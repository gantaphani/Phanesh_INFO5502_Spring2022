this litigation arose from administrative approvals of a project to modify the moss landing power plant,which is located in monterey county.in connection with state energy commission certification proceedings for the project,the regional water board issued a federal water pollution permit.appellant challenged the issuance of that permit.following two judicial hearings punctuated by an administrative remand,the trial court dismissed appellant administrative mandamus petition.this appeal and followed.the complex issues before us include procedural challenges to the trial court jurisdiction and to its interim remand.the parties also dispute the sufficiency of the evidence supporting issuance of the water permit,both before and after remand,and the proper application of the governing statute.for reasons explained in this opinion,we affirm the trial court final judgment denying appellant petition for writ of mandate.
introduction 
the parties this action was initiated by voices of the wetlands,petitioner below and appellant and on appeal.appellant is a nonprofit association of individuals dedicated to preserving elkhorn slough.respondents in the trial court were two state agencies collectively,the water boards the california state water resources control board state board and the california regional water quality control board,central coast region regional board.real party in interest are duke energy moss landing,llc,and duke energy north america,llc collectively,duke.at all times relevant to this litigation,duke owned and operated the moss landing power plant,which is located at the mouth of elkhorn slough.both duke and the water boards are respondents and on appeal collectively,respondents.
the challenged administrative decision appellant challenges a permit issued to duke by the regional board,under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes.the npdes permit allows duke to cool the moss landing power plant using water taken from moss landing harbor and later discharged back into monterey bay.according to appellant,the issuance of the npdes permit here violates federal law,because the water boards did not require duke to use the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental effects,as required by federal law citing several specific grounds,appellant attacks the boards approval of cooling,claiming that it kills unacceptable numbers of aquatic larvae.
judicial proceedings after the state board declined to review the issuance of the npdes permit,appellant brought judicial proceedings in the superior court.respondents demurred,asserting that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter because the controversy arose from certification proceedings conducted by the california state energy resources conservation and development commission energy commission and judicial review of such proceedings may be had only in the california supreme court.after overruling respondents demurrer,the court conducted a hearing,ordered a limited remand to the regional board,and later conducted a second hearing,ultimately denying appellant writ petition.the ensuing judgment culminated in this appeal and.
background 
this litigation arose from duke application to modernize its moss landing power plant.the plant,previously owned by pacific gas and electric,has been in continuous operation since.duke proposed to replace five old units at the moss landing power plant with two new,natural gas fired,combined cycle generating units.
as described in the energy commission october decision,the moss landing power plant is located in a biologically sensitive area,just south of the elkhorn slough national estuarine research reserve,which adjoins the much larger monterey bay national marine sanctuary near moss landing harbor about midway between the cities of santa cruz and monterey.the elkhorn slough is a biological gem and a biologically rich wetland system,providing habitat for hundreds of resident and migratory bird species.the slough is home to a great diversity of rare plants and animals and it also serves as an important nursery and source of nutrients for monterey bay.and elkhorn slough is one of the few relatively large coastal wetlands remaining in california.
as proposed,the two new generating units would use seawater from the harbor for cooling,the same basic technology utilized by the old units.under section b of the federal clean water act,cooling water intake structures must reflect the best technology available bta for minimizing adverse environmental impacts.when a plant draws water in,the environmental effects may include impingement and entrainment.as explained in the energy commission october decision impingement occurs from suction when the cooling water intake system holds organisms against the traveling screens.entrainment is where smaller aquatic organisms such as larvae and fish eggs are drawn through the screens into the plant cooling system.when the cooling water is later discharged at a higher temperature,the water body receiving it may suffer harmful thermal effects.the regional board required duke to address both impingement and entrainment intake effects,as well as the thermal discharge impact.
synopsis of procedural history 
starting in,duke sought administrative approval to modernize the moss landing power plant.duke applied for the necessary certification from the energy commission.duke also applied to the regional board for an npdes permit for the modified facility.the two agencies evaluation processes were integrated.for one thing,as described in the energy commission decision,the commission and the rwqcb regional board formed a technical working group twg made up of representatives from various regulatory agencies,the scientific community,and duke energy.the twg met regularly on a monthly basis beginning in march,holding approximately meetings.the twg worked to design biological resource studies and then validate the results of these studies.
in october,the energy commission approved duke application for certification,subject to various conditions including compliance with the requirements of the npdes permit.in november,the regional board approved duke npdes permit.as relevant here,the regional board required duke to upgrade the existing intake structure for the new units to minimize the impacts due to impingement of larger fish on the traveling screens in addition,the board,california energy commission,and duke energy developed an acquisition and aquatic habitat enhancement program designed to minimize adverse environmental effects of the intake system on the elkhorn slough watershed resources,which would be funded by a million payment from duke appellant took an administrative appeal of the permit approval to the state board,which rejected appellant petition for administrative review in june.
in july,appellant instituted this judicial action,petitioning the monterey county superior court for a writ of administrative mandamus to set aside the water boards issuance of the npdes permit.duke and the water boards demurred to the petition,in part on the ground that the superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.the energy commission filed a memorandum as amicus curiae,supporting respondents arguments.after the court overruled their demurrers,respondents opposed the petition on the merits.
following a hearing in september,the court filed its intended decision.in it,the court rejected one of the regional board npdes permit findings,number,which concerned bta for the cooling system.as the court put it finding number is not supported by the weight of the evidence.the court therefore ordered issuance of a writ of mandate compelling the regional board to conduct a thorough and comprehensive analysis of best technology available applicable to the moss landing power plant.a writ did not issue,however.instead,in march,the court entered an order of remand to the regional board.the court retained jurisdiction while the remand was pending.
in april,appellant filed a writ petition in this court,which challenged the trial court decision to remand the matter to the regional board without first issuing a writ directing the agency to vacate the entire npdes permit.we summarily denied appellant writ petition.
in may,the regional board conducted a further public hearing.after considering additional evidence,the regional board concluded that the challenged finding was supported by the weight of the evidence.appellant appealed administratively to the state board,again without success.
the parties returned to the trial court.in june,the court filed an intended decision upholding the regional board action on remand and denying appellant petition.the following month,the court issued a statement of decision,reaching the same result.
these appellate proceedings followed.
contentions 
in its appeal,appellant argues the administrative remand process was fatally flawed the water boards improperly relied on the availability of an environmental enhancement fund in making the challenged determinations and the regional board erred in making its determination of best technology available,because it failed to apply a discernible standard and it acted with unfettered discretion.
the water boards and duke dispute appellant arguments.they also raise two additional claims by,both of which appellant refutes the trial court erred in overruling their demurrers to appellant petition,because a statute bars judicial review in the superior court in proceedings involving power plant certification and the court erred in remanding the matter to the regional board,because ample evidence supported the original administrative approvals.
statutory framework 
we begin by summarizing the statutory framework that governs the issues before us.because an npdes permit is at issue here,federal and state water law applies.because the project is a power plant,state law governing power plant approvals also comes into play.we briefly describe each pertinent body of law.
federal water quality law the clean water act 
the united states environmental protection agency epa regulates water quality in the nation navigable waters pursuant to several statutes,the most important of which is the clean water act.manaster selmi,cal.environmental law and land use practice water quality regulators,fn.omitted.the clean water act cwa is codified at its official name is the federal water pollution control act fwpca.see,city of burbank state water resources control bd.cal th,d.
congress passed the clean water act in its present form in.rapanos united states,d plur.opn.with that legislation,congress established a comprehensive water quality policy for the nation.city of burbank state water resources control,supra,cal th at,d.
before it was amended in,the federal water pollution control act employed ambient water quality standards specifying the acceptable levels of pollution in a state interstate navigable waters as the primary mechanism in its program for the control of water pollution.environmental protection agency state water resources control board,d,fns.omitted.under that system,it was very difficult to develop and enforce standards to govern the conduct of individual polluters.id.at.in,prompted by the conclusion of the senate committee on public works that the federal water pollution control program has been inadequate in every vital aspect,congress enacted the amendments that make up the current law.id.at,fn.omitted.
the federal legislation introduced two major changes in the methods to set and enforce standards to abate and control water pollution.first,the amendments are aimed at achieving maximum effluent limitations on point sources,as well as achieving acceptable water quality standards.a point source is any discernible,confined and discrete conveyance from which pollutants are or may be discharged.an effluent limitation in turn is any restriction established by a state or the administrator on quantities,rates,and concentrations of chemical,physical,biological,and other constituents which are discharged from point sources including schedules of compliance.environmental protection agency state water resources control board,supra,at,fns.omitted,citing.second,the amendments establish the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes as a means of achieving and enforcing the effluent limitations.under the npdes,it is unlawful for any person to discharge a pollutant without obtaining a permit and complying with its terms.an npdes permit serves to transform generally applicable effluent limitations and other standards including those based on water quality into the obligations including a timetable for compliance of the individual discharger,and the amendments provide for direct administrative and judicial enforcement of permits.id.at,fns.omitted,citing.
the goal of the act is to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.a see rapanos united states,supra,d.
congress entrusted the epa with primary authority for implementing the clean water act.see generally manaster selmi,cal.environmental law,supra.the epa statutory authority includes responsibility for issuing npdes permits.a.
congress also provided that a state may issue npdes permits for discharges into navigable waters within its jurisdiction,but only upon epa approval of the state proposal to administer its own program.environmental protection agency state water resources control board,supra,at.b.under the federal clean water act,each state is free to enforce its own water quality laws so long as its effluent limitations are not less stringent than those set out in the clean water act.city of burbank state water resources control,supra,cal th at,d.in such cases,the epa suspends its issuance of npdes permits in favor of the state approved program.b environmental protection agency state water resources control board,supra,at,fn.but the epa retains authority to review operation of a state permit program.id.at.see also,national association of home builders defenders of wildlife,d,fn.
ii.state water law the act 
in california,the controlling law is the water quality control act act,which was enacted in.city of burbank state water resources control,supra,cal th at,d.the act preceded the federal clean water act by three years.id.at,d.the state statute is codified in the water code,division,at sections.
the goal of the act is to attain the highest water quality which is reasonable,considering all demands being made and to be made on those waters and the total values involved,beneficial and detrimental,economic and social,tangible and intangible.city of burbank state water resources control,supra,cal th at,d,quoting.the task of accomplishing this belongs to the state water resources control board state board and the nine regional water quality control boards together the state water board and the regional water boards comprise the principal state agencies with primary responsibility for the coordination and control of water quality,quoting.
in,the california legislature amended the act to ensure consistency with the requirements for state programs implementing the federal water pollution control act.city of burbank state water resources control,supra,cal th at,d.on may,the acting epa administrator approved the state of california request to administer its own npdes permit program and,effective that date,suspended epa issuance of all permits for all discharges in the state of california,other than those from agencies and instrumentalities of the federal government.environmental protection agency state water resources control board,supra,at.california was the first state in the nation to be authorized to issue national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permits,which regulate the discharge of pollutants to surface waters.manaster selmi,cal.environmental law,supra,fn.omitted.
the state water agencies thus perform a dual role of implementing state law relating to water quality and carrying out a delegated administrative responsibility over the more precise and system of federal law.waterkeepers northern california state water resources control bd.th,d.
in california,wastewater discharge requirements established by the regional water boards are the equivalent of the npdes permits required by federal law.city of burbank state water resources control,supra,cal th at,d.but water code section requires equivalency only for purposes of state compliance with the minimum requirements of the federal mandate.the federal law does not preclude the state from utilizing its broader authority to regulate other sources of pollution by means of its waste discharge permit system.preservation council state water resources control bd.d.
in issuing federal npdes permits under the clean water act,the state board is designated as the state water pollution control agency for all purposes stated in the federal water pollution control act,the clean water act.california implements its delegated permitting authority through its regional water boards.see,see also,see generally,manaster selmi,cal.environmental law,supra.the regional water boards are also responsible for implementing state water law.the actual administration of the act rests on the power of the regional boards to prescribe waste discharge requirements for all persons discharging waste into inland surface waters,enclosed bays and estuaries within their jurisdiction.waterkeepers northern california state water resources control,supra,th at,d.california statewide program of water quality control provides for regional administration within the framework of statewide coordination and policy.hampson superior court d.

iii.state law governing power plant approvals the act 
the california statutory scheme governing power plants is entitled the state energy resources conservation and development act.pub.resources code.the provisions of the act are contained in division of the public resources code,at sections et.
the act governs the siting of thermal powerplants as statutorily defined.the act includes the following relevant definitions site means any location on which a facility is constructed or is proposed to be constructed.facility means any electric transmission line or thermal powerplant,or both electric transmission line and thermal powerplant,regulated according to the provisions of this division.thermal powerplant means any stationary or floating electrical generating facility using any source of thermal energy,with a generating capacity of megawatts or more,and any facilities appurtenant thereto.modification of an existing facility means any alteration,replacement,or improvement of equipment that results in a or more increase in the electric generating capacity of an existing thermal powerplant or an increase of percent in the peak operating voltage or peak kilowatt capacity of an existing electric transmission line.
pursuant to the act,the california energy commission has the exclusive power to certify all sites and related facilities in the state,whether a new site and related facility or a change or addition to an existing facility.the issuance of a certificate by the commission shall be in lieu of any permit,certificate,or similar document required by any state,local or regional agency,or federal agency to the extent permitted by federal law,for such use of the site.
under this statutory scheme,the energy commission is the one stop shopping center for power plant licenses in california.it exercises the state ultimate authority in reviewing and mitigating the environmental impacts of these plants.manaster selmi,cal.environmental law,supra,power plant siting.as defined in the act,the commission jurisdiction over power plant siting is all encompassing.id.at.
the act provides that no construction of any facility or modification of any existing facility shall be commenced without first obtaining certification for any such site and related facility by the commission,as prescribed in this division.pub,referring to division.
nominally,the first step in the administrative certification process is a notice of intention to file an application for the certification of the site and related facility or facilities.the purpose of the notice of intent is to determine whether the proposed site or sites are suitable to accommodate the proposed facility,and whether the proposals comply with energy commission standards and demand forecasts,id.at.by statute,however,certain applicants are exempt from filing a notice of intention noi.see pub.the noi process has not been used for over years at present,all projects actually being proposed in california are exempt from the noi process.manaster selmi,cal.environmental law,supra,fn.omitted.
regardless of whether a notice of intention is required,every applicant wishing to construct or modify a thermal power plant must file an application for certification afc with the energy commission,subd.a,manaster selmi,cal.environmental law,supra,a,b,to.once the afc is filed,it must be determined by the commission to be data adequate,complete,based on informational requirements in the commission regulations.manaster selmi,cal.environmental law,supra,c,to pub,subd.b,tit.after acceptance of the afc as data adequate,the commission staff then issues a preliminary staff assessment psa of the project,and the parties may file comments on the psa.manaster selmi,cal.environmental law,supra,a,fn.omitted.after staff workshops and the opportunity for public comment,the staff prepares a final staff assessment fsa.of,tit.by gubernatorial executive order issued in february,effective through december,the fsa operates as the equivalent of an environmental impact report under the california environmental quality act ceqa.city of morgan hill bay area air quality management dist.th,d see also pub,subd.a exemption from ceqa for certified regulatory programs.the order was intended to expedite the processing of applications for power plants by ensuring that the necessary environmental review of such proposals would be completed more quickly.city of morgan hill bay area air quality management,at,d.
in addition to assessment by its own staff,the energy commission is required to transmit a copy of the application for certification afc to various interested agencies and to elicit their comments.the statute specifically includes local governmental agencies having land use and related jurisdiction in the area of the proposed site and related facility,subd.f.it also includes each federal and state agency having jurisdiction or special interest in matters pertinent to the proposed site and related facilities and to the attorney general,subd.g.
once the staff assessment process is complete,an energy commission siting committee holds a series of public hearings.of,tit.the committee then issues a proposed decision,called a presiding member proposed decision,which is distributed for public review and comment.after revisions,if any,and consequent further public comment,if warranted,the proposed decision is submitted to the full commission,which either approves the afc with conditions or denies it,see generally manaster selmi,cal.environmental law,supra,to.
the energy commission may not certify a proposed facility that does not conform with applicable federal,state,regional,or local laws,unless the commission makes special findings related to public convenience and necessity.
judicial review 
the legislature has placed explicit limitations on judicial review of certification decisions of the energy commission,as set forth in public resources code section.the first limitation relates to the judicial forum,which is now the california supreme court alone.the act thus provides the decisions of the commission on any application for certification of a site and related facility are subject to judicial review by the supreme court of california,subd.a.previously,appellate courts could also review such decisions,but the supreme court has been the exclusive forum for judicial review since may,eff.may.in that regard,the statute now mirrors an even earlier predecessor provision,which entrusted exclusive jurisdiction of energy commission power plant siting decisions to the supreme court.county of sonoma state energy resources conservation.com.cal d,the operative effect of section is to give this court exclusive jurisdiction over energy commission decisions that comprise a necessary ingredient of the certificate issued by the puc.
the legislature intent in limiting judicial review in this fashion was to expedite the final operative effect of energy commission decisions.county of sonoma state energy resources conservation,supra,cal d at.in doing so,the legislature sought to expedite the state ultimate authorization of electric generating plants id.at.
in addition to limiting the forum for review,public resources code section expansively defines the subject matter within the supreme court exclusive jurisdiction.it thus provides subject to the right of judicial review of the decisions of the commission by the supreme court,no court in this state has jurisdiction to hear or determine any case or controversy concerning any matter which was,or could have been,determined in a proceeding before the commission,or to stop or delay the construction or operation of any thermal powerplant except to enforce compliance with the provisions of a decision of the commission,subd.c.
with that statutory backdrop in mind,we turn to the parties specific contentions,addressing them in the chronological order in which they arose below,and discussing the factual record as necessary.we begin with the question of the superior court jurisdiction,raised below by respondents demurrers to the petition and presented here by their.
jurisdiction 
the first issue before us is whether the superior court had subject matter jurisdiction to entertain appellant petition for administrative mandamus.that question turns on which statute governs judicial review in this case,or.
a.the statutes 
as explained above,under the authority of the act,the state regional water boards implement the federal clean water act,including its npdes permit system.city of burbank state water resources control,supra,cal th at,d.
under the act judicial review provisions,jurisdiction is in the superior court,subd.b.thus provides any party aggrieved by a final decision or order of a regional board for which the state board denies review may obtain review of the decision or order of the regional board in the superior court by filing in the court a petition for writ of mandate not later than days from the date on which the state board denies review.ibid.
the act governs the approval of thermal power plants,a function entrusted exclusively to the energy commission.
in terms of judicial review,challenges to energy commission siting decisions may be heard in only one judicial forum,the california supreme court,subd.a.no other state court has jurisdiction to hear or determine any case or controversy concerning any matter which was,or could have been,determined in a proceeding before the commission,or to stop or delay the construction or operation of any thermal powerplant except to enforce compliance with the provisions of a decision of the commission,subd.c.
contentions 
appellant defends the trial court decision to apply the judicial review provisions of the act to this dispute.it argues the decision at issue in this litigation is not an energy commission decision under the act.it is a challenge to a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit issued by the regional water board,and subsequently upheld by the state board,pursuant to the state federally delegated clean water act program.according to appellant,only the water boards are empowered to implement the delegated npdes program in california.appellant finds no statutory authority in the act or elsewhere to displace the water boards exclusive jurisdiction for this program.additionally,appellant cites adverse policy implications that would arise from a contrary construction.
respondents disagree.as they see it,when npdes permits are issued in connection with power plant approvals,the act coordinates administrative environmental review through the energy commission.by logical extension,judicial review is available only pursuant to the act.in respondents view,the disputed issue of best technology available was a matter which was,or could have been,determined in the energy commission proceeding under the statute,subd.c.for that reason,respondents assert,the superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.
as all parties recognize,the issue is one of statutory interpretation.we therefore begin our analysis by summarizing the pertinent canons of statutory construction.
statutory construction general principles 
when charged with interpreting legislative acts,our task is to determine afresh the intent of the legislature by construing in context the language of the statute.in determining such intent,we begin with the language of the statute itself.smith law group cal th,d,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in giving due consideration to statutory context,we examine the legislative purpose in enacting the provision.id.at,d,citations omitted.furthermore,as our high court has repeatedly emphasized,every statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part,so that all may be harmonized and have effect.moore panish cal d.where as here two codes are to be construed,they must be regarded as blending into each other and forming a single statute.citation.accordingly,they must be read together and so construed as to give effect,when possible,to all the provisions thereof.tripp swoap cal d,overruled on another ground in frink prod cal d.
with those principles in mind,we independently review the question of statutory construction presented here.see,yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.in order to resolve the parties dispute about which body of state statutory law governs judicial review of the issuance of the npdes or must consider the agencies respective responsibilities concerning the challenged administrative determination.we begin with the energy commission role.
the energy commission role with respect to the challenged determination 
the relationship between the energy commission and the regional water board is part of a bigger picture,which entails the energy commission interaction with various governmental agencies that share overlapping interests in the construction or modification of power plants.as has been said one who would construct and operate a california power plant must first obtain an interconnected set of federal,state and regional agency approvals.city of morgan hill bay area air quality management,supra,th at,d,pacific lumber state water resources control bd.cal th,d,timber harvest permit approvals are subject to a regulatory scheme that encourages interagency teamwork but does not strip state agencies of their respective authority to protect resources.
interaction with other agencies generally 
as the act recognizes,other governmental agencies may share an interest in the energy commission power plant siting decision.for that reason,the act requires the energy commission to inform those agencies of the application for certification.as to local governments,the act thus provides upon receipt of an application,the commission shall forward the application to local governmental agencies having land use and related jurisdiction in the area of the proposed site and related facility,subd.f.as to other entities,the act requires the energy commission to transmit a copy of the application to each federal and state agency having jurisdiction or special interest in matters pertinent to the proposed site and related facilities and to the attorney general,subd.g.by regulation,the energy commission also must send the afc to the california department of fish and game,to the air p ollution control district in which the project is located,and to the water resources control board in which the project is located,tit,subd.c.the act further provides for the timely submission of feedback local and state agencies having jurisdiction or special interest in matters pertinent to the proposed site and related facilities shall provide their comments and recommendations on the project within days of the date of filing of an application,subd.h see also,tit.the act also requires the energy commission to notify interested federal agencies of its determinations upon approval of an application,the commission shall forward to the united states nuclear regulatory commission,the environmental protection agency,and to other appropriate federal agencies,the results of its studies including the environmental impact report on the facility,the written decision on the facility contained in the application,and the commission determination of facility safety and reliability as provided in section.
interaction with air pollution control districts 
because there are close parallels between water and air quality regulation,the energy commission relationship with air pollution control districts is of particular relevance to our analysis.before describing that relationship,we begin with some statutory background on air quality regulation.
as with the control of water pollution within california,our state air pollution regulatory program is based on provisions of both federal and california law.manaster selmi,cal.environmental law,supra.the applicable federal law is the clean air act.et as amended in,title v of the federal clean air act operates much like the federal clean water act,in that it requires new,modified,and existing major and affected sources to obtain air pollution operating permits meeting uniform federal requirements.manaster selmi,cal.environmental law,supra.that amendment reflects a determination by congress to emulate the npdes program in the clean air act amendments.ibid.congress intended that the clean air act permit program be primarily administered and enforced by state and local government permitting authorities.id.at,citing,b.
in california,the clean air act is implemented by local air pollution control districts,which issue permits for the prevention of significant deterioration,called psd permits.city of morgan hill bay area air quality management,supra,th at,d.the state statute thus provides every district board may establish,by regulation,a permit system that requires that before any person builds,erects,alters,replaces,operates,or uses any article,machine,equipment,or other contrivance which may cause the issuance of air contaminants,the person obtain a permit to do so from the air pollution control officer of the district.health,subd.a.the environmental protection agency epa has approved california clean air program and delegated permitting authority to the state the district therefore has authority to issue psd permits pursuant to the federal clean air act.city of morgan hill bay area air quality management,at,d.the resulting authorizations are federal permits.ibid.
like other state statutory schemes aimed at environmental protection,california clean air with its accompanying cooperation between the local air pollution control district and the state energy commission.the energy commission and the air quality management district work together in their approval process.the commission must obtain a determination of compliance from the district as part of its own air quality assessment during the certification process.the district officer reports this determination to the commission,tit,subd.b see dist,rule.a representative of the district appears at commission hearings to present and explain that determination.see,tit,subd.c.city of morgan hill bay area air quality management,supra,th at,d.
interagency coordination here 
in this case,as the energy commission explained in its final commission decision during the siting process,commission staff,as well as duke energy carried out extensive coordination with numerous local,state,and federal agencies.these included the central coast regional water quality control board rwqcb,the coastal commission,the california independent system operator cal iso,monterey bay national marine sanctuary,united states fish and wildlife service,california department of fish and game,army corps of engineers,monterey bay unified air pollution control district mbuapcd,pacific gas and electric pg e,monterey county,north county fire protection district,and caltrans,as well as intervenor california unions for reliable energy cure,and interested local environmental groups and individual citizens in the community.
the regional board role with respect to the challenged determination 
as explained above,the state board is designated as the state water pollution control agency for all purposes stated in the federal water pollution control act,the clean water act.california implements its delegated federal permitting authority through its regional water boards.see,see also,see generally,manaster selmi,cal.environmental law,supra.
in keeping with those statutory directives,the regional water board was the agency that actually issued the challenged npdes permit here.
harmonizing the two agencies roles 
when it comes to power plant siting,the energy commission possesses ultimate authority within the state.city of morgan hill bay area air quality management,supra,th at,d.subject only to its mandated cooperation with other agencies and compliance with applicable law,the energy commission jurisdiction over power plant siting within california is all encompassing.manaster selmi,cal.environmental law,supra,power plant siting.
when an energy commission certificate is issued,it will supersede any conflicting local,regional or state statute,ordinance,or regulation.that being so,the energy commission certificate constitutes the only state,local or regional approval necessary to construct and operate a power plant.city of morgan hill bay area air quality management district,th at,d.all other such approvals thus are effectively subsumed within the energy commission certificate.pub,energy commission certificate shall be in lieu of any such approval required by any state,local or regional agency.
the same can not be said,however,when a necessary federal permit is at stake.one pertinent example is a psd permit,issued by local air pollution control districts under the federal clean air act for the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality.city of morgan hill bay area air quality management,supra,th at,d,citing and.a psd permit is a federal approval.city of morgan hill,at,d.as a federal approval,the psd permit is not necessarily subsumed within the energy commission certification in the way that state,local,and regional approvals are.pub,energy commission certificate shall be in lieu of any federal requirement but only to the extent permitted by federal law.
by parity of reasoning,the same analysis applies to federal npdes permits,such as the one issued by the regional board in this case.as the energy commission itself observed in its final decision here while the commission reviews the overall power plant project,the regional board regulates the project intake and discharge systems via the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit issued pursuant to the federal clean water act citation.a similar observation was made at the regional board september meeting by its counsel.explaining the interaction between the energy commission and the regional board,counsel said this board is the only agency that is authorized to issue npdes permits in this region,under federal law.so the energy commission certification must be consistent with the npdes permit.it can have different things that are more stringent or different,as long as they do conflict.in response to a board member question,counsel explained further that the energy commission proposed decision did not act as a precedent or constraint on the regional board decision.and in its staff report for the september meeting,regional board staff expressed a similar view when addressing a request by the coastal commission that the energy commission preempt the npdes permit in the stated view of the regional board staff,the requested preemption is not legal because only the state and regional boards have authority to implement the npdes program in california.
in short,while the energy commission enjoys ultimate authority for power plant siting within california,the regional board is responsible for issuing any required federal npdes permit,national wildlife federation consumers power,reversed in part on another point in national wildlife federation consumers power,although power plant construction and operation are subject to the control of the federal energy regulatory commission,that agency regulatory powers over projects do not preempt any concurrent regulation under the cwa.although the two agencies approvals are interconnected,the federal permit issued by the regional board is not automatically subsumed within the energy commission certification.
implications for judicial review 
under the act,judicial review of the energy commission powerplant certification may be had only by direct writ review in the california supreme court,subd.a city of morgan hill bay area air quality management,supra,th at,fn,d.no other state court may hear or decide any matter which was,or could have been,determined in a proceeding before the commission,subd.c.under the act,by contrast,approval of the federal npdes permit is subject to challenge by administrative mandamus in superior court,subd.b psd permit.
as we now explain,the judicial review provisions of the act govern this controversy.we reach that conclusion after analyzing the subject matter of the determination,addressing the forum choices,and considering legislative intent.
subject matter 
as just explained,the npdes permit issued here constitutes a separate federal approval needed for this project.as the energy commission itself acknowledged,the regional board is the agency that regulates the project intake and discharge systems by means of the npdes permit.
we recognize that the energy commission in fact incorporated the requirements imposed on duke by the regional board.the energy commission thus imposed the following as a condition of certification the project owner shall submit the final,approved national pollutant discharge elimination system permit from the central coast regional water quality control board governing the discharge of the project once through cooling water to the energy commission.the project owner shall comply with all provisions of the national pollutant discharge elimination system permit.
but we are not persuaded that incorporation of the permit requirements somehow converts them into a matter which was,or could have been,determined by the energy commission,subd.c.as noted above,the commission must follow the laws governing other affected agencies it may not certify a facility when it finds that the facility does not conform with any applicable state,local,or regional standards.and it may not make a finding in conflict with applicable federal law or regulation.ibid.consistent with that legal constraint,the energy commission made the following general finding in this case the conditions of certification contained in the accompanying text,if implemented by the applicant,ensure that the project will be designed,sited,and operated in conformity with applicable local,regional,state,and federal laws,ordinances,regulations,and standards,including applicable public health and safety standards,and air and water quality standards.among the laws it identified as applicable was the federal clean water act.
in this context,we conclude,the npdes permit requirements do not represent a matter which was,or could have been,determined by the commission,subd.c.to the contrary,the matter was determined by the regional board and that determination was adopted by the energy commission in the course of discharging its own legal obligation.
forum choice 
and each provide for a different judicial forum,depending on whether the challenged decision is a power plant certification.
as our high court instructs,we must read these provisions together,giving effect to both provisions if we can.tripp swoap,supra,cal d at.honoring that instruction,we conclude that both avenues for judicial review are open to an aggrieved party in a proper case.
the petitioner thus may seek writ review of a power plant certification in the california supreme court,while challenging an npdes permit in superior court at the same or another time.supreme court review of energy commission certification id.at,d superior court review of psd permit.review of a challenged decision thus may be had by filing a petition for a writ of mandate in the superior court,unless the decision is one on an application for certification of a thermal power plant,in which case the petition must be filed in the supreme court.santa teresa citizen action group state energy resources conservation development com.th,d.
as explained above,the administrative decision challenged in this case is not the power plant certification itself rather it is the separate npdes permit.appellant challenge to that permit thus was properly heard in the superior court.
legislative intent 
by accepting the legislature decision to grant access to the superior court for a challenge under,we do no violence to the limitation on judicial forum enacted as part of.as noted above,the legislative intent behind that limitation was to hasten the final operative effect of energy commission decisions.county of sonoma state energy resources conservation,supra,cal d at.in doing so,the legislature sought to expedite the state ultimate authorization of electric generating plants id.at.
this is not a case in which the superior court acted to stop or delay the construction or operation of any thermal powerplant,however,subd.c.in its october intended decision,the court stated nothing in this decision compels an interruption in the ongoing plant operation during the regional b oard review of this matter on remand.
conclusion 
for all of the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the judicial review provisions of the act govern this controversy,and that the superior court thus had jurisdiction to hear and determine the parties dispute concerning the npdes permit.
having concluded that the trial court had jurisdiction to hear this controversy,we next consider the propriety of its decision to remand the matter to the regional board.
ii.remand order 
as noted above,the court rejected one of the regional board npdes permit findings,number,which addressed best technology available bta for the cooling system.as the court stated in its october intended decision finding number is not supported by the weight of the evidence.the court therefore ordered issuance of a writ of mandate compelling the regional board to conduct a thorough and comprehensive analysis of best technology available applicable to the moss landing power plant.duke and the water boards objected to the intended decision,but the court adopted it as its statement of decision.the court directed appellant to prepare an appropriate judgment,present it to opposing counsel for review,and submit it to this court for signature.but the parties could not agree on the form of judgment and the writ never issued.instead,in march,the court entered an order remanding the matter to the regional board for a hearing on the bta issue the court retained jurisdiction while the remand was pending.
the trial court decision to remand the matter to the regional board is challenged by both sides.in the appeal,appellant contends that the remand procedure violates the statute governing administrative mandamus and thus was fatally flawed.in the,respondents argue that the court should not have remanded the matter,because ample evidence supported the original administrative approvals.
we consider each side challenge to the remand in turn,ultimately rejecting both.addressing appellant challenge first,we conclude that the remand was procedurally proper,both as a matter of statutory authority and as an exercise of the trial court inherent powers.reaching respondents contention next,we find substantial evidence to support the trial court evidentiary determination.
procedural propriety of the remand order 
according to appellant,remand was foreclosed by code of civil procedure section,which governs administrative mandamus actions.as appellant reads that statute,only two remedies were available to the trial court issuance of a writ commanding the regional board to set aside its entire order,or a judgment denying the petition for writ of mandamus.see code civ,subd.f.
respondents disagree.the water boards contend there is nothing in code of civil procedure section f prohibiting the action of the trial court to order the remand,then issue the judgment denying the writ at a later time.they observe in this case a judgment was ultimately issued denying the writ,as required by the section.for its part,instead of focusing on the statute,duke argues that the court had inherent authority to remand to the regional board.
moreover,duke asserts,appellant claims have been rendered moot by the subsequent proceedings.appellant disputes duke assertion of mootness.we consider that issue at the threshold.
as duke aptly observes a question may be deemed moot when,although it initially presented an existing controversy,the passage of time or the acts of the parties or a court decision have deprived the controversy of its life.boccato city of hermosa beach d.
here,however,we conclude that the parties dispute over the procedural propriety of interlocutory remand retains vitality.appellant claims on this point relate to the manner in which the subsequent proceedings were conducted.specifically,appellant contends,a writ should have issued setting aside the entire npdes permit.instead,more limited proceedings were appellant continuing objections.thus,this is not a case where the appellant own conduct rendered its challenge moot,mhc operating limited partnership city of san jose th,d city appeal was moot where it complied with writ of mandate.nor is this a case in which actions by another party to the litigation deprived the controversy of life,boccato city of hermosa beach,supra,d at.plaintiff challenge to parking permit fees was moot because defendant refunded the fees.finally,we can not agree that appellant unsatisfied demand for a different and fuller administrative process is rendered moot simply because the challenged proceedings were undertaken and completed,terry civil service commission d,mandamus proceedings to enforce petitioners right to take civil service examination were not rendered moot by their failure to pass it.for that reason,we conclude,appellant claims of procedural error are not moot.
in any event,even if appellant claims were technically moot,we have inherent power to decide them,since the issues presented are important and of continuing interest.burch george cal th,fn,d,morehart county of santa barbara cal th,d,city of morgan hill brown th,fn,d.we therefore consider the substance of appellant contentions.
authority to remand under code of civil procedure section 
on the merits,our analysis of the question of the remand procedural propriety begins with the governing statute.our standard of review is de novo.usher county of monterey th,d.
a.the statute 
the pertinent statutory provision is code of civil procedure section,which governs administrative mandamus actions in superior court.of particular relevance here is subdivision f,which reads in pertinent part the court shall enter judgment either commanding respondent to set aside the order or decision,or denying the writ.where the judgment commands that the order or decision be set aside,it may order the reconsideration of the case in the light of the court opinion and judgment code civ,subd.f.
according to appellant,the remand order issued here is an impermissible interlocutory judgment,which is not authorized by the statute.
in support of its argument,appellant relies on resource defense fund local agency formation com.d.in that case,the plaintiffs challenged a city annexation action,petitioning for a writ of administrative mandamus.id.at.the trial court found the city environmental findings inadequate under the california environmental quality act ceqa.id.at.it entered an interlocutory judgment of remand,to allow the city to make the necessary findings the order provided for judgment to be entered after action by the city council or the expiration of days.ibid.on appeal,the first district court of appeal concluded that the interlocutory remand was improper.ibid.the appellate court cited two grounds.first,it explained we can not agree that an interlocutory judgment is authorized by code of civil procedure section.that statute authorizes remand when the writ is granted where the judgment commands that the order or decision be set aside,it may order the reconsideration of the case in the light of the court opinion and judgment and may order respondent to take such further action as is specially enjoined upon it by law code civ,subd.f.in proper context,the questioned remand is not a prejudgment procedure,italics omitted.moreover,the court continued,we think the use of an interlocutory remand raises serious questions of due process it effectively precluded any possible challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the new findings.id.at.in the court words the misguided attempt to salvage the defective proceedings provided no opportunity to test the adequacy of the new findings or otherwise challenge the existence of supporting evidence and compliance with the ceqa.ibid.in this respect alone,we find the interlocutory judgment grievously erroneous.ibid.
thereafter,the same court revisited resource defense fund,in sierra club contra costa county th,d.the court described both the statutory and due process components of its earlier decision,framing two similar arguments in its current case.id.at,d.first addressing the statutory basis of its earlier decision,the court noted its conclusion in resource defense fund that code of civil procedure section does not permit remand before the writ issues,but instead specifies that the writ shall issue and the reviewing court may then remand.sierra club,at,d.a different statute was at issue in sierra club,a ceqa provision that directs a court which finds a public agency has failed to act in compliance with ceqa to issue a writ of mandate.id.at,d,fn.omitted,citing pub.a different trial court procedure also was employed in sierra club the trial court did not proceed by way of interlocutory judgment and remand,but instead issued a tentative decision directing adoption of additional findings.id.at,d.the court in sierra club implicitly concluded that the trial court failure to issue a writ before remanding to the agency did not comport with the express requirements of the governing ceqa provision.id.at,d.the court next focused on the due process element of the resource defense fund case,observing the vice of prejudgment remand,as resource defense fund points out,is that it raises serious questions of due process,quoting resource defense fund local agency formation,supra,d at.the procedure at issue in sierra club produced the same due process flaws identified in resource defense fund.as the sierra club court explained the result of that procedure has been effectively to insulate those findings from any meaningful challenge.sierra club,at,d.the court therefore concluded that the trial court erred by not issuing the writ of mandate and remanding the eir to the board.id.at,d.
as respondents point out,however,other authorities have endorsed the general use of administrative remand in a proper case.
in one category of cases,remand is permitted to correct procedural defects at the administrative level.such a defect exists,for example,where there has been no fair hearing.in the words of our state high court,it is established that the proper procedure upon the failure of an administrative board to give a hearing under appropriate circumstances,is to remand the case to the board for proper proceedings.steen city of los angeles cal d,see also,english city of long beach cal d,clark city of hermosa beach th,d.a second example of using remand to correct a procedural defect is when the evidentiary record of the administrative hearing is inadequate.see aluisi county of fresno d,but see id.at,writ issued.moreover,the supreme court has held that the trial court has the power to remand a matter to an administrative agency for clarification of ambiguous findings.rapid transit advocates,southern cal.rapid transit dist.d,citing no oil,city of los angeles cal d,and keeler superior court cal d,national association of home builders defenders of wildlife,supra.at proper course would have been to remand to the agency for clarification of its reasons.and when there are errors in the admission of evidence before an administrative agency,it is proper to remand to the agency for reconsideration.newman state personnel board th,d.remand for reconsideration is also appropriate where the original hearing before the agency was conducted by an unauthorized hearing officer.see also,usher county of monterey,supra,th at,d.but where the administrative agency errs not in the conduct of the hearing but in the results reached,there is no basis for reconsideration.newman state personnel,at,d.
remand is allowed in a second category of cases,where relevant new evidence is to be considered.code civ,subd.e.in such cases,the statute specifically authorizes remand proceedings.rapid transit advocates,southern cal.rapid transit,supra,d at.code of civil procedure section,subdivision e,permits consideration of relevant evidence that either was improperly excluded by the administrative agency or could not with reasonable diligence be produced before it.helene curtis,los angeles county assessment appeals bds.th,d ashford culver city unified school dist.th,d.subdivision e opens a narrow,discretionary window for additional evidence,newly discovered after the hearing or improperly excluded at it.routine allowance thereunder of conflicting scientific opinions created after the decision would pose for decisions a threat of repeated rounds of litigation,and uncertain,attenuated finality fort mojave indian tribe department of health services th,d.remand under code of civil procedure section,subdivision e for consideration of postdecision evidence generally has been limited to truly new evidence,of emergent facts.see generally.ed.administrative law.
the cases thus recognize the propriety of remand where procedural defects have prevented a fair administrative hearing or where relevant new evidence has emerged.as our high court long ago observed in the context of administrative mandamus actions,where determinative powers are vested in a local administrative agency and the court finds its decision lacks evidentiary basis,a hearing was denied or it was otherwise erroneous,it is proper procedure to remand the matter to the agency for further and proper proceedings rather than for the court to decide the matter on the merits.fascination,hoover cal d.if a hearing has been denied or the evidence is insufficient to sustain the action of the board,and it is still possible for the board to hold a hearing or exercise its discretion,then the matter should be remanded to the board for further consideration rather than having a trial de novo in the superior court and requiring that court to exercise independent judgment on the facts which should be determined by the board.la prade department of water power cal d.
the question before us is whether the statute categorically forbids a limited interlocutory remand to the agency without issuance of a writ,as appellant contends.we conclude that it does not.based on the language of code of civil procedure section,subdivision f,and considering the foregoing authority,particularly the cases from the california supreme court,we reject appellant interpretation of the statute.we acknowledge that there is an apparent split of authority on the question.as one commentator notes,it is unclear whether the remand procedure may be used without entry of judgment or issuance of a writ.cal.administrative mandamus trial and judgment,citation omitted see also,id.
as we now explain,we conclude that the statute permits such a procedure in a proper case.we reach that conclusion after examining the statute use of the word judgment,the necessity for a writ,and the validity of a limited remand.as relevant to our analysis here,the statutory language reads the court shall enter judgment either commanding respondent to set aside the order or decision,or denying the writ.code civ,subd.f.
judgment the statute requires the court to enter judgment code civ,subd.f.generally speaking,judgment means the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding.code civ,griset fair political practices com.cal th,d.likewise,by general statutory definition,a judgment in a special proceeding is the final determination of the rights of the parties therein.code civ.as our state high court long ago recognized there can be but one final judgment in an action,and that is the one which in effect ends the suit in the court in which it was instituted and finally determines the rights of the parties in relation to the matter in controversy.stockton.works ins.cal.but the label of the judgment as interlocutory is not determinative upon this question,since it is the substance and effect of a judgment that determines its finality.in re county pioneer society cal d.a judgment is not final where the court expressly reserve s for future decision questions regarding the rights,duties,and liabilities of the parties.id.at.this is equally true in the context of special proceedings such as mandamus.thus,for example,there is no final judgment where the trial court denial of the alternative writ in administrative mandamus neither terminated the proceeding below nor finally determined the rights of the parties in the proceeding.gibson savings loan commissioner d.accord,fire fighters union city of azusa d.
here,the statute plainly contemplates entry of a final judgment at the conclusion of the mandate proceeding.but we find nothing in the language of code of civil procedure,section,subdivision f,that forecloses the use of an interlocutory order,either expressly or by necessary implication.see ng state personnel bd.d.court remand was an interlocutory order,not a final,appealable judgment county of inyo city of los angeles d.appellate court earlier decision in mandamus proceeding was an interim one which did not terminate the lawsuit endangered habitats league,state water resources control bd.th,d same see also,rapid transit advocates,southern cal.rapid transit,supra,d at.trial court acted properly in continuing mandamus trial and remanding to agency for clarification of findings.
we therefore conclude that the statute does not expressly require entry of a final judgment as a necessary predicate to remand,where further action both by the agency and by the court is contemplated.
writ next,we consider the related question of whether the statute demands issuance of a peremptory writ prior to remand.appellant argues that a writ is required at this juncture,citing the statutory language commanding the court to enter judgment either denying the writ or ordering the agency to set aside the order or decision code civ,subd.f.we can not agree that the statutory language demands issuance of a writ as the sole means to compel agency action while the mandamus proceeding remains pending in court.
we begin by observing that code of civil procedure section,subdivision f,does not explicitly mention the issuance of a writ it calls for entry of a judgment.a writ is not a judgment.endangered habitats league,state water resources control,supra,th at,d.by statutory definition,a writ is a species of order.every direction of a court or judge,made or entered in writing,and not included in a judgment,is denominated an order.code civ.the word writ signifies an order or precept in writing,issued in the name of the people,or of a court or judicial officer code civ,subd,palma industrial fasteners,cal d,form by which peremptory writ issued from the court of appeal combined elements of both an order and a writ.a writ of mandate is a piece of paper.if its purpose is to declare the rights of parties,its existence suffices if its purpose is to compel someone to do something,its existence does not suffice.endangered habitats league,state water resources control,supra,th at,d compliance is secured via return.
certainly,the usual practice in mandamus proceedings is for the court to issue a writ to explain its decision and to order the agency to comply with it.cal.administrative mandamus,supra,procedures after trial.under that familiar procedure,the proper way to ensure compliance is to require a return on the writ,which commands a party to do something and report to the court that the act has been done.endangered habitats league,state water resources control,supra,th at,d.
notwithstanding that accepted general practice,we can not agree with appellant that issuance of a writ is the only authorized procedure for accomplishing the goal of agency compliance with judicial orders.here,the trial court instead chose to issue an order for remand,to reserve jurisdiction,and to require the agency to inform it upon the completion of remand proceedings.we find nothing in the statute that forbids use of the alternate procedure chosen by the court,while the mandate proceeding is still pending and before entry of final judgment.while the peremptory writ offers one familiar,way for the court to secure the agency compliance,the statute does not demand its exclusive use for this purpose.to hold otherwise would exalt form over substance,giannini controls superior court d.directing trial court to permit petitioners to file a supplemental petition in mandamus so that they would not be compelled to relitigate the same question under a different case number.
limited remand finally,we consider the statute mandate that the court either set aside the order or decision or deny the writ.code civ,subd.f.appellant apparently reads that language as a requirement that the court set aside the entire decision of the regional board before remanding to that agency.appellant thus argues that the only permissible judicial remedy was a writ of mandate ordering respondents to set aside the npdes permit.we disagree.we find nothing in the statutory language compelling the approach espoused by appellant.to the contrary,it is permissible for a court to direct issuance of a limited writ of mandate in an administrative mandamus proceeding.helene curtis,los angeles county assessment appeals,supra,th at,d id.at,d respondent tax agency was ordered only to hold a hearing on petitioner application to reduce its assessed valuation,evans department of motor vehicles th,d in proceedings under the administrative procedures act,the agency itself may order an administrative reconsideration of only part of the case pursuant to.thus,for example,where disciplinary proceedings against a liquor licensee were based on two counts,only one of which was supported by the evidence,the matter should be remanded to the board to reconsider the penalty alone.stoumen reilly cal d,see also,cooper state bd.of medical examiners cal d,same.similarly,where only two of six disciplinary charges against a civil service employee were supported by the evidence,limited remand was proper to reconsider just the penalty.nelson department of corrections d,rejecting the petitioner contention that respondent personnel board should be required to hold an entirely new hearing.
by analogy,in cases involving the california environmental quality act,authority for limited remand is explicitly recognized.public resources code section,subdivision b,provides that the court order must include only those mandates that are necessary to achieve ceqa compliance.city of redlands county of san bernardino th,d,fn.omitted.that section provides alternative remedies which allow the trial court to tailor the remedy to fit the violation.san bernardino valley audubon society metropolitan water dist.th,d,fn.omitted.public resources code section is a specific application of the general rule contained in code of civil procedure section,subdivision f id.at,d,italics added.it was enacted in to give the trial courts some flexibility in tailoring a remedy to fit a specific ceqa violation.see also,anderson first coalition city of anderson th,d.the foregoing authority thus reflects the severable nature of some administrative decisions made in ceqa cases.see generally,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.real property,id.supp.
here,the trial court effectively ordered the agency to set aside a discrete and segregable part of its decision,finding number,and it ordered the regional board to conduct a thorough and comprehensive analysis with respect to that finding alone.the effect of that order was to remand the case to the board for proper proceedings as to that single issue.steen city of los angeles,supra,cal d at.
in our view,under the circumstances presented here,the trial court was justified in taking that approach.limited remand is appropriate in this case,for several reasons the administrative order as a whole was broad ranging and complex,covering far more than just technology alternatives for minimizing entrainment the permit was the product of years of scientific study and interagency collaboration and the trial court found fault with only one of the agency findings 
in sum,we conclude,given the circumstances presented in this case,the court acted within the permissible confines of the statute in ordering a limited remand to the regional board without first commanding a writ to issue.
inherent authority to remand 
as just explained,we find nothing in code of civil procedure section that forecloses the possibility of interim remand.moreover,the court also has the inherent authority to return a matter to an administrative agency for further proceedings.courts have inherent power,as well as power under section of the code of civil procedure,to adopt any suitable method of practice,both in ordinary actions and special proceedings,if the procedure is not specified by statute or by rules adopted by the judicial council.tide water oil superior court cal d,fn.omitted trial court did not err in trying with prohibition proceeding.
as the california supreme court long ago in a case where section was found inapplicable aside from statutory provisions,such a power to remand also exists under the inherent powers of the court.keeler superior court,supra,cal d at.there is no question but that,consistent with proper regulations,a court has inherent power to control the course of litigation before it.citations.this includes the power to remand a cause in mandamus for further proceedings which are deemed necessary for a proper determination.ibid.the policy underlying such a rule is that the determination of the issues should first be made by the administrative agency.steen city of los angeles,supra,cal d at.
due process 
we recognize that remand without issuance of a writ may offend due process in some circumstances.as has been aptly stated the vice of prejudgment remand is that it raises serious questions of due process it effectively preclude s any possible challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the new findings.sierra club contra costa county,supra,th at,d,quoting resource defense fund local agency formation,supra,d at.
that is not our case,however.here,appellant had the opportunity both to participate in the supplemental administrative hearing in and to contest the resulting findings at the continued judicial hearing in.the essential requirements of due process are met when the administrative body is required to determine the existence or nonexistence of the necessary facts before any decision is made citations and the party is afforded an opportunity for review by the courts citation.de cordoba governing board d.in the instant case petitioner was given a full administrative hearing and afforded an opportunity for judicial review.thus its constitutional right to due process was not violated.ibid.in no way were the agency procedures or findings insulated from review here.we therefore discern no due process problem arising from the prejudgment remand procedure used in this case.
conclusion 
under the circumstances presented here,the court acted properly in remanding the matter to the regional board for additional hearings on finding number only the remand procedure comported with the requirements of code of civil procedure section it was within the court inherent authority and it did not offend due process.
evidentiary predicate for remand 
in their,respondents question the evidentiary predicate for remand.they assert that the court erred in remanding the matter to the regional board,because the original administrative determination was supported by substantial evidence.appellant disagrees.
as before,our analysis begins with the statute.
statutory framework 
in administrative mandamus proceedings,the judicial inquiry shall extend to the questions whether the respondent agency has proceeded without,or in excess of jurisdiction whether there was a fair trial and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law,the order or decision is not supported by the findings,or the findings are not supported by the evidence.code civ,subd.b.
in this case,the first phase of the judicial proceeding concluded with administrative remand,based on the trial court here in respondents one critical agency finding was not supported by the weight of the evidence.
as a necessary threshold step in assessing the challenged determination,we first describe the governing standards of review.
standard of review in the trial court independent judgment 
in this case,the act provides for independent trial court review of the evidence before the regional board as contained in the administrative record for the purposes of subdivision c of section of the code of civil procedure,the court shall exercise its independent judgment on the evidence,subd.d.
independent trial court review is accomplished by means of a limited trial de novo in which the trial court not only examines the record for errors of law but also exercises its independent judgment upon the weight of the evidence produced before the administrative agency together with any further evidence properly admitted by the court.merrill department of motor vehicles cal d,fns.omitted.however,judicial trial de novo after an administrative hearing is not usually intended as a trial without appropriate consideration of the evidence upon which the administrative body based its action.dare bd.of medical examiners cal d.in exercising its independent judgment,a trial court must afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings,and the party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the evidence.fukuda city of angels cal th,d,see generally,cal.administrative mandamus,supra,court scope of review under ccp.
standard of review in the appellate court substantial evidence 
where an independent review standard applies below,as is the case here,we review the factual findings of the trial court,not those of the agency.fukuda city of angels,supra,cal th at,d.thus,where the trial court exercised its independent judgment,we must determine whether the findings and judgment of the trial court are supported by substantial,credible and competent evidence.citation.all conflicts in the evidence must be resolved and all inferences drawn in favor of the judgment.cooper kizer d,quoting evans unemployment ins.appeals bd.cal d,see also,lake reed cal th,d.in other words,where the trial court is authorized to conduct a limited trial de novo the province of the appellate court is analogous to that assumed by it in an ordinary civil appeal merrill department of motor vehicles,supra,cal d at,accord,state water resources control bd.cases th,d.
the evidence 
with that deferential review standard in mind,we now assess the trial court decision to remand the matter to the regional board to conduct a thorough and comprehensive analysis of best technology available,a decision that was based on its determination that finding number lacked evidentiary support in the administrative record.our assessment of this point turns on these two questions is there is evidence of alternatives to cooling in the administrative record if so,is there evidence that the regional board considered such alternatives 
background alternatives for plant cooling 
thermal electric generating facilities create heat in order to convert water into steam that will drive turbines,thus generating electricity.rábago,what comes out must go in cooling water intakes and the clean water act harv.envtl.power plants need a thermal transfer system to eliminate the excess heat that they produce.see also,may van rossum,the quick and the dead fish entrainment,entrapment,and the implementation and application of section b of the clean water act.waste heat is eliminated using air dry cooling or water wet cooling.wet cooling systems may be broadly categorized as either open cycle or closed cycle.
dry cooling dry cooling systems employ condensers,fans,and large cooling towers.they use virtually no water.riverkeeper,united states environmental protection agency,fn.riverkeeper ii.
wet cooling a cooling system withdraws water from the source waterbody,runs it through the condenser system,and then discharges without recirculation.as the water circulates through the condenser system it is heated,and thus returns to the environment in a heated state.cooling systems require a continual supply of cooling water and are more common than systems.may van rossum,supra.at see also riverkeeper ii,supra,at,fn.rábago,supra,harv.envtl.at.cooling was already in use at the moss landing power plant,and the regional water board approved that alternative as the best technology available for the two new units at the plant.
wet cooling in contrast to cooling systems,cooling systems recirculate and reuse cooling water.as with cooling,cooling water in systems is passed through the condenser system where it is heated in the process of converting steam back to water.after passing through the condenser system,however,the cooling water is transported to cooling towers or to some other process to be cooled.once cooled,the water is returned to the condenser system and used again in the cooling process.although the cooling water used in a system is constantly being reused and recycled,some of the water is lost through evaporation and other processes.therefore systems must recoup such losses by making additional withdrawals of cooling water from the source waterbody.the amount of cooling water withdrawn from the source waterbody in a system is only to of the quantity of water used by a comparable system.accordingly,the adverse environmental impact on aquatic ecosystems is far less from than from systems.may van rossum,supra.at see also riverkeeper ii,supra,at,fn.rábago,supra,harv.envtl.at.closed cycle wet cooling systems may employ either mechanical or natural draft cooling towers,using either fresh water or seawater.
water intake wet cooling and closed on water intake from a source waterbody.technology alternatives exist for water flow reductions,which in turn diminish impact on aquatic organisms.they include water pump flow reduction and seasonal flow reduction.apart from technologies that limit intake flow,there are other technologies for minimizing biological impacts,such as screens and filters physical and behavioral barriers and fish collection,removal,and conveyance systems.see generally,may van rossum,supra.at.beyond design alternatives,intake location may be changed,either to an alternate onshore site or to an offshore location.id.at.
discussion of alternatives in the administrative record 
in their briefs on appeal,respondents cite to numerous documents in the administrative record that discuss alternatives for the plant cooling water intake system.the water boards first point to reports and analyses presented to the energy commission,including duke application for certification,made in may duke responses to the energy commission request for supplemental data,dated july the energy commission staff preliminary,final,and amended analyses,which were submitted between february and june and the energy commission presiding member proposed decision,issued in august.they also emphasize the existence of reports prepared or evaluated by the technical working group twg,including studies submitted by duke as required by the regional board lastly,the water boards list various reports,comments,and presentations submitted to the regional water board at its meetings in september and october.
only that last category of evidence concerns us here.whatever information exists in the administrative record as a whole,the focus of judicial inquiry properly rests solely on the evidence before the regional board,which was the agency charged with approving or disapproving the npdes permit.we consider that evidence now.
evidence of alternatives presented to the regional board 
duke npdes permit application was considered by the regional board in public meetings held in september and october.after a lengthy hearing on september,the matter was continued to allow further exploration of two issues an alternative offshore location for the cooling water intake,and the proposed mitigation plan.the continued hearing took place on october.at the conclusion of that hearing,the regional board approved the permit.
over the course of the two public meetings,the regional board was provided with many documents.the two agenda packets alone contain a total of nearly pages.the board also received testimony at both hearings.of that extensive body of written and oral evidence,a relatively small portion dealt with cooling water alternatives.we summarize that portion of the evidence now.
staff report a staff report was prepared for the september hearing,which refers to best technology available bta alternatives in three places.the first reference to bta in the staff report is this statement the discharger must use bta to minimize adverse environmental impacts caused by the cooling water intake system.if the cost of implementing technological alternatives for achieving bta is wholly disproportionate to the environmental benefits to be achieved,the board may consider alternative methods to mitigate these adverse environmental impacts.in this case the cost of technical alternatives for eliminating entrainment impacts such as cooling towers is wholly disproportionate.the next reference to bta alternatives is table,entitled best technology available costs new units only,with cost figures supplied by duke.the third reference to bta is staff discussion of alternatives in response to a comment by the center for marine conservation.the comment states power plant modifications that avoid impacts,such as cooling towers,should be chosen over mitigation.staff responds cooling towers are the only alternative for definitely eliminating significant impacts due to entrainment to our knowledge,there are no salt water cooling towers in place for a facility like the moss landing power plant.cooling towers are massive structures,they present other impacts construction,noise,aesthetic,fog,etc.and they are relatively expensive up to million in this case.the range of productivity loss,and our interpretation of that range,does not support pursuing technological alternatives to eliminate entrainment impacts.staff thus recommended granting the npdes permit as drafted,allowing the use of cooling,but requiring duke to fund a million mitigation plan to address the adverse environmental effects of entrainment.
energy commission documents the transcript of the september hearing indicates that the board received an excerpt of the energy commission presiding member proposed decision covering those issues that are before the board today,which are the thermal,entrainment and impingement issues.the agenda packet for the october meeting includes several other items from the energy commission a excerpt from its june final staff assessment containing table,which sets out bta alternatives and their costs and gives a short description of three alternatives condensers,an offshore intake location,and an alternate onshore location and a portion of the transcript of the june evidentiary hearing before the energy commission addressing the offshore alternative.
b report the transcript of the october hearing indicates that the board was given chapter of duke b report.that chapter consists of pages of text and charts evaluating alternative intake technologies.
presentation by raimondi at the october hearing,a slide presentation was given by peter raimondi,one of two independent scientists hired by the regional board.in his presentation,raimondi analyzed several cooling alternatives air cooled towers and closed cycle water cooling mechanical and natural draft towers.his analysis involved four criteria is the alternative available and reliable does the alternative provide further reduction in aquatic organism losses does the alternative offer feasibility and what are its economic costs raimondi also discussed an alternative water intake location offshore.
testimony at both hearings,speakers addressed the regional board during the public comment period,some in person and some by letters read into the record.several speakers mentioned cooling water alternatives.at the september hearing,a representative of the department of fish and game noted that alternatives were considered,including cooling towers.however,she added in the report,it does indicate they are very expensive.three other speakers at that first hearing commented on the lack of consideration of alternatives.two of them urged the board to postpone approval of the permit to allow further analysis of cooling tower alternatives.at the october meeting,four other speakers likewise urged the board to delay permit approval on that ground.
analysis by the regional board 
as the foregoing summary shows,evidence of alternatives to cooling was presented to the regional board.the pivotal questions are whether that evidence was sufficient and whether the record demonstrates that the board analyzed the alternatives.the trial court answered both questions in the negative.in particular,the court found no meaningful analysis by the regional board.at least as to that point,we are compelled to agree.as the record indicates,two individual board members criticized the alternatives analyses,but there is no evidence that the board as a whole analyzed or even discussed the issue.
board member statements at the september hearing,after presentations by and on behalf of staff,regional board member shallcross said obviously,the most preferred alternative is to avoid the taking or damaging altogether.and looking at the best technology,table in the staff report,you have a list of different technologies and their cost over the project life.i would have to agree most of them are probably,what is the word,wholly disproportionate.however,the one that interests me is the offshore intake and the cost over the project life it says it was specified.during deliberations,he reiterated i very disappointed that the whole idea of putting the intake structure out,out in the ocean was vetted,basically,at all.he continued i definitely would like to see the intake vetted and some of these other things i mentioned,in particular more specifics on the mitigation plan.he thus concluded i wo be able to support this today.as noted above,the matter was thereafter continued to allow further discussion of the offshore intake alternative and the mitigation package.
at the october meeting,during raimondi presentation,board member shallcross expressed concern about the analytic method used for examining the alternatives,specifically their elimination from consideration upon failure to meet one of the four criteria identified by the scientist.as he put it,one of my problems with this was that all the alternatives were fully analyzed.shallcross later expressed his disappointment with the way alternatives analysis was handled overall.in his view,the technological alternatives were set aside rather quickly.and all the time was spent on developing the mitigation plan.another board member,daniels,agreed,noting that things like distillation were not even considered at all.nevertheless,shallcross said,i going to trust staff on this,on the alternatives,on the technological alternatives,and i am going to support the motion to approve the permit.
trial court determination in the trial court view,the regional board did not conduct an adequate analysis of the alternatives for achieving bta.for one thing,the court observed,the regional board apparently accepted duke cost estimates without any independent study or analysis.the court therefore took issue with the resulting conclusion that the cost of alternative cooling technologies was wholly disproportionate to their benefits,finding evidence on that point at best meager,and at worst,speculative and based on historical conjecture.for another thing,the court found no evidence in the record of a comprehensive,definitive consideration of cooling water alternatives by the regional board to apply best technology available to the moss landing power plant.under the deferential standard that governs our review of the trial court decision,we are compelled to adopt its view of the record,as we now explain.
discussion 
in affirming the trial court on this point,we honor the important principle that the administrative body charged with responsibility for a particular determination must itself examine and ultimately decide the question.
that principle finds frequent expression in cases involving the california environmental quality act.as has been said in the ceqa context,the responsible agency must show that its approval of the proposed project followed meaningful consideration of alternatives and mitigation.mountain lion foundation fish game com.cal th,d.ceqa thus requires the public agency to consider feasible alternatives to the project which would lessen any significant adverse environmental impact.id.at,d.furthermore,under ceqa,a decisionmaking agency is prohibited from approving a project for which significant environmental effects have been identified unless it makes specific findings about alternatives and mitigation measures.id.at,d,citing pub.the agency decisionmaking body must adopt the required findings itself.it may not delegate the duty to make findings to agency staff or a subordinate body.protect our water county of merced th,d.
a ceqa decision thus is subject to reversal when there is no evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency evaluated feasible mitigation measures during its review mountain lion foundation fish game,supra,cal th at,d.the cursory rejection of a proposed alternative does not constitute an adequate assessment of alternatives as required under ceqa and it fails to provide solid evidence of a meaningful review of the project alternative that would avoid the significant environmental effects identified id.at,d.
we think that those principles apply with equal force here.as the agency charged with making the bta determination,the regional board was required to meaningfully analyze the alternatives itself.as a duly constituted deliberative body,the board is required to undertake its own examination of the evidence,whether provided by the applicant,by independent consultants,or even by its own staff.we acknowledge the authority cited by respondents,which holds that staff opinion may constitute sufficient evidence to support an agency decision.industries city council d,citing coastal southwest dev.california coastal zone conservation com.d.see also,city of rancho cucamonga regional water quality control bd.th,d.but staff opinion,no matter how well researched and supported,is no substitute for meaningful by the responsible agency itself.
the administrative record before us supports the trial court conclusion that the regional board failed to analyze bta alternatives during its deliberations in september and october.see walters pine cove county water dist.d.under these circumstances,we find no basis for reversing the trial court findings concerning the evidence and its decision to remand to the board for further consideration and hearing ibid.
conclusions 
to sum up,we find that the administrative remand was procedurally proper we therefore reject appellant contrary contentions.we also conclude that the trial court had an adequate evidentiary basis to support its remand order for that reason,we rebuff respondents challenge.
that brings us to appellant claims arising from the administrative hearing following remand and from the ensuing judicial proceeding.
iii.administrative proceedings 
concerning the may administrative hearing,appellant argues that the regional board erred in considering new evidence on remand.appellant also asserts that the board improperly excluded a letter containing its written arguments and evidence.respondents dispute both of appellant contentions.
the trial court explicitly ruled against appellant as to both claims.first,the court concluded,the regional board complied with the remand order in taking new evidence.second,the court found,fair and appropriate rulings were made regarding admissibility of evidence,while maintaining a focus on the remand issue.on appeal,we review the factual basis for the trial court determinations for substantial evidence.city of rancho cucamonga regional water quality control,supra,th at,d.however,to the extent that the court determinations relate to procedural due process claims,they are reviewed de novo on appeal because the ultimate determination of procedural fairness amounts to a question of law.nasha city of los angeles th,d.
background 
in march,the regional board gave written notice that it would conduct a remand hearing on may.as indicated in the notice,the parties to the hearing were the regional board,duke,appellant,and the energy commission.
after setting forth background information,the notice explains the regional board is convening this hearing in order to provide an opportunity for all parties to present evidence and analysis regarding the bta alternatives,their costs and their environmental benefits.the best way to provide a comprehensive and thorough analysis of these issues is to consider the wide range of evidence and arguments submitted on all sides as well as comments from the public.as to the scope of the hearing,the notice states the court did not remand the entire npdes permit.the court only held that the regional board did not have sufficient evidence to support its finding that costs of alternatives to minimize entrainment impacts are wholly disproportionate to the environmental benefits.the notice further indicates that because there was no challenge concerning the effects of cooling on impingement or thermal discharge,the issues in this hearing relate only to entrainment impacts of the new units cooling water intake.
concerning procedure,the notice advises testimony,other evidence and legal arguments submitted in this hearing must be in accordance with this notice.only relevant testimony and other evidence will be accepted into the record.the notice lists the relevant issues it provides a schedule for the submission of written testimony,with an april deadline for direct testimony,evidence,and argument,and an april deadline for rebuttal.the notice also describes the conduct of the meeting,including the order of oral presentations and the time limits for each party.
the notice prompted a number of submissions,comments,and other responses.
duke submissions 
in response to the hearing notice,duke submitted a document containing pages of direct testimony,including attachments,plus professional résumés for its witnesses.duke submission was received on april.
duke characterized its analysis of alternatives as built off of but more thorough than its b report.since entrainment was the sole focus,systems were the only technology alternatives considered.six options were explored mechanical draft cooling using seawater mechanical draft cooling using fresh water natural draft cooling air dry cooling hybrid cooling and spray ponds.duke appendix d assessed the six identified alternatives,analyzing costs and environmental factors for each.other appendices provided further economic information.duke later submitted comments in lieu of rebuttal testimony,a letter from its counsel responding to a public comment from the california coastal commission,and a document entitled testimony,appendix that last document corrected some of the previously submitted information concerning plant efficiency and other matters.
staff submissions 
the regional board staff submitted a report with pages of text,plus several additional pages listing attachments,references,and other documents in the record.there are attachments to the staff report,comprising more than pages in all.
the report advises that staff reviewed all known intake structure technologies,such as screening devices,filters,and alternatives for reducing cooling water flow,such as seasonal flow limits,variable speed pumps,and closed cooling systems.concerning the first category intake structure devices,the staff report describes them as experimental and not demonstrated available technologies for mlpp moss landing power plant.turning to the second category flow reduction devices,the report rejects seasonal limits and pumps as not applicable or unlikely to provide increased benefit for minimizing entrainment.the report thus focuses on closed cycle systems as alternative technologies for reducing the plant cooling water intake.the report summarizes these alternatives as follows closed cooling systems,such as mechanical draft cooling towers or dry cooling would provide a significant reduction in entrainment,up to.staff considers these alternatives to be demonstrated available technologies,and has little evidence that they could not be installed at mlpp.however,the cost of these alternatives is estimated to be approximately million to million.the estimated value of the entrainment losses is to million based on staff habitat equivalency conversion method staff conclusion is that the cost of closed cooling systems is wholly disproportionate to their benefit.the cost figures used by staff are ascribed to the environmental protection agency.the report also touches on some environmental issues resulting from the alternatives,such as the possibility of salt drift on agriculture if saltwater mechanical draft towers were used.
the staff report recommends that the regional board determine that the weight of the evidence supports finding of the npdes permit for mlpp,which states that the costs of alternative cooling technologies are wholly disproportionate to the benefit to be gained.
staff later submitted rebuttal,commenting on duke testimony,particularly its alternatives analysis,and responding to public comments from the elkhorn slough coalition and the california coastal commission.
board counsel correspondence 
acting as the regional board legal advisor,senior staff counsel jennifer soloway submitted a memorandum to provide guidance to the board on the purpose of this hearing and the applicable law.dated april,the memorandum describes the trial court order discusses the legal guidance available for applying the governing law,section b of the clean water act,which requires the best technology available bta details the statutory factors for bta analysis describes standards for determining whether a particular technology is available and offers advice on applying the wholly disproportionate test.
the record also contains another correspondence from soloway,this one a letter dated may,and directed to jeff young,the regional board vice chair.counsel letter states you have requested copies of opinions,decisions,and analyses pertaining to the wholly disproportionate cost analysis.counsel adverted to two court opinions already in the record and forwarded seven additional documents.she noted,however the following npdes permit decisions and analyses include discussions of section b as it applies to certain power plants.because b is applied on a basis,these documents are instructive but are not binding on the board.
appellant responses and submittals 
in its first response to the hearing letter dated march,objected to the format of the scheduled hearing and requested a continuance.roger briggs,the regional board executive director,forwarded the letter to the other parties,gave them a deadline to respond,and advised appellant to proceed according to the extant hearing notice unless advised to the contrary.duke and the energy commission both responded each asked the regional board to overrule appellant objections and to deny the requested continuance.by letter of april,briggs overruled appellant objections and refused to postpone the hearing.that letter closed with a reminder that appellant submission was due by april,the previously established deadline for presenting direct evidence and argument in writing.
appellant submitted a letter dated april,in which it repeated its view that defects in the npdes permit required its reopening opined that those defects would not be cured by the proposed new hearing process and stated its intent to preserve and reassert these additional objections to the permit.appellant further advised that it was proceeding with a petition for writ of mandate to the court of appeal and thus respectfully declines to submit any testimony at this time.
on april,appellant submitted further correspondence from its counsel.in its opening paragraph,the letter states that it is in response to the staff report and other submittals.the letter reiterates appellant position that the only proper course of action in this matter is to reopen the existing npdes permit but continues in order to fully preserve its rights and to assist the board future deliberations over this important public policy matter,voices submits the following preliminary comments.when the board properly notices a new draft permit,we will,of course,provide additional testimony and comments.in a discussion titled threshold issues,the letter asserts that the purpose of the hearing is not clear,that new evidence should not be taken,and that the regional board counsel mischaracterized the trial court decision.under the heading additional matters for consideration in a new permit process,appellant provides a detailed legal analysis setting forth its view of clean water act section b,particularly the role of costs and mitigation.
appellant april submittal was rejected for inclusion in the written record for the hearing.as stated in a may letter by bruce daniels,regional board chair,the decision was made on the grounds that appellant letter was untimely and beyond the scope of the hearing issues before explaining his determination,daniels first observed that appellant april correspondence seems to have been submitted to address future deliberations of the board that theoretically will occur if appellant request to vacate the existing npdes permit is granted.daniels nevertheless acknowledged the possibility that appellant intends to augment the administrative record and participate in the current hearing.he continued in case that is their intent,the following discussion explains that because the letter was not submitted in accordance with the deadlines and requirements of the notice,it will not be accepted into the administrative record and will not be distributed to the board members in the course of the hearing.the letter from daniels apparently did not reach appellant prior to the may hearing.
appellant arranged for another submission on april,this one a memorandum authored by three individuals,including brent haddad of the university of california,santa cruz.it states we are submitting this memorandum to the board in an effort to clarify the inadequacies in the submissions by duke and regional board staff.the haddad memorandum continues section b of the clean water act states that cooling water intake structures must be of the best technology available bta,although courts have subsequently allowed exceptions for cases of wholly disproportionate costs and benefits the costs and benefits used by duke and the board staff are not comprehensive nor do they meet the standards laid out in the law with regard to incremental costs and benefits.following a detailed analysis,the memorandum concludes that a strong case can be made on purely economic grounds that the assessment so far inadequately meets the wholly disproportionate requirements of b of the clean water act.this memorandum was admitted into evidence at the hearing.
the hearing 
at the start of the may remand hearing,regional board chair daniels reiterated the procedures for the hearing as described in the hearing notice.daniels then announced that several documents had been received after the deadlines in the notice.he identified two late submittals that nevertheless had been admitted a public comment from the elkhorn slough coalition,and the haddad memorandum.daniels then stated the other late submittals are not admissible to the record for this hearing but he did not specify what particular items were excluded.a regional board staff member later made an objection to haddad memorandum as being outside the scope of the hearing,but that objection was overruled.
after daniels made his opening comments,one board member shallcross recused himself.board counsel soloway then explained her role,summarized the history of the proceedings,and described the nature and scope of the hearing.soloway advised the regional board you are not required in any way to stick by the original decision the board made in.the court remanded this for you to look at this again.in response to a board member question,a representative from the regional board staff indicated that there had been major additions to the record.
following these preliminaries,the parties oral presentations began,starting with regional board staff.within their respective time allocations,the parties were permitted to each other witnesses,and board members questions were allowed as well.before duke witnesses,appellant counsel again objected to the board decision to accept new evidence.after presentation of the parties evidence,the board took public comments and then entertained the parties closing statements before beginning its deliberations.
at the conclusion of the hearing,by majority vote on a formal motion,the regional board stated that it had undertaken a thorough and comprehensive analysis and concluded that finding of the npdes permit for the moss landing power plant was supported by the weight of the evidence.a formal resolution to the same effect followed.
legal issues 
before addressing appellant specific claims of error,we begin with some general observations about the nature of the administrative proceeding at issue here and the proper scope of judicial review.
npdes permit proceedings typically are subject to informal adjudication procedures under the administrative procedures act.city of rancho cucamonga regional water quality control,supra,th at,d,citing,et,and of,tit.while administrative bodies are not expected to observe meticulously all of the rules of evidence applicable to a court trial,common sense and fair play dictate certain basic requirements for the conduct of any hearing at which facts are to be determined.among these are the following the evidence must be produced at the hearing by witnesses personally present,or by authenticated documents,maps or photographs ordinarily,hearsay evidence standing alone can have no weight citations,and this would apply to hearsay evidence concerning someone else opinion furthermore,within reasonable limits must be allowed.desert turf club board of supervisors d,accord,ashford culver city unified school,supra,th at,d,subd.c see generally,witkin,cal.evidence ed.introduction,id.supp.
on judicial review,the administrative proceedings enjoy a presumption of regularity,which generally extends to procedural matters,including evidentiary rulings.city of rancho cucamonga regional water quality control board,supra,th at,d.when the basic fairness of an administrative hearing is challenged,however,the appellate court independently reviews the claim as a question of law.sinaiko superior court th,d id.at,d wholesale disqualification of petitioner experts rendered the administrative proceedings unfair as a matter of law.
with that background,we turn to appellant claims of administrative error at the remand hearing.
the decision to take new evidence 
appellant first complaint is that the regional board erred in accepting new evidence at the remand hearing.to the extent that this argument constitutes an attack on the trial court authority to remand,we have already resolved the question adversely to appellant.beyond that,we find no merit in the argument.
where further administrative proceedings are warranted,they may involve the admission of new evidence.see,keeler superior court,supra,cal d at,upholding remand procedure for the taking of further evidence.in one case,for example,a writ issued ordering the department of motor vehicles both to set aside its decision revoking the petitioner probation and suspending his license and to reinstate his license as it existed immediately prior to that suspension.carlton department of motor vehicles d.on appeal,the agency complained that the trial court erred in not specifically remanding the matter to the dmv for a new hearing.id.at.the appellate court stated where an administrative decision is set aside for insufficiency of the evidence it is customary to remand the matter to the agency for a new hearing ibid.with a new hearing,the court agreed,it was conceivable the dmv could produce competent evidence sufficient to establish the petitioner responsibility for the underlying accident.id.at.as pertinent here,the court emphatically explained nothing in the writ of mandate precludes it from doing so.id.at.other cases likewise recognize the agency discretion to consider new evidence on remand.see,zink city of sausalito d.where the trial court independent review of the evidence determines that some of the substantive findings are unsupported by the evidence,remand to the administrative body is the only means of permitting it to exercise its discretion overton state personnel bd.d.evidentiary deficiency requires that the peremptory writ issue garcia california emp.stab.com.d,due to the insufficiency of the evidence in the record filed herein to support the findings of the board,it is necessary that this application be remanded for further evidence,moyer state board of equalization d,under,agency reconsideration may be based on all the pertinent facts of the record and such additional evidence and argument as may be permitted.as the foregoing authority demonstrates,on remand or reconsideration,an administrative agency may admit new evidence as necessary to a proper determination of the issues before it.
the cases cited by appellant do not dictate a contrary conclusion.they stand for the unremarkable proposition that a court may not consider evidence that was not presented to the agency.see,western states petroleum superior court cal th,d,cadiz land rail cycle th,d friends of the old trees department of forestry fire protection th,d.as california supreme court authority makes clear,the overriding purpose of restricting review to the administrative record is to ensure that the courts do not engage in independent factfinding rather than engaging in a review of the agency discretionary decision.friends of the old trees department of forestry fire protection,at,d,discussing western states petroleum superior court,at,d.nothing in these cases prevents an agency from supplementing its own record on remand.
in sum,the agency acted properly in accepting additional evidence in response to the court remand order.
for the same reasons,the trial court correctly considered this new evidence at the judicial hearing.indeed,review of that evidence was not only proper,it was necessary given the court prior determination that the agency initial analysis was inadequate.as reflected in the trial court statement of decision it was certainly this court expectation that the board would more fully consider additional relevant evidence on the issue of the best technology available bta.to meaningfully comply with the remand,a more complete inquiry into bta necessitated the receipt of further information.having reviewed over pages of new administrative evidence,the court determined that the board engaged in the kind of scrutiny and analysis that the issue required.the augmented administrative record thus helped guide the trial court in its review of the agency discretionary decision.friends of the old trees department of forestry fire protection,supra,th at,d.by considering the additional evidence adduced at the remand hearing,the court adopted the proper analytic focus reviewing the agency expanded rather than engaging in its own.ibid.
we therefore reject appellant assertion that such an approach would lead to the very kind of post hoc agency rationalizations that the courts have soundly rejected,and it would make a mockery of the section administrative mandamus provision and decades of case law as well as its dire prediction that the fundamental building blocks of administrative law,which guard against arbitrary and capricious decisionmaking by our otherwise unaccountable public agencies,will thereby lie in shambles.to the contrary,we conclude,the challenged procedure helped to ensure a more thorough and meaningful administrative process,without sacrificing procedural protections or encouraging justification.
the decision to exclude appellant written submission 
appellant next challenges the exclusion of its counsel april letter,made on the grounds that it was untimely direct evidence and that it largely addressed matters beyond the scope of the remand order.describing its april letter as containing detailed legal and policy arguments regarding the propriety of staff chosen cost analysis and the legality of the habitat mitigation approach on which staff analysis relied,appellant characterizes its submission as proper rebuttal argument and thus timely.moreover,appellant insists,it was prejudiced by the exclusion of this document,notwithstanding the trial court finding to the contrary.
the administrative procedures act contemplates liberality in admitting evidence at adjudicative proceedings such as the one at issue here.city of rancho cucamonga regional water quality control board,supra,th at,d.in npdes proceedings such as this,wide latitude is allowed an administrative agency in the receipt of evidence steel train.even so,unless exclusion of the evidence rendered the entire proceeding claim that appellant does not board chair decision to reject appellant submission comes clothed in a presumption of regularity.city of rancho cucamonga,at,d cal.jockey club cal.racing bd.cal d,trial court properly rebuffed the contention that competent evidence offered by plaintiff was rejected by the agency,sinaiko superior court,supra,th at,d trial court exclusion of petitioner experts violated due process.
appellant has the burden of demonstrating error.fukuda city of angels,supra,cal th at,d.as we now explain,appellant failed to carry that burden here.we thus affirm the trial court approval of the administrative decision to exclude appellant submittal as untimely and outside the scope of the hearing.
timeliness 
the hearing notice established an april deadline for direct testimony,evidence,and argument.the requirement for early submittal of direct written testimony is expressly permitted by regulations governing the water boards adjudicative proceedings.as pertinent here,those regulations provide the hearing notice may require that direct testimony be submitted in writing prior to the hearing,tit,c.that practice is in keeping with the water boards policy to discourage the introduction of surprise testimony and exhibits,a.the regulations also provide consequences for noncompliance where any of the provisions of this section have not been complied with,the presiding officer may refuse to admit the proposed testimony or the proposed exhibit into evidence,and shall refuse to do so where there is a showing of prejudice to any party or the board,e.
to the extent that appellant april submission represents direct testimony,it was untimely and subject to exclusion on that ground alone.of,tit,c,e.appellant characterizes the letter as rebuttal,however.and as longstanding california supreme court precedent teaches,improper restrictions on the right to present evidence in rebuttal may constitute a deprivation of the constitutional guaranty of due process of law.pence industrial acc.com.cal d.
as a close reading demonstrates,appellant april letter is susceptible of several different interpretations,a point recognized by regional board chair daniels.on the one hand,it can be fairly read as simply rejecting the remand process as illegitimate,preserving objections,and addressing theoretical future deliberations alternatively,as daniels acknowledged,the letter could be interpreted as an attempt to participate in the current hearing.
viewed as a proffer of evidence and argument for the may remand proceeding,we agree that appellant april letter was not rebuttal.to be sure,appellant takes duke and the regional board staff to task for perceived analytic errors and evidentiary omissions.for the most part,however,it does so by setting up then knocking down straw men,without actually rebutting any direct evidence.appellant employs this tactic with each of the three substantive topics it discusses 
in its first argument,appellant decries staff recommendation as entirely without legal or factual support.appellant offers its assessment of what staff logic seems to be,then promptly disparages it as a tautological analysis that is entirely inconsistent with the plain language of the clean water act and epa interpretation of the statute.having given itself that opening,appellant devotes several pages to presenting its view of the proper interpretation of federal water law.
appellant continues in this vein with its second point,which concerns the valuation of costs and benefits.in appellant words,the board can not selectively choose only certain benefits to consider and weigh against the full costs of alternative technologies.that,however,is exactly what staff proposes in this case.again,though,appellant arguments on this point are addressed to its view of what the new staff report suggests rather than what that report contains by way of rebuttable evidence.to the extent that appellant does refer specifically to evidence adduced on direct,its discussion is mainly limited to reasserting that board can not lawfully consider new evidence unless it reopens the permit.appellant other comments about staff truncated approach to valuing benefits are offered merely as a springboard for its own analysis of the issue,which should have been offered on direct.
introducing its third and final main point,appellant states the heart of the problem with the existing permit is the board reliance on million in mitigation funding in lieu of bta.as to that issue,appellant offers legal arguments about the validity and application of the mitigation approach.these arguments do not specifically address any evidence submitted for the hearing,however.nor do they attempt to counter the legal analysis provided by board counsel soloway concerning mitigation instead,appellant advances these legal arguments as support for its own interpretation and application of the statute.appellant legal arguments concerning mitigation thus are not rebuttal.finally,to the extent that appellant addresses substantive aspects of the mitigation plan,its arguments are beyond the scope of the hearing issues,a point we now address.
stressing the importance of its proffered information on mitigation,appellant contends that its exclusion was both erroneous and prejudicial.appellant cites the apparent misunderstanding of board decisionmakers about the use and availability of mitigation funding as a substitute for technology under section b,and opines that there is no way to determine whether the improper exclusion of appellant submittal would have made a difference in the outcome.but the mitigation known as the habitat or environmental enhancement not at issue in the hearing,except insofar as its economic aspects relate to the question of whether the costs of alternative technologies were wholly disproportionate to their benefits.as board counsel soloway observed in her introductory remarks at the hearing the habitat enhancement program was not questioned by the court.and in fact is outside the scope of the language of b.during the hearing,board chair daniels likewise addressed the mitigation plan on several occasions,usually in the process of preventing testimony about its ecological aspects.each time,he hewed to the distinction between the scientific and the economic aspects of the program.thus,for example,daniels said we do need to talk about costs because you ca talk about wholly disproportionate without talking about costs and benefits.i think where we step off the end is where we start talking about the habitat program which is outside the intake structure issue and is a completely different mechanism than to try to mitigate against those impacts.so we are not going to talk about the habitat program.you can talk about the costs,the benefits,the impacts of the current plan,and any of these proposed different intake regimen s,but not the habitat program.at another point in the hearing,during testimony by haddad about the availability of replacement wetlands,daniels stated that an issue we are not dealing with here.if you want to talk about how it relates to valuation,that okay.
in administrative proceedings,the basic requirement of relevancy remains.witkin,cal.evidence,supra.both oral and written evidence should be considered if relevant to the issues.allied comp.ins.acc.com.cal d.by the same token,of course,it is not error to exclude irrelevant evidence.id.at,referee properly rejected further medical evidence bearing on the extent of the employee disability and other evidence relating to her occupational classification where the hearing was limited to the accuracy of the rating expert conclusion see also,ashford culver city unified school,supra,th at,d videotapes that lacked authenticating foundation were irrelevant vielehr state personnel bd.d.discussing relevance of proffered evidence.
the relevance of appellant evidence depends on whether it addressed the limited issue before the board.as explained above,the board was not considering the scientific validity of the mitigation plan.instead,the question before the board was purely the habitat equivalency valuation reflected in that plan accurately monetized the entrainment impact.as the water boards concede,this distinction between the biological and economic aspects of the mitigation plan sometimes proved slippery during the hearing.nevertheless,the presiding officer consistently and effectively limited the evidence to the program economic aspects.
appellant april letter does mount a fleeting challenge on that one relevant issue,arguing that there simply is no credible evidence to support the numbers on which staff relies indeed,the limited evidence of wetlands replacement costs in the record from other projects suggests that staff missed the mark by an order of magnitude.to that limited extent,the letter arguably was relevant.but appellant must show prejudice from its exclusion as well as error.as our high court has long acknowledged,there is no basis for reversing an agency decision to exclude evidence if the error complained of has not resulted in a miscarriage of justice.cal.jockey club cal.racing,supra,cal d at,cal,art.vi.no prejudice appears here.appellant was able to offer far more extensive and effective evidence and analysis on this point through haddad evidence.thus,even assuming error in the exclusion of appellant april letter,there is no prejudice.
conclusion 
to sum up,we reject both of appellant procedural challenges to the administrative hearing.first,we find no merit in appellant claim that the agency erred in considering new evidence in response to the court remand order.the additional evidence permitted a more thoroughgoing administrative process,as the court remand order contemplated.furthermore,the augmented record assisted the court in its review of the agency decision.second,the agency acted properly in excluding appellant submittal as untimely and beyond the scope of the issues.to the limited extent that the submittal constituted rebuttal on relevant aspects of the mitigation plan,appellant suffered no prejudice from its exclusion.
having rebuffed both of appellant procedural challenges to the administrative hearing,we now turn to the judicial proceeding in which the regional board decision was affirmed.
iv.judicial proceedings 
appellant challenges the outcome of the court hearing,arguing in effect that the trial court misinterpreted and misapplied the governing statute,section b of the clean water act.respondents dispute those assertions.as a framework for our analysis of this issue,we begin by summarizing the general principles of statutory construction that guide our task.next,we discuss section b itself.finally,we examine how that statute was applied in this case.
general principles of statutory construction 
the courts task in interpreting federal legislative acts is to ascertain the intent of congress.chevron,natural resources defense council,d accord,national association of home builders defenders of wildlife,supra.at.that task begins with the statutory language itself,which must be read in context.national association of home builders,at,city of burbank state water resources control board,supra,cal th at,d.
if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress chevron,natural resources defense council,supra,at.accord national association of home builders defenders of wildlife,supra.at.but where a fundamental ambiguity is not resolved by the statutory text it is appropriate to look to the implementing agency expert interpretation of the provision at issue.national association of home builders defenders of wildlife,at.
within those parameters,statutory interpretation presents a question of law,which we review de novo.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d.because a federal statute is at issue here,we look to federal law for guidance.although lower federal court decisions are not binding on this court,they may be persuasive,especially as regards the interpretation of federal law.spellman securities,annuities ins.services,th,d see also,people bradley cal d,adams pacific bell directory th,d.moreover,the environmental protection agency administrative interpretation is relevant here too,in light of the state board obligation to carry out the objectives of federal law in issuing npdes permits.waterkeepers northern california state water resources control,supra,th at,d.
construction of section b 
with those principles in mind,we now turn to a consideration of the governing statute,section b of the clean water act cwa.
the statutory language 
the governing provision reads any standard established pursuant to section of this title cwa or section of this title cwa and applicable to a point source shall require that the location,design,construction,and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.b,subdivision b.
the statutory text is brief but rich.in the opinion of one commentator,by requiring that location,design,construction,and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact,congress has imbued section b with more operative terms than any phrase in all environmental law.may van rossum,supra.at,quoting b.
agency interpretations 
over the decades since the enactment of section b,the environmental protection agency has generated a rather bewildering array of regulatory interpretations,reflected in its rulemaking and in many other documents.
regulations 
the epa attempts at rulemaking under section b have a long history.because the regulations illuminate the agency understanding of the section,we briefly summarize their development here.
initial regulations the agency first promulgated regulations in.they were remanded on procedural grounds in appalachian power train cir.riverkeeper i,supra,at.thereafter,the agency formally withdrew the regulations.pursuant to a consent decree,the epa agreed to promulgate regulations in three phases by specified deadlines.riverkeeper i,at riverkeeper ii,supra,at.
phase i rule new facilities phase i concerns cooling water intake structures at new facilities.riverkeeper i,supra,at,fn.the draft rule was published in august.the final rule was promulgated in december.one portion of the final rule permitted a facility to comply with section b by undertaking restoration measures riverkeeper ii,supra,at.
the phase i regulations were challenged in riverkeeper i,supra.on appeal,the court upheld most aspects of the phase i rule,but remanded the provisions relating to the restoration option.riverkeeper ii,supra,at see riverkeeper i,supra,at.
phase ii rule existing power plants the phase ii rule governs cooling water intake structures at large,existing power plants.riverkeeper ii,supra,at.the draft rule was issued in april.the final rule was promulgated in july.july.
the phase ii regulations were challenged in riverkeeper ii,supra.after extensively analyzing various elements of the regulations,the court remanded the matter to the agency on procedural and substantive grounds.id.at.the court reaffirmed that restoration measures are not permissible compliance alternatives under section b.id.at.it also addressed the role of costs in the bta analysis.id.at.as to that point,the court concluded that costs play a limited role in the determination of best technology available.id.at.
phase iii rule other existing facilities phase iii will regulate existing power plants not governed by phase ii,as well as other industrial facilities.riverkeeper ii,supra,at.
none of the regulations is binding here.the regulations were remanded then withdrawn.the phase i regulations apply only to new facilities.see riverkeeper ii,supra,at,discussing the definition of new facility under the phase i and phase ii regulations.the phase ii regulations were published in july,long after the october permit approval at issue here.therefore,as appellant acknowledged in its written briefs,the phase ii regulations do not strictly govern the npdes permit challenged here.nonetheless,as indicated above,they do shed light on the agency understanding of its statutory charge.
b.other regulatory guidance 
beyond its rulemaking efforts,the environmental protection agency has interpreted section b in other documents,including its draft guidance for evaluating the adverse impact of cooling water intake structures on the aquatic environment section b,issued in may hereafter,the draft guidance.in addition,the epa general counsel has issued a number of written opinions in connection with specific npdes permits hereafter,general counsel opinions.two are of particular interest here general counsel opinion environmental protection agency,office of the general counsel,opinion,june,and general counsel opinion environmental protection agency,office of the general counsel,opinion,july.further insight may be gleaned from the epa adjudication of particular npdes permit applications,which one commentator describes as a rather detailed administrative common law developed as the agency attempted to apply the statute.rábago,supra,harv.envtl.at.the same commentator calls the epa extant policy and regulatory statements a somewhat incoherent patchwork of information.though each is helpful,none is enforceable.id.at.
the statute reach 
to better understand clean water act section b,we first explore its parameters.we consider three issues related to the statute reach the relationship between intake and discharge the provision applicability to npdes permits for existing facilities and the basis for considering closed cycle alternatives to cooling water intake structures.
relationship between intake and discharge 
the first two subdivisions of section address two points on the water use continuum,income and outgo.the intake of water for plant cooling is regulated by b,while discharge of the used,heated water is governed by a.section b is concerned with the adverse environmental impact of the withdrawal of cooling water rather than the discharge of heated water.general counsel opinion,supra.it is the one section of the act that focuses not on discharges,but on intakes.rábago,supra,harv.envtl.at see also,riverkeeper ii,supra,at.by contrast,section a is concerned with whether the discharge exceeds a thermal limitation or whether the discharge interferes with the propagation of a balanced indigenous population of shellfish,fish,and wildlife.general counsel opinion.section a permits consideration of the quality of the receiving water for purposes of granting variances with respect to the rules concerning thermal pollution of the water discharge.riverkeeper ii,at,fn.
despite these differences,there is a relationship between the withdrawal of cooling water and thermal discharges.general counsel opinion.that relationship has an operational component the amount of water that goes in is directly related to the amount that comes out.therefore closed cycle systems,which take in minimal amounts of cooling water in the first instance,in turn,discharge minimal thermal pollution directly into the water.rábago,supra,harv.envtl.at see also,may van rossum,supra.at.the relationship also has a legal component the statute requires that any standard established by the epa to govern the discharge of pollutants from existing facilities must also regulate cooling water intake structures.riverkeeper ii,supra,at.even so,section b,the sole intake provision in the entire clean water act,has been described as something of an afterthought,having been added by the conference committee without substantive comment.riverkeeper i,supra,at,fn.
npdes permits for existing plants 
as explained in federal court decisions,section b applies to existing plants as they undertake the periodic npdes permitting process.in riverkeeper ii,the court confirmed the statute application to existing plants,saying nothing in section b indicates that because it applies to the location,design,construction,and capacity of a facility cooling water intake structure,the section is therefore limited to new facilities and does not require existing facilities either to modify existing intake structures or to construct new intake structures in order to come into compliance with the epa rule.riverkeeper ii,supra,at,fn.omitted.the court rejected the argument that the epa has authority to approve cooling water intake structures only before construction and can not regulate these structures through the npdes permits riverkeeper ii,supra,at.as the court acknowledged the textual basis for the epa to regulate cooling water intake structures during the periodic permitting process applicable to the discharge of pollutants is not immediately apparent.id.at.despite this textual hiccup,the court said,the epa decision to use the npdes process to enforce section b is not unreasonable.see also,steel train,supra,at.in sum,riverkeeper ii concludes,the epa may regulate cooling water intake structures via the npdes permit process.otherwise,congress intent to regulate the intake structures of existing facilities could not be effectuated.riverkeeper ii,at,fn.omitted.
consideration of alternative cooling technologies 
as explained by the epa general counsel,closed cycle systems may be considered in assessing best technology available,even though they are not technically subsumed within the statute,which governs only cooling water intake systems.cooling towers or other closed cycle cooling systems are not cooling water intake structures.it is clear that there is no independent basis under section b to require a cooling tower in a permit.however,under section b a permit may restrict the volume of flow or capacity of an intake structure.general counsel opinion.such a reduction of allowable capacity may necessitate the use of a closed cycle or recirculating cooling system.section b does not,however,allow for the imposition of closed cycle cooling systems per se,at see,may van rossum,supra.at.
with that understanding of the statute reach in mind,we now address its command to minimize adverse environmental impact through the use of the best technology available.
statutory mandate to minimize adverse environmental impact 
section b requires technology that minimizes adverse environmental impact.
the specific environmental impacts to be minimized are impingement and entrainment.in the epa view,they are primary,harmful environmental effects that can be reduced through the use of specific technologies.at,supra phase ii final regulations see riverkeeper ii,supra,at.
by regulatory interpretation minimize means to reduce to the smallest amount,extent,or degree reasonably possible.phase i final regulations see also,general counsel opinion,equating minimize with reduce to the smallest possible amount or degree.the statute does not require the complete elimination of all impacts.as stated in the draft guidance regulatory agencies should clearly recognize that some level of intake damage can be acceptable if that damage represents a minimization of environmental impact.draft guidance.more recently,in connection with its promulgation of the phase ii rule,the epa concluded that the percent reduction of impingement mortality and entrainment is not completely within the control of a facility and therefore may not be precisely achieved by a facility.riverkeeper ii,supra,at.
statutory mandate to employ best technology available 
to satisfy the statutory mandate of minimizing environmental impact,a plant cooling water intake system must reflect technology available.we separately consider each of the three words in that critical operative phrase.
is it a technology 
the statute is.riverkeeper ii,supra,at,id.at cwa reflects a imperative.bta is an organic concept planted firmly in the cwa preference,and evolves along with developments in engineering.may van rossum,supra.at.
by way of example,design technologies may include screening devices,use of fish handling and bypass systems,pumps,trash racks,and behavioral barriers as well as fish ladders,fish buckets,improved fish screens,protective coatings,intake depth adjustment,modified velocity caps,and sound deterrent devices.may van rossum,supra.at.technologies for capacity reduction may include such things as seasonal flow reductions and upgraded screening.id.at.
on the other hand,restoration measures are not a technology within the contemplation of the statute as construed in the riverkeeper cases.riverkeeper i,supra,at riverkeeper ii,supra,at.as the riverkeeper i court explained,such measures have nothing to do with the location,the design,the construction,or the capacity of cooling water intake structures,because they are unrelated to the structures themselves.riverkeeper i,at.restoration measures correct for the adverse environmental impacts of impingement and entrainment they do not minimize those impacts in the first place.accord,riverkeeper ii,at.thus,under the express dictates of the statute,restoration measures can not substitute for the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact in cooling water structures.riverkeeper ii,at.to the extent that the epa regulations allowed restoration in lieu of technology,they were struck down.riverkeeper i,at remanding that aspect of the phase i final regulations riverkeeper ii,at remanding that aspect of the phase ii final regulations.
is it available 
in assessing whether a technology is available within the meaning of the statute,several elements come into play,including feasibility and costs.
the feasibility of a given technology is a relevant factor in determining bta.riverkeeper i,supra,at epa was entitled to consider feasibility generally.an assessment of feasibility properly includes considerations.as the draft guidance explains the appropriate technology is best determined after a careful evaluation of the specific aspects at each site.draft guidance,at.there might be physical constraints,such as topography or the availability of fresh water.additionally,there may be legal constraints on using a particular technology at a given site based on the application of other laws,such as those prohibiting nuisance.see,subds.b,c.
in considering the availability of a technology,cost is also a factor.
appellant observes that the statute contains no explicit authority for cost considerations,and it urges as a general proposition that an agency implementing federal law may not consider costs unless the statute clearly authorizes cost considerations,citing whitman american trucking associations,d.whitman is inapposite here.as duke points out,whitman involved air quality standards under the clean air act.under that statute,those standards had to be set high enough to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety without regard to cost.id.at.as the high court recognized,however,other provisions of the clean air act do permit economic costs to be taken into account.id.at.whitman offers no basis for disregarding costs in considering the availability of a technology under section b.in any event,as appellant explains in its reply brief,it does not contend on this appeal that economic considerations can never be taken into account.
as appellant acknowledges,the environmental protection agency itself has read economic considerations into the provision.see.at,supra phase ii final regulations.the federal courts have concurred.seacoast league costle,seacoast riverkeeper i,supra,at riverkeeper ii,supra,at.as the riverkeeper i court acknowledged,section b itself is silent as to what factors the epa should consider.riverkeeper i,supra,at.nevertheless,that court concluded,the epa was permitted to consider cost and energy efficiency in determining the best technology available.ibid.however,as explained in riverkeeper ii,the agency can do so only in a limited fashion and not as a primary consideration.riverkeeper ii,supra,at.
over the years,a standard for economic considerations has emerged,commonly referred to as the wholly disproportionate test.see generally,may van rossum,supra.at.under that test,a technology need not be employed if its costs are wholly disproportionate to the environmental benefits to be gained.this standard is reflected in both regulatory and judicial decisions.see,general counsel opinion,seacoast,supra,at,riverkeeper ii,supra,at,fn.
is it the best 
to comply with section b,the technology selected must be the best available.although the statute objective is to minimize impingement and entrainment,other factors may also be considered,such as energy efficiency and environmental effects.at,supra.as stated in riverkeeper ii,the epa could rely on factors other than impingement and entrainment in establishing bta,such as negative environmental impacts or concerns about energy production and efficiency riverkeeper ii,supra,at see also riverkeeper i,supra,at rejecting the argument that the epa gave too much weight to energy consumption and emissions in the phase i rule.
the determination of bta is entrusted to the epa or its delegate,in this case,the regional board.as we now explain,the agency must use its best professional judgment in making that determination.
agency standard for applying section b best professional judgment 
in the absence of uniform regulations or other national standards,npdes permits are issued on a basis,with the agency using its best professional judgment.see,natural resources defense council epa,supra phase i final regulations.at,supra phase ii draft regulations.at,supra phase ii final regulations.
using its best professional judgment,the agency thus must determine whether the applicant is using the best technology available to minimize adverse impacts.under the statute as interpreted,that determination has both environmental and economic dimensions.
environmental considerations 
adverse aquatic environmental impacts occur whenever there will be entrainment or impingement damage as a result of the operation of a specific cooling water intake structure.the critical question is the magnitude of any adverse impact.draft guidance.
various factors may be considered in determining an impact magnitude 
as the draft guidance explains the exact point at which adverse aquatic impact occurs at any given plant site or water body segment is highly speculative and can only be estimated on a basis by considering the species involved,magnitude of the losses,years of intake operation remaining,ability to reduce losses,draft guidance,at.by way of example,that document offers one potential matrix,which factors in resource value and potential impact,then postulates an open system large volume intake in an area of high biological value does not represent best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impact and will generally result in disapproval.exceptions to this may be demonstrated on a basis where,despite high biological value and high cooling flow,involvement of the biota is low or survival of those involved is high,and subsequent reductions of populations is minimal,at.
economic considerations 
as explained above,the chosen technology must reduce impact to the smallest amount,extent,or degree reasonably possible,supra phase i final regulations,italics added.in terms of economic considerations,the epa long ago stated that the application of bta should not impose an impracticable and unbearable economic burden on the operation of any plant subject to section b.at,supra epa initial regulations,italics added.more recently,the court in riverkeeper ii concluded that the epa may permissibly consider cost to determine what technology can be reasonably borne by the industry in formulating rules.riverkeeper ii,supra,at,italics added.
the foregoing environmental and economic factors help guide the agency in making its determination of best technology available for the particular site.with that understanding of section b in mind,we now consider how it was applied in this case.
application of section b 
appellant advances two main arguments concerning the application of section b here.first,it contends,the respondents impermissibly relied on the mitigation plan in determining bta.second,it asserts,the regional board acted with unfettered discretion in concluding that the costs of alternative technologies were wholly disproportionate to their benefits.
the trial court found against appellant on both issues.we review the trial court decision,not that of the agency.fukuda city of angels,supra,cal th at,d.the trial court legal determinations receive a de novo review with consideration being given to the agency interpretations of its own statutes and regulations.city of rancho cucamonga regional water quality control,supra,th at,d.the court factual determinations are reviewed for substantial evidence.ibid.
mitigation 
the court rejected appellant claims concerning the propriety of the environmental mitigation project in the permit on both legal and factual grounds.as a legal matter,the court determined that it was not bound by the decision in riverkeeper i rejecting the use of mitigation measures.see riverkeeper i,supra,at.as the trial court put it,that decision is not controlling here.that case addresses new construction and not the modification of existing facilities such as the plant at issue here.as a factual matter,the court stated,the present record of the board proceedings,viewed in its entirety,does not show that habitat restoration was offered as a substitute for selecting the best technology available.
a.the court legal ruling 
as explained above,under federal decisional law,mitigation does not qualify as a technology for purposes of section b.riverkeeper ii,supra,at riverkeeper i,supra,at.in each of the two riverkeeper cases,the court explicitly construed the statute itself,not merely the regulations at issue.riverkeeper ii,at use of restoration measures contravenes the act clear language as well as its principle riverkeeper i,at restoration measures are plainly inconsistent with the statutory text.in light of this persuasive federal decisional law,we may therefore assume that mitigation does not constitute a technology under section b of the clean water act.
nevertheless,we observe,california law makes mitigation a legitimate factor in certain circumstances.for example,a provision of state water law contained in the act,which governs each new or expanded coastal powerplant,expressly recognizes the availability of mitigation measures as one way to minimize the intake and mortality of all forms of marine life,subd.b.
and under the california environmental quality act,an environmental impact report must include a meaningful discussion of both alternatives and mitigation measures.kings county farm bureau city of hanford d.see pub.resources code.the same is true of the corresponding report issued pursuant to an agency certified regulatory must include alternatives to the proposed project and mitigation measures to minimize significant adverse environmental effects mountain lion foundation fish game,supra,cal th at,d,citing pub.resources code,subd.d a.in this case,as the lead ceqa agency,the energy commission was required to consider mitigation,even if the regional board was not.
in any event,we need not decide here whether section b categorically forecloses the consideration of mitigation measures in lieu of technology.as we now explain,we may affirm the court ruling based on its factual component alone.
b.the court factual determination 
as noted above,after considering the administrative record as a whole,the trial court concluded that the regional board did not use the mitigation plan as a substitute for selecting the best technology available.
that determination finds adequate support in the record.at the administrative hearing,only the monetary aspects of the mitigation plan were at issue.in her introductory remarks at that hearing,agency counsel reminded the regional board that bta is defined as any kind of changes to the cooling water intake structure,including location,design,construction and capacity.and so it about the cooling water structure.she further observed that the mitigation plan was outside the scope of section b.during the hearing,the board chair strictly controlled the admission of evidence on the mitigation plan,admitting evidence about its economic aspects while rejecting information about its ecological features.he issued periodic reminders that the mitigation plan is outside the intake structure issue and is a completely different mechanism from intake technologies.and during deliberations,board members generally limited their discussion of the mitigation plan to its valuation component.the board dealt separately with the alternative technologies for plant cooling 
on this record,we find substantial evidence to support the trial court factual determination that the regional board did not adopt the mitigation plan as an alternative technology for purposes of section b,but instead considered it only for its relevance in monetizing environmental impacts and benefits.
wholly disproportionate test 
as with its mitigation arguments,the trial court cited both legal and factual grounds in rejecting appellant attack on the propriety of the wholly disproportionate test applied by the board in the bta analysis.discussing the legal ground for its ruling,the court stated consideration of the costs of various technologies in individual bta determinations,using what has come to be known as the wholly disproportionate test,is a reasonable reading of section b.as a factual matter,the court observed the board made the determination that the cost of alternatives to cooling would be wholly disproportionate to the benefits achieved.the record contains a basis for that conclusion,and cost was only one of the factors considered by the board in arriving at its conclusion.
a.the court legal ruling 
in the legal component of its ruling,the court determined that a reasonable reading of the statute permits a consideration of whether the costs of a technology are wholly disproportionate to the benefits to be gained.
as explained above,regulatory documents and federal decisional law support a construction of section b that incorporates the wholly disproportionate standard.see,general counsel opinion,seacoast,supra,at.even riverkeeper ii,extensively discussed by appellant at oral argument,indirectly endorses the wholly disproportionate standard,albeit in dicta and in the context of a variance analysis.riverkeeper ii,supra,at,fn.the riverkeeper ii court thus expressed its discomfort with the significantly greater than standard contained in the remanded regulation,given the historical applicability of a wholly disproportionate to standard and the use of the latter standard in the phase i rule.ibid.
we see no reason to reexamine that interpretation here.as we understand it,appellant real quarrel is not with the wholly disproportionate standard per se,but rather with its application here,a point we now explore.
b.the court factual determination 
based on the administrative record before it,the trial court affirmed the regional board determination that the cost of alternative technologies was wholly disproportionate to their benefit.in its bid for reversal,appellant asserts two claims against the agency in this regard that it employed an and impermissible reasonableness standard in assessing costs and that the record does not support the board findings on this point.to determine whether the court erred in affirming the regional board decision here,we first consider the standard governing the agency.we then examine the record for evidence supporting the court approval of the agency wholly disproportionate cost determination.
agency discretion as explained above,the agency exercises its best professional judgment in determining whether to issue an npdes permit in a given case.natural resources defense council epa,supra,at.that standard does not permit the agency to act with unfettered discretion,however.ibid.an agency violates that boundary when,for example,it adopts a procedure that lacks implementation criteria.id.at the epa acted with unfettered discretion where it had no discernible standards for authorizing discharges of toxic pollutants above a previously established limit.
in appellant view,the board merely borrowed the phrase wholly disproportionate and then turned what epa has always viewed as an unbearable or extraordinary cost test into an entirely reasonableness standard with neither content nor limits.appellant complains that agency staff had no particular definition or formula for how to apply its wholly disproportionate test and it argues that the lack of sideboards for staff reasonableness determination created the kind of unfettered discretion that is contrary both to the letter and spirit of the clean water act and that has been expressly rejected by the courts.
in response to appellant arguments,the water boards assert the very nature of best professional judgment dictates that the permitting agency use its best judgment to interpret a standard in the absence of regulatory guidance,and this necessarily requires the use of discretion.furthermore,they observe,the regional board in this case undertook a detailed legal and factual analysis of alternative cooling options and the benefits and drawbacks of each.they contend that the board properly exercised its best professional judgment here.
under a deferential standard such as best professional judgment,the agency enjoys considerable discretion,cal.jockey club cal.racing,supra,cal d at.in this case,we can not agree that the lack of a rigid wholly disproportionate formula means that the board acted without standards.to the contrary,in the absence of uniform regulations,the agency quite properly used its best professional judgment in deciding the complex issues presented by this permit application.it considered such factors as the magnitude of the impact,the degree to which it reasonably could be minimized,and the proportionality of the cost of doing so.
under the circumstances presented here,the trial court did not err in approving the board analysis.judicial review is considerably deferential when the agency decision rests on an evaluation of complex scientific data within the agency technical expertise.riverkeeper ii,supra,at.we therefore reject appellant claim that the agency exercised unfettered discretion here.
evidentiary underpinnings the trial court found that the administrative record supports the board determination that the cost of alternatives to cooling would be wholly disproportionate to the benefits achieved.we assess that judicial finding for substantial evidence.city of rancho cucamonga regional water quality control,supra,th at,d.
disputing the trial court determination,appellant argues that the administrative record lacks evidentiary support for the board finding.in pressing that argument,appellant asserts that the million mitigation fund served as the key metric for respondents valuation of benefits in applying their wholly disproportionate test and that there is not the slimmest reed of foundation for that calculation.in particular,appellant takes issue with the cost determination for habitat equivalency.
respondents disagree.as the water boards point out,the agency had to determine some way to quantify the benefits.the regional board chose the habitat equivalency method,where the larval loss is converted to equivalent habitat acreage and the resulting acreage equivalency is then assigned a monetary value respondents defend the resulting valuation,particularly in light of the conservative assumptions that underpin the calculation 
we agree with the trial court implicit finding that substantial evidence supports the benefit calculation.at the may administrative hearing,during its of raimondi,appellant observed that at acres of restored habitat and million the amount to be funded by duke it comes out to be a little under per acre.when asked whether a study or other analysis in the record supported that figure,raimondi replied those values come directly from the elkhorn slough report.apparently,that reference is to information from the elkhorn slough foundation,which was to administer the mitigation program.the foundation director,mark silberstein,had testified at the regional board september hearing.that testimony was in the record for the may hearing.during his testimony,silberstein identified actual costs that the foundation had paid to acquire local easements and to restore habitat.for example,the foundation had acquired an easement on an upland ranch for approximately per acre.it had purchased easements for restorable wetland at nearby morro cojo slough at a cost of approximately per acre.and the foundation had spent probably dollars an acre to restore acres in the national estuarian research reserve.
in light of this evidence,we reject appellant attack on the evidentiary foundation for the habitat cost determination.appellant does not challenge any other element of the wholly disproportionate cost analysis.therefore,as the trial court properly concluded,the regional board determination must be affirmed.
conclusion 
we find no merit in appellant contentions concerning the interpretation and application of section b of the clean water act.like the trial court,we reject appellant claim of misplaced reliance on the mitigation plan as well as its challenge to how the wholly disproportionate test was applied.we therefore affirm the trial court determinations.
summary of conclusions 
i.the judicial review provisions of the act govern this controversy.for that reason,the superior court had jurisdiction to hear and determine this dispute over the npdes permit.
ii.the trial court march order for administrative remand was procedurally proper,and it was supported by sufficient evidence.
iii.the may administrative hearing was conducted properly.the agency did not err,either in considering new evidence in response to the court remand order or in excluding appellant submittal.
iv.the trial court acted properly in affirming the agency application of section b of the clean water act to the npdes permit at issue in this case.
disposition 
we affirm the trial court june judgment,which denied appellant petition for writ of administrative mandamus.respondants the water boards and real party duke shall have costs on appeal.
the federal law at issue here is commonly known as the clean water act cwa,which is codified at sections.in keeping with the general practice in federal courts,we refer to statutory provisions by their section in the clean water act and provide the parallel citation to the united states code only on first reference or where necessary to avoid confusion.riverkeeper,fn.riverkeeper i.in addition,we refer to clean water act statutory subdivisions in shorthand fashion.we thus refer to the provision that governs,subdivision b as section b.
the npdes permit refers to this proposal as both the environmental enhancement program and the elkhorn slough enhancement program.over the course of the administrative and judicial proceedings,the proposal has been called by that first title,by the corresponding initials eep,and by other names,including the mitigation plan the habitat program the habitat equivalency plan and the habitat enhancement plan or hep.its stated purpose is to increase health and biological productivity of aquatic habitat in the elkhorn slough watershed.in this opinion,we generally refer to it as the mitigation plan.
the court march remand order states this court having determined that finding of regional water quality control board order is not supported by the weight of the evidence in the record,it is ordered that order be,and it hereby is,remanded to the regional water quality control board to conduct a thorough and comprehensive analysis with respect to finding of said order 
code of civil procedure section,subdivision e,provides where the court finds that there is relevant evidence that,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,could not have been produced or that was improperly excluded at the hearing before respondent agency,it may enter judgment as provided in subdivision f remanding the case to be reconsidered in the light of that evidence or,in cases in which the court is authorized by law to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence,the court may admit the evidence at the hearing on the writ without remanding the case.
in its entirety,the regional board order granting duke the challenged npdes permit comprises more than pages.the subject matter of its findings ranges from the regional basin plan and the california ocean plan to thermal discharges,impingement,and entrainment.the compliance provisions set forth as orders in the permit include discharge prohibitions,effluent limitations,receiving water limitations,and other standard provisions none of the permit orders specifically addresses entrainment.
duke prepared an assessment of technology alternatives,designed to address the requirements of section b of the clean water act.the assessment was required by the regional board.duke produced four drafts of this report between september and early april.the final draft is dated april.it is officially entitled moss landing power plant b resource assessment.we refer to it here as duke b report.
applying those four criteria to the closed cycle draft water tower alternatives,raimondi concluded they are available and proven for freshwater they greatly reduce the entrainment of aquatic organisms they present other environmental issues,including saltwater blowdown and visual impacts resulting from their enormous size they cost million more than cooling,with an additional energy requirement of megawatts of power.as for air cooled towers,raimondi opined they are available and proven they eliminate seawater intake entirely and thus eliminate entrainment their feasibility is diminished by such problems as heat exhaust,noise,and the need for additional land the cost would be approximately million for construction and million over years for operation and maintenance,plus megawatts of additional power.
the issues are set forth in the notice as follows.what are the alternatives to cooling for units which of these alternatives are effective to reduce entrainment are there reasons that any of these alternatives may not be feasible c.what are the costs of these alternatives to cooling d.what are the environmental benefits of each alternative is the cost of the alternatives wholly disproportionate to their environmental benefit 
as to those points,daniels letter states while the april letter states in some parts that it is responding to submissions by board staff and duke energy,the overwhelming majority of the letter addresses issues that were not raised by the other parties.thus,the letter is not properly submitted as rebuttal argument or evidence.additionally,most of the letter addresses issues outside the scope of the order of remand by the superior court of monterey county because the purpose and scope of this hearing is to comply with the order of remand,the issues argued in the april letter are outside the scope of the hearing and so are not relevant and may be excluded.
on the question of costs,the memorandum explains that the wholly disproportionate test is a test of incremental cost,which refers to the added expenditure necessary for environmental protection above and beyond the costs of normal operation.for mlpp,some technology must be employed to cool the two new generating units.therefore,the expenditure that mlpp would make to achieve this cooling is not a cost of environmental protection,but a cost of their operations therefore costs for the wholly disproportionate test should be the difference between the cooling technology and the alternatives.in the view of the memorandum authors,analysis of incremental costs was lacking in this case.they state the board was not directed to measure the incremental costs that mlpp would now face given that mlpp has already invested in technology.therefore,the costs have been drastically.on the issue of benefits,the memorandum advises benefits for consideration must also be incremental.in this case,the benefits would be the increase in environmental quality above the case that would result with mlpp choosing technology to achieve their cooling needs only.therefore,the target figure is the total benefit value of environmental protection minus the environmental protection that would be achieved otherwise.as with costs,the authors of the memorandum question the treatment of benefits,saying the benefit calculations provided by duke are clearly lacking.they consider direct use and nonuse values exclusively while only small organisms are directly affected by impingement and entrainment i e,the indirect effects are potentially widespread and of great value.the authors complain that duke assessed only direct impacts on the fish directly entrained in the cooling system without considering associated effects on other biota in the ecosystem.the authors of the memorandum offer a detailed,critical analysis of the habitat equivalency method of benefit valuation used by regional board staff as reflected in the mitigation plan.they opine not only have the benefits been incorrectly calculated,but planned mitigation is technically infeasible.
several factors support this interpretation.for one thing,just two weeks earlier,appellant had expressly declined to submit any testimony at this time.for another thing,the april letter opens by reiterating appellant position that the only proper course of action in this matter is to reopen the existing npdes permit while nonetheless seeking to fully preserve its rights and to assist the board future deliberations with the proffered preliminary comments.moreover,most of the letter content appears under the heading additional matters for consideration in a new permit process,a title that suggests appellant unwillingness to participate in the remand hearing then scheduled.additionally,on the penultimate page of the letter,appellant renews its insistence on reopening the permit,stating in reconsidering all of these issues in a new permit process,voices strongly encourages the board to resist staff and illegal approach given the foregoing,it would be reasonable to conclude that appellant did not intend its april correspondence as a substantive proffer for this proceeding.
those three topics,which appear under the heading additional matters for consideration in a new permit process,are as follows.the clean water act does not allow cost considerations to drive the bta analysis.the board can not selectively evaluate
