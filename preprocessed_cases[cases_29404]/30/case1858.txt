in an action brought in san diego county by the people of the state of california and several public interest groups challenging the certification of an environmental impact report eir for,and the decision approving construction of,a toll road that would traverse portions of both san diego and orange counties,made by the orange transportation corridor agency and its board of directors together the ftca,we are presented with the following issue does code of civil procedure section,subdivision b hereafter section b,which allows suits challenging actions taken by public officials to be filed in the county where some or all of the cause of action arises,apply to cases such as this that seek to vindicate public rights,or,as the ftca contends and the trial court found,only those involving personal rights or property we conclude,after analyzing the text of section b,case law interpreting that statute,and public policy considerations,that this action to vindicate public rights was properly filed in san diego county because section b is not limited to actions involving personal rights or property.we therefore grant the petition for writ of mandate and order that the court set aside its order transferring venue to orange county.
factual and procedural background 
this action,brought by california state parks foundation,endangered habitats league,laguna greenbelt,natural resources defense council,sea and sage audubon society,sierra club,surfrider foundation,the people of the state of california and the state parks and recreation commission collectively,petitioners,challenges the ftca decision to certify an environmental impact report eir for,and approve construction of,a toll road the toll road that would run through both orange county and the northern reaches of san diego county,including san onofre state beach san onofre.petitioners allege san onofre is one of california state parks and includes both a world famous surfing beach named trestles and a campground that provides recreation for over campers per year.according to petitioners,the cristianitos subunit of san onofre provides valuable and rare upland and wetland habitats,including unique habitat for species of animals listed as threatened or endangered under federal laws,including steelhead trout,arroyo toad,california gnatcatcher,least bell vireo,southwestern willow flycatcher,riverside fairy shrimp,san diego fairy shrimp,snowy plover,pacific pocket mouse,and tidewater goby.san onofre also contains nationally recognized historic and archeological sites.petitioners allege that the toll road impacts on the area will be severe,traversing four miles of the cristianitos subunit of san onofre within feet of one of the park campgrounds,which receives over campers a year,removing acres of san onofre park land,and fragmenting the remainder.they allege that if the toll road is built,the campground must be abandoned,as well the entire cristianitos subunit,which represents almost percent of the park land.
petitioners allege that the ftca adoption of the toll road project violates the california environmental quality act ceqa because the eir it adopted failed to fully evaluate impacts to san onofre natural,historic,cultural,visual,and recreational resources consider reasonable alternative routes that would have avoided these impacts consider and adopt appropriate mitigation measures and provide substantial evidence in support of the decision.
in march petitioners filed two separate petitions for writ of mandate petitions against the ftca in the north county division of the superior court of san diego county.the petitions alleged that venue was proper in san diego county as the causes of action arose in part in san diego county because a substantial portion of the toll road lies within the county of san diego,including the entirety of that portion of the toll road that would run through san onofre.many of the significant environmental impacts of the toll road that are the subject of this lawsuit would occur in san diego county,and the toll road would impact state park property interests in san diego county.more specifically,petitioners alleged that while the alleged purpose of the toll road project is to provide traffic benefits to southern orange county,some of the most significant impacts of the project would occur in san diego county to resources that have been set aside for the benefit of all the people of the state.the toll road is described as unprecedented in that it would be the first time in california that an agency comprised entirely of local governments would take designated state park lands for its own highway purposes.
in april the ftca moved to transfer venue of the action to orange county.the ftca argued that venue was not proper in san diego county because the ftca is not located in that county section b did not apply as the petitions did not involve an interference with personal rights or property and section,subdivision a was not applicable because the petitions did not seek to litigate any interest in real property or injury thereto.
petitioners opposed the motion,arguing that venue was proper in san diego county under section b because some part of the cause of action arose in san diego county the ftca is a public officer the ftca approval of the toll road is an a ct d one within the meaning of section b section b is not limited to actions involving an interference with personal rights or property and because the action sought to prevent injury to real property in san diego,it was properly filed in that county.
the court granted the motion to transfer venue,finding that section b did not apply,and the general venue provisions of section did,requiring the action to be filed in the county where one of more of the defendants reside.
this petition for writ of mandate followed.
discussion 
principles of statutory interpretation 
in interpreting a statute where the language is clear,courts must follow its plain meaning.citation.however,if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider various extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme encompassing the statute.citation.in the end,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d,see also harris capital growth investors xiv cal d.
ii.general concepts of venue 
the term venue denotes the particular county within the state where a case is to be heard.citations.which county constitutes the proper venue in a particular case is determined according to the venue et.in applying these statutes to determine the county or counties where venue is proper,the courts generally look to the main relief sought,as determined from the complaint as it stands at the time of the motion for change of venue.citation.generally but with numerous exceptions,when the main relief sought in a case does not relate to rights in real property,the superior court in the county where the defendants or some of them reside at the commencement of the action is the proper court for the trial of the action,subd.a.partnership superior court th,d.
where a defendant has made a proper showing of nonresidence,the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the case comes clearly within one of the statutory exceptions to the general rule that actions are triable in the place of the defendant residence.archer superior court in and for humboldt county d.
iii.analysis 
section b provides an exception to the ordinary venue provisions as to actions against public officers 
subject to the power of the court to transfer actions and proceedings as provided in this title,the county in which the cause,or some part of the cause,arose,is the proper county for the trial of the following actions b against a public officer or person especially appointed to execute the duties of a public officer,for an act done by the officer or person in virtue of the office,or against a person who,by the officer command or in the officer aid,does anything touching the duties of the officer.italics added.
the ftca does not contest that a mandamus action such as this is covered by section b,or that the ftca is a public officer within the meaning of the statute.section b covers writ proceedings against state officials and agencies,mandamus,prohibition or injunction.tharp superior court cal d.
additionally,in this case the cause of action,or part of it,arose in san diego county.the cause of action arises wherever the plaintiff would be injured by the state action complained of a cause arises in the county where the effects of the administrative action are felt,not where the agency signs the challenged order or takes the challenged action.lipari department of motor vehicles th,fn,d.it is where the shaft strikes the plaintiff,not where it is drawn,that counts.citation regents of university of california superior court cal d,regents.the challenged action by the ftca,approving an eir and the toll road project,will,according to the allegations of the petitioners complaint,have a direct and substantial impact on an area of san diego county that it will traverse,most notably where it passes through san onofre 
finally,the ftca concedes for the purpose of this petition that its approval of the eir and toll road project is an act done within the meaning of section b.the petitioners complaint does not allege a failure to act,or threatened future action,but rather an affirmative act taken by the ftca.thus,it falls within the terms of section b.harris alcoholic beverage control appeals bd.d.harris section b at that time section b applies to acts done as distinguished from acts threatened.
thus,a review of the language of section b demonstrates that it applies to this action.there is no language in the statute that,expressly or impliedly,limits its purview to actions seeking to vindicate private,as opposed to public,rights.because the language of the statute is clear,we need not resort to any secondary sources to aid in our interpretation in determining intent,we look first to the words of the statute,giving the language its usual,ordinary meaning.if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what is said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.hunt superior court cal th,d.only when the language of the statute is susceptible to more than one reasonable construction is it appropriate to turn to extrinsic aids to ascertain its meaning.diamond multimedia systems,superior court cal th,d.
despite the clear language of section b,the ftca argues that it does not apply to actions such as this that seek to vindicate public,as opposed to private,rights.in doing so,the ftca relies on cases interpreting section b,that its claims hold that such a limitation on the scope of section b exists.however,t his court is limited to interpreting the statute,and such interpretation must be based on the language used.by the express provisions of section of the code of civil procedure,in the construction of a statute the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein,not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted it is elementary that there can be no intent in a statute not expressed in its words that the intention of the legislature must be determined from the language of the statute.citations.it is a cardinal rule in the construction of statutes that the intent of the legislator should be followed,but this is subject to the imperative and paramount rule that the court can not depart from the meaning of language which is free from ambiguity,although the consequence would be to defeat the object of the act.citations.anderson jameson cal d,anderson,italics added.
thus,we can not add the qualification the ftca proposes,that section b applies only to actions seeking to enforce private rights,based upon language in cases interpreting section b,because the statute language itself contains no such limitation,express or implied.
moreover,as we shall now discuss in detail,case law interpreting section b and its predecessor statute does not support this position,and at most involves imprecise or overly broad language unnecessary to their holdings.in fact,section b has been held applicable to actions seeking to vindicate public rights.further,no action seeking to vindicate public rights has ever been held not to be within section b merely because of the public nature of the action.indeed,the language that the ftca relies upon in several cases that it argues shows an implied limitation in section b to actions involving private rights or property involved a very different issue whether the complaint alleged an affirmative act by a public official,as opposed to a mere omission or threatened future action.
case law interpreting section b 
the ftca contention that section b does not apply to actions seeking to vindicate public rights begins with its reliance on mcmillan richards cal.mcmillan,interpreting the predecessor to section b.in that case,which involved a dispute over ownership of a plot of land in marin county,the plaintiff brought a mandamus action in san francisco,the plaintiff residence,to compel execution of a sheriff deed.the defendant sheriff of marin county,citing the predecessor to section,subdivision of the california civil practice to transfer the action to marin county because it was an action against a public officer,and marin county was the county in which the action arose.mcmillan,supra,cal.at,wl.the plaintiff argued that the statute was inapplicable,stating,this is not an action brought for an act done by the defendant as sheriff,but to compel him to do an act ibid.
the california supreme court agreed,holding the statute only applied to cases that challenged affirmative acts the second subdivision of section nineteenth of the california civil practice act,which provides that actions against a public officer for acts done by him in virtue of his office,shall be tried in the county where the cause or some part thereof arose,applies only to affirmative acts of the officer,by which in the execution of process,or otherwise,he interferes with the property or rights of third persons,and not to mere omissions or neglect of official duty.mcmillan,supra,cal.at,first italics in original.
in support of its position that section b does not apply to actions seeking to vindicate public rights,the ftca points to the language from the foregoing quote that states section b is limited to affirmative acts by a public official whereby he or she interferes with the property or rights of third persons.however,that statement merely gave an example of what constitutes an affirmative act.it did not in any way,express or implied,state a rule that only actions to enforce private rights are covered by section b.indeed,the distinction between public and private rights was not raised by any party to the litigation and was not at issue in the supreme court holding.
the ftca then argues that the mcmillan case involved only public,not private,rights.this contention is unavailing.in mcmillan the plaintiff sought to compel a public officer to execute a deed to private property.thus,the action sought to vindicate purely private rights.
in concluding that the predecessor to section b applied only to affirmative acts,mcmillan relied on two new york cases,construing a virtually identical venue provision,elliot cronk administrators wend.elliot and hopkins haywood wend.hopkins mcmillan,supra,cal.at.elliot was a suit to compel a sheriff estate to pay the plaintiff a money judgment collected by the sheriff and owed to the plaintiff.in holding that the venue provision did not apply to that action,the new york court stated that venue provision applies exclusively to those official affirmative acts of public officers,by which,in the service of process or otherwise,they may interfere with the property or rights of third persons,and thereby become liable to an action.elliot,supra,wend,second italics added.hopkins similarly involved an action to compel a constable to return an execution payment owed to the plaintiff.the court there,citing elliot,also found the venue provision inapplicable,stating this provision we have held to be applicable only to affirmative acts,and not to mere omissions to discharge an official duty.hopkins,supra,wend.
of particular relevance to this case,is a later case decided by new york highest court,interpreting that same venue provision.in people hayes,the new york attorney general filed an action on behalf of the people of that state against road commissioners for alleged statutory violations in laying out a road between two counties,alleging that the road was on a route wholly unsuitable.ibid.the defendants sought to transfer the case to one of the counties through which the road would run.after holding that the road commissioners were public officers for purposes of the venue statute,and concluding that the complaint alleged their wrongdoing at least in part occurred in the other county,the court considered the issue of whether the venue statute applied in a suit by the people.ibid.the court concluded that it did.ibid.
this holding was repeated in a civil case brought on behalf of the people of new york state against the notorious boss tweed.in people tweed,the court,after concluding that there was no distinction under the venue statute between an action brought in the name of the people and one between individuals,held that it applied to cases brought on behalf of the people,those seeking to vindicate public rights.ibid.
these new york cases provide persuasive authority section b applies to actions to seeking to vindicate public rights.interpreting a similar venue provision,and using language later adopted by the california supreme court in mcmillan,the new york courts determined the venue statute did apply to actions seeking to vindicate public rights.
the ftca also relies on bonestell,richardson curry cal,bonestell,wherein the plaintiffs filed suit in san francisco against the secretary of state,an assistant attorney general,and the state printer of the state of california,as well as a san francisco firm to which a contract for the furnishing of paper for use in the state printer office had been awarded by the government defendants in their official capacity.the complaint sought to enjoin further action in regard to or under said contract,upon the ground the contract was illegal and void.the official acts of the government defendants were performed in the county of sacramento.id.at.
the government defendants moved for a change of venue pursuant to section,former subdivision now,subdivision b.bonestell,supra,cal.at.the trial court denied the motion,and,on appeal,the supreme court held the statute was inapplicable.ibid.it expanded on the language in mcmillan,stating that this venue statute contemplates only such affirmative acts of an officer as directly interfere with the personal rights or property of the person complaining,such as wrongful arrest,trespass,conversion.the complaint in the case at bar shows no such case.moreover,the action is not one against public officers for an act done by them,but is an action against them and certain other persons solely to prevent the doing of certain acts by such officers and by the other defendants in the future.id.at,wl 
the broad language of that statement is what the ftca focuses on in arguing that section b applies only to actions enforcing private rights,specifically the reference to personal rights or property.it is unclear where the word personal came from.in making that statement,the court in bonestell cited the above quoted language from mcmillan,which did not contain the word personal.bonestell,supra,cal.at.this indicates perhaps an inexact translation of mcmillan holding.
as one commentator has noted,bonestell only held section b was inapplicable because the suit was not based on acts done,but merely sought to prevent the doing of future acts.witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions.in fact,witkin has interpreted section b as having been narrowly construed to apply only to affirmative acts,not omissions or neglect,and acts done,not contemplated future acts.witkin,supra,citing bonestell,supra,cal.at.witkin recognizes no limitation in section b to actions seeking to enforce private rights.
if bonestell created any new rule,it was that this venue statute not only did not apply to an alleged failure to act,but also to threatened future acts,an issue not present in mcmillan.the court of appeal in cecil superior court in and for los angeles county d,cecil explained the bonestell holding the complaint in the bonestell case,which we have examined,alleged that the defendants had passed a resolution awarding a contract to defendant paper company and were about to enter into a contract and to purchase quantities of paper thereunder.it was these proposed acts which were sought to be enjoined the mere decision that the contract should go to the successful bidder was not an official act which gave rise to the cause of action and the opinion of the court shows that the attack was considered to be one directed against acts about to be done by the defendants.italics added.
to the extent the language of bonestell could be interpreted as stating that actions under section b are limited to those seeking to vindicate private rights,it does not affect our holding.the holding of a decision is limited by the facts of the case being decided,notwithstanding the use of overly broad language by the court in stating the issue before it or its holding or in its reasoning.mcgee superior court d.because the distinction between private and public rights was not at issue,the holding in bonestell is limited to the conclusion that section b does not apply to threatened future actions.
the ftca also cites state commission in lunacy welch cal,a mandamus action to compel the county treasurer to pay a certain amount of money to the state treasurer.again,the action fell outside section b,not because it involved an action seeking to vindicate public rights,but because that section applies only to affirmative acts of the officer,by which,in the execution of process,or otherwise,he interferes with the property or rights of third persons,and not to mere omissions or neglect of official duty.citation.welch,supra,cal.at.while that action involved public rights,as opposed to mere private ones,the california supreme court in no manner indicated that was the basis for denying application of section b.rather,section b was held inapplicable because it challenged an official failure to act,as opposed to an affirmative action.welch,supra,cal.at.
the ftca relies on harris,supra,d,in which the department of alcoholic beverage control department denied an application for an beer license.the applicants appealed to the alcoholic beverage control appeals board appeals board.the department contended the applicants appeal to the appeals board was untimely.the department filed a petition in the superior court for the city and county of san francisco seeking a writ of prohibition against the appeals board,to preclude the appeals board from proceeding with the applicants appeal.the department obtained issuance of a writ of prohibition against the appeals board alone.thereafter,the appeals board unsuccessfully moved for a change of venue to sacramento.id.at.
the court of appeal affirmed the order denying the motion for a change of venue.harris,supra,d at.it held section b is not applicable here.it has been narrowly construed to apply only to affirmative acts which directly interfere with the personal rights or property of the person complaining,to acts done as distinguished from acts threatened.citations.in the present proceeding the department seeks a writ of prohibition to restrain the appeals board from taking further action in connection with the appeal of the applicants,or,from another point of view,seeks a writ of mandate enforcing dismissal of the appeal.considered under either aspect,the proceeding does not fall within section.citation.harris,supra,d at,italics added.thus,again,section b was held inapplicable because that action sought to enjoin a future action,not one already taken.there was no discussion of a distinction between actions seeking to vindicate public versus private rights.
the ftca also cites cecil,supra,d,wherein the director of agriculture issued an order of conditional revocation of a los angeles milk distributor license for alleged violations of law.the distributor brought a mandamus proceeding in los angeles against the director to compel revocation of the order and to enjoin interference with its business under the order.the defendant sought to move venue to sacramento,the place of his residence.the trial court denied the motion,and the court of appeal affirmed.
the ftca focuses on the following language from the cecil decision wherein the court of appeal discussed why that action fell within section b most assuredly arden is prosecuting a cause for redress against interference with its personal rights and property.the director of agriculture has gone into the county of los angeles,has inquired into alleged violations of law by arden,and has issued an order which will put an end to arden business as a distributor of milk by revoking its license,unless such revocation is avoided by the payment of an additional sum for milk produced,as fixed by the findings of the department.or we may say that arden has been assessed some because of the manner in which it has conducted its business in and from the county of los angeles,and if it fails to pay that amount,the right to carry on its business in and from the county of los angeles will be ended by the revocation of its license.we are not considering a mere general order issued by the director of agriculture applicable alike to all milk distributors in the state or to those engaged in certain branches of the industry,but an adjudication relating to particular practices and transactions of a single milk distributor engaged in business in los angeles county and which directly affects its property located in its principal place of business.we think that the act of the director which will thus operate to arden detriment is essentially of the type of acts which the courts have had in mind and which they have described as affirmative acts and those which interfere with the property or rights of third persons.cecil,supra,d at,italics added.
the ftca contends the language of this case should be seen as limiting actions falling under section b to those affecting the personal or property rights of the individual plaintiff,and not those involving the public at large.however,we do not read it so broadly.
first,although the court of appeal in cecil discussed the fact that the plaintiff claim sought redress against interference with its personal rights and property cecil,supra,d at,it in no way held that such rights are required for section b to be applicable.further,in discussing the holdings of mcmillan,bonestell and welch,upon which it relied in holding that the cecil case fell within section b,the court of appeal stated none of the cases has done more than hold that acts which the officer has failed to do or which he will do unless enjoined therefrom are not acts done within the meaning of the section and which provide the substance of the cause of action.cecil,supra,d at.thus,the cecil court acknowledged that the only issue involved in those cases,upon which it relied for its own holding,was whether there had been an affirmative act by the public official.
moreover,to the extent that the court of appeal used language in its discussion that implied that actions seeking redress of public rights would not fall within section b,we again note that t he holding of a decision is limited by the facts of the case being decided,notwithstanding the use of overly broad language by the court in stating the issue before it or its holding or in its reasoning.mcgee superior court,supra,d at.the question of whether actions seeking to redress public rights fall within section b was not at issue in cecil.
the ftca position is undermined further by a california supreme court decision that held that a case seeking the vindication of public rights did fall within the ambit of section b.in regents,supra,cal d,the plaintiff filed an action under the taxpayer standing provisions of section,challenging resolutions adopted by the regents of the university of california prohibiting the hiring of communist party members.the complaint alleged that the resolutions,and the expenditure of tax monies in furtherance of the resolutions,were unconstitutional.regents,supra,cal d at.despite the fact that the claims were public in nature,the high court found section b applicable,and distinguished the bonestell and harris as involving threatened future action,rather than affirmative acts that had already taken place,as occurred in regents.regents,supra,cal d at,fn.if bonestell or harris created or affirmed a rule limiting section b to private actions that issue would have been addressed in regents.in fact,the california supreme court,in reaching its decision,quoted the very language from harris that the ftca argues limits section b application to private claims section applies only to actions involving affirmative acts which directly interfere with the personal rights or property of the person complaining,to acts done as distinguished from acts threatened.citation.regents,supra,cal d at,fn,quoting harris,supra,d at.despite recognition of this language,the high court still held section b applied to an action seeking to vindicate public rights.
the ftca asserts that regents was in reality a private action because angela davis,then a university of california professor threatened with termination under the resolutions,intervened in the action and was vindicating her private right to avoid termination.however,the ftca ignores the fact that the high court in regents expressly held that her complaint in intervention had no impact on the main action for venue purposes that the intervenor complaint in intervention rests,in part,on her contract of employment with the university does not affect the determination of the venue of the principal action.a complaint in intervention does not change the nature of the original suit since the intervenor has chosen to join the taxpayers action,any decision as to the venue for the taxpayers action will also apply to the intervenor.regents,supra,cal d at,fn.the ftca also attempts to characterize that action as a private one by claiming the original taxpayer action itself arose from davis termination.however,this ignores the fact that the plaintiffs in the taxpayer action challenged several resolutions adopted in the,and in september.regents,supra,cal d at.it was only the last one that was directed specifically at davis.ibid.
moreover,taxpayer actions themselves clearly do not seek to vindicate private rights as they do not authorize individual taxpayers to recover money.instead,taxpayer suits provide a general citizen a remedy for controlling illegal government activity.connerly state personnel board th,d.a taxpayer plaintiff need not demonstrate any personal interest in the litigation,and no showing of special damage to the particular taxpayer plaintiff is required.blair pitchess cal d,connerly,supra,th at,d.
the ftca also seeks to characterize regents as a private rights case based upon the county in which the action was filed.that was los angeles county,the county in which rested the campus at which davis taught,and from which she was fired.however,the court discussion of davis in this regard was simply to determine whether,as required by section b,at least some part of the cause of action arose in that county.the high court held that it did because some public funds had been expended in furtherance of the challenged ordinances by commencing the proceedings to terminate davis in los angeles county.regents,supra,cal d at.the court was not determining whether the action was private or public,but only whether there was an affirmative act which resulted in a wrong that was felt,at least in part,in los angeles county.
two other more recent reported decisions also involving public rights have held that section b was applicable.in stoneham rushen d
