in the eastern united states,the average visual range in most national parks and wilderness areas designated as class i federal areas,see a,is less than kilometers,about percent of what it would be under natural conditions.see national research council,protecting visibility in national parks and wilderness areas.in order to address this problem,the environmental protection agency promulgated a regional haze rule,pursuant to section of the clean air act caa.see regional haze regulations and guidelines for best available retrofit technology bart determinations.july,the haze rule.the haze rule requires that under specified circumstances states impose best available retrofit technology bart on any sources.the latter are a specific class of large stationary pollution sources that were put in place between august,and august,and whose operations fall within one or more of specifically listed source categories.at see also.the regulation calls for imposition of bart if the source may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility in any mandatory class i federal area.e ii.the haze rule also permits states to reduce haze by alternate means,including a regional approach,so long as the alternative would be,would improve visibility more rapidly than under bart.e.aspects of the haze rule have been before this court twice before,center for energy and economic development,ceed american corn growers ass,corn growers,and those opinions contain extensive discussions of the rule statutory framework and regulatory history.
this case involves challenges from multiple groups,including the center for energy and economic development and the utility air regulatory group industry petitioners,and the national parks conservation association environmental petitioner.in its brief,epa succinctly summarizes the challenges industry petitioners generally challenge the rule as inappropriately requiring states to apply bart to too many sources,while the environmental petitioner argues that the rule improperly allows states to exempt too many sources from bart.because we believe the haze rule is a reasonable interpretation of caa,we affirm the rule against both sets of challenges.
as we explained in corn growers,a of the clean air act established a national goal of preventing and remedying existing visibility impairment at class i areas,and caa b directs epa to issue regulations requiring that states adopt make reasonable progress towards meeting this national goal.see corn growers,at.
as outlined in b a and implemented by the haze rule,the bart process consists of two steps.first,in the attribution step step i,states must review each source within the state to determine whether any such source emits any air pollutant which may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility in any mandatory class i federal area sources that do so are subject to bart.see e ii.an earlier preamble to the haze rule required states to find that a source is reasonably anticipated to cause or contribute to regional haze if it can be shown that the source emits pollutants within a geographic area from which pollutants can be emitted and transported downwind to a class i area,an approach known as collective contribution.regional haze regulations,july.in corn growers we struck down such guidance as inconsistent with the act provisions giving the states broad authority over bart determinations.at emphasis added.in doing so,however,we did not foreclose the states themselves from deciding to take a collective approach in the attribution step,see id.at garland,dissenting on other grounds,and the current rule identifies collective contribution as only one of at least three different approaches that a state may take in meeting its obligations under caa b a.see.at.under the current haze rule,a state can complete the attribution step by using collective attribution,by demonstrating that,cumulatively,none of its sources contributes to visibility impairment,or by analyzing each source individual contribution.id.states may also use other reasonable approaches for analyzing the visibility impacts of an individual source or group of sources.at.
the second step outlined in b a,the determination step step ii,requires states to determine the particular technology that an individual source subject to bart must install.that determination requires consideration of five factors the cost of compliance,the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of compliance,any existing pollution control technology in use at the source,the remaining useful life of the source,and the degree of improvement in visibility which may reasonably be anticipated to result from the use of such technology.g see also e ii.at.in corn growers,we held that these five factors were meant to be considered together by the states,at,but that epa could not require the states to evaluate the improvement factor collectively while mandating that the other four factors be evaluated separately for each individual source.compare id.at with id.at.
bart is not,however,the sole means by which states can meet their obligations under the clean air act.the haze rule also permits states 
to implement or require participation in an emissions trading program or other alternative measure rather than to require sources subject to bart to install,operate,and maintain bart.such an emissions trading program or other alternative measure must achieve greater reasonable progress than would be achieved through the installation and operation of bart.
e.we affirmed the use of such better than bart approaches in ceed,though we objected to the particular program under review there.see ceed,at.we said nothing about how might be measured.
after our ceed decision,epa introduced the following test to evaluate whether a achieves greater reasonable progress than bart 
if the distribution of emissions is not substantially different than under bart,and the alternative measure results in greater emission reductions,then the alternative measure may be deemed to achieve greater reasonable progress.if the distribution of emissions is significantly different,the state must conduct dispersion modeling the modeling would demonstrate greater reasonable progress if both of the following two criteria are met 
i visibility does not decline in any class i area,and 
ii there is an overall improvement in visibility,determined by comparing the average differences between bart and the alternative over all affected class i areas.
on march,epa issued the clean air interstate rule cair,requiring reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in eastern states and the district of columbia.may,see also.at.cair imposes specified emissions reduction requirements on each affected state,and enables states to meet the requirements by means of programs.at.in conjunction with the introduction of cair,epa amended the haze rule to add a new that a state that opts to participate in the clean air interstate rule trade program need not require affected egus electric generating units to install,operate,and maintain bart.e.see also.noting that the comparison is to be evaluated under the standards enumerated in e.same.
in adopting the current version of e,epa provided analyses demonstrating that cair would achieve greater overall emission reductions than bart,and would make greater reasonable progress according to the visibility test outlined in e,that cair would result in a greater aggregate visibility improvement than bart averaged over all class i areas without reducing visibility at any individual area.see.at see also technical support document for the final clean air interstate rule,march,at cair tsd.in doing so,however,epa also noted that the determination that cair makes greater reasonable progress than bart for egus is not a determination that cair satisfies all reasonable progress requirements in cair affected states a state can not assume that cair will satisfy all of its obligations.at.in particular,despite the rule changes reflecting cair,the epa retained a regulation specifying that states must establish reasonable progress g
