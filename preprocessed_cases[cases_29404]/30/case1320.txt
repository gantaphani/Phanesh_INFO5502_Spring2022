this suit involves appellants,biodiversity associates,challenge to the forest service approval of the hollow timber sale in the black hills national forest.appellants claim that in approving the challenged timber sale the service acted in violation of the black hills national forest plan and in violation of the national forest management act.the district court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,granted judgment in favor of the forest service,and dismissed plaintiffs claims.exercising jurisdiction pursuant to,we affirm,but for different reasons than those stated in the district court.
a.the national forest management act 
recognizing the vital importance of america renewable resources and noting the highly complex issues raised by the management of the national forests,congress enacted the national forest management act of,stat.codified at et nfma.the act stated a c ongressional policy of multiple use sustained yield management,d,and provided for the development and maintenance of land management plans for use on units of the national forest system,b.specifically,nfma requires that land and resource management plans provide for multiple use and sustained yield of the products and services obtained from national forest land and in particular,include coordination of outdoor recreation,range,timber,watershed,wildlife and fish,and wilderness.e 
forest planning 
nfma establishes a process for forest planning.see generally.envtl.coalition dombeck,cir neighbors of cuddy mountain united states forest,cir.for a particular forest entrusted to its management,the forest service is first required to develop a land resource management plan lrmp,or forest plan,to prepare an accompanying environmental impact statement eis,and to facilitate a public review process conducted in accordance with the national environmental policy act nepa,et.see a,b second,the forest service is required to implement the forest plan by approving or disapproving specific projects.projects must be consistent with the governing forest plan and are subject to the procedural requirements of nepa.i resource plans and permits,contracts,and other instruments for the use and occupancy of national forest system lands shall be consistent with the land management plans.e providing that the forest supervisor shall ensure that all outstanding and future permits,contracts,cooperative agreements,and other instruments for occupancy and use of affected lands are consist e nt with the plan.envtl.coalition,at.
timber harvesting 
nfma requires the secretary of agriculture to establish standards to ensure that trees are not harvested until they reach the culmination of mean annual increment of growth cmai.m.cmai is the age at which the rate of growth among a stand of young trees peaks and after which annual growth remains level or declines.cmai is a traditional silvicultural definition designed to maximize the volume yield from a given area.appellees app.at charles wilkinson michael anderson,land and resource planning in the national forests.the cmai standard is subject to statutory exceptions set forth in m as well as other exceptions to be established in accordance with m 
b.the black hills national forest 
in,a lrmp for the black hills national forest was implemented pursuant to the plan provides for the coordinated multiple use of outdoor recreation,range,timber,watershed,wildlife and fish,and wilderness in the management of the black hills national forest,resulting in sustained yields of goods and services for the benefit of the american people.xi pt,record of decision for black hills national forest lrmp at.
the black hills plan contains a number of specific habitat management provisions designed to meet the statutory goal of providing a diversity of plant and animal communities in the national forests.see g a requiring the secretary of agriculture to establish regulations insuring management for provision of wildlife and fish in the national forests g b requiring the secretary of agriculture to establish regulations providing for diversity of plant and animal life in the national forests.among those provisions is a general direction to provide raptor habitat accompanied by a guideline regarding the specific proportions of old growth timber that should be maintained to achieve that provision.the goshawk,a kind of raptor,is designated as a sensitive species as well as a management indicator species for the black hills.a management indicator species is one whose population changes are believed to indicate the effects of management activities.a.
hollow project proposals 
the dispute before us centers on the hollow project area,an area of approximately acres that lies within the black hills national forest.because the hollow project area was failing to meet the desired future condition dfc set forth in the forest plan ii at,in june the ranger district of the black hills national forest issued an environmental assessment ea of the hollow project area.the ea proposed certain vegetative management activities id.at,including the hollow timber sale,which were specifically designed to move toward meeting forest plan goals and objectives id.at.those goals and objectives included increased yield of timber products,habitat diversity,visual diversity,management of fire and insect risks,conservation of soil and water resources,and maintenance of aesthetic values.id.at to.among the activities proposed to meet the dfc of the plan were overstory removal,commercial thinning,commercial timber harvests,patch clearcuts,pine removal from meadows,hardwood release,and precommercial thinning.
the ea set forth four alternative project proposals.aside from the alternative,alternative,the proposals involved some variation of a timber sale.alternative would treat the most acreage alternative would treat the least acreage and maintain more cover for wildlife species and alternative would involve the least amount of road construction.id.at.any of the four proposals,according to the ea,would result in four percent of the hollow project area being designated as old growth.id.at.only two percent of the designated old growth was actually old growth at the time of the ea the rest of the designated old growth stands were in various structural stages.id.at.
the specific environmental effects of each of the proposed alternatives are analyzed in the ea.the raptor management section acknowledges concern s that populations and reproduction of the goshawk are declining in forests and that these declines may be associated with forest changes caused by timber harvesting.however,fire suppression,livestock grazing,drought,and toxic chemicals may be involved.id.at.the analysis then concludes that alternatives and have the lowest habitat potential for goshawks and that alternative provides less mature dense canopy stands,goshawk nesting habitat,than alternative.id.the environmental effects section on silviculture states that the patch clearcut proposals of each of the action alternatives need not meet the requirements of cmai because the clearcuts will be created for other than timber management purposes cfr iii id.at to.the ea also concludes that each of the action alternatives will result in meeting the habitat diversity requirements of the plan.
chapter of the ea sets forth mitigation measures to be used in reducing the potential adverse impacts that may result from implementing the proposed activities.id.at.one of the mitigation measures involves special treatment of goshawk nest sites,although a survey showed no active goshawk nests in the hollow project area.
hollow project approval 
after reviewing the ea of the hollow project area district ranger,frank cross,approved alternative some a decision notice and finding of no significant impact fonsi dated june.before analyzing the four alternatives,cross stated that the proposals were designed to achieve ten goals,including provision of short and sources of wood fiber,management of old growth stands and to meet the plan minimum requirements,enhancement of tree species other than pine to increase vegetative diversity,protection of threatened,endangered,and forest service sensitive plants and animal species,and management of fuels to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire.the approved project,alternative,provides for the cutting of million board feet of sawtimber and cubic feet of products other than logs on acres of land.additionally,the project provides for miles of new road construction and miles of road reconstruction.
procedural background 
in august,several plaintiffs,including appellants,biodiversity associates,administratively appealed the forest service decision approving the hollow project.plaintiffs objected to the decision on the grounds that the hollow timber sale would violate the cmai standard,the approved sale would log the most mature trees of any of the alternatives and would thus destroy the most goshawk and raptor habitat while only designating younger stands as future old growth and therefore future raptor habitat,and the forest service had prematurely painted trees for sale and logging before public comment.in a decision dated september,tom thompson,deputy regional forester,denied plaintiffs appeal.thompson concurred with the appeal reviewing officer conclusion that cross decision did not violate law,regulation or policy.
the instant suit is before us on plaintiffs appeal from the district court march,order denying their request for summary judgment and dismissing their complaint with prejudice specifically,appellants argue that the district court erred in its conclusions regarding raptor habitat and the cmai requirements of m.

appellants first argue that the forest service erred in approving the hollow timber sale despite the undisputed fact that the hollow project area currently fails to meet the raptor habitat provisions of the black hills forest plan.the lynchpin of the argument is that the raptor habitat acreage requirement contained in the forest plan is a mandatory requirement such that allowing the forest service to move the black hills farther away from the raptor standard is contrary to the clear terms of the forest plan.appellants br.at.under the reasoning of the lower court,appellants assert,there is nothing to prevent the forest service from designating saplings as future old growth,and cutting all the mature raptor habitat.id.citing g b and,a appellants state that the black hills must be managed to provide diversity of animal communities.finally,appellants cite i and e for the proposition that the forest service must make all resource management decisions in accordance with the raptor habitat requirement.appellants br.at.
in response,the service argues that the diversity unit in which the hollow project area lies does not currently meet the raptor habitat provision and that the two percent of old growth that does exist will not decline under any of the alternatives proposed in the even the alternative chosen.the service further asserts that the proposed project is the result of an exercise of its particular expertise in determining how to best achieve the requirements of nfma and of the applicable forest plan.ultimately,it argues the project chosen was devised to meet the diversity directions of the hundreds of standards in the black hills plan,including the allegedly competing raptor habitat and standards,neither of which is met in the forest current condition.according to that view,achievement of the raptor habitat standard is necessarily a prospect,given the current state of the black hills,which the hollow timber sale is reasonably designed to meet.appellees br.at.although the service acknowledges that alternative results in less raptor nesting habitat because it retains fewer structural stage stands than alternative,the service asserts alternative is preferable because in the long term it provides for production of more timber,addresses a greater area of the forest,increases visual variety of vegetation,best addresses increased fire danger from catastrophic wildfires,and results in the greatest economic return.
because appellants are correct in asserting that the black hills must be managed to provide for a diversity of animal and plant communities,see,g b,and that the forest service must make management decisions in accordance with the black hills plan,see,i,we must only decide whether the raptor habitat provision is a mandatory,immediately binding,overriding requirement and,if it is not,whether the service approval of alternative was arbitrary and capricious in light of the plan raptor habitat provision the service argues that the provision of raptor habitat is not an overriding requirement which must be met to comply with the forest plan and nfma diversity requirements,given the competing goals and constraints embodied in the forest plan.appellees br.at.our standard of review requires us to give the service interpretations of its own regulations,in this case the provisions of the forest plan,controlling weight unless they are plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation s.stinson united states,d quotation omitted citing cases for the same proposition sierra club martin,cir noting that the forest service interpretation of its forest plan should receive great deference from reviewing courts.see also thomas jefferson shalala,d noting that an agency interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to substantial deference.in order to determine whether the service interpretation of the raptor habitat provision is reasonable,we must examine the structure of the black hills plan.
the record of decision approving the black hills forest plan states that the plan establishes broad direction and does not attempt to anticipate and resolve every problem or conflict which may arise in man a gement of the black hills national forest.xi pt,record of decision for black hills national forest lrmp at.listed as a m ajor feature of the plan is that it identifies the desired condition of the black hills national forest to be achieved in the future.id.at.
the first important chapter of the lrmp for the black hills national forest describes the management situation,including the condition of the forest and the expected future condition after implementation of the plan.id.at.in the section describing the forest future,the plan notes its key feature is its multiple use mix of outputs.no resource output is emphasized to the extent that standards for another resource are violated.id.at.next,the lrmp for the black hills describes its management direction,which is to be used in analyzing proposals by prospective forest users and in implementing the forest plan.id.at.management direction is broken down into forest direction,goals,objectives and management requirements which are generally applicable to the entire forest,and management area direction,management requirements specific to individual areas within the forest.id.the forest direction section consists of goals concise statements describing a desired condition to be achieved sometime in the future id.at,objectives concise,measurable results that respond to the goals id.at,and management requirements the baseline conditions that must be maintained throughout the forest in carrying out th e plan id.at.management requirements are further broken down into three successive categories management activities,general direction statements,and standards and guidelines.management activities are work processes that are conducted to produce,enhance,or maintain levels of outputs,or to achieve administrative and environmental quality objectives.id.general direction statements specify the actions,measures,or treatments to be done when implementing the management activity or the condition expected to exist after the general direction is implemented.id.finally,standards and guidelines are quantifications of the acceptable limits within which the general direction is implemented.id.
found within the plan management baseline conditions that must be maintained throughout the forest in carrying out th e plan is the raptor habitat acreage provision at issue in this case.to implement the general direction to p rovide raptor habitat,a quantitative standard instructs the service to p rovide acres of old growth timber per acres in acre blocks.id.at.
although we find the structure of the black hills plan far from lucid or,we can not conclude the service unreasonably interpreted the plan when it determined that the raptor habitat acreage provision is not overriding.as an initial matter,the language of the plan itself is it indicates a desire to achieve raptor habitat through provision of a specific quantity of old growth forest.the word provide can be reasonably interpreted as meaning to provide what does not currently exist.along the same lines,the relevant management activity is not only to maintain current habitat but to improve overall necessarily goal.
the service argument that it is required to balance the many standards set forth in the plan is not inconsistent with the structure and the language of the plan itself,nor is it,as appellants assert in their reply brief,a construction by lawyers.appellants reply br.at.first,the plan expressly states that its key feature is its multiple use mix of outputs.no resource output is emphasized to the extent that standards for another resource are violated.an integrated mix of resource outputs is provided rather than a single function emphasis that maximizes some outputs to the exclusion of others.xi pt.at.second,in the fonsi approving the hollow timber sale,ranger cross explicitly based his approval of modified alternative on its provision of the best balance between the issues identified during the scoping process,one of those issues being the provision of adequate raptor habitat,old growth forest.ii at.although the service attempt to paint the and raptor habitat provisions as competing appears to be post hoc and,more offensively,a gratuitous attempt to liken this case to sierra club united states forest service,our review of the fonsi shows the service in fact chose alternative because it concluded that alternative better addressed a number of management issues,including the habitat requirements of the forest plan.specifically,the fonsi states alternative was superior because it provides higher timber yield than alternatives,and,it thins and treats fuels on more acres than other alternatives,thereby reducing the destructive potential of future forest fires,it more completely me ets the objectives of providing wood fiber production than the other alternatives,it results in more structural variety of ponderosa pine stands,it treats more acres and increases the visual variety of the vegetation,and it would result in the greatest economic return of all action alternatives.ii at to.notably,the service also identified alternative potential drawbacks in the analysis for instance,the fact that the chosen alternative calls for construction of additional roads and would result in slightly more impacts than alternatives and with regard to the plan standards for soil,water,and riparian habitat.id.at.the fonsi additionally notes that alternative favors wildlife species which prefer early successional stages over wildlife species which prefer mature,old growth forests but highlights the accompanying increase in the variety of vegetation types and ages across the project.id.at.
in sum,we conclude the service interpretation of the raptor acreage habitat provision as not immediately binding and overriding is reasonable.moreover,our review of the forest plan and of the fonsi do not lead us to conclude that the service acted arbitrarily or capriciously when it adopted alternative even though that alternative admittedly favors animal species that prefer earlier successional stages of forest.the fonsi shows the service actively and explicitly balanced,on the record,the provisions of the forest plan and chose alternative because,in the service expert assessment,it best balanced the many issues identified in the scoping process and best met the and diversity requirements of the forest plan.although we may well have reached a different conclusion if faced with the decision regarding raptor habitat in the first instance,our standard of review does not allow us to substitute our judgment for that of the agency where,as here,the agency decision was based on a consideration of relevant factors,does not involve a clear error of judgment,and is accompanied by an explanation that comports with the evidence in the record.overton park,at friends of the bow,at.
appellants second argument in this appeal involves the interpretation and application of m,which provides for the establishment of standards to ensure cmai and for exceptions to those standards.we review an agency construction of a statute which it administers under the familiar chevron analysis.first,we ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter because we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
