since,the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla,et,has set forth the procedures for administrative approval of offshore oil drilling on the outer continental shelf.in this case,six native alaskans and the environmental organization greenpeace,seek review of the secretary of the interior approval of the development and production plan dpp for the northstar oil and gas development project,located off the north coast of alaska in the beaufort sea.petitioners edwardsen challenge both the adequacy of the final environmental impact statement eis under the national environmental policy act nepa,et,and the compliance of the oil discharge prevention and contingency plan spill response plan with the requirements of a of the oil pollution act of opa,codified at j.we have jurisdiction to review the nepa claims.we lack jurisdiction,however,to review the spill response plan,because it was approved in a separate agency action and opa vests review of such plans in the district court.see n.
background 
bp exploration alaska,bpxa seeks to produce oil from northstar,an oil and gas reservoir that extends from two to eight miles off the north coast of alaska in the beaufort sea.it is a harsh environment the average annual temperature is eleven degrees fahrenheit,and ice covers coastal areas of the sea for at least nine months each year.
undeterred by the severe climate conditions,a number of animal species make their home in the beaufort sea and on its shores.these include caribou and the endangered bowhead whale.for over years,the area has also been home to the inupiat eskimo,whose traditional subsistence lifestyle includes the hunting of caribou and bowhead whales.
beneath the beaufort sea,the northstar reservoir contains an estimated million barrels of oil reserves.the state and federal governments sold leases to this field in.the federal leases account for about twenty percent of the reserves,and state leases make up the remainder.exploration began in.
bpxa acquired the rights of the original lessees in and applied for federal,state,and local approval to begin producing oil from the northstar reservoir.bpxa proposes to reconstruct and expand seal island,an artificial gravel island located near the center of the northstar reservoir on state submerged lands.bpxa plans to drill oil and gas production wells,gas injection wells,and waste disposal wells from seal island.some wells are to be in the federal portions of the reservoir.a pipeline,buried beneath the sea floor,will carry oil from seal island to the shore.a second pipeline,submerged in the same trench as the oil pipeline,will carry natural gas to seal island for use as fuel.on shore,the oil pipeline will run for eleven miles above ground to a connection with the pipeline.the pipeline will transport northstar oil to valdez,alaska.from there,tankers will carry the oil to ports in the western and abroad.production from the project is expected to last fifteen years.
bpxa applied to the army corps of engineers the corps for permits under section of the clean water act,and section of the rivers and harbors appropriation act of,and to the minerals management service of the department of the interior mms for approval of the dpp under ocsla.
in,the corps determined that the issuance of a permit would constitute a major federal action that would require the preparation of an eis.the mms and the environmental protection agency epa followed suit in.a single eis was prepared by the corps,as lead federal agency,in conjunction with the mms,the fish and wildlife service,national marine fisheries service,and the epa,with the assistance of a contractor funded by bpxa.in july,the mms adopted the eis for use in its decision.two months later,the mms approved the dpp,in accordance with the recommendation of the state of alaska.
in october,the petitioners sought review of the mms approval of the dpp in this court.petitioner greenpeace,is an international environmental organization.the individual petitioners are inupiat eskimos who maintain that the approval of northstar threatens their ability to continue hunting,fishing,and gathering traditional subsistence resources.
discussion 
nepa claims 
ocsla,as amended in,identifies four distinct stages in the development of an offshore oil well on the outer continental shelf.see secretary of the interior california,d.the four stages are formulation of a five year leasing plan by the department of the interior lease sales exploration by the lessees development and production.id.at.the final and at issue here.
before commencing development and production,the lessee must submit a development and production plan to the department of the interior for approval.see a.the required scope and contents of the dpp are defined by c and.the secretary must forward the dpp to the governor of any affected state and,upon request,to any affected local government.a.the secretary is required to accept the recommendations of the governor upon determining that they provide for a reasonable balance between the national interest and the of the citizens of the affected state.c.the secretary action to approve,require modification of,or disapprove a dpp is subject to judicial review only in the united states court of appeals for the circuit in which the affected state is located.c.
edwardsen contends that in approving the dpp,the secretary,acting through the mms,erred by relying upon an environmental impact statement eis that did not comply with the requirements of the national environmental policy act nepa,et.nepa requires federal agencies proposing major federal actions that may significantly affect the quality of the human environment to prepare a detailed eis.see c.nepa does not expressly provide for judicial review.see daniel mandelker,nepa law and litigation ed.because the alleged nepa violation arises under ocsla,which provides for exclusive jurisdiction in the court of appeals,we have original jurisdiction over the nepa claim.see parks and conservation ass faa,cir exercising original jurisdiction over alleged nepa violations under the statutory review provision of the faa act.

direct and indirect effects 
nepa requires an eis to address 
i the environmental impact of the proposed action,
ii any adverse environmental effects which can not be avoided should the proposal be implemented,
iii alternatives to the proposed action,
iv the relationship between local uses of man environment and the maintenance and enhancement of productivity,and 
v any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.
c i v.impacts and effects include direct and indirect effects.see.direct effects are those that the proposed action causes and that occur at the same time and place as the action.a.indirect effects are caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in distance,but are still reasonably foreseeable.b.
edwardsen argues that the eis contains an inadequate analysis of direct and indirect effects because it does not include a oil spill trajectory analysis.the ocsla regulations the mms promulgated that relate to the eis do not require a lessee to conduct a analysis of the trajectory of spilled oil in determining the environmental impacts.edwardsen directs us to an mms regulation that requires a n appropriate trajectory analysis specific to the area in which the facility is located.b.that regulation,however,specifies the contents of the scenario required in a spill response plan,rather than an eis.moreover,an eis need not include a scenario.see robertson methow valley citizens council,d.see also mandelker,nepa law and litigation at.
edwardsen faults the mms for failing to collect new data from the specific site of northstar in determining the direct and indirect effects of an oil spill.the mms used data from the oil spill risk analysis conducted for lease sale,a federal sale in the beaufort sea that occurred on august.lease sale encompasses an area that includes a portion of northstar.the mms used data from lease sale to calculate the probabilities that oil spilled from northstar would reach land and segments.the mms concluded in the eis that the data from lease sale presents a valid estimate of oil movement and resource areas likely to be contacted.model input data such as winds and currents incorporated into the mms model is consistent with information that would be used in a northstar model.
the mms explained that the use of data from lease sale in fact approximated a estimate of the environmental impact of an oil spill 
seal island lies close to the center of the two ocs leases use of modeling data for an oil spill originating in these lease areas provides a worst case estimate of the maximum areal extent of oil movement and resource areas likely to be contacted.an oil spill originating from the pipeline inside the barrier islands near shore would not be exposed to the stronger currents present near seal island and,therefore,would not spread as far away from the point of spill.
in using the data from lease sale,the mms made a reasoned judgment that the data was relevant and yielded a useful analysis of the extent to which spilled oil would spread under the least favorable conditions.
edwardsen points out that the fish and wildlife service fws objected to the absence of a analysis in the eis.the fact that the fws would have preferred a analysis is not sufficient,however,to require a conclusion that the mms acted unreasonably or in contravention of nepa by using the lease sale data.we hold that the mms took the required hard look in the eis at the direct and indirect effects of northstar.see okanogan highlands alliance,at.
cumulative impacts 
the nepa regulations do not explicitly require an eis to include a discussion of cumulative impacts.see mandelker,nepa law and litigation,at.the requirement arises from a regulation directing agencies to consider cumulative impacts in determining the scope of an eis.see c.the cumulative impact of a project is 
the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.
edwardsen argues that the eis contains an inadequate analysis of cumulative impacts.he first contends that the eis fails to comply with the methodology set forth in the council on environmental quality guidance on the matter of cumulative impacts.the handbook that edwardsen cites does not,however,constitute legally binding agency guidance.indeed,the preface to the handbook contains the following statement 
the handbook does not establish new requirements for cumulative effects analyses.it is not and should not be viewed as formal ceq guidance on this matter,nor are the recommendations in the handbook intended to be legally binding.
council on environmental quality,considering cumulative effects under the national environmental policy act iii,available at http.
the proper question is therefore whether the eis analysis of consideration of cumulative impacts complies with nepa and the nepa regulations.edwardsen highlights five areas in which,he contends,the eis is deficient in its analysis of cumulative impacts freshwater,gravel,air quality,vegetation,and subsistence.
freshwater 
millions of gallons of freshwater will be used to build ice roads for northstar.edwardsen argues that the eis inadequately examines the cumulative impacts of this use of freshwater.
the eis includes a section entitled,would freshwater withdrawals for ice road construction affect lake levels or water quality in this section,the eis estimates the volume of freshwater required for ice road construction.edwardsen makes three challenges to the eis estimate of the volume of freshwater withdrawals.first,he argues that the eis cumulative effects analysis does not take into account the total amount of freshwater required for road construction.a table contained in chapter of the eis estimates that from million to million gallons of freshwater would be required for the construction of ice roads,and million to million gallons of freshwater would be required for ice road operations to connect west dock to seal island.the table concludes that each action would have a m inor impact on lake water levels and water quality,since each quantity represents fifteen percent or less of the permitted usage from kuparuk deadarm mine site,the likely source of freshwater.in chapter,the eis concludes that the impact to water levels of the withdrawal of to million gallons of freshwater would be minor.in chapter,the eis reiterates the estimated usage of to million gallons and concludes,based on the small amount of drawdown and screened intakes to prevent entrainment of fish,no impacts to freshwater fish are expected.these statements do not,however,account for the million to million gallons of freshwater expected to be used for ice road operations.
edwardsen correctly points out that the eis assessment of the impact of freshwater use appears to have overlooked the million to million gallons required to connect west dock to seal island.we are not persuaded,however,that such omission is material.the eis conclusion that the impact to water levels will be minor remains supported by the record.the correct amount of total annual freshwater drawdowns,million to million gallons,is comfortably below the million gallons that alaska permits to be removed each year from the kuparuk deadarm mine site,the most likely source of freshwater for ice road construction.in addition,the eis also notes the availability of several other permitted sources in the project area.any freshwater removed is replenished each year during spring breakup.
edwardsen also faults the eis for analyzing the projected northstar drawdowns of freshwater in isolation,without considering drawdowns of freshwater for other ice roads.the relevant cumulative effects analysis of the eis reads as follows 
extraction of freshwater for use in the construction of ice roads to support onshore and offshore oil and gas activities would increase as new actions are developed.water withdrawal from authorized water sources,rivers occurs during the winter in accordance with permit restrictions on water volume.because freshwater is replenished during the spring and summer months,the cumulative effect on lake water quality due to increased freshwater use for road construction would be negligible.
although the eis could have explained existing drawdowns of freshwater or the absence of any such drawdowns,there is no evidence in the record to suggest that there are any other drawdowns of freshwater from the likely sources of freshwater for northstar.in the absence of any such evidence,we can not say that the failure to consider other drawdowns renders this eis inadequate.
edwardsen next contends that the eis inadequately describes the effect of water withdrawals on birds and vegetation.in light of the eis conclusion that the withdrawals would have a minimal effect on water levels,the absence of any further discussion is reasonable.in the eis,the mms concludes that the impact of freshwater removal on water levels,salinity and alkalinity of the water,and water quality will be negligible.we conclude that the mms analysis was reasonably thorough.see cuddy mountain,at.
the reconstruction of seal island will require to cubic yards of gravel.edwardsen contends that the eis analysis of the impacts of this extraction of gravel is weak and that it is flawed by the absence of an evaluation of past or ongoing gravel extraction impacts.
