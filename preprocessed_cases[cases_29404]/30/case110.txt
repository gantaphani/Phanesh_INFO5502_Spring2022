this controversy,now approaching its tenth anniversary,arises out of the frustration experienced by,john and susan baker,in applying for a permit to build a pier on clark island in plymouth harbor,massachusetts.the purpose of the pier was to enable equipment to be unloaded onto the island to support plaintiffs agricultural pursuits,which included a tree farm.the presence of a nesting site for sea birds on plaintiffs property,and the possible impact of future agricultural activity on it,aroused the concern of,eight massachusetts officials and employees of environmental regulatory bodies.the eighth defendant is jane mead,director of the massachusetts office of coastal zone management 
by delaying the pier permit,defendants are alleged,pursuant to,to have infringed plaintiffs due process and equal protection rights count i and their first amendment rights by retaliating against them for their exercise of free speech count vii the district court dismissed count i for failure to state a claim,see baker coxe,and granted summary judgment to defendants on count vii,see,d.after perusing a tower of volumes of depositions and exhibits,we conclude,as did the district court,that appellants have not demonstrated interference with constitutional rights,but have merely asserted righteous indignation at the zealous actions of government officials.
factual background 
we report in suitably labeled groupings the essential relevant facts.
the land involved.the bakers have owned land on clark island since.since,they have administered a forestry trust in order to operate a tree farm.on this site is a major nesting area,or heronry,for several varieties of sea birds,including herons and egrets.at one time,the northern end of clark island was reported to be among the largest breeding grounds for waterfowl in the state of massachusetts.the bakers had given the manomet bird observatory access to the island to conduct studies of the birds.
the acec issue.in april,a bill was considered for presentation to the massachusetts legislature that would have classified certain tracts of land,including the bakers property,as an area of critical environmental concern acec.if so classified,that land would have been subject to use restrictions and presumably a diminution in value.realizing that his land would be subject to such a law,baker telephoned a state senator and mentioned that he opposed it.when the bakers learned that the manomet bird observatory supported the acec bill,they revoked the permission that had been granted to enter their land.the acec bill did not progress beyond the drafting stage and was never presented to the legislature.
the pier application.two years later in may,the bakers applied to the army corps of engineers for a permit to build a pier in order to receive farming equipment for use in connection with their tree farm.the corps was prepared to issue a permit when,in september,jay copeland,an environmental reviewer for natural heritage,received notice from the corps of the pending application.
natural heritage interest.copeland and his assistant,huckery,felt that the nesting area was close enough to the tree farm operations,which would have been aided by the pier,to disrupt the heronry and cause the birds to abandon their nests.copeland requested that the permit not be issued until he investigated the pier possible impact.the corps obliged and initiated proceedings on september.
contact with parsons.copeland consulted his superior,the director of natural heritage,thomas french,who had visited the heronry five years earlier with katharine parsons,an ornithologist who had conducted her doctoral research on clark island.french advised copeland to gather more information from parsons.parsons told copeland that in she had learned that someone had used a bush hog mower to clear brush and shrubbery on heronry grounds,destroying many unfledged birds and nests.she also mentioned bakers opposition to the acec legislation and speculated that the tree farm was not a serious effort but rather a tax dodge.copeland included these remarks in his notes.not only had copeland taken no position on the acec issue,but there was no evidence that any other defendant had.
visit to the island.on october,copeland visited the heronry with representatives from the environmental protection agency,the fish and wildlife service and the army corps of engineers,along with the bakers project manager,and blodget,the state ornithologist.they found the heronry essentially destroyed,observing large piles of recently cut brush,abandoned nests,and protective vegetation coarsely mowed or bush hogged.but ornithologist blodget was of the opinion that,granted an opportunity to,the heronry would revive.so copeland felt that further review was needed and he sought support from parsons.
parsons letter.two days later,on october,she wrote a letter at copeland behest to underscore the importance of the heronry.noting her credentials and prior research at the heronry site,parsons asserted in the letter that the present owners had clearly diminished and perhaps decimated the usefulness of the heronry.copeland circulated this letter to other agencies to try to get support for obtaining an environmental review of the pier permit.
contacts with agencies.at about this time,several contacts were made with other agencies.copeland inquired of the massachusetts department of revenue about the tax status of the tree farm and sought to discover other ways in which the bakers could still qualify for tax concessions.in his subsequent letter to the corps of engineers opposing the pier permit,copeland indicated two possibilities granting a conservation easement and seeking tax relief for allowing the land to revert to its natural state.french and huckery contacted the department of environmental management to see if the tree farm was being operated in compliance with the forestry permit an inspection later proclaimed the farm in full compliance.blodget asked christopher dowd,an investigator with the fish and wildlife service,to determine whether the destruction of the heronry in violated the migratory bird treaty act,mbta,and if so,to ascertain who was responsible.after some investigation,dowd concluded that the information was too stale to justify further action.
natural heritage files opposition.on november,natural heritage sent a letter to the corps opposing the pier permit application on the ground that the pier would facilitate activity,which was likely to contribute significantly to the destruction of a major natural resource.both the environmental protection agency and the fish and wildlife service sent similar letters.
plaintiffs sue parsons.shortly after this,baker sued parsons,claiming that her october letter was defamatory.eventually,this suit was dismissed as contravening a law proscribing strategic litigation against public participation slapp.see baker parsons,dismissing suit pursuant to.laws ch,h,the statute.
issuance of the eir.the massachusetts environmental policy act.laws ch,mepa,requires review of all projects larger than a certain size.although the size of the pier project did not mandate it,environmental review could still be had under a fail safe provision of mepa,if requested by the secretary of eoea,by two state agencies,or by ten citizens.see.in this case,after failing to persuade the secretary or another agency,natural heritage did succeed,in october,in garnering ten citizens to request review.the bakers accordingly filed an environmental notification form on june.on august,eoea issued a decision requiring the bakers to take the next step by filing an environmental impact report eir,a comprehensive planning document that required an evaluation of the environmental impact on the heronry not only of the proposed pier,but also the associated forestry practices.
lawsuit challenging the eir.the bakers brought suit against eoea in massachusetts superior court,challenging the breadth of the eir.that court,through judge cratsley,limited the eir to how the pier will affect the public interest in the tidelands across which the pier will be built,and the public interest in wetlands and resources.bak
