native ecosystems council and the ecology center collectively referred to as nec appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to the united states forest service forest service on nec claims in connection with the forest service approval of the north elkhorns vegetation treatment project elkhorn project or proposed project.the elkhorn project is a wildlife improvement project involving a timber sale within the helena national forest and the elkhorn wildlife management unit elkhorn wildlife unit,the only wildlife management unit in the national forest system.nec contends that the forest service approval of the elkhorn project was arbitrary and capricious,in violation of the national forest management act nfma,et,the national environmental policy act nepa,et,and the administrative procedure act apa,because the project violates the big game standards of the helena national forest plan hnf plan.nec also argues that the forest service approval of the elkhorn project is arbitrary and capricious because the project will threaten the viability of the northern goshawk.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we reverse and remand.
the helena national forest comprises acres of montana and includes a broad expanse of the elkhorn mountains.the helena national forest is managed in accord with the hnf plan,adopted pursuant to nfma in among other requirements,the hnf plan contains standards relating to the security of big game species such as elk,including the requirement that each elk herd have at least percent hiding cover.the hnf plan elk hiding cover standard is central to nec claims,and we examine it in detail in section ii.
the elkhorn mountains are also the home of the only designated wildlife management unit in our national forest system,the elkhorn wildlife unit.in,congress directed the forest service to evaluate acres of helena and deerlodge national forests for designation as a wilderness area.wilderness act of,stat.prompted by the presence of valuable wildlife resources,and the predominance of public concern for wildlife values in the area,the forest service instead recommended the establishment of a special management unit with a management direction emphasizing wildlife.the subsequently created elkhorn wildlife unit encompasses areas of both the helena and deerlodge national forests in montana,including the area of the proposed project.the elkhorn wildlife unit has its own standards,with which any projects must comply and which have been incorporated into the hnf plan.relevant to this appeal,the forest service is only to consider land management activities in the elkhorn wildlife unit when they are compatible with management direction for wildlife.the elkhorn wildlife unit is also generally unsuitable for timber management,because the land is proposed for use that precludes timber harvest on the programmed basis.
in,the forest service proposed an amendment to the helena and deerlodge national forest plans called the elkhorn forest plan amendment,seeking to alter the direction of the elkhorn wildlife unit from its wildlife emphasis to a more general ecosystem management.the district court upheld a challenge by environmental groups,concluding that the plan amendment was significant and that the forest service had violated nepa by not preparing an environmental impact statement eis for the proposed amendment am.wildlands forest,no.cv,dist.lexis,at.the forest service thereafter abandoned the elkhorn forest plan amendment.however,the forest service was not precluded by the district court decision from pursuing future projects within the elkhorn wildlife unit,so long as any proposed projects were consistent with the hnf plan,nfma,and nepa.
the forest service proposed the elkhorn project in.after completing an environmental impact statement eis and record of decision rod in,the forest supervisor chose alternative,the harvesting of acres within a area of forest in the northwest corner of the elkhorn wildlife unit because the elkhorn wildlife unit is classified under the hnf plan as unsuitable for timber harvest,the elkhorn project is not a timber sale per se,it is a wildlife habitat improvement project that will involve a timber sale commercial thinning as the tool to achieve part of the desired condition.the forest supervisor concluded that such land can be logged under nfma for the purpose of meeting other objectives if the forest plan establishes that such actions are appropriate.citing.the project stated purpose is to improve wildlife habitat through the rejuvenat ion of the winter range forage base for species such as deer,elk,and moose,and the creation of a sustainable forest structure that would eventually provide more suitable habitat for other wildlife species.the proposed project would create a broad swath of open forest approximately miles long and to mile wide,reconstruct a road,and construct a loop trail.
the eis concluded that the project complied with the hnf plan big game requirements.specifically,the eis concluded that the project would leave the affected elk herd,the sheep creek elk herd,with percent hiding cover,above the percent hiding cover minimum required by the hnf plan 
after the forest service published the elkhorn project eis and rod,nec filed an administrative appeal,which was denied.nec then filed suit in the united states district court for the district of montana,arguing that the forest service approval of the elkhorn project violated nepa,nfma,and the apa.
the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted the forest service motion,concluding that the agency analysis of the proposed project impacts was sufficient to meet the requirements of nfma and nepa as well as the requirements of the hnf plan.the district court noted that the forest service had altered the acreage denominator of its elk hiding cover analysis from previous hiding cover analyses,which had concluded that the sheep creek elk herd was generally below the hiding cover minimum as calculated over the herd entire range.the forest service change to the calculation methodology consequently boosted the percentage of cover present after the project to within the range allowable under the hnf plan.the district court called the forest service change convenient,or even suspicious,but concluded that its appropriateness is not something this court can determine.this timely appeal followed.
nec argues that the elkhorn project does not comply with the hnf plan big game hiding cover requirements and therefore does not comply with nfma.see i.nec also argues that the elkhorn project eis is deficient under nepa because it used an incorrect hiding cover calculation to reach the conclusion that the project complied with the hnf plan.

the eis describes the hiding cover standard as not a very meaningful measure of the forest service duty to provide for elk security in the helena national forest and elkhorn wildlife unit.it is that the forest service failure to comply with the provisions of a forest plan is a violation of nfma.as nfma makes plain,r esource plans,permits,contracts,and other instruments for the use and occupancy of national forest system lands shall be consistent with the land management plans.i see also neighbors of cuddy mountain alexander,cir specific projects,such as the timber sale,must be analyzed by the forest service and the analysis must show that each project is consistent with the plan.neighbors of cuddy mountain forest,cir holding that the forest service was not in compliance with nfma where its project was inconsistent with the forest plan of the entire forest friends of southeast future,at i plainly imposes a legal obligation on the forest service to ensure that timber sales are consistent with the relevant forest plan.
our scope of review does not include attempting to discern which,if any,of a forest plan requirements the agency thinks are relevant or meaningful.if the forest service thinks any provision of the hnf plan is no longer relevant,the agency should propose amendments to the hnf plan altering its standards,in a process complying with nepa and nfma,rather than discount its importance in environmental compliance documents.
the administrative record shows that there are acres of potential hiding cover in the acre sheep creek elk herd unit or drainage,and that the proposed project would subtract acres,leaving acres of hiding cover.nec does not dispute these figures.rather,nec takes issue with the forest service calculation denominator the area over which the agency determined the hiding cover percentage.the question is whether we can reasonably discern from the record that the forest service complied with the hnf plan big game minimum hiding cover standard,hnf plan big game standard,and thereby complied with nfma.motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.holding that courts must uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency path may reasonably be discerned quoting bowman,freight,d.
we are unable to determine from the record that the agency is complying with the forest plan standard.the hnf plan hiding cover standard can be read to require the hiding cover percentage be calculated over the entire elk herd unit or drainage,or only over the summer range portion of that elk herd unit however,the elkhorn project eis and rod did not calculate hiding cover over either the eis does not include a hiding cover calculation for the sheep creek elk herd entire range or drainage,nor does the eis include a mathematical determination of the sheep creek herd summer range from which to calculate the hiding cover percentage.instead,the eis relied on the fact that about acres of the sheep creek elk herd unit are within the helena national forest and estimated that the sheep creek elk herd summer range was,as the forest service said in its briefing,roughly equivalent to the hnf forest boundary.this acre denominator was the baseline from which the agency reached its conclusion that the project complied with the forest plan standard.in addition,the eis measured hiding cover within the helena national forest area that corresponds to the acre denominator,but not whether any hiding cover existed in the area inhabited by the sheep creek herd beyond the boundary of the helena national forest.
an agency position that is contrary to the clear language of a forest plan is not entitled to deference.friends of southeast future,at.here,the forest service hiding cover calculations considered only the section of the sheep creek elk herd range within the boundaries of the helena national forest and not the parts of the elk herd range located on private or other,public lands.the agency interpretation is inconsistent with the language of the forest plan 
an environmental analysis for project work will include a cover analysis.the cover analysis should be done on a drainage or elk herd unit basis.subject to hydrologic and other resource constraints,elk summer range will be maintained at percent or greater hiding cover in drainages or elk herd units.
emphasis added.the hiding cover standard does not allow the forest service to exclude private and other public lands within the sheep creek elk herd range from its hiding cover calculation perimeters,as the agency did in the elkhorn project eis.
in neighbors of cuddy mountain forest service,the forest plan of the payette national forest required the forest service to show that any approved projects would leave old growth forest within each affected pileated woodpecker home range.at.the forest service concluded that the approved project would meet the forest plan standard by calculating the minimum percentage using the area of the proposed timber sale rather than the woodpecker range.id.we reversed the district court grant of summary judgment to the forest service,holding that,inter alia,the agency did not demonstrate that the project would be consistent with the payette lrmp,and thus it failed to comply with the nfma.id.at.as in neighbors of cuddy mountain forest service,in the eis in this case,the forest service used an incorrect denominator in attempting to comply with the forest plan standard,calculating the sheep creek elk herd hiding cover over only the sections of the sheep creek elk herd within the helena national forest boundaries,rather than calculating the percentage over the sheep creek elk herd drainage or elk herd unit.the eis thus did not ensure that the elkhorn project would comply with the hnf plan and failed to comply with nfma.
under nfma,the forest service calculations need not be perfect.forest guardians,at.however,we must still be able reasonably to ascertain from the record that the forest service is in compliance with the hnf plan standard.sec chenery.if the administrative action is to be tested by the basis upon which it purports to rest,that basis must be set forth with such clarity as to be understandable.it will not do for a court to be compelled to guess at the theory underlying the agency action nor can a court be expected to chisel that which must be precise from what the agency has left vague and indecisive.in this case,we can not tell from the administrative record whether or not the forest service complied with the hiding cover standard.the f
