pursuant to the clean air act,the environmental protection agency epa regulates emissions of particles known as particulate matter.in order to meet statutory and regulatory requirements,california submitted a state implementation plan sip to the epa for its approval.the sip contains,among many other things,limits on motor vehicle emissions for the years and.although the epa overall approval process of the sip is still underway,the agency has made a preliminary finding that the sip limits on motor vehicle emissions for years and are adequate for purposes of the state transportation plans and projects.the epa adequacy determination allows california to approve transportation plans and projects that otherwise could not proceed.pursuant to b,several environmental groups filed this petition for review.petitioners assert that the epa adequacy determination was arbitrary,capricious,or otherwise contrary to law.we deny the petition.
factual and procedural history 
air quality standards and state implementation plans 
the general statutory background concerning air quality standards and sips is common to many cases 
the clean air act,act,establishes a comprehensive program for controlling and improving the united states air quality through state and federal regulation.the act requires the epa to establish national ambient air quality standards naaqs for air pollutants that the epa determines may reasonably be expected to endanger public health or welfare.
the states are responsible for ensuring that their air quality meets the naaqs.id.a.the states are divided into air quality control regions,and each region is designated as being either in attainment or nonattainment,or as unclassifiable with respect to each of the naaqs.id.d.the attainment deadlines and control measures applicable within each region vary,depending on the pollutant and the severity of the region pollution problem.see id.
under the act,a state must develop a sip that provides for the attainment,maintenance,and enforcement of the naaqs in each region within the state.id.a.section sets forth the general requirements for all sips,which include enforceable emission limitations and other control measures to meet the requirements of the act enforcement programs and assurances that the state has adequate personnel,funding,and authority to carry out the sip.every sip or sip revision must be adopted by the state after reasonable notice and hearing,and each must be submitted to the epa for approval.id.a.the epa may fully approve,partially approve and partially disapprove,conditionally approve,or fully disapprove a sip.id.k.
latino issues forum epa,cir.
for areas designated nonattainment,the act requires that a sip meet certain specifications.c.relevant here,the sip must provide for attainment of the naaqs by the attainment deadline,id.c,and it also must provide,in the interim years,for reasonable further progress toward the goal of attainment.id.c.the term reasonable further progress means such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by this part or may reasonably be required by the administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable naaqs by the applicable date.id.
in the part of the sip known as the control strategy implementation plan revision,the state must describe specific strategies for controlling the emissions of and reducing ambient levels of pollutants in order to satisfy statutory requirements for demonstrations of reasonable further progress and attainment.additionally,the state must allocate allowable emissions for each year between motor vehicles and all other sources,factories and power plants.id.the state budget of emissions from motor vehicles for a given year is known as the motor vehicle emissions budget.id.motor vehicle emissions budget is that portion of the total allowable emissions defined in the submitted or approved control strategy implementation plan revision or maintenance plan for a certain date for the purpose of meeting reasonable further progress milestones or demonstrating attainment or maintenance of the naaqs id.
regulation of particulate matter 
particulate matter is the generic term for a broad class of chemically and physically diverse substances that exist as discrete particles liquid droplets or solids over a wide range of sizes.national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter,july,naaqs rule.the epa regulates particulate matter as an air pollutant for purposes of the clean air act.id.the epa originally regulated all particulate matter as a single class.id.at.in,the epa created a subclass of particulate matter all particles with a diameter equal to or less than micrometers,referred to as pm.id.
in,spurred by extensive scientific research into the deleterious effects of very small particles,the epa added to the list of regulated air pollutants a new subset of particulate matter those particles with a diameter equal to or less than micrometers,referred to as pm.id.at.in,the epa imposed more stringent air quality requirements by decreasing the acceptable level of pm,naaqs rule.
the epa has promulgated regulations describing the requirements for sips concerning pm.the epa designated as the default baseline emission inventory year to be used for attainment planning purposes.id.b.the epa also specified requirements concerning a nonattainment area plan for reasonable further progress.id.for certain sips,including the one at issue here,the sip must demonstrat e that reasonable further progress will be achieved for the and emissions years,known as milestone years.id.c.the rfp plan must demonstrate that in each applicable milestone year,emissions will be at a level consistent with generally linear progress in reducing emissions between the base year and the attainment year.id.d.the rule details the specific calculations that correspond to a decrease in emissions from the emissions level in the base year to the target emissions level in the attainment year.id.f.
transportation projects and transportation plans 
the clean air act requires that all federally funded transportation projects and transportation plans conform to the applicable sip.c.section c provides 
conformity to an implementation plan means 
a conformity to an implementation plan purpose of eliminating or reducing the severity and number of violations of the national ambient air quality standards and achieving expeditious attainment of such standards and 
b that such activities will not 
i cause or contribute to any new violation of any standard in any area 
ii increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of any standard in any area or 
iii delay timely attainment of any standard or any required interim emission reductions or other milestones in any area.
those statutory requirements apply as soon as the state submits its sip to the epa for approval and continue to apply after epa approval.id.the epa has an affirmative responsibility to ensure conformity.id.those requirements mean,among other things,that a transportation project or plan can not cause the applicable motor vehicle emissions budget to be exceeded.a.
although perhaps not obvious at first glance,the epa affirmative responsibility to ensure that transportation projects do not,for instance,delay timely attainment,c,puts the epa in a difficult situation logistically.the epa approval process of a sip,including the epa final determination whether the state proposed motor vehicle emissions budget will meet the requirements of the clean air act,can take a long time.but the statute requires that the epa determine conformity for transportation purposes as soon as the state submits its sip.id.without approved motor vehicle emissions budgets,however,state transportation agencies can not determine whether transportation projects or plans will meet the statutory conformity requirements.id.
the epa attempted to resolve this tension by promulgating the conformity rule,codified at.transportation conformity rule amendments flexibility and streamlining.the epa decided that,once a state submits a sip,the agency will conduct a cursory review of the submitted motor vehicle emissions budgets within a short time frame.id.at.if the submitted budgets meet six specified minimum criteria,the epa will deem the budgets adequate for transportation conformity purposes.e.
once the epa deems a motor vehicle emissions budget adequate,transportation projects and plans can proceed in accordance with that budget,even though the epa has not given and may never give final approval to either the budget or the sip.the epa notice in the federal register made clear that the adequacy determination is independent of the epa final approval or disapproval of the sip thus,the epa may later disapprove a budget that the epa previously had found adequate.see.at see also sierra club epa,cir there are two,discrete epa actions relevant to this case epa action finding the motor vehicle emissions budget to be adequate for transportation conformity purposes,pursuant to e and epa approval of the sip,effected by notice and comment rulemaking.epa has consistently recognized that these separate actions are different from each other.footnote and some citations omitted.the epa explains in its brief to this court that,a bsent such a process,transportation projects would,in many instances,soon come to a standstill while the region sip submittal was being reviewed.
not long after the epa promulgated the conformity rule,an environmental petitioner successfully challenged certain aspects of the adequacy review process in the district of columbia circuit envtl.def.fund epa.importantly,however,the petitioner did not challenge the basic mechanism of this review process the epa can determine that a budget is adequate for transportation conformity purposes before the epa makes a final determination to approve or disapprove a sip or a budget.
the epa revised the conformity rule to its present form in,july.the epa stated that the final rule addresses only the procedures for making adequacy findings for submitted sips in accordance with the court decision.the final rule does not change the criteria listed in e of the rule for determining the adequacy of submitted sips,as the court did not address this provision in its decision.at.
again,environmental petitioners sought review of the conformity rule in the district of columbia circuit.envtl.def.epa.this time,the court held that,because the petitioners challenged only provisions that the epa originally promulgated in and did not challenge the modifications,the petitioners arguments were.id.at.in other words,the time had expired to challenge the epa overall process for making adequacy determinations.so long as the epa conforms to its own regulations and does not change its interpretation of its regulations,the courts must not disturb the agency action.id.at.
south coast air basin nonattainment status 
one of the air quality control regions in california is the south coast air basin,comprising orange county and portions of los angeles,riverside,and san bernardino counties.romoland sch.dist.inland empire energy,llc,cir.in,the epa designated the south coast air basin as nonattainment with respect to pm.air quality designations and classifications for fine particles.the relevant dates for the south coast air basin with respect to pm are as follows the base year is,the milestone years are and,and the attainment year is 
in,the california air resources board,which is the state agency entrusted with preparing the sip,submitted an implementation plan to the epa for approval.that sip contained,among other things,two sets of motor vehicle emissions budgets for pm.one set,labeled baseline budgets,contained budgets for the two milestone years only,and did not contain a budget for the attainment year.the baseline budgets reflected the anticipated emissions given the restrictions on motor vehicles.the second set,labeled budgets,contained budgets for the two milestone years and for the attainment year.the budgets reflected more stringent emissions restrictions,in anticipation of future legislative and other uncompleted action.
petitioners submitted extensive comments to the epa in opposition to the proposed budgets.among other things,petitioners submitted scientific data and analyses demonstrating that levels of pm are much higher in close proximity to highways.petitioners argued that,accordingly,the south coast air basin could not achieve attainment without additional measures.petitioners concluded that the alleged failure to demonstrate attainment was fatal to all of the motor vehicle emissions budgets,for both the milestone years and the attainment year.
by letter to the california air resources board and subsequent publication in the federal register,the epa found that the budgets were not adequate for transportation conformity purposes because those budgets depended on measures that have yet to be implemented.the epa also found,however,that the baseline budgets were adequate for transportation conformity purposes.
as a result of the agency adequacy finding,transportation agencies must use these baseline budgets in future transportation conformity determinations.the epa explained the baseline motor vehicle emissions budgets reflect emissions reductions from rules that were adopted as of october but,in contrast to the budgets,do not include new,not yet implemented emissions reductions from the state strategy as reflected in the south coast sip.
the epa provided a detailed analysis of why its findings complied with the six regulatory minimum criteria found at e.relevant here,the fourth criterion states that the epa can find a budget adequate only if the budget is consistent with applicable requirements for reasonable further progress,attainment,or maintenance whichever is relevant to the given implementation plan submission.id.e iv.the epa explained that the baseline budgets were adequate for transportation purposes because those budgets are consistent with the requirement to demonstrate reasonable further progress.the budget,however,was not adequate for transportation purposes because the epa could not determine that the budget is consistent with the requirement to demonstrate attainment.
petitioners timely filed this petition for review pursuant to b.they challenge the epa adequacy determination with respect to the baseline budgets 
standards of review 
title b confers jurisdiction over petitions for review challenging many different types of agency actions,including an adequacy determination such as the one at issue here.the statute provides a standard of review for some types of agency actions covered by subsection b grant of jurisdiction,id.d,but the statute is silent on the standard of review for other types of agency actions,including the one before us.the supreme court has held that,in situations like this one,the courts of appeals must proceed pursuant to the administrative procedure act general standard of review for agency actions.a.vigil leavitt,cir citing alaska dep t of envtl.conservation epa.thus,we may set aside the challenged agency action only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
discussion 
petitioners challenge the epa final agency determination that the baseline budgets were adequate for transportation conformity purposes.our jurisdiction is limited to deciding whether that decision was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise contrary to law.a see also b describing the extent of jurisdiction envtl,at discussing the limits of jurisdiction under b.this limitation is important because,at many times in petitioners briefs,they appear to be challenging other,earlier actions by the epa.
for instance,petitioners appear,at times,to argue that the placement of air quality monitors is erroneous because none of those monitors is in close proximity to a highway.but as the government correctly points out,the placement of monitors was the subject of earlier rulemaking and,therefore,can not be challenged in this action.in their reply brief,petitioners properly concede that they are not challenging monitor placement.similarly,petitioners can not now challenge the substance of the applicable rules concerning conformity.those rules were promulgated in earlier years,and the day window for filing petitions for review long ago closed.envtl,at.in other words,petitioners are limited to challenging the epa application of those rules to california submitted motor vehicle emissions budgets.we turn,then,to that issue.
petitioners argue that the epa failed to consider a relevant factor attainment when it made its adequacy determination concerning the budgets.the epa concedes that it did not consider petitioners attainment data for purposes of the budgets but argues that nothing requires it to do so.therefore,the parties dispute boils down to whether the epa must consider attainment data when conducting its adequacy review of a budget for a milestone year.
that issue is properly before us.generally,we must set aside an agency action where it failed to consider mandatory factors set forth by statute or in a regulation.cerrillo perez ins,cir see also nrdc epa,cir an agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto.ins,u.this issue falls within the jurisdictional scope of b because it questions whether the epa final agency action its adequacy finding properly applied the law to the facts at hand.
petitioners argue that the clean air act and the epa implementing regulations,coupled with court cases interpreting those sources of law,require the epa to consider attainment data when determining the adequacy of budgets.before turning to those sources of law,it is helpful to describe the parties positions on how they contend this area of the law works.
the epa asserts that,for a milestone year,a budget need only demonstrate reasonable further progress toward the ultimate goal of attainment.because a milestone year occurs before the attainment year,it is not necessary to demonstrate that the state has implemented sufficient measures to reach attainment by the eventual attainment year.for purposes of demonstrating reasonable further progress,it suffices that the state demonstrate that it will have reduced emissions to a level consistent with generally linear progress toward the target emissions level by the attainment date.in order to calculate emissions levels for a milestone year consistent with reasonable further progress,the only information related to attainment needed by the epa is the total target emissions as of the attainment date.once the epa has calculated the total target emissions for the attainment year,a linear calculation easily provides the target emissions for the milestone years.no other data concerning attainment are necessary or relevant.
in petitioners view,the epa has the cart before the horse.according to petitioners,it makes little sense to find that,even though the state can not demonstrate how it will achieve the ultimate goal of attainment,the epa nevertheless can determine the adequacy of the state incremental steps toward achieving that ultimate goal.petitioners make much of the epa admission that,in order to determine reasonable further progress,it must calculate the target emissions level.petitioners appear to argue that it is unreasonable to approve the target emissions level,even for purposes of adequacy review,if the epa concedes that the state can not reach that target emissions level through the proposed measures.
once the state has demonstrated its ability to achieve attainment at least for purposes of adequacy review,then and only then can the state reasonably the intermediate emissions levels.the ultimate goal,after all,is attainment of the naaqs.reasonable further progress is an extra requirement to which some states must adhere.the epa approval,for adequacy purposes,of budgets without a demonstration that the state can achieve attainment,permits the state to effect an around the clear requirement of the clean air act to achieve attainment.
both the epa view and petitioners view are reasonable in the abstract.there is nothing illogical about the epa view that,although it will not approve an budget where the state has not implemented enough measures,it nevertheless will use the target emissions level to calculate emissions levels.additionally,there is nothing illogical about the epa approval,for adequacy purposes,of the budgets corresponding to those intermediate years if the budgets independently meet the statutory and regulatory requirements.
at the same time,petitioners view that the reasonable further progress goals should not be approved for adequacy or other purposes until the state has demonstrated that it will achieve attainment also makes sense.after all,attainment is the goal,and approval of goals has the practical effect of allowing transportation projects to proceed before the state has demonstrated that it will achieve attainment.
although both views are reasonable in the abstract,the pertinent question is what choices congress and the epa made when they,respectively,enacted the clean air act and promulgated implementing regulations.on that question,petitioners argue that both the conformity rule and the pm implementation rules required the epa to consider attainment when making its adequacy determinations.in these circumstances,the deference owed to the agency can not be understated 
we must give substantial deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulations.our task is not to decide which among several competing interpretations best serves the regulatory purpose.rather,the agency interpretation must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.in other words,we must defer to the agency interpretation unless an alternative reading is compelled by the regulation plain language or by other indications of the agency intent at the time of the regulation promulgation.this broad deference is all the more warranted when,as here,the regulation concerns a complex and highly technical regulatory program,in which the identification and classification of relevant criteria necessarily require significant expertise and entail the exercise of judgment grounded in policy concerns.

conformity rule 
petitioners first argue that the epa action violated the conformity rule,originally promulgated in,e.in particular,petitioners challenge the epa finding concerning the fourth of the six criteria 
epa will not find a motor vehicle emissions budget in a submitted control strategy implementation plan revision or maintenance plan to be adequate for transportation conformity purposes unless the following minimum criteria are satisfied 
iv the motor vehicle emissions budget s,when considered together with all other emissions sources,is consistent with applicable requirements for reasonable further progress,attainment,or maintenance whichever is relevant to the given implementation plan submission.
id.quoting only portions of the conformity rule,petitioners argue that the rule requires that the budgets be consistent with attainment.id.but petitioners repeated quotation of only part of the rule is misleading.the full text of the rule flatly contradicts their reading.a budget must be consistent with applicable requirements for reasonable further progress,attainment,or maintenance whichever is relevant to the given implementation plan submission.id.emphases added.the meaning of the rule is clear for budgets concerning milestone years,reasonable further progress requirements are relevant for budgets concerning the attainment year,attainment requirements are relevant and for budgets concerning maintenance years,maintenance requirements are relevant.because the approved budgets at issue concern milestone years only,the only relevant requirements are reasonable further progress requirements attainment requirements are not relevant.
