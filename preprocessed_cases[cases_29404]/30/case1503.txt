this is an appeal by the secretary of the interior and intervenor national mining association nma from a judgment of the district court.the district court held that the secretary interpretation of the surface mining control and reclamation act smcra section,to exclude subsidence from the definition of surface coal mining operations regulated under section e of the act,e,was contrary to the law and therefore invalid.because we find that congress did not speak unambiguously on this precise issue in the smcra and because we find the secretary interpretation to be reasonable,we defer to the secretary and reverse the district court.
background 
a.the litigation 
this case began with citizens coal council ccc challenge to the secretary of the interior final rulemaking action by which she promulgated the regulation contained in.the challenged regulation is an interpretive rule,based on sections and e of the smcra,et.the regulation states 
interpretive rule related to subsidence due to underground coal mining in areas designated by act of congress.osm has adopted the following interpretation of rules promulgated in part.
a interpretation of where mining is prohibited or limited.subsidence due to underground coal mining is not included in the definition of surface coal mining operations under section of the act and of this chapter and therefore is not prohibited in areas protected under section e of the act.
ccc sought review of this rulemaking in district court,after exhausting its administrative remedies.it claimed that the secretary interpretation of the cited provisions of the smcra was contrary to the clear law,and therefore,unworthy of any deference by the courts.as a remedy,ccc requested that the court vacate the regulation and instruct the secretary to impose instead,a regulation stating that subsidence was included within definition.the district court granted ccc motion for summary judgment holding that congress has expressed its intent clearly on the precise point at issue here and that the secretary interpretation of and e is contrary to law.citizens coal council norton,d.the district court then remanded the regulation to the secretary without instruction.
ccc filed a notice of appeal on april,and intervenor nma filed its notice the following day.on june,the district court granted the appellant motion to stay the remand order,but vacated the regulation and stayed its judgment pending appeal.see citizens coal council babbitt,june.on june,the secretary filed a notice of appeal of both rulings.in the present case,the secretary and nma appeal the district court ruling that the regulation was invalid and its subsequent vacation of the regulation,and ccc appeals the district court refusal to grant the full relief it requested.
b.the statutory scheme 
we recognize from the outset that the smcra is a complex and often puzzling statute,in many cases raising a variety of questions as to its correct interpretation.smcra was enacted in an effort by congress to both protect society and the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations and to assure that the coal supply essential to the nation energy requirements,and to its economic and social is provided and strike a balance between protection of the environment and agricultural activity and the nation need for coal as an essential source of energy.a,f.as the district court recognized and the parties do not dispute,the focus of the regulation in smcra was primarily on the surface mining techniques,such as,and one of its goals was to encourage the development and application of underground mining technologies as an alternative less likely to disturb lands used for other activities.see citizens coal,d at citing,k.
to this purpose,smcra section e prohibits surface coal mining operations with certain exceptions,in a number of protected areas,particularly within the boundaries of the national parks system,national forests,and public parks and historic sites.in addition,these operations are also prohibited within feet of the outside line of any public road within feet from any occupied dwelling,unless waived by the owner thereof and within feet of any public building,school,church,community,or institutional building,public park,or within feet of a cemetery.e.
smcra section defines surface coal mining operations as follows 
a activities conducted on the surface of lands in connection with a surface coal mine or subject to the requirements of section of this title surface operations and surface impacts incident to an underground coal mine,the products of which enter commerce or the operations of which directly or indirectly affect interstate commerce.such activities include excavation for the purpose of obtaining coal including such common methods as contour,strip,auger,mountaintop removal,box cut,open pit,and area mining,the uses of explosives and blasting,and in situ distillation or retorting,leaching or other chemical or physical processing,and the cleaning,concentrating,or other processing or preparation,loading of coal for interstate commerce at or near the mine site and 
b the areas upon which such activities occur or where such activities disturb the natural land surface.such areas shall also include any adjacent land the use of which is incidental to any such activities,all lands affected by the construction of new roads or the improvement or use of existing roads to gain access to the site of such activities and for haulage,and excavations,workings,impoundments,dams,ventilation shafts,entryways,refuse banks,dumps,stockpiles,overburden piles,spoil banks,culm banks,tailings,holes or depressions,repair areas,storage areas,processing areas,shipping areas and other areas which are sited structures,facilities,or other property or materials on the surface,resulting from or incident to such activities.
smcra section a requires the secretary to promulgate rules and regulations directed toward the surface effects of underground coal mining operations embodying the requirements of section b,but instructs the secretary,in adopting such rules,to consider the distinct difference between surface coal mining and underground coal mining.a.the permit requirement of section b mentions subsidence specifically,in contrast to sections and.
b permit requirements 
each permit issued under any approved state or federal program pursuant to this chapter and relating to underground coal mining shall require the operator to 
adopt measures consistent with known technology in order to prevent subsidence causing material damage to the extent technologically and economically feasible,maximize mine stability,and maintain the value and reasonably foreseeable use of such surface lands,except in those instances where the mining technology used requires planned subsidence in a predictable and controlled manner provided,that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the standard method of room and pillar mining 
b.section c extends the secretary authority to regulate underground coal mining if it creates a danger to inhabitants.
c suspension of underground coal mining operations in urbanized areas 
in order to protect the stability of the land,the regulatory authority shall suspend underground coal mining under urbanized areas,cities,towns,and communities and adjacent to industrial or commercial buildings,major impoundments,or permanent streams if he finds imminent danger to inhabitants of the urbanized areas,cities,towns,and communities.
c.section d extends the subchapter to cover surface operations and surface impacts incident to underground coal mining operations.
the provisions of this subchapter relating to state and federal programs,permits,bonds,inspections and enforcement,public review,and administrative and judicial review shall be applicable to surface operations and surface impacts incident to an underground coal mine with such modifications to the permit application requirements,permit approval or denial procedures,and bond requirements as are necessary to accommodate the distinct difference between surface and underground coal mining.
