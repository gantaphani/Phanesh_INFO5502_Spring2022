national parks conservation association,and the sierra club appeal from the district court orders dismissing with prejudice their action against the tennessee valley authority brought under the citizen suit provision of the clean air act,a.national parks and the sierra club claim that tva violated the act in connection with work it performed in on a boiler at its power plant in colbert county,alabama.national parks and the sierra club assert three claims against tva the district court denied their motion for partial summary judgment and granted tva motion to dismiss two of the claims as barred by the statute of limitations and the remaining claim for failure to provide proper notice.we affirm.
the tennessee valley authority is a federal agency that operates over forty electricity generating facilities,including the colbert plant in tuscumbia,alabama.the colbert plant uses five boiler units to generate electricity.the process involves burning coal to create steam and passing the steam through a turbine,which drives a generator that produces electricity.national parks and the sierra club claim that the colbert plant operations emit harmful quantities of pollutants,specifically nitrogen oxide,particulate matter,and sulfur dioxide.although not the subject of this suit,they have similar complaints about tva operations at several other power plants located throughout tennessee,alabama,and kentucky.
the allegations in this lawsuit are limited to only one of the colbert plant boilers,unit.colbert unit has been in operation since.in a project that began in and was completed in,tva overhauled unit to restore its lost capacity,extend its life,and reduce or eliminate forced outages.the project cost over million and took three years from planning to implementation.at all relevant times,tva has operated unit under an operating permit issued by the alabama department of environmental management pursuant to its state implementation plan the permit prescribes emission limitations,and the department monitors and tests the unit emissions to ensure compliance.tva did not obtain construction permits before undertaking the project,however,and national parks and the sierra club claim that this omission,among others,violates the clean air act.
the goal of the clean air act is to protect and enhance the quality of the nation air resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population.b.to achieve this goal,the act employs a program of cooperative federalism under which the epa develops national ambient air quality standards for various pollutants.sierra club united states epa,cir.each state then formulates a state implementation plan,which limits emissions for specific sources of pollution and which must be approved by the epa,to attain and maintain those standards.see also.the act differentiates between existing sources of pollution and new sources,and these two types of sources are regulated differently.new york united states epa.thus,tva obligations with respect to the project and its subsequent operation of unit depend on how unit is classified under the act.
new sources of pollution include both newly built units and plants as well as existing ones that have been modified in a way that increases their emissions,according to the definitions set forth in the act and epa regulations.see,a.unlike existing sources,new sources and modified sources are subject to the new source performance standards,part,which impose stringent emission limitations and other requirements such as monitoring and testing.new sources and modified sources also are subject to new source review which requires the proponent of a proposed construction or modification to complete various requirements before the project can proceed,such as obtain construction permits and determine emission controls to be installed in the source.see a.valley auth.whitman,cir.the new source performance standards and new source review programs are implemented through state implementation plans.see new york epa,at.
existing sources,in contrast,are plants,units,and other sources that were built before the epa proposed otherwise applicable standards.a.while they are subject to several sets of regulations including state implementation plans,they have grandfathered status and are not subject to new source review or the new source performance standards.new york epa,at.this system is intended to achieve environmental controls without unduly hampering economic growth.id.
in,the epa charged tva with modifying several of its units in violation of the new source review programs colbert unit was among these units.the epa found tva guilty in administrative proceedings and ordered it to come into compliance with the act,but this court refused to enforce the order after concluding that the administrative proceedings were unconstitutional.whitman,at.the epa has not pursued prosecution of tva for these alleged violations.
after the epa action failed,national parks and the sierra club sent tva notice of their intent to sue for clean air act violations at the colbert plant and nine other power plants located throughout tennessee,alabama,and kentucky.various suits were filed against tva under the act citizen suit provision,a.two of these were filed in the district court below,the present suit and a separate a suit filed by the sierra club and the alabama environmental council.that separate suit alleged that tva operations at the colbert plant repeatedly violated the opacity limitation,an emission limitation for particulate air pollution established by alabama state implementation plan,during the period from to.sierra club.valley,cir.the district court granted summary judgment to tva,holding that there could be no violations because,although the plant emissions exceeded the opacity limitation,they were within the forgiveness zone of the alabama department of environmental management de minimis rule.id.at.this court reversed in part,reasoning that the de minimis rule had not been approved by the epa and thus was not part of alabama state implementation plan.id.at.we affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs claim for civil penalties as barred by tva sovereign immunity but remanded for reconsideration of whether the plaintiffs were entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief for claims arising from the plant violations of the opacity limitation.id.at.
meanwhile,the instant suit was pending in the district court.national parks and the sierra club allege three counts,all relating to the project and subsequent operation of colbert unit.the first two counts allege that tva modified unit in violation of the new source review programs by failing to obtain construction permits,failing to perform air quality analysis and install emission controls,failing to obtain offsets,and operating the unit as illegally modified.the third count alleges that the unit pollutant emissions after the modification exceeded epa limitations and failed to comply with other requirements of the new source performance standards.national parks and the sierra club seek civil penalties and declaratory and injunctive relief on all counts.they do not dispute that colbert unit at all relevant times had an operating permit issued by the alabama department of environmental management,which monitored compliance as required by alabama state implementation plan for existing sources.to be viable,all three counts require the project to be characterized as a major modification,triggering the epa new source review preconstruction permitting requirements and the emission limitations established by the new source performance standards described above.tva contends that the project was not a major modification and,in any event,would fall under the exception for routine maintenance,repair,and replacement.
without deciding this issue,the district court made a series of rulings against national parks and the sierra club,each of which they now challenge on appeal.first,the district court denied national parks and the sierra club motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether the project involving colbert unit was a modification,reasoning that the parties dispute several factual issues including how to measure the changes in emissions and whether the work was routine maintenance and repair according to industry standards.next,the district court granted in part tva motion for partial summary judgment on the two new source review counts.the court held that the claims for civil penalties were barred on statute of limitations grounds,where the suit was filed in,well over five years after the work on unit took place the alleged violations of preconstruction requirements were not continuing violations and the concurrent remedy doctrine barred the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief.in a third order,the district court granted tva motion to dismiss national parks and the sierra club new source performance standards claim for failure to comply with the notice requirements of b.the court held that the plaintiffs notice letter lacked specificity where it broadly alleged nearly years worth of daily violations of nearly all of the potentially applicable regulations,when in fact the new source performance standards violations ultimately alleged in the complaint were confined to one pollutant.
after these rulings,the action remained in the district court awaiting consolidation with sierra club tennessee valley authority,which was on appeal from the district court to this court.after this court handed down its decision in sierra club,however,the parties agreed that no issues were left for the district court to resolve in this case.accordingly,the court dismissed the entire action.the court observed that,even if the plaintiffs could not obtain relief based on the project on colbert unit in this suit,sierra club established that the colbert plant operations violate the clean air act because of the opacity limitation,and,while tva is immune to civil penalties,declaratory and injunctive relief might be available for any viable claims.this appeal followed.
we review de novo the district court orders granting tva motions to dismiss and for summary judgment,upholding them if there are no genuine issues of material fact and if tva is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.sierra club,at see also.c.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving parties,national parks and the sierra club.pub.interest research group citizen lobby,epa,cir.thus,we assume without deciding that the project involving colbert unit was a modification that triggered the new source review program requirements and the new source performance standards.see parks conservation ass n.valley,cir.
first,we address the district court dismissal of national parks and the sierra club two new source review claims.they allege that tva violated various requirements of new source review by failing to obtain construction permits,and to install emission controls that would have been specified during the permitting process,before undertaking work on colbert unit and by operating unit after this illegal modification.the district court dismissed these claims on statute of limitations grounds insofar as they sought civil penalties,and it dismissed the claims pursuant to the concurrent remedy doctrine insofar as they sought injunctive and declaratory relief.in the sierra club separate case against tva,this court held that tva has sovereign immunity on any claims for civil penalties,sierra club,at.in light of that decision,national parks and the sierra club do not contest the dismissal of their claims for civil penalties.they contend nonetheless that the district court improperly dismissed their claims for injunctive and declaratory relief.that dismissal was premised on the concurrent remedy doctrine,which arises only if the legal claims are.thus,even though it is established that tva sovereign immunity bars national parks and the sierra club legal claims,we begin by considering whether and to what extent the statute of limitations also bars those claims.
statute of limitations 
legal claims brought under the clean air act are subject to the general federal statute of limitations established by,wherein the claim is barred if suit is not brought within five years of the date the claim first accrues.a claim first accrues on the date that a violation first occurs.mining browner.tva argues that national parks and the sierra club claims accrued in and,when tva undertook and completed the work on colbert unit without obtaining construction permits,installing certain emission controls,and fulfilling other requirements of new source review thus national parks and the sierra club suit filed nearly twenty years later in is most evidently untimely.the district court agreed,holding that national parks and the sierra club could not advance their new source review claims because tva had done no work on unit in the period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint.see also parks,at because applies,for their suit to be timely,the plaintiffs must identify a wrongful act that took place within five years of their filing this suit.
national parks and the sierra club advance several theories why the district court conclusion was incorrect.first,they argue that their claims were timely filed because tva violations of the act were continuing violations.under the continuing violations doctrine,the statute of limitations is tolled for a claim that otherwise would be where the violation giving rise to the claim continues to occur within the limitations period.havens realty coleman,d.in determining whether to characterize a violation as continuing,it is important to distinguish between the present consequences of a violation,which do not extend the limitations period,and a continuation of a violation into the present,which does.ross buckeye cellulose,cir see also ctr.for biological diversity hamilton,cir.
numerous district courts have held that violations of requirements of the preconstruction permitting process do not constitute continuing violations of the clean air act.see,new york niagara mohawk power,d,united states.power,d,united states murphy oil usa,d,united states westvaco,d,collecting additional cases.the district court joined this line of cases,and they persuade us,as well.the plain language of the act states,no major emitting facility may be constructed unless the proponent of the construction or modification fulfills the enumerated requirements.a.from this language,it follows that violations of the preconstruction permitting requirements occur at the time of construction,not on a continuing basis.niagara mohawk,d at see also.power,d at observing that the act provides separate requirements for preconstruction permits and operating permits,and et respectively,and the plain language of the act shows that preconstruction permitting violations occur when construction begins,not for the duration of the source operation.this conclusion is reinforced by the very citizen suit provision national parks and the sierra club invoke,which permits suit against any person who proposes to construct or constructs any new or modified major emitting facility without a permit.a emphasis added.operation of such a facility is not articulated as a basis for a violation of new source review under either a or a.a source operation is regulated separately from its construction under the act,compare setting forth requirements to be met prior to construction,with et governing operating permits and e p rohibited acts under new source performance standards include to operate such new source in violation of any standard of performance applicable to such source.the relevant alabama regulations also treated construction and operating permits separately.under such an arrangement,the statutory provisions governing preconstruction requirements can not reasonably be construed to mean that building or altering a machine without a permit is a violation that continues as long as the machine exists or is operated a violation of the clean air act preconstruction permit requirements occurs at the time of the construction or modification and is not continuing in nature.power,d at.
national parks and the sierra club contend that an alternative line of cases has characterized violations of preconstruction requirements as continuing violations,citing united states duke energy,d,aff on other grounds,cir,vacated by envtl.def.duke energy,d united states marine shale processors,cir united states am.power serv,d.of these cases,only the district court opinion in duke energy offers a rationale for treating violations of preconstruction requirements as continuing violations.however,the case is not directly analogous because the state regulations at issue in duke energy integrated construction and operating permits,see d at,such that compliance with preconstruction permitting requirements was a condition for the legal operation of the source.that is not the situation before us,as alabama state implementation program utilized separate construction and operating permit systems in during the work on colbert unit,and there is no evidence that tva operating permit was otherwise conditioned on its compliance with new source review preconstruction requirements.see murphy oil,d at finding no continuing violation where nothing in the statute creates a continuing liability for a facility failure to obtain a permit.
next,national parks and the sierra club argue that the district court misconstrued the nature of their claims with respect to tva operation of unit after the allegedly illegal modification.they emphasize that tva never installed and continues to operate without best available control technology,emission limitations for modified sources located in areas that are in attainment of the epa air quality standards.alabama regulations required the director of the department of environmental management to determine the achievable emission limitations for a specific source before granting it a construction permit.air pollution control comm reg.l.this best available control technology then would be specified for installation in the modified source.because tva never went through the preconstruction permitting process before undertaking work on unit,emission limitations never were specified for the unit.according to national parks and the sierra club,tva nonetheless has an ongoing obligation to apply best available control technology and commits a fresh violation of the act every time it operates unit without these emission controls.in support of this position,they cite a portion of the governing alabama state implementation plan stating that modified sources shall apply best available control technology.air pollution control comm reg.c.
national parks and the sierra club also point us to a recent decision from the sixth circuit where they joined with another organization and litigated the timeliness of clean air act claims arising from tva failure to undergo the preconstruction permitting process and its subsequent operations at a tennessee plant,national parks conservation association,tennessee valley authority,cir.in that case,the district court had held that the plaintiffs claims were.id.at.a divided panel of the sixth circuit reversed,holding that tennessee regulations created an ongoing obligation to install best available control technology,and thus the plaintiffs claims were timely to the extent that they alleged that tva failed to apply the emission controls within the limitations period.id.at.relying on this decision,national parks and the sierra club argue that,regardless of whether the continuing violations doctrine applies,their first new source review claim must survive to the extent that tva committed a new,discrete violation every time it operated unit without best available control technology during the limitations period.
were this case governed by tennessee environmental regulations,the sixth circuit decision in national parks indeed would be persuasive authority for national parks and the sierra club position.they advance the same claim in both modified a source without applying best available control technology and has been in violation of the act ever since,committing a discrete violation every time it operates the source without these emission controls.we can not avoid the fact,however,that the obligation to apply best available control all the violations alleged in the new source review counts of the complaint in this solely a prerequisite for approval of the modification,not a condition of unit lawful operation,under the relevant alabama state implementation plan.thus,national parks and the sierra club claim is completely.
the complaint charges tva with violating the alabama regulations in effect at the time of tva work on unit,and these regulations govern our inquiry.a careful review of alabama preconstruction permitting program reveals that best available control technology was to be determined and installed at the time of construction.alabama maintained completely distinct construction and operating permit programs,and the obligation to apply best available control technology was confined to the regulations for permits to construct in clean air areas.while these regulations did provide that a major modification shall apply best available control technology,that requirement applied to each proposed emissions unit.air pollution control comm reg.c emphasis added.moreover,the regulations defined best available control technology as a set of emission limitations determined by the director before construction begins.air pollution control comm reg.l.the alabama regulations apparently did not provide a way for a party who had undertaken a modification to obtain such a determination outside the preconstruction permitting process.these provisions compel our conclusion that tva obligation to install best available control technology was to be met at construction time in,and was not an ongoing duty.
while the alabama regulations cited above and certain portions of the tennessee regulations interpreted by the sixth circuit in national parks share very similar language we conclude that an important difference in the states plans ultimately precludes us from reaching the same result as our sister circuit.tennessee state implementation plan provided that,if a party failed to obtain a construction permit specifying emission limitations at the time of construction or modification,a construction permit could be issued at a later date to assure that these regulatory requirements are met.comp.regs.e.the sixth circuit construed this provision as creating an ongoing obligation to comply with requirements of the preconstruction permitting process.national parks,at.national parks and the sierra club have not pointed out any analogous provision in the alabama plan in effect in,and we are not aware of one.unlike tennessee,alabama limited the obligation to apply best available control technology to proposed modifications,with no caveat continuing the obligation for the operating life of the source if it was not met during the construction phase.in light of this distinction,we can not say that tva failure to apply best available control technology on unit constitutes a series of discrete violations of the relevant alabama regulations,parks,at,some of which fall within the limitations period.see niagara mohawk,d at courts have held that a violation of the obligation to install best available control technology before construction does not create continuing obligations or constitute continuing violations for purposes of the application of the statute of limitations.
we likewise reject national parks and the sierra club argument that,although tva had an operating permit issued by the alabama department of environmental management,it continually violated the act by failing to obtain an air permit specifying best available control technology for unit after alabama state implementation plan was amended in.the amendments revised alabama permitting system so that construction and operating permits were combined and issued as air permits.they provided that a person modifying a source had to obtain an air permit before construction and,if that person failed to do so,the source could not operate legally until an air permit was obtained.admin.code rule a,c.as a threshold matter,it is not clear that national parks and the sierra club have properly charged any violations of the alabama regulations the complaint charges tva only with violating the alabama preconstruction permitting regulations in effect during tva work on unit in.moreover,the amendments have no significance in this case where it is undisputed that tva had an operating permit for unit at the relevant times.there is no indication that the amendments were to apply retroactively,reviving tva obligation to obtain a preconstruction permit specifying emission limitations.rather,all construction and operating permits,the latter of which tva had,were converted to air permits by operation of law in.national parks and the sierra club position amounts to an argument that tva has been violating the act continually by operating unit under the wrong permit,and we reject it.see united states am,cir rejecting collateral attack on permit.
where tva has not been accused of violating its operating permit,unit present pollutant emissions have significance in this case only as a current ill effect of its past failure to fulfill the requirements of alabama preconstruction permitting program in.that is not sufficient to bring national parks and the sierra club new source review claims within the statute of limitations,which serves several important purposes including barring stale claims and protecting expectations that have settled over time.see,at.under these circumstances,a plaintiff recourse is to allege violations of the operating permit.see niagara mohawk,d at see also murphy oil,d at.as the district court observed,the sierra club apparently has done this successfully in its separate suit against tva charging opacity limit violations at the colbert plant.to be sure,relief is available under the act if those operations exceed the opacity limitation,sierra club,at not for the preconstruction violations alleged in this separate suit,which are.
concurrent remedy doctrine 
by its plain language,the statute of limitations set forth in applies only to claims for legal relief it does not apply to equitable remedies.united states banks,cir.nonetheless,where a party legal remedies are,that party concurrent equitable claims generally are barred under the concurrent remedy doctrine.cope anderson.see also gilbert city of cambridge,cir stating that it is settled that where legal and equitable claims coexist,equitable remedies will be withheld if an applicable statute of limitations bars the concurrent legal remedy united transp.union.coast ry,cir holding that,where both legal and equitable relief are sought,the statute of limitations bars both.
national parks and the sierra club rely on banks and united states cinergy,d,in arguing that the concurrent remedy doctrine does not bar their claims.banks carved out an exception to the concurrent remedy doctrine so that statutes of limitations can not operate to bar claims brought by the federal government in its sovereign capacity as enforcer of environmental regulations.at government sought injunction against party discharging dredged or fill materials on wetlands in violation of clean water act.national parks and the sierra club argue that this exception should be extended to them because they are acting as private attorneys general to enforce environmental regulations for the public benefit,see middlesex county sewerage auth.sea clammers ass n,d.there is no authority,however,for expanding the governmental exception to preclude application of the concurrent remedy doctrine in the instant suit,which was filed by private parties where the government has declined to act.the statute provides that plaintiffs in a citizen suit are acting on their own behalf,a though they may be acting as private attorneys general,they do not represent the public at large in the same way the government does when it brings suit to enforce the statute.see conservation law found.of new england,browner,citing legislative history of citizen suit provision.
alternatively,national parks and the sierra club argue that the doctrine is inapplicable because their legal and equitable claims do not seek concurrent remedies,urging us to adopt the reasoning articulated by the indiana district court in cinergy.in cinergy,the court held that the concurrent remedy doctrine did not bar a citizen suit seeking injunctive relief that was paired with a claim for civil penalties.the court held that the separate claims were not concurrent because the remedies had different goals and effects.d at identifying the goal of civil penalties as deterrence because fine is paid to the government,while the goal of equitable relief is to stop threats to the environment.we are not aware of other authority for this novel distinction and are not persuaded that it is a meaningful one.we conclude that the civil penalties and equitable relief sought in this case are concurrent because an action at law or equity could be brought on the same facts.united states telluride,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.
finally,national parks and the sierra club argue that,after sierra club established tva sovereign immunity on claims for civil penalties,their only claim is for equitable relief,and thus their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief must survive because they no longer have any concurrent legal claim,or otherwise,to support application of the concurrent remedy doctrine.we reject this argument.that tva has sovereign immunity by no means renders its statute of limitations defense superfluous.tva was entitled to raise multiple defenses,and the plaintiffs request for civil penalties remains part of the operative complaint.parks,at.thus,we have considered whether and to what extent the statute of limitations and the concurrent remedy doctrine bar the legal and equitable new source review claims national parks and the sierra club assert in this suit,and we conclude that the district court correctly dismissed those claims.consequently,we need not address tva laches defense.
in their third claim,national parks and the sierra club allege that tva operation of colbert unit violated the new source performance standards,see,on a daily basis for nearly twenty years.the district court dismissed the claim,holding that national parks and the sierra club had failed to comply with the notice requirement for citizen suits established by b.national parks sent tva notice of its intent to sue on october,but the district court found the letter to be the notice equivalent of a shotgun complaint because it broadly alleged daily violations of an entire set of regulations without specifically identifying the individual alleged violations and dates.
we review the sufficiency of notice de novo.see waterkeepers cal.ag indus,cir.in general,unless the plaintiff provides specific notice of intent to sue at least days before filing the complaint,a citizen suit may not be maintained.see hallstrom tillamook county,d envtl.found.abc rail,cir notice requirement is a mandatory condition precedent to the filing of a citizen suit under clean water act.under the clean air act citizen suit provision,at least days before commencing the suit,the citizen plaintiff must give notice of the violation i to the administrator,ii to the state in which the violation occurs,and iii to any alleged violator of the standard,limitation,or order allegedly violated.b a.the notice must contain 
sufficient information to permit the recipient to identify the specific standard,limitation,or order which has allegedly been violated,the activity alleged to be in violation,the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation,the location of the alleged violation,the date or dates of such violation,and the full name and address of the person giving the notice.
