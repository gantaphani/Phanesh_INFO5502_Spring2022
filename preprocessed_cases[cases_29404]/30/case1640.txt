in this case,we consider the meaning of an exclusionary clause in a comprehensive general liability cgl insurance policy that excludes injuries caused by the discharge,dispersal,release or escape of pollutants.specifically,we are asked to determine whether that clause,a standard pollution exclusion clause,applies to exclude injury to a tenant resulting from a landlord allegedly negligent use of pesticides on his property.we conclude that in order for an exclusionary clause to effectively exclude coverage,it must be conspicuous,plain and clear gray zurich insurance cal d,and that the pollution exclusion in question does not plainly and clearly exclude ordinary acts of negligence involving toxic chemicals such as pesticides.accordingly,we reverse the contrary judgment of the court of appeal.
statement of facts 
the following facts are undisputed.truck insurance exchange truck insurance issued a cgl insurance policy to mackinnon,for the period of april to april.that policy obligated the insurer to pay all sums for which the insured become s legally obligated to pay as damages caused by bodily injury,property damage or personal injury.the insurer must pay for damages up to the limit of liability when caused by an occurrence arising out of the business operations conducted at the insured location.under exclusions the policy states we do not cover bodily injury or property damage resulting from the actual,alleged,or threatened discharge,dispersal,release or escape of pollutants a at or from the insured location.the terms pollution or pollutants are defined,in the definitions section at the beginning of the policy,as mean ing any solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant,including smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acids,alkalis,chemicals and waste materials.waste materials include materials which are intended to be or have been recycled,reconditioned or reclaimed.
jennifer denzin was a tenant in mackinnon apartment building.she requested mackinnon to spray to eradicate yellow jackets at the apartment building.mackinnon hired a pest control company,antimite associates,antimite,to exterminate the yellow jackets.antimite treated the apartment building for yellow jackets on several occasions in and.on may,denzin died in mackinnon apartment building.
denzin parents filed a wrongful death lawsuit against mackinnon,antimite,and other defendants.they alleged that on or about may,defendants negligently failed to inform denzin that her apartment was to be sprayed with dangerous chemicals,and failed to evacuate her,as a result of which she died from pesticide exposure.mackinnon tendered his defense to truck insurance under the cgl insurance policy.
on november,truck insurance retained counsel and filed a responsive pleading to the complaint on behalf of mackinnon.on december,truck insurance sent mackinnon a letter advising him that,because an immediate response was necessary,truck insurance had referred the denzin action to defense counsel in order to protect mackinnon interests.truck insurance added that it was still investigating the matter to determine if coverage existed.truck insurance added that it did not intend to waive any provisions of the insurance policy,and truck insurance reserves all of its rights under the terms,exclusions,and conditions of any policies issued to you.
on june,truck insurance sent mackinnon a letter advising that it had concluded that the pollution exclusion precluded coverage for the denzin action and therefore truck insurance would be withdrawing its defense within days.truck insurance later extended the withdrawal date to july.
in june,mackinnon retained counsel to represent him in the denzin action.mackinnon,through his counsel,settled the denzin action for and then filed the instant insurance coverage action,claiming truck insurance owed mackinnon a duty to defend and indemnify him in the denzin action.mackinnon action asserted causes of action for declaratory relief,breach of contract,and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
truck insurance moved for summary judgment on mackinnon coverage claims on the ground the pollution exclusion contained in the insurance policy issued by truck insurance to mackinnon precluded coverage for the denzin suit.mackinnon opposed the motion.the trial court granted summary judgment based on the following findings the denzin action alleged the decedent died as a result of exposure to a pesticide used to eradicate yellow jackets at her apartment building the pollution exclusion in the truck insurance policy was clear and unambiguous there was no potential for coverage for the denzin action because the injuries alleged in the denzin complaint are excluded from coverage by the pollution exclusion and because there was no potential for coverage,mackinnon breach of the good faith covenant cause of action also fails.
the court of appeal affirmed.it too found the clause unambiguous as applied to mackinnon claim,citing several cases from other jurisdictions giving the exclusion a broad reading.we granted review.
ii.discussion 
in determining whether a summary judgment motion was properly granted,we review the trial court decision de novo,applying the rule that a defendant is entitled to summary judgment if the record establishes as a matter of law that none of the plaintiff asserted causes of action can prevail.flatt superior court cal th,d.the trial court principal ground for granting summary judgment,and the court of appeal principal ground for affirming the trial court,was a determination that the pollution exclusion found in mackinnon policy excluded coverage of denzin wrongful death complaint.as discussed below,interpretation of policy language is a question of law.we therefore must determine,de novo,whether the pollution exclusion was properly interpreted by these courts.
the meaning of the current pollution exclusion has not received wide attention in this state however,the scope of the exclusion has been litigated extensively in other jurisdictions.to say there is a lack of unanimity as to how the clause should be interpreted is an understatement.although the fragmentation of opinion defies strict categorization,courts are roughly divided into two camps.one camp maintains that the exclusion applies only to traditional environmental pollution into the air,water,and soil,but generally not to all injuries involving the negligent use or handling of toxic substances that occur in the normal course of business.these courts generally find ambiguity in the wording of the pollution exclusion when it is applied to such negligence and interpret such ambiguity against the insurance company in favor of coverage.the other camp maintains that the clause applies equally to negligence involving toxic substances and traditional environmental pollution,and that the clause is as unambiguous in excluding the former as the latter 
historical background of pollution exclusion 
in order to understand the meaning of the pollution exclusion,some historical background is useful.the illinois supreme court comprehensive review of this history in koloms,supra,merits extensive quotation the events leading up to the insurance industry adoption of the pollution exclusion are and relatively uncontroverted.citation.prior to,the cgl policy provided coverage for bodily injury or property damage caused by an accident.citations.the term accident,however,was not defined in the policy.as a result,courts throughout the country were called upon to define the term,which they often interpreted in a way as to encompass injuries.in response,the insurance industry revised the cgl policy in and changed the former accident based policy to an occurrence based policy.the new policy specifically defined an occurrence as an accident,including injurious exposure to conditions,which results,during the policy period,in bodily injury and property damage that was neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.citation.despite these changes,courts continued to construe the policy to cover damages resulting from,gradual exposure to environmental pollution.
meanwhile,at about the same time,the united states congress substantially amended the clean air act in an effort to protect and enhance the quality of the nation air resources,stat.now codified at through,as amended.the passage of these amendments,which included provisions for cleaning up the environment,imposed greater economic burdens on insurance underwriters,particularly those drafting cgl policies.citation.the insurer burdens further increased with the environmental disasters of times beach,love canal and torrey canyon.citations.
in the wake of these events,the insurance industry became increasingly concerned that the policies were to cover most injuries.to that end,changes were suggested,and the industry proceeded to draft what was to eventually become the pollution exclusion 
the result of these efforts was the addition of an endorsement to the cgl policy in adopted as exclusion f.the endorsement provided in pertinent part 
this policy shall not apply to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the discharge,dispersal,release or escape of smoke,vapors,soot,fumes,acids,alkalis,toxic chemicals,liquids or gases,waste materials or other irritants,contaminants or pollutants into or upon land,the atmosphere or any watercourse or body of water but this exclusion does not apply if such discharge,dispersal,release or escape is sudden and accidental.
during the next years,various courts labored over the exact meaning of the words sudden and accidental.much of the litigation focused on whether the word sudden was intended to be given a strictly temporal meaning such that,in order for the exception to apply,the discharge of pollution had to have been abrupt.citation.this controversy generated an enormous amount of litigation,leading one commentator to describe the dispute as one of the most hotly litigated insurance coverage questions of the late.citations.not surprisingly,insurance companies responded by drafting a new version of the exclusion,which,first appearing in,is now commonly known as the absolute pollution exclusion.the two most notable features of this latest version are i the lack of any exception for the sudden and accidental release of pollution,and ii the elimination of the requirement that the pollution be discharged into or upon land,the atmosphere or any watercourse or body of water.citation.koloms,supra,at,fn.omitted,italics added see also jackson,hartford acc.indem,noting the holding of a considerable number of courts that pollution would be regarded as sudden and accidental if the result or injury was unexpected or unintended.
even commentators who represent the insurance industry recognize that the broadening of the pollution exclusion was intended primarily to exclude traditional environmental pollution rather than all injuries from toxic substances.as two attorneys representing the insurance industry have concluded insurers introduced the absolute exclusion in as a replacement for the qualified exclusion,principally in response to court decisions interpreting the qualified exclusion in favor of coverage.in particular,courts have noted that the revised pollution exclusion deleted the sudden and accidental exception because some decisions had misapplied this exception or,at least,construed it in a manner contrary to insurers original intent.by the a significant body of law had developed construing the sudden and accidental exception to embrace gradual pollution.the courts broad reading of the qualified exclusion sudden and accidental exception was at the forefront of insurers concern at the time the absolute exclusion was drafted.shelley mason,application of the absolute pollution exclusion to toxic tort claims will courts choose policy construction or deconstruction tort ins,fns.omitted shelley mason.

arguments for and against a narrow interpretation of the pollution exclusion clause.
one of the primary arguments for a narrow interpretation of the pollution exclusion is based on the history reviewed above.as kolums stated our review of the history of the pollution exclusion amply demonstrates that the predominate sic motivation in drafting an exclusion for injuries was the avoidance of the enormous expense and exposure resulting from the explosion of enviromental litigation.citations.similarly,the amendment to the exclusion was wrought,not to broaden the provision scope beyond its original purpose of excluding coverage for environmental pollution,but rather to remove the sudden and accidental exception to coverage which,as noted above,resulted in a costly onslaught of litigation.we would be remiss,therefore,if we were to simply look to the bare words of the exclusion,ignore its raison,and apply it to situations which do not remotely resemble traditional environmental contamination.the pollution exclusion has been,and should continue to be,the appropriate means of avoiding the yawning extent of potential liability arising from the gradual or repeated discharge of hazardous substances into the environment.emphasis in original.citations.we think it improper to extend the exclusion beyond that arena.koloms,supra,at accord,doerr mobil oil,supra,so d at sullins allstate insurance,supra,andersen highland house,supra,at gainsco ins.amoco production,supra,at see also stempel,supra,tort ins.at.
courts adopting a narrower interpretation of the exclusion have also maintained that an interpretation of pollutant as applying literally to any contaminant or irritant would have absurd or otherwise unacceptable results.t here is virtually no substance or chemical in existence that would not irritate or damage some person or property.westchester fire ins.city of pittsburg,city of pittsburg,affd.sub nom.pennsylvania nat.mut.cas.ins.city of pittsburg,cir see also nautilus ins.jabar cir,interpreting maine law pipefitters welfare educational fund westchester fire insurance cir,pipefitters motorists mut.ins.rsj,summary rsj.
another argument for this camp focuses on the common meaning of the term discharge,dispersal,release or escape,as implying expulsion of the pollutant over a considerable area rather than a localized toxic accident occurring in the vicinity of intended use.lumbermens mutual casualty industries,cir,lumbermens accord,meridian mutual ins.kellman cir,kellman center for creative studies aetna life casualty.center for creative studies steely,supra,at.other courts have viewed these words as terms of art describing environmental pollution.west american ins.tufco flooring,tufco flooring,disapproved on other grounds in gaston county dyeing mach.northfield ins,accord,sphere drake ins.realty,rsj,supra,at gill,supra,at continental casualty,injury not excluded.
on the other hand,many courts have taken a position that the current pollution exclusion is not ambiguous in encompassing acts of negligence involving toxic that are outside the scope of traditional environmental pollution.these courts tend to find the meaning of the key words,as defined in a dictionary,to unequivocally cover forms of contamination other than traditional environmental pollution.this approach is exemplified by the wisconsin supreme court in peace,supra,in which the court determined,after extensive analysis of the dictionary definitions of the various terms,that a tenant action against the landlord for lead paint ingestion was excluded.as the court stated the words discharge,dispersal,release,and escape are not defined in the policy,but they appear to describe the entire range of actions by which something moves from a contained condition to an uncontained condition.id.at.the court therefore concluded that ingestion of chipped lead paint was covered we believe the plain language of the policy covers the release of paint containing lead from a wall or ceiling into the air or onto the floor.common sense tells us that lead paint that never leaves a wall or ceiling does not cause harm.id.at,fn.omitted.
the peace court also rejected the argument that the terms discharge,dispersal,release or escape are environmental law terms of art because they appear in environmental statutes a quick check of the wisconsin statutes shows that these terms are used in many situations completely unrelated to the environment,including criminal law.citing a multitude of criminal justice statutes that use these common terms would not transform the terms into criminal justice terms of art.peace,supra,at.
the court also disagreed that the term pollutant is ambiguous.the key term in the clause pollutants is specifically defined in the policy the definition can not be undone by different notions of pollution outside the policy,unrelated to the policy language,unless such a reading produced absurd results.in the text here,the words are not fairly susceptible to more than one construction.the pollution exclusion clause does not become ambiguous merely because the parties disagree about its meaning citation,or because they can point to conflicting interpretations of the clause by different courts.peace,supra,at accord,deni,supra,so d at.
as for the intended purpose of the pollution exclusion,courts finding a lack of ambiguity in the language of the policy dismiss such history as irrelevant.u nless we conclude that the policy language is ambiguous,it would be inappropriate for us to consider the arguments pertaining to the drafting history of the pollution exclusion clause.citation.deni,supra,so d at.
principles for construing insurance policies under california law 
we begin our own analysis with a review of the principles that govern the construction of insurance policy language in this state.interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law and follows the general rules of contract interpretation.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,waller.the fundamental rules of contract interpretation are based on the premise that the interpretation of a contract must give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage,controls judicial interpretation.citations.a policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.citation.but language in a contract must be interpreted as a whole,and in the circumstances of the case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.id.at,d.
moreover,insurance coverage is interpreted broadly so as to afford the greatest possible protection to the insured,whereas exclusionary clauses are interpreted narrowly against the insurer.white western title ins.cal d.a n insurer can not escape its basic duty to insure by means of an exclusionary clause that is unclear.as we have declared time and again any exception to the performance of the basic underlying obligation must be so stated as clearly to apprise the insured of its effect.citation.thus,the burden rests upon the insurer to phrase exceptions and exclusions in clear and unmistakable language.citation.the exclusionary clause must be conspicuous,plain and clear.state farm mut.auto.ins.jacober cal d.this rule applies with particular force when the coverage portion of the insurance policy would lead an insured to reasonably expect coverage for the claim purportedly excluded.gray zurich insurance,supra,cal d at.the burden is on the insured to establish that the claim is within the basic scope of coverage and on the insurer to establish that the claim is specifically excluded.aydin first state ins.cal th,d.
d.the meaning of the pollution exclusion 
therefore,in order to ascertain the scope of an exclusion,we must first consider the coverage language of the policy.see gray zurich insurance,supra,cal d at,ponder blue cross of southern california,supra,d at.mackinnon cgl policy obligated the insurer to pay all sums for which the insured become s legally obligated to pay as damages caused by bodily injury,property damage or personal injury.we said of similar language that it connotes general protection for alleged bodily injury caused by the insured.gray zurich ins,supra,cal d at.this language establishes a reasonable expectation that the insured will have coverage for ordinary acts of negligence resulting in bodily injury.id.at.coverage will therefore be found unless the pollution exclusion conspicuously,plainly and clearly apprises the insured that certain acts of ordinary negligence,such as the spraying of pesticides in this case,will not be covered.id.at.
truck insurance contends that the pollution exclusion,read literally,would plainly and clearly extend to virtually all acts of negligence involving substances that can be characterized as irritants or contaminants,that is,are capable of irritating or contaminating so as to cause personal injury.specifically,they argue that pesticides are chemicals capable of causing irritation and can therefore be defined as an irritant and a pollutant.the spraying of pesticides can be described as a discharge or dispersal.
but truck insurance reading of the clause is predicated on a basic fallacy,one shared by many of the courts on which it relies the conclusion that the meaning of policy language is to be discovered by citing one of the dictionary meanings of the key words,such irritant or discharge.see american states ins.nethery cir,peace,supra,at deni,supra,so d at.although examination of various dictionary definitions of a word will no doubt be useful,such examination does not necessarily yield the ordinary and popular sense of the word if it disregards the policy context.bank of the west superior court cal th,d.rather,a court properly refusing to make a fortress out of the dictionary,russian hill improvement board of permit appeals cal d,quoting justice learned hand dictum in cabell markham cir,must attempt to put itself in the position of a layperson and understand how he or she might reasonably interpret the exclusionary language.aiu ins,supra,cal d at.
the unreasonableness of truck insurance interpretation becomes clear when its full implications are considered.virtually any substance can act under the proper circumstances as an irritant or contaminant.see city of pittsburg,supra.at.the court in pipefitters,supra,at page stated without some limiting principle,the pollution exclusion clause would extend far beyond its intended scope,and lead to some absurd results.the hypothetical allergic reaction to pool chlorine,proposed by the pipefitters court,illustrates this absurdity.chlorine certainly contains irritating properties that would cause the injury.its dissemination throughout a pool may be literally described as a dispersal or discharge.our research reveals no court or commentator that has concluded such an incident would be excluded under the pollution exclusion.the response of two leading insurance industry attorneys has simply been to state that there are no decisions reporting denials arising from swimming pool chlorine under the pollution e xclusion.shelley mason,supra,tort ins.at.truck insurance counsel took a similar position at oral argument.
other such hypotheticals can be imagined.the application of iodine onto a cut through an eyedropper may be literally characterized as a discharge or release of an irritant.truck insurance interpretation would therefore bar coverage for injury caused by the misapplication of iodine,or its application on someone who was hypersensitive or has an allergic reaction.a child accidental ingestion of a pesticide or other toxic substance negligently left in an empty soft drink bottle would be barred.yet few if any would think of these injuries as arising from pollution in any recognizable sense of that term.
courts interpreting the pollution exclusion broadly have acknowledged that their interpretation may yield results that no one would consider reasonable.for example,the florida supreme court,adopting a broad interpretation similar to truck insurance,responded to various unspecified hypotheticals by affirming that insurance policies will not be construed to reach an absurd result.deni,supra,so d at see also peace,supra,at.yet an interpreting an exclusionary clause so broadly that it logically leads to absurd results,in conjunction with an affirmation in the abstract that it will not be interpreted to yield such results,is a recipe for judicial confusion.see stempel,supra,tort ins.at.
our conclusion that truck insurance interpretation is overly broad is bolstered by a closer examination of the connotations of the terms discharge,dispersal,release or escape in the context of the present case.a release is defined as the act of liberating or freeing discharge from restraint.webster new internat.dict.an escape is defined as an evasion of or deliverance from what confines,limits,or holds.id.at.these terms connote some sort of freedom from containment,and it would be unusual to speak of the normal,intentional application of pesticides as a release or escape of pesticides.
to disperse is defined,variously,as to cause to become spread widely,to dissipate,dispel,to spread or distribute from a fixed or constant source,or to cause to break up and go in different ways.webster new internat,supra,at,italics added.the notion of dispersal as a substantial dissemination is reinforced by its use with the term pollutant.indeed,the word dispersal,when in conjunction with pollutant,is commonly used to describe the spreading of pollution widely enough to cause its dissipation and dilution.see,milloy,northeast blowing smoke on cause of its pollution,chicago sun times,beyond to miles,air pollutants are dispersed sanchez,in,a crackling controversy over smog,washington post,the valley is bordered on three sides by mountain ranges and can not naturally disperse the pollution it creates.knowledge of common usage does not lead us to believe that the term disperse pesticides is generally used as a substitute for spray or apply pesticides,except perhaps when the pesticides are being spread throughout a large area.see,ritter,pesticide trucks go after mosquitoes,chicago,referring to one teaspoon of the pesticide sumiturin dispersed over an area the size of a football field simmons,tanzania begins to deal with toxic wasteland,times,referring to some cataclysmic meteorological event that would wash or disperse large quantities of persistent pesticide s into the environment.in the present case,the application of pesticides in and around an apartment building does not plainly signify to the common understanding the dispersal of a pollutant.see kellman,supra,at strains the meaning of discharge,dispersal,seepage,dispersal,release or escape to apply it to localized toxic injury occurring in the vicinity of intended use see also lumbermens,supra,at center for creative studies,supra.at steely,supra,at.
discharge is defined most pertinently as to send forth or to give outlet to pour forth.webster new internat,supra,at.although the application of pesticides could literally be described as a discharge of pesticides,that term is rarely used in this manner.in fact,a lexisnexis allnews search of pesticide in the same sentence with discharge reveals that the two words are used together almost invariably to describe the runoff of pesticides into water or soil,often with other effluents.see,mcchesney,future of farming in california central valley,all things considered,radio broadcast referring to pesticide discharges to surface waters and other agricultural pollutants rogers,deal set to upgrade mexican sewage treatment is set,san diego union tribune july,referring to industrial plant that discharges effluent contain ing pesticides into the ocean kay,growers sued over pollution suit says pesticides contaminated water,chronicle,referring to discharg ing irrigation runoff gold,a looming ecological mistake,times,referring to discharge of harmful pesticides into nearby creek.in other words,the term discharge is commonly used with pesticides to describe pesticide runoff behaving as a traditional environmental pollutant rather than pesticides being normally applied 
in short,because truck insurance broad interpretation of the pollution exclusion leads to absurd results and ignores the familiar connotations of the words used in the exclusion,we do not believe it is the interpretation that the ordinary layperson would adopt.what then is the plain meaning of the pollution exclusion the key to this inquiry,we believe,turns on the meaning of the term pollutant.because the definitional phrase any irritant or contaminant is too broad to meaningfully define pollutant,we must turn to the common connotative meaning of that term.this position was well articulated by the court in regional bank of colorado paul fire and marine ins.cir,interpreting colorado law,when considering whether carbon monoxide fumes from a residential heater should be considered pollution a reasonable policy holder would not understand the policy to exclude coverage for anything that irritates.irritant is not to be read literally and in isolation,but must be construed in the context of how it is used in the policy,defining pollutant.while a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence might well understand carbon monoxide is a pollutant when it is emitted in an industrial or environmental setting,an ordinary policyholder would not reasonably characterize carbon monoxide emitted from a residential heater which malfunctioned as pollution.it seems far more reasonable that a policyholder would understand it as being limited to irritants and contaminants commonly thought of as pollution and not as applying to every possible irritant or contaminant imaginable.id.at,italics added accord,stoney run commercial ins.cir,gill,supra,at.
limiting the scope of the pollution exclusion to injuries arising from events commonly thought of as pollution,environmental pollution,also appears to be consistent with the choice of terms discharge,dispersal,release or escape.as one court has observed the drafters utilization of environmental law terms of art discharge,dispersal,release,or escape of pollutants reflects the exclusion historical of liability for environmental catastrophes related to intentional industrial pollution.rsj,supra,at see also nautilus ins.jabar,supra,at center for creative studies,supra.at koloms,supra,at.it may be an overstatement to declare that discharge,dispersal,release or escape,by themselves,are environmental law terms of art.but,as discussed above,these terms,used in conjunction with pollutant,commonly refer to the sort of conventional environmental pollution at which the pollution exclusion was primarily targeted.
moreover,as discussed above,there appears to be little dispute that the pollution exclusion was adopted to address the enormous potential liability resulting from laws enacted between and.koloms,supra,at see also shelly mason,supra,tort ins.at stempel,supra,tort ins.at.on the other hand,neither truck insurance nor the considerable number of amicus curiae from the insurance industry writing on its behalf point to any evidence that the exclusion was directed at ordinary acts of negligence involving harmful substances.see stempel,supra,tort ins.at pointing to the lack of evidence supporting the insurers position despite their greater access to policy drafters documents.nor do they bring to light evidence that the substantial limitation on cgl coverage that an exclusion so interpreted would impose was communicated to the purchasers of insurance or insurance regulators,nor that the significant reduction in coverage was accompanied by a reduction in premiums.se
