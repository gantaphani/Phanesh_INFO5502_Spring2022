in,the mojave desert air quality management district the district adopted rule rule concerns the use of road reduces airborne offset increases in airborne dust as well as other forms of particulate air pollution.
the parties offer strikingly different characterizations of rule.
according to the district,rule merely provides a protocol to be used in applying for,calculating,and issuing paving offsets.it does not authorize any actual road paving hence,it can not possibly have any environmental effects.any future paving offsets will be subject to environmental review if and when applicants seek them,but at this point,their environmental effects are speculative.
based on this characterization,the district found that its adoption of rule was exempt from environmental review under the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et under the class categorical exemption,which applies to actions taken by regulatory agencies to assure the maintenance,restoration,enhancement,or protection of the environment where the regulatory process involves procedures for protection of the environment,tit.
by contrast,according to plaintiffs rule would allow the paving of up to miles of dirt roads,and thus it would have adverse environmental effects.moreover,the fine particulate matter produced by combustion is a worse pollutant than the coarse particulate matter produced by unpaved roads,so that using the latter to offset the former would,in itself,have adverse environmental effects.plaintiffs conclude that rule does not qualify for the claimed exemption.
ceqa does not demand the impossible it simply requires public agencies to consider the reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of their actions.plaintiffs may have overstated their case a bit by harping on the unlikely possibility that rule may result in the paving of all miles of unpaved road within the district jurisdiction.still,it is reasonably,it is almost the adoption of rule will result in some road paving.plaintiffs showed that road paving would tend to have adverse environmental effects the district,for its part,failed to show that these effects would be either de minimis or too speculative to analyze.accordingly,there was insufficient evidence to support the district finding that the adoption of rule would assure the maintenance,restoration,enhancement,or protection of the environment,tit.
factual backgrounda.general legal background.
particulate matter pm refers to very small solid or liquid particles that can be suspended in the atmosphere.particulate matter consisting of particles that are micrometers or less in diameter is considered an air pollutant.c.can be further subclassified into fine particles,which are micrometers or less in diameter part,appx.l and coarse particles,which are between and micrometers in diameter part,appx.o.
the federal clean air act et requires the environmental protection agency epa to prescribe national ambient air quality standards standards.a,b.these include separate standards for a and.areas that fail to meet the standards are designated as nonattainment areas.d.
each state is required to adopt a state implementation plan plan that provides for implementation,maintenance,and enforcement of the standards.a see also,a.a plan must include a permit program for major new or modified stationary sources of air pollution in nonattainment areas new source review.a c,c.a permit for a new source may be granted only if it obtains emission reduction credits to offset the increased emissions that it will produce.a a,c.
the district is the local agency with the primary responsibility for the development,implementation,monitoring,and enforcement of air pollution control strategies for most of the mojave desert air basin.health,see also health,tit,defining the mojave desert air basin.the legislature intended the district t o successfully develop and implement a comprehensive program for the attainment and maintenance of state and federal ambient air quality standards health,subd.d.to that end,the district has the power to make rules that become part of the state plan.health,see generally,et.
parts of the district have been designated as nonattainment areas for,tit.however,the district does not include any nonattainment areas for,tit.
the following additional facts are taken from the administrative record.
traditional offset methods include shutting down an existing facility or controlling the emissions from it.the district has identified road paving as an method of offsetting emissions.the district jurisdiction includes approximately miles of unpaved roads.
rule was derived from a similar rule adopted in maricopa county,arizona.its purpose is to ensure that offsets for road paving meet federal requirements that all offsets must be r eal,q uantifiable,p ermanent,e nforceable and s urplus.see a,appx.s,iv c i.
rule is too long to quote here in its entirety.accordingly,we summarize its principal provisions.
it states that paving offsets may be used as offsets in accordance with other district rules governing new source review.it provides two mathematical formulas for determining the emissions from paved and unpaved roads,respectively,in units of pounds per vehicle mile traveled.it then provides that t he emission reductions associated with paving an unpaved road shall be calculated as the difference between the emissions from the road in the unpaved condition and the emissions from the road in the paved condition.the resulting reduction in emissions can be used to offset an increase in emissions on a basis.see also mojave desert air quality management district rule c,available at.gov modules show document.aspx documentid,as of june.
rule also prescribes procedures for approving or denying an application for paving offsets.it states,the district shall determine whether to issue or deny paving offsets in compliance with the standards set forth in subsection c subsection c then states 
a the district shall only issue paving offsets pursuant to this rule,if the emission reductions will be real,quantifiable,permanent,enforceable and surplus.
b the district shall only issue paving offsets pursuant to this rule in the amount determined necessary for construction of the new or modified facility or emissions unit 
finally,rule provides after the district has determined to issue the paving offsets the district shall submit the proposed paving offsets for public notice and comment upon the expiration of the public comment period after review of comments accepted,if any and upon payment of the appropriate analysis fee,if any the district shall issue the paving offsets 
c.the proposed class categorical exemption finding.
a staff report acknowledged that the adoption of rule was a project within the meaning of ceqa.it stated,however the potential environmental impacts of compliance with the adoption of proposed rule are positive to the environment,as proposed rule will encourage additional road paving with commensurate reduction in particulate emissions from unpaved road dust entrainment.it also stated the adoption of proposed rule is exempt from ceqa review because it will not create any adverse impacts on the environment.because there is no potential that the adoption might cause the release of additional air contaminants or create any adverse environmental impacts,a class categorical exemption reg s.applies.
plaintiffs comments.
in response to the staff report,plaintiffs submitted pages of comments.their comments were supported by the analyses of petra pless and david howekamp,who were duly qualified expert environmental consultants.
plaintiffs objected that the adoption of rule could have a number of potentially significant environmental impacts.in this appeal,they focus on the following three.
the differences between and road dust.
new stationary sources of,such as power plants,tend to generate through combustion plaintiffs commented that c is qualitatively different from entrained road dust.from road dust is mostly coarse,with only about to percent.by contrast,from combustion is mostly fine it can be to percent.thus,according to plaintiffs,the district is effectively trading one air pollution problem for another.
differs from in its tendency to spread through the atmosphere.larger particles fall out of the air faster than smaller particles.also,particles from road dust are kicked up by vehicles at ground level,whereas particles from combustion typically exit through tall stacks with high exit velocities thus,from road dust travels only a short distance and settles not far from the road,whereas from combustion is regionally distributed.
also differs from in its tendency to cause disease.fine particle pollution is link ed with serious morbidity and mortality.exposure to fine pm has been shown to be associated with both lung cancer and heart disease.
in addition,plaintiffs noted that the very activity of paving roads would in itself cause emissions,including diesel exhaust,a p articularly damaging source of fine pm,contain ing nearly toxic substances.
plaintiffs quoted a letter from the state air resources board the board stating fine particulate matter emissions are a serious human health concern.the board explained f ine particulates have unique pulmonary dynamics.they selectively penetrate into lung alveoli.whatever chemicals the particulates have absorbed are also transported into the body.the board concluded we believe there is no technical justification for allowing pm emission reductions from road paving to offset increases from natural gas combustion if offsets have been granted for paving roads,those offsets should not be allowed to be used to mitigate the impacts of combustion particulate bolding omitted.
the effects on animals and plants.
plaintiffs also commented that paving roads may result in a number of adverse direct and indirect impacts on biological resources.direct impacts include mortality during road construction and increased frequency of roadkill from vehicle travel on paved roads i ndirect impacts include spread of invasive plant species air,water,soil,and noise pollution soil disturbance and erosion and increase of roadway pollutants and associated habitat loss,degradation and fragmentation alteration of wildlife movement and changes in wildlife populations.
paved roads increase roadkill because they attract more vehicles,and they allow vehicles to travel at higher speeds.in addition,they absorb heat during the day and release it at night,thus attracting animals in search of warmth.
the act of road paving would kill a ny vegetation along the unimproved road,any species living in that vegetation or on the unimproved road shoulders,and any sessile or organisms in the path of the road.
animal species that live along unpaved roads in the district,and that therefore could be directly adversely affected by road paving,include the desert tortoise,a state and federal threatened species the mojave ground squirrel,a state threatened species and the western burrowing owl,a state and federal species of concern.
finally,plaintiffs commented that road paving could induce growth paving roads may encourage land development by improving access to properties that are at present only accessible via unpaved roads.consequently,newly paved roads would facilitate the already rampant urban sprawl 
e.the district response.
the district provided responses to plaintiffs comments.in these,it stated there will be no increase in any particulate emissions due to the proposed rule.it also stated,it is the district reasonable judgment that detailed environmental review of potential,speculative impacts from paving of particular roads which might occur at some point in the future is unable to be performed due to the highly speculative and unknown nature of any potential paving projects which could be used to generate offsets pursuant to this rule when and if any application for offsets is submitted the environmental impacts of such should be assessed by the agency accepting the paving of the road.
the district then adopted rule and found that the class categorical exemption applied.
procedural background 
plaintiffs filed a timely petition for a writ of administrative mandate pursuant to ceqa 
after hearing argument,the trial court denied the petition.it ruled s ubstantial evidence supports the d istrict determination that the class categorical exemption applies.rule is a component of new source review of any new or modified stationary sources of air pollutants and is intended to assist the d istrict in bringing the area into attainment with national air pollution standards.as such,it will enhance or protect the environment.it does not relax standards or allow environmental degradation.indeed,it does not permit any activity that would harm or degrade the environment.contrary to petitioners argument,the rule does not permit the paving of any road or the using of any offset the rule simply sets forth a protocol for calculating such an offset if one is sought.whether the use of such offsets in connection with a particular project is appropriate will be part of the environmental analysis of that project.nothing in the rule entitles a future applicant to use such offsets.accordingly,it entered judgment against plaintiffs and in favor of the district.
discussiona.general ceqa principles.overview of the ceqa process.
ceqa and its implementing administrative regulations ceqa guidelines establish a process to ensure that public agencies inform their decisions with environmental considerations.citation.the first tier is jurisdictional,requiring that an agency conduct a preliminary review to determine whether an activity is subject to ceqa.citations.an activity that is not a project is not subject to ceqa.citation.
the second tier concerns exemptions from ceqa review.the legislature has provided that certain projects,such as ministerial projects and repairs to public service facilities of an emergency nature,are exempt.citations.in addition,the ceqa guidelines list categorical exemptions or classes of projects that the resources agency has determined to be exempt per se because they do not have a significant effect on the environment.citations.
if a public agency properly finds that a project is exempt from ceqa,no further environmental review is necessary.citation.the agency need only prepare and file a notice of exemption citations,citing the relevant statute or section of the ceqa guidelines and including a brief statement of reasons to support the finding of exemption citation.if a project does not fall within an exemption,the agency must conduct an initial study to determine if the project may have a significant effect on the environment.citation.
ceqa third tier applies if the agency determines substantial evidence exists that an aspect of the project may cause a significant effect on the environment.in that event,the agency must ensure that a full environmental impact report is prepared on the proposed project.citations.muzzy ranch solano county airport land use com cal th,d,fn.omitted.
first tier the existence of a project.
project is defined as an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment pub.resources code,see also,tit.activity,for this purpose,includes a n activity directly undertaken by any public agency pub.resources code,subd.a,as well as a n activity that involves the issuance to a person of a lease,permit,license,certificate,or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies pub.resources code,subd.c.
under ceqa,project refers to the underlying activity which may be subject to approval by one or more governmental agencies it does not refer to each of the several approvals sequentially issued by different agencies.citations.this definition ensures that the action reviewed under ceqa is not the approval itself but the development or other activities that will result from the approval.citation.citizens for a alameda city of alameda th,d.
whether a particular activity constitutes a project in the first instance is a question of law.citation.riverwatch olivenhain municipal water dist.th,d.
second tier the existence of an exemption.
the ceqa guidelines provide for classes of projects that generally do not have a significant effect on the environment and therefore may be exempted from ceqa review.citations.committee to save hollywoodland specific plan city of los angeles th,d,fn.omitted.
in this case,the district relies on the class categorical exemption,which applies to actions taken by regulatory agencies,as authorized by state or local ordinance,to assure the maintenance,restoration,enhancement,or protection of the environment where the regulatory process involves procedures for protection of the environment.construction activities and relaxation of standards allowing environmental degradation are not included in this exemption,tit.
the scope of an exemption may be analyzed as a question of statutory interpretation and thus subject to independent review.citations.but the substantial evidence test governs our review of the agency factual determination that a project falls within a categorical exemption.citation.san lorenzo valley community advocates for responsible education san lorenzo valley unified school dist.th,d.
applying the substantial evidence test in the context of a court reviewing an agency exemption decision means determining whether the record contains relevant information that a reasonable mind might accept as sufficient to support the conclusion reached.although the agency bears the burden to demonstrate with substantial evidence that its action fell within the exemption,all conflicts in the evidence are resolved in its favor and all legitimate and reasonable inferences are indulged in to uphold findings,if possible.citations.great oaks water santa clara valley water dist.th,d,fn.omitted.
in determining whether the agency findings are supported by substantial evidence,the trial court and the appellate courts essentially perform identical roles.we review the record de novo and are not bound by the trial court conclusions.citations.environmental protection information center california of forestry and fire protection cal th,d.
ceqa principles as applied to this case.
the adoption of a rule or regulation can be a project subject to ceqa.wildlife alive chickering cal d,plastic pipe fittings california building standards com.th,d.
many agencies take the position that rulemaking actions are exempt under ceqa,relying either on the exemption from ceqa that applies when it is certain an activity will not have a significant environmental impact citation,or the categorical exemptions for actions taken to protect natural resources citation or to protect the environment citation.kostka zischke,practice under the cal.environmental quality act ed.
rulemaking proceedings can not be found exempt,however,when the rule has the effect of weakening environmental standards.citations.even a new regulation that strengthens some environmental requirements may not be entitled to an exemption if the new requirements could result in other potentially significant effects.citations.kostka zischke,practice under the cal.environmental quality act,supra.
for example,in bay area air quality management dist.th,d,disapproved on other grounds in western states petroleum superior court,supra,cal th at page,footnote,d,an air quality management district adopted regulations that required new control measures for the emission of volatile organic compounds vocs from paint and other architectural coatings,at,d.the plaintiffs presented evidence that the new regulations require d lower quality products.as a result,more product w ould be used,which w ould lead to a net increase in voc emissions.id.at,d.the district took the position that its adoption of the regulations was categorically exempt,citing,among other things,the class exemption.id.at,d.it argued that the regulations constitute d more stringent standards for voc and thus can not be said to have created an adverse change.id.at,d.
the appellate court rejected the district exemption claim the only evidence in rebuttal to that presented by plaintiffs is a staff response t hat concludes t he staff disagrees with the assertion that implementation of the suggested control measures will result in an emissions increase due to increased thinning,more frequent recoating and increased incidence of job failures.thus,the staff disagrees with the contention that implementation will have adverse environmental impacts.this conclusion is based on the fact there was no supporting data for plaintiffs claims.thus,rejection of plaintiffs claims is predicated on lack of the very information which would be provided by an eir.since the staff likewise was unable to produce evidence of no adverse impact,the district can not say with certainty there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment.citation.bay area air quality management,supra,th at,d.
ordinarily,as noted earlier,we review a categorical exemption finding under the substantial evidence standard.great oaks water santa clara valley water,supra,th at,d.the district exemption claim,however,was based not so much on evidence as on logic.if that logic is flawed,or if it is contrary to the evidence,the claim must fail.
the district reasoned,in part,that rule is positive to the environment,as it will encourage additional road paving with commensurate reduction in particulate emissions from unpaved road dust entrainment.this overlooks the fact that rule merely provides for road paving as an offset for new,increased emissions.moreover,it does so in a ratio.thus,even assuming that road dust is environmentally indistinguishable from other and road paving itself has no deleterious environmental effects,the net effect is,at best,a push.and if either of these assumptions is false,the net effect would be negative.
the district also reasoned that rule permits applicants to seek offsets for road paving,but does not require them to do so if and when an applicant seeks such offsets,the application will be subject to further environmental review.in response to plaintiffs comments,it added that environmental review at this point would be unduly speculative.
this argument flows from the district narrow view of the relevant project as strictly limited to the adoption of rule.as already noted,however,t he term project,means the whole of an action which has a potential for physical impact on the environment,and t he term project refers to the underlying activity and not the governmental approval process.citation.citation.orinda board of supervisors d.here,the underlying activity was road paving when performed by applicants for the purpose of obtaining the district approval of offsets in the process of new source review.the approval of rule was the first step in a process of obtaining governmental approval for such road paving.
under ceqa definition of a project,although a project may go through several approval stages,the environmental review accompanying the first discretionary approval must evaluate the impacts of the ultimate development authorized by that approval.this prevents agencies from chopping a large project into little ones,each with a minimal impact on the environment,to avoid full environmental disclosure.citations.it is irrelevant that the development may not receive all necessary entitlements or may not be built.piecemeal environmental review that ignores the environmental impacts of the end result is not permitted.citations.kostka zischke,practice under the cal.environmental quality act,supra.
the scope of review under ceqa is not confined to immediate effects but extends to reasonably foreseeable indirect physical changes to the environment.citations.an agency action is not exempt from ceqa simply because it will not have an immediate or direct effect on the environment.ceqa applies if it is reasonably foreseeable that environmental impacts will ultimately result.citations.kostka zischke,practice under the cal.environmental quality act,supra.
in the classic case of bozung local agency formation com.cal d,the supreme court defined the issue before it as whether ceqa applies to the approval of annexation proposals by a local agency formation commission lafco,where property development is intended to follow the annexation approval
