opinion of the court 
american premier underwriters,appeals the entry of a consent decree that resolves the liability of consolidated rail corporation conrail,national railroad passenger corporation amtrak,and southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority septa for environmental contamination at the paoli rail yard in paoli,pennsylvania.american premier,a defendant,argues that the decree unfairly allocates responsibility for cleanup at the site and that the contribution protection it provides to the settling parties is not permitted under the relevant statute.we affirm.
operations that involved the service,repair,and storage of rail cars were conducted at paoli rail yard from until the beginning of.in the,electric rail cars that used dielectric fluid to cool their transformers were first stored and maintained at the yard.dielectric fluid contains polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs.pcbs,which pose substantial risks to human health and the environment,are released during the servicing of train transformers and volatilize if overheated during train operation.operations at the yard allegedly caused pcb contamination throughout the rail yard property.the contamination eventually spread to other nearby properties through erosion.
from until,american premier and its predecessors owned and operated the rail yard.pursuant to the regional rail reorganization act of,american premier conveyed the yard to conrail on april.that same day,conrail conveyed the yard to amtrak.amtrak still owns the property.conrail operated the yard from april,until the end of.septa then took over the yard operation,using it to maintain commuter trains from until january,when it moved its maintenance operations to a different location.septa gradually phased out the use of dielectric fluid that contained pcbs,ending its use in.
in,epa representatives observed that access to the rail yard was unrestricted and that people walked through and children played in areas at and near the rail yard.they also saw signs of erosion indicating water runoff from the yard into nearby residential areas.sampling revealed pcb contamination in the rail yard and residential soils and in the fish in nearby creeks.
the following year,the united states brought this action against septa,conrail,and amtrak collectively,the rail companies pursuant to,inter alia,sections,a,and of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,a,and.the government sought injunctive relief and reimbursement of response costs in connection with the release of pcbs at the site.the commonwealth of pennsylvania intervened as a plaintiff later that year 
in june,the united states,conrail,and septa petitioned the district court that had overseen american premier bankruptcy reorganization to establish their right to proceed against american premier.see in re penn cent.transp,cir.american premier argument that the earlier reorganization discharged the cercla claims was ultimately unsuccessful.see id.at.in,the united states filed a separate action against american premier,and the rail companies brought american premier into this action as a defendant.american premier then sought a declaratory judgment that the government claims were barred by a settlement agreement that resolved claims between american premier and the united states arising from the valuation of american premier rail assets conveyed pursuant to the regional rail reorganization act.see penn cent.united states.the court granted summary judgment to the government on this issue.see id.at.
since the government initiated this action,it has entered into five partial preliminary consent decrees with the rail companies under which they agreed to perform a variety of remedies at the site.in,septa agreed to construct a combination fence that restricted access to the rail yard and limited further pcb migration into the area surrounding the yard.later that year,all three rail companies agreed to conduct an engineering study addressing erosion and pcb migration from the rail yard and identifying possible remedies to limit the spread of pcbs.a dispute arose between the united states and the rail companies over the work necessary to implement the study,and epa ended up constructing sedimentation basins and erosion control systems and removing and disposing of contaminated soil from several residential properties.under the third partial preliminary consent decree,the rail companies conducted a remedial investigation to determine the extent of pcb contamination at the site and a feasibility study of various remedial alternatives.as part of this decree,septa entered into a stipulation that addressed worker protection at the rail yard and decontamination of the car shop,a building in which rail cars had been repaired since.under the fourth partial preliminary consent decree,the rail companies agreed to conduct a soil sampling program to determine the extent of pcb contamination in the residential areas and the surface water channels north of the rail yard.finally,under the last partial decree,the rail companies excavated approximately cubic yards of contaminated soils from the residential area north of the yard.all told,the rail companies spent approximately million on remedial action related to the site before entering into the consent decree that is the subject of this appeal.
epa placed the paoli rail yard site on the national priorities list in.in july,epa issued a record of decision that reviewed remedial alter natives and their projected costs and selected remedies for the site.as modified,the record of decision requires excavation and treatment of contaminated rail yard soils estimated cost,groundwater treatment and fuel oil recovery estimated cost,decontamination and demolition of rail yard buildings and structures estimated cost,excavation of contaminated residential soils estimated cost,and excavation of contaminated stream sediments estimated cost.
in,epa proposed a consent decree that would require all four defendants to clean up the rail yard by carrying out the first three remedies from the record of decision,while leaving american premier responsible for cleaning up the watershed by carrying out the last two remedies.
in february,american premier offered to pay of past and future remediation costs at the site as part of a global settlement.american premier told the rail companies not to view the proposal as a typical opening bid,thus intimating that it would not be willing to increase its settlement offer.the rail companies responded that they were disappointed with the offer and that they believed that american premier had sorely misjudged the probable outcome if the parties were to litigate.the united states was similarly unsatisfied with the offer.
on september,epa issued a unilateral administrative order requiring american premier to implement the remedies from the record of decision related to the watershed portion of the site.under this order,american premier is responsible for the excavation of residential soils and stream sediments.together,these remedies are estimated to cost.
on july,the united states filed a praecipe to lodge consent decree,with the proposed decree resolving the rail companies liability to the united states and the commonwealth for contamination at the site.the consent decree contends that the degree of involvement by american premier in the disposal of hazardous substances and the operation at the site is at least equal to or maybe greater than the degree of involvement by all the settling parties combined.it requires the rail companies to excavate and contain the rail yard soils,perform the groundwater treatment and fuel oil recovery,and decontaminate and demolish rail yard buildings and structures.together,these remedies are estimated to cost.the decree also requires several payments by the rail companies to the epa hazardous substance superfund to reimburse past response costs,to the commonwealth to reimburse past response costs,and for natural resource damages.
the decree gives contribution protection to the rail companies for the past,interim,and future response costs of the united states and the comm
