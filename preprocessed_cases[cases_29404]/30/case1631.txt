we must decide whether two county zoning ordinances relating to the permissible locations for timber operations are preempted by state forestry statutes.concluding they are not,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
background 
in,the board of supervisors of the county of santa cruz county adopted several ordinances that would have affected timber harvesting operations in the county.as pertinent here,county ordinances restricted timber harvesting to specified zone districts within the county santa cruz county res.santa cruz county ord.hereafter the zone district ordinance,barred timber harvesting operations in certain areas adjacent to streams and residences santa cruz county ord.hereafter the stream ordinance,and limited the parcels on which helicopter operations associated with such harvesting could occur santa cruz county ord.hereafter the helicopter ordinance.county also requested and obtained from the california coastal commission a ruling certifying the zone district ordinance as an amendment to county local coastal program.
plaintiffs big creek lumber and homer mccrary jointly big creek and the central coast forest association,a nonprofit association of landowners and forestry professionals in the county,filed a petition for writ of mandate against county and the california coastal commission,challenging county ordinances and the commission certification of the zone district ordinance as a local coastal program amendment.plaintiffs petition alleged that county and the california coastal commission actions violated the california environmental quality act pub.resources code,et and county ordinances violated the doctrine of preemption.
the preemption claim was bifurcated and heard separately.the trial court found in favor of plaintiffs except as to the zone district ordinance.on appeal,the court of appeal invalidated county ordinances in their entirety.we granted county petition for review of the court of appeal invalidation of the helicopter and zone district ordinances 
discussion 
the zone district ordinance amends county zoning laws to restrict timber harvesting operations to areas zoned for timber production,mineral extraction industrial,or parks,recreation and open space.the helicopter ordinance requires that helicopter staging,loading,and servicing facilities associated with timber operations be located either on a parcel of land zoned for timber harvesting or on a parcel adjacent to such,and within the boundaries of a timber harvesting plan that has been approved by the california department of forestry and fire protection.
plaintiffs argue that the ordinances are preempted by the nejedly forest practice act of fpa pub.resources code,et and the california timberland productivity act of tpa,et.for the following reasons,we conclude that county ordinances are not preempted.
overview state forestry law 
the forest practice act 
timber harvesting operations in this state must be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the forest practice act.the act was intended to create and maintain a comprehensive system for regulating timber harvesting in order to achieve two goals sierra club state bd.of forestry cal th,d,to restore,enhance,and maintain the productivity of timberlands where feasible and to achieve the maximum sustained production of timber products,while giving consideration to values relating to recreation,watershed,wildlife,range and forage,fisheries,regional economic vitality,employment,and aesthetic enjoyment see.
as originally enacted in,the fpa permitted individual counties to adopt stricter rules and regulations governing timber operations than those provided under the fpa.stats,ch,adding former.in,the legislature amended the fpa stats,ch,to provide instead that counties may recommend to the california board of forestry and fire protection board additional forest practice rules and regulations,subds.a,b but,except with respect to performance bonds or other surety for road protection,counties are forbidden to regulate the conduct of timber operations,subd.d hereafter section d 
pursuant to the fpa,timber operations are controlled by means of a timber harvesting plan that must be submitted to the state forestry department before timber operations may commence.and.the legislature has specified that the plan include the name and address of the timber owner and the timber operator,a description of the land upon which the work is proposed to be done,a description of the silviculture methods to be applied,an outline of the methods to mitigate erosion caused by operations performed in the vicinity of a stream,the provisions,if any,to protect any unique area within the area of operations,and the anticipated dates for commencement and completion of operations,subds.a g.sierra club state bd.of forestry,supra,cal th at,d.the director of the state forestry department,and the board on appeal,review timber harvesting plans for compliance with the fpa and applicable regulations.
the timberland productivity act 
the tpa,as amended in stats,ch,reflects state policy,inter alia,that timber operations conducted in a manner consistent with forest practice rules adopted by the board shall not be or become restricted or prohibited due to any land use in or around the locality of those operations,subd.b the tpa seeks to implement that policy by including all qualifying timberland in timberland production zones.timberland,the legislature has stated,means privately owned land,or land acquired for state forest purposes,which is devoted to and used for growing and harvesting timber,or for growing and harvesting timber and compatible uses,and which is capable of growing an average annual volume of wood fiber of at least cubic feet per acre,subd.f.
in order to accomplish its purposes,the tpa relies on tax incentives and zoning mandates.the tpa restricts land in certain timberland production zones tpz to the growing and harvesting of timber and compatible uses.see.in exchange,owners of land in a tpz benefit by lower property tax valuations that reflect the enforceable statutory restrictions.see cal,art.xiii,legislature may tax certain land consistently with use restrictions.
the tpa predecessor statute stats,ch,dictated timberland preserve zoning for certain list a parcels that were assessed for growing and harvesting timber as the highest and best use.exceptions to mandatory zoning of list a properties were permitted where a parcel in fact was not used for timber growing and harvesting,or where the owner contested the zoning and local officials found exclusion to be in the public interest,subds.a,b.timberland preserve zoning also was dictated for certain other timberlands,called list b parcels,that were not at that time assessed for growing and harvesting timber as the highest and best use.exceptions to mandatory zoning of list b properties were permitted only where local officials found exclusion to be in the public interest,subd.c.initial determinations as to parcels placement on list a and list b were to have been completed by,subds.a,b,c.
since,additional timberland production zoning has been initiated by petition of the property owner.the tpa also provides for rezoning and for removal of parcels from timberland production zoning.see.
preemption principles 
the party claiming that general state law preempts a local ordinance has the burden of demonstrating preemption.see,kucera lizza th,d.we have been particularly reluctant to infer legislative intent to preempt a field covered by municipal regulation when there is a significant local interest to be served that may differ from one locality to another.fisher city of berkeley cal d,see also great western shows,county of los angeles cal th,d.the common thread of the cases is that if there is a significant local interest to be served which may differ from one locality to another then the presumption favors the validity of the local ordinance against an attack of state preemption.gluck county of los angeles d,citing,inter alia,galvan superior court cal d.
thus,when local government regulates in an area over which it traditionally has exercised control,such as the location of particular land uses,california courts will presume,absent a clear indication of preemptive intent from the legislature,that such regulation is not preempted by state statute.see it solano county bd.of supervisors cal th,d.the presumption against preemption accords with our more general understanding that it is not to be presumed that the legislature in the enactment of statutes intends to overthrow principles of law unless such intention is made clearly to appear either by express declaration or by necessary implication.county of los angeles frisbie cal d,accord,people davenport cal d,theodor superior court cal d.
moreover,the general principles governing state statutory preemption of local land use regulation are well settled.the legislature has specified certain minimum standards for local zoning regulations,et even though it also has carefully expressed its intent to retain the maximum degree of local control see.it solano county bd.of supervisors,supra,cal th at,d.a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.cal,art.xi,italics added.local legislation in conflict with general law is void.conflicts exist if the ordinance duplicates citations,contradicts citation,or enters an area fully occupied by general law,either expressly or by legislative implication citations.morehart county of santa barbara cal th,d.
local legislation is duplicative of general law when it is coextensive therewith and contradictory to general law when it is inimical thereto.local legislation enters an area fully occupied by general law when the legislature has expressly manifested its intent to fully occupy the area or when it has impliedly done so in light of recognized indicia of intent.great western shows,county of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d.
c.the zone district ordinance 
plaintiffs contend the zone district ordinance is preempted by section d of the fpa.with exceptions not relevant here,section d provides that individual counties shall not regulate the conduct of timber operations or require the issuance of any permit or license for those operations.as neither ordinance at issue requires the issuance of any permit or license,this case concerns the import of the statutory phrase conduct of timber operations.
in big creek lumber county of san mateo th,d big creek san mateo,the court of appeal held that section d does not deprive california counties of authority to zone timberland outside tpz for uses other than timber production.the court of appeal acknowledged that section d mandates that the conduct of timber harvesting operations be governed exclusively by state law,but held that san mateo county ordinance,which restricted the location of commercial timber harvesting,did not offend the statute because it spoke not to how timber operations may be conducted,but rather to where they may take place.big creek san mateo,at,d.the court also noted that numerous provisions of california forestry law reveal the legislature intention to preserve local zoning authority.see id.at,d,citing statutes.harmonizing the fpa and the tpa,the court concluded that the legislature did not intend to preclude counties from using their zoning authority to prohibit timber cutting on lands outside tpz.id.at,d.for the following reasons,we agree.
traditional local zoning power 
land use regulation in california historically has been a function of local government under the grant of police power contained in article xi,section of the california constitution we have recognized that a city or county power to control its own land use decisions derives from this inherent police power,not from the delegation of authority by the state.devita county of napa cal th,d.and the legislature,when enacting state zoning laws,has declared its intention to provide only a minimum of limitation in order that counties and cities may exercise the maximum degree of control over local zoning matters,quoting.
thus,t he power of cities and counties to zone land use in accordance with local conditions is well entrenched.it solano county bd.of supervisors,supra,cal th at,d.in enacting zoning ordinances,the municipality performs a legislative function,and every intendment is in favor of the validity of such ordinances.lockard city of los angeles cal d.
express preemption 
in the fpa,the legislature directed the board to divide the state into districts and adopt forest practice rules and regulations for each district no timber operations may be conducted without submission of a timber harvesting plan and approval by the director of forestry and fire protection or by the board on appeal,see generally big creek san mateo,supra,th at,d.and,as noted,while individual counties may recommend regulations to the board,subd.a,they may not regulate the conduct of timber operations d.the question of express preemption turns on whether the field the legislature has occupied in so providing encompasses the county zone district ordinance.see morehart county of santa barbara,supra,cal th at,d.our primary task when interpreting a statute is to determine the legislature intent.brown kelly broadcasting cal d.we turn first to the statutory language,since the words the legislature chose are the best indicators of its intent.adoption of kelsey cal th,d.
section d contains no express reference to zoning,nor does it bar localities in terms from regulating the location of timber operations.rather,counties are forbidden to regulate the conduct of timber operations.as the court in big creek san mateo pointed out,in common parlance an ordinance that avoids speaking to how timber operations may be conducted and addresses only where they may take place falls short of being a clear attempt to regulate the conduct thereof.big creek san mateo,supra,th at,d desert turf club board of supervisors d,that state has occupied field of horse racing regulation does not deprive county of right to adopt zoning restrictions on placement of racetracks.nevertheless,as the court of appeal below recognized,to the extent zoning by definition may have the consequence of excluding logging from some locations,it may in that sense be said to regulate that activity,at least in the excluded locations.
when as here a statute is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,we look to extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.hoechst celanese franchise tax bd.cal th,d,see also it solano county bd.of supervisors,supra,cal th at,d.in this case,such indicia support the construction of section d adopted by the court of appeal in big creek san mateo,supra,th,d.
first,in many places where it addresses timberland zoning,general state forestry law expressly preserves and plainly contemplates the exercise of local authority.the actual designation of tpz,for example,is left to local action,subds.a,c,g see,on or before march,list a on or before march,list b and current.owners of parcels desiring tpz zoning must petition local authorities,subd.a.if the parcel does not meet state timber stocking standards and forest practice rules,the owner must agree to do so within five years,subd.c a,and,if the owner fails to do so,local authorities are empowered to rezone the parcel ibid.and to specify a new zone for the parcel,which is in conformance with the county general plan and whose primary use is other than timberland,subd.c b.additionally,local bodies are authorized in certain circumstances to rezone tpz parcels,subd.c or convert them to another use,subd.b.
thus,it is clear that the legislature has deferred a number of important zoning decisions to local authority,even in the case of tpz.big creek san mateo,supra,th at,d.certainly neither the tpa nor the fpa suggests localities are restricted in what uses they may prohibit outside tpz zones.big creek san mateo,at,d.nowhere in the statutory scheme,in fact,has the legislature expressly prohibited the use of zoning ordinances id.at,d.
second,section d terminology is not so overshadowing that it obliterates all vestiges of local power as to a subject where municipalities have traditionally enjoyed a broad measure of autonomy.waste resource technologies of public health th,d discussing authority to grant refuse disposal permits.that the legislature intended the phrase regulate the conduct in section d to preclude only local regulations that affect how timber operations are conducted is borne out by the kinds of issues the board,under the rubric of the conduct of timber operations,is in its rules and regulations statutorily required to address.see.fire prevention and control,soil erosion control,site preparation,water quality and watershed control,flood control,disease prevention and control ibid.these clearly are matters relating to the process of carrying out timber operations.see big creek san mateo,supra,th at,d.
third,the legislative history of the fpa does not support plaintiffs expansive reading of section d.although plaintiff big creek suggests the legislature purpose was to substitute for local regulation procedures whereby the board would adopt rules addressing local concerns,the available legislative history contains no discussion of county zoning authority or its relation to regulation of the conduct of logging operations.big creek san mateo,supra,th at,d.
of greater import is that section d was added to the fpa during the same legislative session in which the tpa was amended.see stats,ch,adding and,ch.that the legislature would,in the same legislative session,include in one general forestry statute numerous provisions that rely upon local zoning authority see,and when amending another general forestry statute forbid localities exercise of such authority seems unlikely.see garvey byram cal d,concerning reenactment of former with minor amendments during the same legislative session in which former was enacted people black cal d,provisions relating to same subject enacted at same legislative session should be consistently construed.
the history of the legislation that added section d to the fpa confirms that one of its purposes was to influence local zoning agencies in the exercise of their authority.a tpz designation puts county residents on notice that timber operations are expected to occur on the parcel,subd.b,inter alia to discourage expansion of urban services into timberland,subd.a.by restricting timber harvesting to timberland production,mineral extraction industrial,and park,recreation and open space zone districts,county zone district ordinance encourages timberland owners who desire to harvest their timber to rezone their property to one of these permitted zone districts.this in turn advances the legislature objective of including all qualifying timberland in timberland production zones.
fourth,construing section d so as to encompass every local regulation of timber operations without regard to whether the regulation purports to control the process or manner of carrying out such operations would not account for the legislature having included the phrase the conduct of in the fpa express preemption provision.as the united states supreme court has reminded us,each phrase within an express preemption provision limits the universe of local action by the statute.lorillard tobacco reilly,d,italics added.plaintiffs proposed reading of section d would give the phrase the conduct of no limiting effect on the universe of local action preempted by that statute.
plaintiffs reading of section d also would violate the fundamental rule that c ourts should give meaning to every word of a statute if possible,and should avoid a construction making any word surplusage arnett dal cielo cal th,d.one effect of plaintiffs reading would be to render the fpa definition of timberland see partly surplusage.as previously noted,for the purposes of the fpa with exceptions not pertinent,timberland means land which is available for,and capable of,growing a crop of trees of any commercial species used to produce lumber and other forest products ibid.the phrase available for would be superfluous if the definition were read to include any land that is capable of growing qualified trees,but that is what plaintiffs implicitly urge by suggesting that section d displaces counties traditional power to declare which parcels among all those capable of growing trees are available for timbering.
when the legislature wishes expressly to preempt all regulation of an activity,it knows how to do so.for example,the legislature has provided in the tpa that p arcels zoned as timberland production,located in tpz shall be zoned so as to restrict their use to growing timber and to compatible uses.the growing and harvesting of timber on those parcels shall be regulated solely pursuant to state statutes and regulations,italics added.one implication of this provision,of course,is that the growing and harvesting of timber on parcels need not be regulated solely pursuant to state statutes and regulations.
moreover,to read section d as precluding all local zoning control over timber operations could lead to absurd results.such a reading,for example,apparently would require cities and counties to allow commercial logging even in residential districts.neither the language of the statute nor its legislative history supports such a reading.see big creek san mateo,supra,th at,d.
the legislature has had ample opportunity over the past decade to amend section d to abrogate or modify the court of appeal construction of the statutory phrase regulate the conduct of timber operations in big creek san mateo.yet,notwithstanding it has amended the fpa in numerous other particulars every year since that decision was filed,it has not done so.several california judicial decisions,moreover,have relied on big creek san mateo in the intervening years where a statute has been construed by judicial decision,and that construction is not altered by subsequent legislation,it must be presumed that the legislature is aware of the judicial construction and approves of it.wilkoff superior court cal d.the legislature failure to amend section d,while not conclusive,may be presumed to signify legislative acquiescence in the big creek san mateo decision.people leahy cal th,d,citing numerous authorities.
for the foregoing reasons,we agree with the court of appeal in big creek san mateo that the conduct of timber harvesting operations is exclusively governed by state law.conduct however is not given a specialized definition in the fpa.its ordinary meaning is the act,manner,or process of carrying out as a task or carrying forward as a business,government,or war.big creek san mateo,supra,th at,d.accordingly,local zoning ordinances,like the county zone district ordinance,that speak to the location of timber operations but not to the manner in which they are carried out,are not expressly preempted by section d.
implied preemption 
the legislature preemptive action in specific and expressly limited areas weighs against an inference that preemption by implication was intended elsewhere.it solano county bd.of supervisors,supra,cal th at,d,see also cipollone liggett group,d congress enactment of a provision defining the reach of a statute implies that matters beyond that reach are not.in addition,and specifically pertinent here,p reemption by implication of legislative intent may not be found when the legislature has expressed its intent to permit local regulations.similarly,it should not be found when the statutory scheme recognizes local regulations.people ex rel.deukmejian county of mendocino cal d.
both these bars to implied preemption are present.by expressly preempting local regulations targeting the conduct of timber operations,section d implicitly permits local regulations addressed to other aspects of timber operations.and,as has been explained,general forestry particular,the recognizes local zoning authority.notwithstanding we might,therefore,forgo applying the test for implied preemption applicable when state statutes do not recognize local regulations,applying that test buttresses our conclusion that county ordinances are not preempted.
in determining whether the legislature has preempted by implication to the exclusion of local regulation we must look to the whole purpose and scope of the legislative scheme.people ex rel.deukmejian county of mendocino,supra,cal d at.implied preemption occurs when general law so completely covers the subject as to clearly indicate the matter is exclusively one of state concern general law partially covers the subject in terms clearly indicating a paramount state concern that will not tolerate further local action or general law partially covers the subject and the adverse effect of a local ordinance on transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible municipal benefit.ibid.
a complete coverage 
plaintiffs contend the legislature has demonstrated its intent to preempt all local restrictions on timber harvesting by fully occupying the field of timber harvesting regulation.plaintiffs first note the legislature statement of intent,when enacting the fpa,to create and maintain an effective and comprehensive system of regulation and use of all timberlands.invoking the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius,they argue that certain provisions of the fpa recognizing limited local authority to regulate timber operations indicate that local authority is otherwise preempted but as county points out,the legislature adopted section at the same time it adopted a provision authorizing counties to adopt timber harvest rules and regulations stricter than the state rules stats,ch,adding former,so the general statement of intent in section can not have been intended to preempt local restrictions by occupying the field.
moreover,plaintiffs expressio unius argument implicitly assumes the statutory preemption of local rules that regulate the conduct of timber operations encompasses geographic zoning restrictions on the location of such operations.but because,as demonstrated,section d does not have that broad meaning,the legislature had no need to exempt traditional county zoning power from the section preemptive scope hence,the presence of statutory exceptions to fpa preemption demonstrates nothing about the legislature intent respecting counties exercise of that power.
to summarize,general forestry law preempts local regulation of the conduct of timber operations but otherwise expressly contemplates retention of local zoning authority.l ocalities must designate certain lands as tpz.these zones are dedicated to timber growing and harvesting,and localities may not prohibit logging on them.as to other lands that may contain timber,the tpa expressly reaffirms local authority to choose appropriate zoning.local legislative bodies retain authority to exclude from the tpz certain parcels when they believe exclusion is in the public interest.citation.localities also retain the authority to choose the zones into which excluded or removed parcels are placed.big creek san mateo,supra,th at,d.
we observe,further,that california planning and zoning law,et contemplates the continuation of local government traditional zoning authority in connection with timber resources.in adopting that law,the legislature specified that localities should exercise the maximum degree of control over local zoning matters,inter alia by designating the location and extent of the uses of the land,subd.a and including the conservation,development,and utilization of forests in their general plans,subd.d.the planning and zoning law also requires counties to adopt in their general plans land use elements that d esignate,in a land use category that provides for timber production those parcels of real property zoned for timberland production pursuant to the tpa,subd.a,italics added,thus implicitly acknowledging the potential for locally designated land use categories that do not provide for timber production.
in sum,this is not a case in which the subject matter of where logging can occur has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern.people ex rel.deukmejian county of mendocino,supra,cal d at.
b partial state concern 
plaintiffs argue that even if the state has not fully occupied the field of timber operations regulation,it has a paramount interest in determining the location of such operations.they point to the fpa requirements that the board adopt rules and regulations governing the conduct of timber operations,that any person seeking to conduct timber operations submit and have approved a timber harvesting plan,and that such plans contain a description of the land on which the work is proposed to be done,subd.c.they point also to the board enactment of several rules that restrict the harvesting activities that may be conducted in particular types of terrain.
we disagree with plaintiffs that either the legislature having directed the board to adopt rules governing the conduct of timber operations or the board having adopted such rules,impliedly displaces any more than it expressly does so traditional local authority to zone permissible locations for timber operations.surely,l ogging,even when conducted according to state regulations,may have some impacts properly addressed by the local zoning authority.that the state has sought to reduce and control these same occurrences through general regulation does not preempt local zoning control,any more than the state and federal regulation of industrial air pollution would preclude a local zoning authority from relying on air pollution as a reason for excluding industrial plants from residential districts.big creek san mateo,supra,th at,d.
the attorney general reached a similar conclusion over years ago,when addressing analogous circumstances.see county zoning ordinances.asked whether a marin county zoning ordinance purporting to bar commercial logging,mining,quarrying,and drilling,together with all associated uses,activities and structures,in certain areas of the county id.at was preempted by general state laws including forestry laws governing the zoned activities,the attorney general concluded it was not.it is true,the attorney general reasoned,that california has numerous laws regulating each of the activities prohibited by the proposed ordinance.however,these laws do nothing to preclude an otherwise valid zoning ordinance which prohibits extraction of the resource in question.id.at.
specifically with respect to the field of commercial logging county zoning ordinances,supra.at,the attorney general in evaluating marin county ordinance stated the forest practice act then,together with the forest practice rules comprehensively regulate forest practices so as to occupy the entire field of forest practices and local ordinances with respect to such general practices,are invalid due to such preemption in our opinion,however,this area is not so broad as to invalidate a zoning ordinance which prohibits logging where such prohibition is otherwise reasonable.ibid.
for similar reasons we conclude that today general forestry statutes and regulations fall short of indicat ing clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action people ex rel.deukmejian county of mendocino,supra,cal d at,respecting the location of timber operations.
c partial effect on transient citizens 
plaintiffs overriding concern appears to be that localities may by locational zoning prohibit timber harvesting altogether.the ordinance before us does not have that effect,nor does it appear that any county has attempted such a result the zone district ordinance permits timber harvesting on parcels zoned timberland production,mineral extraction industrial,and parks,recreation and open space.to require that commercial timber harvesting occur on land in a timberland production or other specified zone is no more a ban on timber harvesting than a regulation requiring that industrial land uses occur on land zoned industrial is a ban on factories.county concedes that landowners wishing to harvest timber may apply to county for approval to rezone parcels to tpz and that county may not deny tpz rezoning to any qualifying parcel,subd.a,nor may county prohibit timber harvesting in tpz 
we previously have explained that a local ordinance is not impliedly preempted by conflict with state law unless it mandate s what state law expressly forbids,or forbid s what state law expressly mandates.great western shows,county of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d.that is because,when a local ordinance does not prohibit what the statute commands or command what it prohibits,the ordinance is not inimical to the statute.city of los angeles cal th,d.here,county ordinances are not impliedly preempted by conflict with state forestry law because it is reasonably possible for a timber operator to comply with both.
the zone district ordinance does not mandate what general forestry law forbids or forbid what general forestry law mandates.while the forestry laws generally encourage maximum sustained production of timber products while giving consideration to competing values,they do not require that every harvestable tree be cut.accordingly,county zoning ordinance does not conflict with state law simply because it may have the effect of placing some trees,at least temporarily,off limits to logging nor does it appear the board has adopted for santa cruz,or any other county,rules that comprehensively address appropriate geographical locations within the county for timber harvesting.
in sum,plaintiffs have not identified a clear statement by the legislature of an intent,when enacting the fpa,to preempt traditional local zoning authority over the location of timber operations.accordingly,and for all the foregoing reasons,we conclude,as did the court of appeal in big creek san mateo,that the legislature did not intend to preclude counties from using their zoning authority to prohibit timber cutting on lands outside the tpz big creek san mateo,supra,th at,d.
d.the helicopter ordinance 
like the zone district ordinance specification of permissible zone districts for timber harvesting,county helicopter ordinance is a locational zoning provision that regulates not how timber operations may be conducted,but rather where they may take place.see big creek san mateo,supra,th at,d.the helicopter ordinance does not attempt to locally regulate the removal of timber,as it speaks neither to whether nor how helicopters may be used to remove timber.county concedes it lacks authority to prohibit timber removal by helicopters or to regulate the manner in which any such removal is conducted.the helicopter ordinance requires simply that any helicopter staging,loading,and servicing facilities associated with timber operations be located either on a parcel of land zoned for timber harvesting or on a parcel adjacent to such,and within the borders of an approved timber harvesting plan.
for the reasons reviewed in detail helicopter ordinance is preempted neither expressly by section d nor impliedly by general state forestry law.in the case of the helicopter ordinance,which county apparently enacted to address citizens fears created by helicopters transporting logs by air over or near their neighborhoods,and citizen concerns with throbbing and unbearable noise,the conclusion is buttressed by the fact that both the fpa and the tpa expressly contemplate the survival of localities power to abate nuisances endangering public health or safety.see especially pub.resources code,subds.a,b.
specifically,the fpa provides that n o provision of the fpa or any ruling,requirement,or policy of the b oard is a limitation on the power of any city or county or city and county to declare,prohibit,and abate nuisances.pub.resources code,subd.a.and the tpa provides that,while timber operations conducted within a tpz pursuant to the fpa shall not constitute a nuisance,subd.a,that limitation is inapplicable to any timber operation that endangers public health or public safety or prohibits the free passage or use of any navigable lake,river,bay,stream,canal,or basin,or any public park,street,or highway,subd.b.see also,definition of nuisance closely mirrors language preserving power in,subd.b.
disposition 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.
i respectfully dissent.the majority pulls an interpretive rabbit out of a statutory hat by construing public resources code section,subdivision d part of the nejedly forest practice act of et fpa,as preempting only limitations on how timber operations occur,and not local restrictions on where these activities take place.this interpretation can not be reconciled with the language and purpose of section,subdivision d with the fpa generally or with common sense.the distinction that the majority draws between county resolutions,rules,and ordinances regulating how logging transpires,and measures controlling where it takes place,breaks down upon passing scrutiny and provides a roadmap for those who would use technical artifices to evade the letter and spirit of the fpa.the court of appeal below properly rejected this delusive distinction and concluded that state law preempts the resolutions and ordinances that are at issue here.i agree with the court of appeal,and would affirm.
the disputed resolutions and ordinances were adopted by santa cruz county county in.of the measures presently before us,two combine to limit timber harvesting to particular zone districts santa cruz county res.santa cruz county ord.and the other forbids helicopter staging,service,and loading areas except within certain areas santa cruz county ord.the question presented here concerns whether these enactments are preempted by the fpa and,in particular,by section,subdivision d.this subdivision states that,except for exercising authority delegated to them by the state board of forestry and fire protection board of forestry to require bonds or other surety for the protection of roads,individual counties shall not otherwise regulate the conduct of timber operations,as defined by this chapter,or require the issuance of any permit or license for those operations.ibid.
to ascertain the meaning of this language,we look to the intent of the legislature in enacting the law,being careful to give the statute words their plain,commonsense meaning.citation.if the language of the statute is not ambiguous,the plain meaning controls and resort to extrinsic sources to determine the legislature intent is unnecessary.citation.additionally,we must interpret section,subdivision d in context with the entire statute and the statutory scheme.citation.in re jennings cal th,d.
following these principles,it is important to note at the outset that the preemption provision replaced a statutory scheme that allowed for county regulation of timber operations above and beyond that undertaken by the state.the fpa is designed to create and maintain an effective and comprehensive system of regulation and use of all timberlands.toward this purpose,the fpa creates an architecture for state control over timber operations.as originally enacted,the fpa also allowed counties to,within the reasonable exercise of their police power adopt rules and regulations by ordinance or resolution which are stricter than those provided under this chapter and its regulations.former,added by stats,ch.
by the early,however,some observers regarded county ordinances as having essentially prevented the harvest of timber,contrary to the intent of the fpa.of forestry,enrolled bill on bill reg.sess.this concern prompted a revision of the fpa in that replaced county regulation of timber operations with a system in which counties could recommend rules and regulations to the board of forestry.as signed into law,the amendments deleted the provisions of the fpa that had allowed for stricter local control over timber operations.stats,ch.at the same time,the measure added section to the law.stats,ch.whereas the deleted provisions had endorsed direct local regulation of timber harvesting,section instead allows counties to recommend proposed forestry rules to the board of forestry,thereby channeling local concerns through the state agency with principal responsibility for interpreting the fpa,subd.a.the board of forestry must adopt these proposed rules as regulations if they comport with state law and are necessary to protect the needs and conditions of the proposing county,subd.b.except for this procedure for proposing regulations to the board of forestry,and limited,delegated authority to require surety for the protection of roads,subd.e,the fpa prohibits counties from regulating timber operations.as stated above,individual counties shall not otherwise regulate the conduct of timber operations,as defined by this chapter,or require the issuance of any permit or license for those operations,subd.d.
the plain language of this preemption provision offers no support for the interpretation advanced by big creek lumber county of san mateo th,d big creek i and adopted by the majority,ante,d at,at,to the effect that the statute preempts only county rules,regulations,and ordinances affecting how timber operations occur,while leaving untouched measures addressing where these operations take place.instead,the preemption provision speaks in terms that are expansive enough to leave no doubt that the legislature intended to displace all local rules,ordinances,and resolutions specifically regulating timber operations.section,subdivision d prohibits county regulation of the conduct of timber operations.as big creek i and the decision by the court of appeal below recognized,conduct means the act,manner,or process of carrying out as a task or carrying forward as a business,government,or war.webster third new internat.dict.big creek i,supra,th at,d see also black law dict.ed defining conduct as p ersonal behavior deportment mode of action any positive or negative act.if we substitute this definition of conduct into the statute,section,subdivision d would provide in relevant part individual counties shall not otherwise regulate the act,manner,or process of timber operations,as defined by this chapter,or require the issuance of any permit or license for those operations.the court of appeal below,therefore,accurately discerned that conduct,as used in the statute,necessarily includes the act of doing the task at all.local measures that forbid logging in certain locations regulate the conduct of timber operations in those places in the most fundamental way prohibiting it outright.
the legislature did not draw a line between permissible where and impermissible how ordinances both because such a distinction would have no relationship to the impetus for the amendments and because,in practical fact,no such line can ever be drawn.does an ordinance precluding the method of logging within riparian corridors concern where may take place,or how logging occurs within specified areas clearly it does both.what about an ordinance that precludes the use of heavy machinery within county limits does that ordinance limit how a business may conduct its affairs,by using heavy machinery,or not,or where it may operate,in the county,or not,if it chooses to use that machinery and does an ordinance barring the yarding of felled trees by helicopter become any more permissible if the county achieves the same goal by drafting the measure so that it forbids the placement of helicopter landing pads anywhere in the county 
true,a regulation may superficially purport to address only how or where timber operations take place.but given the aims of the legislature in adding section to the fpa,i find it difficult to believe that section,subdivision d concerns only the form,and not the substance,of county ordinances.to paraphrase the point made by the court of appeal below,the legislature could not have intended to allow counties a continued ability to essentially prohibit the harvest of timber of forestry,enrolled bill on bill reg.sess,supra,at,through the simple expedient of disallowing said harvesting virtually anywhere in the county.and whatever the legislature had in mind in enacting section,subdivision d,i doubt that it intended to create a cottage industry in the drafting of local ordinances that appear to regulate only where timber operations may occur,while in actual practice directing how these operations may take place.
from the above,i conclude that section,subdivision d,on its own,directs affirmance of the court of appeal,for both the zoning ordinance and the helicopter ordinance regulate the conduct of timber operations by directly constraining the act,manner,or process of these operations.yet while the plain language of section,subdivision d suffices to resolve this case,other provisions of the fpa further establish that the distinction espied by the majority was never contemplated by the legislature,and that lawmakers sought to abrogate ordinances similar to those involved here.
as enacted,section included a sunset provision that nullified existing county regulations and ordinances regulating timber operations.the sunset provision provided as follows notwithstanding this section or any other provision of state law,any county which regulated the growing or harvesting of timber or the conduct of timber harvesting operations pursuant to an ordinance,rule,or regulation in effect on january,may continue fully to enforce the ordinance,rule or regulation until july.on and after that date,all such local ordinances,rules and regulations,unless adopted pursuant to this section,shall be null,void,and have no force or effect.former,subd.e,added by stats,ch.this provision on its face renders null and void any and all local ordinances,rules,and regulations which regulate the growing or harvesting of timber or the conduct of timber harvesting operations.the majority regards comparable language as unambiguously manifesting an intent to outlaw all local regulation of timber operations.see,ante,d at,at.the reasoning embraced by the majority thus begs the following question why would the legislature declare all county ordinances,rules,or regulations regarding timber operations null and void in former section,subdivision e,if in the preceding subdivision it only sought to limit local authority over how timber harvesting could take place 
the fpa savings clause,meanwhile,reserves to counties their traditional prerogative of declaring nuisances.see,subd.a.yet neither the savings clause nor any other provision of the fpa mentions zoning or other locational ordinances,except to provide that in situations where timber harvesting undertaken to minimize fire hazards is exempt from the fpa thus averting any possibility of conflicts between the fpa and local ordinances,said harvesting must comply with generic zoning ordinances,subd.j.that the legislature has expressly preserved within the fpa one aspect of local police power nuisance regulation but not another zoning indicates that the omission of the latter was intentional,not accidental,and that zoning designed to limit timber operations does not escape the preemptive scope of section,subdivision d 
the analyses and reports prepared for senate bill legislation that abrogated local regulatory authority over timber operations and added section to the additional light on the legislature intent in enacting the measure.the legislature and its staff framed the preemptive effect of the legislation in broad terms.the conference committee report on this measure provided,in pertinent part,certain counties santa cruz,santa clara,san mateo,sonoma,marin have adopted forest practice rules and regulations which are stricter than those provided under the nejedly forest practice act.this bill would take away that power by preempting counties from exercising local control.conf,on bill reg.sess.similarly,the legislative analyst analysis of the bill provided,this bill r epeals provisions of existing law which authorize counties to regulate timber harvesting more restrictively than provided under the nejedly forest practice act,while noting that the legislation e stablishes an alternate process whereby individual counties may recommend to the board of forestry for adoption new rules and regulations governing timber operations.legis.analyst,analysis of bill reg.sess.may.likewise,the enrolled bill report prepared by the department of forestry and fire protection department of forestry observed that the legislation eliminates the authority of individual counties to regulate timber harvesting operations,and establishes instead a procedure for the board of forestry to adopt rules to cover local concerns.of forestry,enrolled bill on bill reg.sess,supra,at,italics added.noticeably absent from these and other expressions of intent is any indication that the legislature intended to allow counties continued control over where timber harvesting could occur,and eliminate only local authority over how logging operations are performed.
in sum,the legislature enacted section in response to local ordinances that had essentially prevented the harvest of timber,contrary to the intent of the fpa.of forestry,enrolled bill on bill reg.sess,supra,at.consistent with the legislature objective,section,subdivision d prohibits local regulation of the conduct of timber operations.the word conduct,as used in section,subdivision d,includes both the act of doing something and how it is done.and at the same time that the legislature enacted section,it sunsetted all local rules,regulations and ordinances relating to the growing or harvesting of timber or the conduct of timber harvesting operations former,subd.e,using language so sweeping that the majority does not even attempt to address it in my view,these facts establish that section,subdivision d,constrains counties ability to directly regulate timber harvesting,regardless of whether said regulations are better described as affecting how logging operations occur or where they take place.
nonetheless,the majority regards the legislature as having limited only counties authority to regulate how logging transpires.in other words,the majority considers it perfectly acceptable for a county to essentially prevent the harvest of timber of forestry,enrolled bill on bill reg.sess,supra,at,provided a county does so by regulating where timber harvesting occurs,not how it happens.the majority advances several arguments in support of this interpretation of section,subdivision d.none of these contentions withstand scrutiny.
the majority begins by invoking a presumption against state preemption of a field covered by municipal regulation when there is a significant local interest to be served that may differ from one locality to another.fisher city of berkeley cal d.the majority restyles this presumption into a clear indication rule,announcing that when local government regulates in an area over which it traditionally has exercised control,such as the location of particular land uses,california courts will presume,absent a clear indication of preemptive intent from the legislature,that such regulation is not preempted by state statute,ante,d at,at.neither it solano county bd.of supervisors cal th,d,which the majority cites for this principle,nor any other decision by this court has ever so augmented the fisher presumption against state abrogation of local regulations.instead,the approach adopted by the majority appears to draw from the rule applied in cases involving federal preemption of state law.see bronco wine jolly cal th,d.the majority transplants this clear indication rule into the context of state preemption of local regulations,but without considering whether the factors that have led courts to recognize the precept in federal preemption cases apply with equal force here.nor does the majority attempt to devise a coherent approach toward distinguishing those areas in which localities have traditionally exercised control from those in which they have not,except to say that the location of particular land uses generally qualifies as a traditional subject of local regulation.
putting these deficits aside,and leaving for another day the question of whether it is appropriate to employ a clear indication rule in disputes involving state preemption of local regulations,there are several problems with the majority application of this approach here.the majority concludes that the legislature did not clearly indicate its preemptive intent with regard to zoning because section,subdivision d does not refer to zoning or other locational restrictions expressly or in terms,ante,d at,at.but the majority cites no authority that has endorsed or even intimated this magic words approach to statutory interpretation.up until now,it has sufficed for the legislature to make its intentions known in the manner it sees fit,without being required to employ particular terms.the legislature that enacted section,subdivision d could not have foreseen that it had to refer to county zoning or other locational ordinances in terms for a court to later determine that lawmakers meant to preclude these measures.
perhaps more important,the terms approach subtly invades the province and prerogatives of the legislature by requiring lawmakers to embrace particular verbal formulations as a prerequisite to judicial recognition of their avowed intent.our job as jurists is not to make the legislature jump through linguistic hoops of our own capricious design.t he majority does not explain by what authority courts can dictate to legislative drafters the forms in which laws must be written to express the legislative intent.rather,what is required is that the legislature demonstrate its intention with sufficient clarity that a reviewing court can discern and effectuate it.in re pedro,supra,cal th at,d,footnote omitted.
this latter criticism has particular force here,given how the majority has rather arbitrarily chosen the terms it requires.section,subdivision d expressly discusses the substantive terms of the preempted local,they must concern the conduct of timber operations.but the majority rejects this wording as insufficient and unclear.instead,the majority concludes that the legislature should have known that it had to expressly address zoning and locational ordinances in terms for us to discern a preemptive intent.in other words,the required terms involve the manner of regulation,not the substance of these rules.again,how the legislature should have foreseen this nuance is anyone guess.undoubtedly,the legislature will respond to this approach with more detailed and complex statutes that try to anticipate the particular terms courts will require in the future.i do not grasp how this will clarify or otherwise improve the law.
next,the majority claims that the legislature must have intended that the words the conduct of,as used within section,subdivision d,would limit the scope of the preemption provision to how logging occurs otherwise,the majority asserts,this phrasing would constitute mere surplusage,ante,d at at,at.the majority reads too much into these three words.this error leads it to adopt a construction of section,subdivision d so susceptible to abuse and evasion through clever drafting that it violates another principle of statutory interpretation,s uperfluity does not vitiate,a maxim that directs that the presence of arguably unnecessary terms in a statute should not,by itself,produce an interpretation that will defeat the legislature central aims in enacting the law.
in prohibiting local regulation of the conduct of timber operations,the legislature simply echoed phrasing used elsewhere in the fpa.specifically,section states,in pertinent part,that rules and regulations adopted by the board of forestry shall apply to the conduct of timber operations.pursuant to its authority to regulate the conduct of timber operations,the board of forestry controls both how timber harvesting occurs and where it takes place.to take two examples of regulations that affect where logging may occur,the board of forestry has limited timber harvesting in channel zones,tit,subd.e,and near bird nesting sites.the use of the phrase the conduct of in section,therefore,does not cabin the board of forestry regulatory authority only to how timber harvesting occurs.and when the legislature uses the same phrasing in different parts of a statute,all else being equal,we assume that it intends to imbue the terms with the same meaning in each context.people wells cal th,d.this principle means that the identical the conduct of phrasing in,subdivision d,does not limit the preemption provision only to county regulations concerning how logging takes place.
the majority also purports to find support for its interpretation in the california timberland productivity act of tpa,another statute relating to timber harvesting.stats,ch.the tpa seeks to,inter alia,d iscourage premature or unnecessary conversion of timberland to urban and other uses,subd.a and e ncourage investment in timberlands based on reasonable expectation of harvest,subd.a.because conventional taxation methods were regarded as deterring efficient timber operations,the tpa amends but essentially reaffirms a system adopted by a predecessor statute through which timberlands may be placed in timberland preserve zones now referred to as a timberland production zones,or tpz.see,subd.c unkel cromwell,california timber yield tax ecol.parcels designated tpz are assessed for tax purposes based on their value for timber production and compatible uses.see.this scheme thus affords a measure of tax relief to those who grow and harvest timber.
the majority stresses that various provisions of the tpa that relate to tpz designations mention and rely upon local zoning authority,ante,d at,at.while this is an accurate observation,it does little to prove that the legislature countenanced the use of this authority to directly regulate timber operations.neither tpz designations themselves,nor any other reference to zoning within the tpa,suggests that the lawmakers who enacted that statute and the pertinent amendments to the fpa considered it acceptable for counties to use their zoning powers in this specific manner.only section,subdivision d speaks to this subject,and its plain language establishes that the legislature has taken this authority away from counties.
another part of the tpa relied upon by the majority,government code section,provides that p arcels zoned as timberland production shall be zoned so as to restrict their use to growing and harvesting timber and to compatible uses.the growing and harvesting of timber on those parcels shall be regulated solely pursuant to state statutes and regulations.this language,the majority states,expresses an unambiguous legislative intent to preclude local regulation of timber operations,ante,d at,at.i agree,and observe that the sunset provision enacted in as public resources code section,subdivision e,contained similar language,suggesting that the legislature intended with section as well to prevent counties from regulating how or where timber operations may occur.
according to the majority,o ne implication of the language within section,of course,is that the growing and harvesting of timber on parcels need not be regulated solely pursuant to state statutes and regulations,ante,d at,at.this carefully couched phrasing implies,correctly,that alternative implications also exist.the legislature added the second sentence to government code section in the same stroke as it enacted section.see stats,ch.in so doing,the legislature may have intended to reaffirm,within the tpa,the principles endorsed by section,subdivision d.while this may have been unnecessary,the majority reading of section creates surplusage of its own.if,as the majority concludes,section does not disturb local zoning authority,there would have been no need for the legislature to specify,as it has,that timber harvesting conducted for purposes still must comply with local zoning ordinances,subd.j.
the majority also claims that it would be absurd to allow timber harvesting near residential areas,and that the court of appeal analysis would compel such a result,ante,d at,at.this invocation of the absurdity doctrine is.regardless of whether section,subdivision d prohibits other forms of local control over timber operations,counties still may declare certain timber operations to be nuisances,subd.a propose to the board of forestry regulations concerning timber operations,with the board of forestry being required to adopt these proposals if they comport with the fpa,subds.a,b and regulate harvesting on plots of less than three acres that are not given a tpz zoning designation,subd.f.also,the department of forestry regulates timber harvesting through its review and approval of the timber harvesting plans required for virtually all commercial logging.see.the fpa allows santa cruz county to recommend that the board of forestry adopt additional rules and regulations regarding the content of these plans.so the real question is much more narrow than the majority suggests whether it would be absurd to deny localities the right to forbid or limit timber operations,other than those constituting a nuisance,on parcels of more than three acres that are located near residential areas,where the board of forestry has declined to enact sufficient prophylactic rules and the pertinent timber harvesting plan has not addressed residents concerns.the legislature already has answered this question in the negative,for as all parties agree,it already has precluded local regulation of timber harvesting on all parcels zoned tpz,regardless of their location.apparently the legislature is of the view that the board of forestry and the approval process for timber harvesting plans will provide sufficient safeguards in such cases 
finally,the majority claims to find support for its interpretation of section,subdivision d in the legislature perceived acquiescence in the holding in big creek i,supra,th,d,ante,d at,at.some perspective is in order here.we granted review to settle a dispute between only decisions by the courts of appeal.big creek i was the earlier decided case,but under the circumstances i am aware of no the majority cites to that we must defer to the initial panel conclusions simply because they were the first to publish their views.were legislative acquiescence so easily discerned and so potent a consideration,we would never disapprove of the earlier of two conflicting decisions.such a rule would make our jobs inestimably easier but,easily,less estimable.yet we do uphold the more recent decision in such situations,time and again.see,people leal cal th,d,hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,fn,d,people adair cal th,fn,d.whatever the merits of legislative acquiescence as an interpretive tool,it has virtually no bearing on the issue before us.
the majority also adopts a mistaken understanding of the doctrine of legislative acquiescence.the majority surmises legislative acquiescence in big creek i,supra,th,d,because the legislature has amended the fpa numerous times since that decision,without revisiting section,ante,d at,at.but the acquiescence doctrine requires more than merely that the legislature amended a statute at some point after a particular provision has been judicially construed.for the doctrine to apply in full measure,the general subject that had been interpreted by the courts must come before the legislature in connection with a subsequent amendment.ventura county deputy sheriffs board of retirement cal th,d,ventura county.here,the parties have not brought to our attention any indication that the subject of state preemption of local authority over timber operations has come before the legislature in connection with any amendment to the fpa over the past decade.section itself was last amended in,more than years before big creek i was decided.stats,ch.the amendments to various other sections of the fpa that the majority relies upon fail to establish that the legislature acquiesced in the interpretation of section,subdivision d advanced in big creek see ventura county,supra,cal th at,d.
ventura county,supra,cal th,d,squarely addresses the acquiescence issue before us.there we were concerned with the proper interpretation of the county employees retirement law of gov,et.a court of appeal decision more than years before ventura county had interpreted portions of the law pertaining to the computation of pensions.see ventura county,supra,cal th at,d.in the intervening years,the legislature amended various provisions of the law numerous times,without disturbing the interpretation advanced by the court of appeal.id.at,d.
the foregoing facts,it was contended,generated an inference of legislative acquiescence in the interpretation adv
