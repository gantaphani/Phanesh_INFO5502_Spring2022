this is a cercla contribution case the appellants were found to have arranged,during the early years of world war ii,for the disposal of wastes from aviation fuel production.
the property at issue,near corona,in riverside county,california,was once a ranch owned by the wardlows.gravel had been excavated from the property in for a nearby dam,leaving four gravel pits.for,the wardlows sold the right to dump acid tar petroleum waste consisting in substantial part of sulfuric those pits.oil refineries,for over a decade by then,had been going farther and farther afield from their long beach locations for disposal sites because the stink of acid tar was notoriously offensive to neighbors.this sludge could be smelled from almost a mile away.burning did not solve the problem,and the fumes were so bad that they killed flowers and fruit trees.runoff from the waste made farmland useless and killed fish in nearby streams.
among the central difficulties in this case is that it is hard to say what the facts are,as the parties could find no living person who knows what happened,and documentary evidence supports nothing more than inferences.the actions giving rise to the claim were performed if indeed they were in and.
elma wardlow,who survived into this litigation,might have been a good source of information.but when plaintiff western properties attorneys attempted to talk to her in the mid,she was in an arizona rest home,infirm,and completely unable to respond to questions wardlow daughter was present during the efforts to talk with her.years before,she had written that a man named carl bliss with the sand and gravel company is the one who made arrangements for the dumping.he is deceased.she noted in the same letter that the sulfuric acid sludge came from an oil company name unknown in long beach.contemporaneous reports identify the wardlows customer or customers only as ethyl gasoline refining operations in wilmington,california 
by the end of january,the first of the four pits was full,and the neighbors were protesting the stink and the threat to their water supplies.county supervisors directed the county attorney to draw up an ordinance they could pass to prevent further dumping.in february,the county attorney wrote a memorandum to the board of supervisors saying that he had met with eli mccoll,representing the major oil companies and connected with the refiners committee on waste disposal.they agreed that in the future no riverside county site would be used without approval of the county health officer and the pollution control department of the california division of fish and game.the memorandum does not state which oil companies mccoll represented or which ones had been dumping sludge in the pits provided by the wardlows.by june of,mccoll had arranged for a different site,and the dumping at the wardlow site had ended.mccoll died before this litigation began,so he could not identify which oil companies wastes he had arranged to have dumped in the wardlows gravel pits.
the wardlows sold the property in to some people named thomas,and it came to be known as thomas ranch.the sludge was still conspicuously present.the gravel pits had become acid filled tar pits that ate cows.one local paper reported that a s the years passed a crust of varying thickness formed over the top animals that ventured too far out upon this crust disappeared forever into the gooey pits and cattle were lost in that manner on a number of occasions.in,the thomases tried burning the waste,which created a sensational fire that burned throughout the day and into the night.the resulting clouds and columns of black smoke attracted more than curious viewers from far and near 
after mesne conveyances,western properties,the development arm of a failed savings and loan,acquired thomas ranch and became involved in remediation discussions with state and local authorities.in,the california department of health services declared the migration of hazardous substances from the pits an actual or threatened release,constituting a nuisance,and ordered western properties to conduct an environmental response.western properties eventually did so,at a cost of about million.
in july,western properties filed the complaint in this case seeking recovery of response costs and contribution,under and respectively,as well as declaratory relief under g,of cercla the complaint also sought relief under california health safety code e,which parallels cercla.the complaint named several oil companies,appellants and others.claims against some of the defendants were dismissed.the oil companies counterclaimed against western properties under a and f for contribution indemnity.
in,both sides moved for summary judgment.the court denied both motions and ruled that the defendants equitable defenses could not be asserted under because the allowance of equitable defenses is contrary to congress intent to impose strict liability.in september,the district court conducted a liability trial,which focused on whose sludge had been dumped.the district court acknowledged the weakness of the evidence but found by a preponderance of the evidence that,more likely than not,the remaining defendants had arranged for their sludge to be dumped in the wardlows gravel pits and were therefore liable for the cleanup expenses.after a subsequent trial in may,the district court found that western properties had incurred in costs.it imposed of these costs on the oil companies,jointly and severally,and none on western properties,on the theory that western properties was a innocent landowner.the oil companies appeal.
jurisdiction.
the oil companies argue that the district court lacked jurisdiction to award damages for remediation against them,because there was no prior civil action against western properties pursuant to cercla or a they cite the fifth circuit decision in aviall services,cooper industries,in aviall,the plaintiff amended its complaint,dropping the a claim and adding a f contribution claim.a panel held that a party can seek a f contribution claim only if there is a prior or pending federal or a action against it.aviall was reheard en banc,and the fifth circuit repudiated the original panel holding the en banc court held that a prp potentially responsible party may sue at any time for contribution under federal law to recover costs it has incurred in remediating a cercla site,not just during or following or a litigation the en banc majority pointed out that several circuit courts have allowed a party to seek contribution absent a cercla action against it,albeit where the issue was not contested our circuit has similarly allowed such contribution actions on january,the supreme court granted certiorari 
the fifth circuit original panel textual interpretation is plausible,but so is the interpretation of the en banc court.no doubt the supreme court decision in aviall will address the varying views on the subject our view is consistent with the en banc decision in the fifth circuit but does not rely on it.this case may be distinguishable because the plaintiffs here brought both a a action and a f action.
we begin our analysis of the jurisdictional question with the statutory text.section f provides,in relevant part 
any person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section a,during or following any civil action under section or under section a nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under section or section 
at first glance,these two sentences seem to conflict.they can be understood as consistent,however,both being permissive.the better reading of the second quoted sentence is that a or a a action is not a necessary condition for bringing a f action,despite the arguably contrary implication of the phrase during or following any civil action under section or under section in the first sentence.thus read,the second sentence prevents us from reading into the first sentence a restrictive only before during or following,and expressly declares that contribution can be sought before a or a a judgment this second sentence,serving as a savings clause,still allows for contribution actions where a judgment or settlement has determined liability.a restrictive reading,requiring a or a a action to be brought before a contribution action is allowed,would diminish the incentive of a prp to remove hazardous substances voluntarily and reach a settlement with government agencies as to liability that contribution may be sought after settlements as well as judgments is a legal tradition suppose,for example,that after a car accident,the driver of each car is liable to an injured person.if one driver settles with the victim,he then can sue the other driver for contribution.it does not matter,for settlements or judgments,whether contribution is sought in the original or in a separate action 
the seventh circuit has made comments in passing that appear to support the argument that a pending action against the party seeking contribution is required.in rumpke of indiana,cummins engine a parenthetical sentence observes,as dictum,that a or a action apparently must either be ongoing or already completed before f is available.the court in rumpke did not deny standing to the current owner of the land,even though no administrative action had been taken,but instead permitted the landowner to sue for its direct response costs under a.the seventh circuit allows this type of suit under its akzo exception an exception allowing prp landowners,who are not statutory innocent owners under to bring a actions and impose joint and several liability on the defendants 
in the case of pinal creek group newmont mining we held that,t ogether,and provide and regulate a prp right to claim contribution from other prps.w hile created the right of contribution,the machinery of governs and regulates such actions,providing the details and explicit recognition that were missing from the text of.pinal creek held that the enactment of in did not replace the implicit right to contribution many courts had recognized in a rather,determines the contours of,so that a claim for contribution requires the joint operation of both sections in this case,unlike in aviall,western properties originally asserted both a a recovery and a f contribution claim and maintained those claims when it amended its complaint.additionally,the oil companies counterclaimed against western properties under both sections.thus,consistent with f and the law of our circuit,the contribution action in this case was pursued during a civil action under a.the district court had jurisdiction of the action.
ii.findings of fact.
the oil companies argue that the evidence is insufficient to establish that any of them arranged for waste disposal in the wardlows gravel pits,or that eli mccoll or the refiners committee on waste disposal did so for them as their agent.the district court findings of fact can be reversed only if clearly erroneous,and not merely because we might have found otherwise on the same evidence 
as the district court recognized,no one piece of evidence conclusively establishes liability on the part of the oil companies.we have made an extensive study of the record to determine whether the district court findings of fact are clearly erroneous.many of the facts and inferences are stated quite tentatively in the findings.each defendant operated refineries during world war ii in the area of wilmington,california,and each used sulfuric acid in the refining process of producing aviation gasoline.each was more likely than not a member of the refiners committee on waste disposal in,although no records are available to establish that fact.the inference is based on records establishing that,from through,and again from through,shell and atlantic richfield were members of the committee every year,and texaco and union were members every year but one.no records are available for the years through.this inference is plainly reasonable in the absence of any evidence cutting against it.
as for what the refiners committee did,that is harder to say.did it arrange for waste disposal,or just deal with political and problems arising out of waste disposal the district court inferred that it arranged for disposal partly because of a remark made by director smith at a meeting of the directors of the orange county water district held on december.the minutes reflect that t he committee is trying to find a suitable location elsewhere for the acid sludge that had been dumped on the wardlow property gravel pit at the east end of the santa ana canyon in riverside county.we have carefully examined these minutes.contrary to the finding of the district court,the reference in the minutes to the committee is not a reference to the refiners committee on waste disposal.
the minutes record that director smith reported for the water conservation committee regarding a diversion from the san jacinto river for irrigation and domestic use.the paragraph continues,
he further reported that the dump for acid sludge a petroleum product is established on the wardlow property gravel pit engineer bailey has made several tests as to underground percolation through the gravel beds and has found rapid percolation of injurious acids which may eventually find its way into our water supply.the committee is trying to find a suitable location elsewhere and is cooperating with the truck who have sic the contract of hauling the sludge and the oil companies who are having the sludge hauled.
it is plain from the context of the minutes that director smith was speaking for the water conservation committee,and that the reference to t he committee was to that water conservation committee,not to the refiners committee.notably,when he spoke of those responsible for where the sludge went,he referred not to any committee,but to the truck hauling it and the oil companies not the refiners committee who are having the sludge hauled.the finding of fact that this reference was to the refiners committee is clearly erroneous.
despite our conclusion that the district court finding of fact regarding director smith report is clearly erroneous,we conclude that,on the whole,the district court findings of fact that the oil companies arranged for waste disposal through the refiners committee is not clearly erroneous.the evidence establishes that eli mccoll,purporting to act on behalf of the refiners committee for which he was a paid employee,spoke on its behalf to officials,applied for a permit to dispose of acid sludge in another location at about the same time,and gave riverside county assurances that disposal would cease at the wardlows property.in his testimony seeking a permit to dispose of waste at another location,mccoll said that he represented seven oil companies in the wilmington area.during that same testimony he explained various disposal alternatives,including a reference to the disposal at the wardlows land.he conferred with the riverside county attorney,on behalf of the refiners committee,about the problems at the wardlows gravel pit disposal site,assuring him that in the future no disposal would be made without the approval of two government agencies.fifteen years later,the oil companies,including all the defendants in this case,loaned mccoll money on account of what they described as a moral responsibility to remedy problems at some other disposal sites.the sludge at another disposal site that mccoll used for the defendant companies had a chemical composition similar to the composition of the sludge on the wardlows land,which was distinctive because of the alkylation process used to make aviation gasoline.the defendant companies produced evidence that they had disposed of their sludge otherwise,but could not establish that they disposed of all of it by other means or in other places.
the oil companies cite a third circuit case,al tech specialty steel allegheny international credit in support of their contention that the district court impermissibly piled conjecture on conjecture to create a mere likelihood that they dumped sludge in the gravel pits.in al tech,a lower court found that allegheny ludlum had not dumped pcbs in a pond.the appellate court affirmed that finding,stating 
it may well be that allegheny ludlum used materials during the relevant period,and it may be that the only reasonable explanation for the presence of pcbs in the pond sediments,based on the evidence adduced,is that allegheny ludlum dumped them there.but that is different from proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that allegheny international is responsible for at least some of the contamination.this al tech failed to do 
it may well be that one or more of the defendants did not arrange for any of its acid sludge to be deposited at the wardlow site.they so argue based on a admission by western properties expert witness.but beyond possibility is not the standard of proof all that is required is a preponderance of the evidence.the issue is close and intensely factual,and it is entirely possible that,had the district court gone the other way,we would also affirm under the liberal standard of review.what is important about al tech is not that the defendants prevailed despite the absence of a good explanation of how the waste got there,but rather that the appellate court,under the standard of review,affirmed facts found after trial 
we affirm the finding that each of the defendant oil companies arranged for the disposal of sludge on the wardlow land in the four gravel pits.a reasonable jurist might have gone either way as to the preponderance of evidence,particularly for one or two of the defendants.but cases are tried in the trial court,and we can not say that the trial court factual determinations were clearly erroneous.a reasonable factfinder could conclude on the evidence presented that each of the four defendants arranged for disposal of its acid sludge in the wardlows gravel pits through the use of the refiners committee and its employee eli mccoll.
iii.full recovery.
the oil companies argue that the district court erred in granting recovery against them jointly and severally for of the cleanup expense,because western properties,as owner,was also a prp and must be required to share the loss.under our decision in pinal creek group newmont mining they argue,the most western properties can get is contribution.the current landowner argues that,because it did not have anything to do with dumping the sludge,it is therefore an innocent landowner entitled to full recovery of its cleanup expenses under the rationale of the seventh circuit akzo exception cases 
on this issue,the oil companies have the better argument.cercla provides that persons who are liable or potentially liable under a may seek contribution from each other using the mechanics set forth in f.western properties,as the owner of thomas ranch,is potentially liable under a and is therefore a prp from whom the oil companies may seek contribution western properties knew about the acid sludge when it bought thomas ranch a landowner that buys property with the knowledge that the property is contaminated with hazardous waste can not establish any of the b defenses to a liability that knowledge prevents the landowner from being an innocent owner,which is statutorily restricted to those who did not know and had no reason to know.even if western properties had not known of the acid sludge pits,the statutory requirement that it demonstrate to a court that it carried out all appropriate inquiries would prevent it from claiming it had no reason to know of the pits 
our analysis is controlled by pinal creek in pinal creek,a group of companies that admitted responsibility for a portion of environmental cleanup costs sought recovery of all costs from other prps under a.we held that only a claim for contribution lies between prps and that the liability of each will correspond to that party equitable share of the total liability and will not be joint and several.although a creates a right of contribution,and western properties can hold other prps liable for a portion of the cleanup costs,t he contours and mechanics of this right are now governed by.therefore,even though western properties has brought both a a and a f claim,because it is a prp,its claim is essentially one for contribution.a landowner can not recover its costs jointly and severally from the polluters,nor can it recover them through indemnity,as distinct from contribution.
this case requires us to resolve an additional question that pinal creek did not decide.while noting that its holding that a cercla claim by a prp against another prp is necessarily for contribution was consistent with the decisions of the supreme court and our sister circuits,pinal creek acknowledged the seventh circuit akzo exception,which excepts prps who have not polluted the site in any way.because the plaintiff in the case was partly responsible for the contamination,pinal creek did not reach the issue of whether such an exception ought to be made.in this case,western properties did not contribute at all to the contamination,and it argues that we ought to adopt the seventh circuit akzo exception.in rumpke of indiana,cummins engine,the purchaser of a dump,who allegedly did not know of hazardous materials that had been deposited there before it purchased,sued firms that had disposed of hazardous wastes there,despite the provision of f that shields from contribution prps that have settled with the government and reduced the potential liability of other prps pro tanto rumpke held that an innocent landowner may,instead of suing for contribution under f,sue for complete cost recovery under a,so the screen against contribution in f for prps that had settled with the government would not bar recovery 
we are unable to accept the proposition that a prp landowner may sue under a for full recovery,jointly and severally,without regard to the limitations of we can not reconcile the proposition with our binding precedent in pinal creek that prps may sue only for contribution,subject to the statutory exception for innocent parties in innocent landowners are only those deemed innocent under.although pinal creek did not reach the question of whether we would adopt the seventh circuit innocent landowner defense,the pinal creek ratio decidendi argues against adopting it.section is a comprehensive scheme for adjustment of the burden among parties that are liable or potentially liable for a recoveries,so there is no reason to read a silent implication of an alternative scheme into a.
there is some attraction,in certain circumstances,to a broad rule for landowners who are not statutorily innocent under.the attractiveness is equitable,not textual,and the contribution statute already allows for equity to be taken into account suppose a person bought a lot on which to build a home,not knowing that some years ago a truck had overturned and spilled hazardous substances into the ground,which had seeped down into the water table.suppose further that by due diligence he could have found out and is deemed to have had reason to know,so he is not a statutory innocent owner.in such a case,the district court would be able to consider the equities,as between the prp landowner and the company whose truck had overturned,using its f authority to allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.
section is not a contribution scheme in which each joint tortfeasor bears a pro rata share of the loss regardless of its degree of fault as we held in boeing cascade,the district court has,under this provision,discretion to decide what factors ought to be considered,as well as the duty to allocate costs according to those factors,without being bound by or limited to any predetermined list of factors because,in an appropriate case,the court might properly exercise its discretion under f to allocate a smaller portion or even no portion of the cleanup cost to a prp landowner,there is no reason to read such authority into a against the limitations of the words of b 
on the other hand,if prp landowners could recover through a in addition to,or notwithstanding,they could evade the f requirement that factors for allocation be equitable,and potentially could obtain double recoveries.this interpretation would violate our holding in boeing that one eq
