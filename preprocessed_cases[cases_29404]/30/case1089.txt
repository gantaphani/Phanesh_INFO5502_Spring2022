this appeal presents the question of whether an action under the national environmental protection act nepa,et,against various federal and state government defendants challenging a proposed plan for managing the california water resources is ripe for judicial review before action is taken.we hold that it is and reverse the district court.because the record is not sufficient to ascertain whether the state defendants participation in the water management program is sufficiently independent of federal control to escape the requirements of nepa,we reverse the district court determination that certain land and water acquisitions undertaken pursuant to the program did not constitute a federal action,and remand with instructions to permit discovery on this question.
at issue in this case is the calfed program calfed program,a cooperative interagency effort of eighteen state and federal agencies with management or regulatory responsibilities for california san francisco bay joaquin delta.the estuary is the largest estuary on the west coast,including over acres in five counties and supplying drinking water for of californians and irrigation water for over seven million acres of highly productive agricultural land.the calfed program describes itself as the largest,most complex water management program in the world,engaged in the most complex and extensive ecosystem restoration project ever proposed.
calfed was formed in summer when the federal and state governments executed a framework agreement to establish a comprehensive program for coordination and communication in order to advance environmental protection and water supply dependability in the estuary.in late and early,the governmental entities executed a memorandum of understanding for preparation of environmental impact mou,in order to coordinate preparation of a single environmental document that satisfies both nepa and ceqa.the parties agreed that the calfed program interagency team will be responsible for preparation of the under calfed general direction.
pursuant to this agreement,in july,calfed issued a programmatic environmental impact statement environmental impact report.the identified a preferred program alternative which,among other actions,would convert agricultural lands to other uses,including habitat,levee improvements,and water storage.in august,calfed certified the in a record of decision rod.the rod stated that it represents the culmination of the national environmental policy act nepa and the california environmental quality act ceqa processes,and reflects a final selection of a plan preferred program alternative which includes specific actions,to fix the,describes a strategy for implementing the plan,and identifies complementary actions the calfed agencies will also pursue.attached to the rod were two agreements entered into by the state and federal governments the implementation memorandum of understanding imeu and the environmental water account operating principles agreement ewa.the ewa is described as a cooperative management program whose purpose is to provide protection to the fish of the estuary through environmentally beneficial changes in the operations of the state water project swp and federal central valley project cvp.the program approach to fish protection requires the acquisition of alternative sources of project water supply.
plaintiffs are individual farmers don laub,debbie jacobsen,and ted sheely,and the california farm bureau federation.in response to the issuance of the calfed and rod,plaintiffs filed suit in federal district court for the eastern district of california,alleging that the defendants failed to follow procedures mandated by nepa and ceqa when promulgating the calfed and rod.specifically,plaintiffs theory is that defendants failed to consider any reasonable alternatives to the proposed conversion of agricultural resources to environmental uses,that they failed to consider the direct,indirect and cumulative impacts of projects that will cause significant effects on agricultural resources,and that their analysis of mitigation options is inadequate.
on august,the district court dismissed the ceqa claims against the state defendants with prejudice based on application of the eleventh amendment,a decision that plaintiffs have not appealed.however,the district court retained jurisdiction over the nepa claims against the federal defendants and invoked the ex parte young doctrine to retain jurisdiction over the individual state defendants.
on august,the district court granted the federal defendants rule b motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction without prejudice,holding that the issuance of was not a final agency action ripe for review.the court further determined that challenged state acquisitions of land and water were not federalized under nepa thus,the court had no jurisdiction over the state defendants.the court also denied plaintiffs request for discovery and briefing on the question of the federal government level of involvement in the state land and water acquisitions.however,the district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint with leave to amend.
plaintiffs then moved for reconsideration of the dismissal.in the alternative,plaintiffs requested that the district court dismiss the entire action without prejudice in order to permit appeal because wmx technologies,miller,cir en banc holds that dismissal of a complaint with leave to amend was not an appealable final judgment.on december,the district court denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration and granted their request to dismiss the entire action without prejudice and without leave to amend.this timely appeal followed.

the federal defendants have raised plaintiffs alleged lack of constitutional standing for the first time on appeal.in fact,they explicitly declined to raise the issue of standing below,stating in their reply brief that the federal defendants have not argued that the plaintiffs lack standing.this turnabout is undoubtedly troubling to plaintiffs,as it is to us.nonetheless,a s a jurisdictional issue,standing may be addressed for the first time on appeal.arakaki hawaii,cir citing pritikin dep t of energy,cir.indeed,because it implicates jurisdiction,a challenge to constitutional standing is one which we are required to consider,even though raised for the first time on appeal.newdow congress,cir citing united states viltrakis,cir.
the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing the following elements that the plaintiff has suffered an injury in invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical that there is a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and that it is likely the injury can be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d see also hall norton,cir.when a party raises standing for the first time on appeal,we first examine the complaint and,if it fails to establish standing,the record.animal protection inst.of am.hodel,cir.here,the complaint alleges individualized injury to each of the plaintiffs,so we need not consider the record 
the complaint alleges plaintiffs laub and jacobson injury as follows 
the proposed implementation of calfed program would result in significant negative impacts on the environmental and economic health of the properties farmed by laub and jacobsen.calfed acquisitions and conversions of agricultural land and water would directly result in shortages of water supply on the west side of the san joaquin valley and have already prompted westside users to look beyond their existing sources water from the delta to the sources of the east side of the san joaquin valley,like laub and jacobsens.calfed proposed acquisition would ultimately result in the potential loss of laub and jacobesen farming operations,jobs,and related services.
it further alleges injury to plaintiff sheely 
calfed acquisitions would compete in markets historically relied upon by sheely water supplier,wwd,among others in the area.calfed proposed acquisitions would ultimately result in the potential loss of sheely farming operations,jobs,and related services.and,because the groundwater resources underlying his farm are of both poor quality and costly to extract,calfed proposed acquisitions would jeopardize sheely entire livelihood by preventing him from having access to an adequate,reliable,affordable water supply of good quality.without this water supply he can not produce his permanent and field crops,consisting of pistachios,cotton,tomatoes,and garlic,valued at million.
finally,the complaint alleges the interest of the california farm bureau federation farm bureau as follows 
plaintiff california farm bureau federation is a,voluntary membership california corporation.the farm bureau purpose is to work for the protection of agriculture and the rural environment,and to find solutions to the problems of the farm,the farm home and the rural community throughout the central valley and the state of california.its members consist of county farm bureaus and,through them,more than individual family members,including over members within the central valley counties of calaveras,fresno,inyo,kern,kings,madera,mariposa,merced,stanislaus,tulare and tuolumne.calfed proposed acquisitions would result in severe negative environmental and economic impacts in our member communities.
the complaint also alleged that plaintiffs laub,jacobsen,and sheely are members in good standing of the farm bureau.
the individual plaintiffs meet lujan standard for injury in fact since each has alleged an invasion of a legally protected particularized interest which affect s the plaintiff s in a personal and individualized way the loss of affordable irrigation water for their agricultural lands.lujan,at.therefore,they have adequately alleged that they will be directly affected apart from their special interest in the subject,as lujan requires.see id.at.see also churchill county babbitt,cir,amended,cir plaintiffs had concrete interest sufficient for standing when there was reasonable probability that transfer of water rights from surrounding areas would adversely affect their lands.
although the federal defendants correctly note that lujan explicitly rejects procedural injury alone as sufficient to establish injury in fact,see lujan,at,plaintiffs do not advance their procedural injury as the basis for injury in fact.rather the injury alleged is the threatened harm to their farmlands.thus,as lujan requires,the parties seeking review are themselves among the injured.see id.at.because the individual plaintiffs have standing,we need not consider whether the farm bureau has standing.see watt energy action educ,d noting that because one plaintiff had standing to bring the suit,the court need not consider the standing of the other plaintiffs see also arlington heights metropolitan housing development,d same.
further,when a plaintiff seeks to enforce a procedural requirement,the disregard of which could impair a separate concrete interest of theirs,the plaintiff can establish standing without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.hall,at quoting lujan,at.the federal defendants assert that plaintiffs are unable to show they will likely suffer immediate injury or identify specific tangible actions that will immediately be taken under the that will cause damage to them.this,they argue,indicates that plaintiffs are unable to establish injury in fact.yet when,as here,a procedural violation is the injury alleged,the requirements of immediacy of the threatened harm are relaxed.hall,at.thus,the fact that plaintiffs can not show immediate harmful action will be taken based on the allegedly defective eis is not fatal to establishing standing.see cen.delta water agency united states,cir t he possibility of future injury may be sufficient to confer standing on plaintiffs threatened injury constitutes injury in fact.
here,plaintiffs have satisfied the relaxed causation and redressibility requirements for a procedural standing case.see cantrell city of long beach,cir once a plaintiff has established injury in fact under nepa,the causation and redressability requirements are relaxed.the plan selected by the challenged would convert agricultural lands to other uses,including habitat,levee improvements,and water storage,and would reallocate agricultural waters in some areas.plaintiffs have alleged that this would adversely impact their ability to maintain current irrigation levels in their farmlands.thus,plaintiffs have adequately alleged that the proposed action will endanger their interests.see churchill county,at to establish causation,a plaintiff need only show a reasonable probability of the challenged action threat to its concrete interest.
in order to establish redressability,plaintiffs asserting the inadequacy of an agency eis,as plaintiffs do here,need not show that further analysis by the government would result in a different conclusion.see hall norton,cir.rather,they need only show that the decision could be influenced by the environmental considerations that nepa requires an agency to study.id.nepa implementing regulations require an eis to include the economic effects of a federal action,and its proximity to prime farmlands.see effects include economic effects requiring consideration of unique characteristics of geographic area such as proximity to prime farmlands.therefore,calfed decision to convert agricultural land and water to other uses could be influenced by an environmental analysis that properly considered the above effects.
accordingly,we conclude that the plaintiffs have adequately alleged an injury in fact sufficient to confer constitutional standing.
the district court erred in holding that plaintiffs nepa claims were not ripe for review.nepa claims are reviewed under the apa.marsh oregon natural res.council,d.in addition to constitutional standing requirements,plaintiffs must also meet the apa standing requirements that there be a final agency action and that the plaintiff suffers an injury that falls within the zone of interests of the violated statutory provision.lujan wildlife fed n,d 
the district court determined that plaintiffs failed to meet the ripeness requirement embodied in the first prong of the apa test for prudential the challenged action be a final agency action.see lujan wildlife fed n,d.the district court,citing whitman american trucking associations,d,reasoned that because the calfed rod and simply outline a program by which state and federal officials and agencies commit to work together to achieve strategies in order to implement a plan to solve environmental problems,the issuance of the does not mark the consummation of the decisionmaking process and therefore does not constitute a final agency action subject to review under the apa.the district court determined that a ny future federal actions,if they significantly affect the quality of the human environment,will have to then comply with nepa.plaintiffs counter that the question of whether an agency has complied with nepa procedural requirements in formulating a programmatic eis is immediately ripe for review before any action is taken.we agree.
this case is akin to idaho conservation league mumma,cir.in that case,environmental organizations brought a nepa challenge to a forest service eis recommending against wilderness designation in certain roadless areas.as do the federal defendants here,the forest service in idaho conservation league argued that the case was unripe for review because actual,decisions regarding development are made at a later stage,and each decision must be accompanied by an eis calibrated to the project degree of specificity,and the ultimate decision regarding wilderness designation lies in congress not the agency,hands.id.we rejected this argument,holding that the case was ripe because 
to the extent the eis and rod have an impact on congress final decision,waiting until the department acts on a specific project would not be an adequate remedy.moreover,a future challenge to a particular,action would lose much force once the overall plan has been if the challenge were premised on the view that the overall plan grew out of erroneous assumptions.
here,as in idaho conservation league,the preferred program alternative set out in the eis will influence subsequent actions.the rod explains the process as follows 
whenever a broad environmental impact analysis has been prepared and a subsequent narrower analysis is then prepared on an action included within the entire program or policy,the subsequent analysis need only summarize the issues discussed in the broader analysis and incorporate discussions from the broader analysis by reference.this is known as tiering.tiered documents focus on issues specific to the subsequent action and rely on the analysis of issues already decided in broader programmatic review.absent new information or substantially changed circumstances,documents tiering from the calfed final programmatic will not revisit the alternatives that were considered alongside calfed preferred program alternative nor will they revisit alternatives that were rejected during calfed alternative development process.
see also instructing agencies to tier their environmental impact statements and to focus on actual issues ripe for discussion at each level,and noting that w henever a broad environmental impact statement has been prepared such as program or policy statement and a subsequent statement is then prepared,it need only summarize the issues discussed in the broader statement by reference and shall concentrate on the issues specific to the subsequent action.thus,the preferred program alternative set out in the eis will determine the scope of future proposals.as we noted in idaho conservation league,if the agency action only could be challenged at the development stage,the underlying programmatic authorization would forever escape review.at.
salmon river concerned citizens robertson,cir also dictates that this case is ripe for judicial review.there,we determined that a challenge to a forest service programmatic eis proposing the application of herbicides was reviewable before any specific applications of herbicides had been authorized.relying on idaho conservation,we held that plaintiffs need not wait to challenge a specific project when their grievance is with an overall plan.id.at because the eis set guidelines that determined future herbicide applications,we concluded that the forest service failure to comply with nepa represented a concrete injury and the plaintiffs challenge was ripe for review.id.likewise,because the preferred program alternative here will determine the scope of future proposals,the defendant alleged procedural failure to comply with nepa requirements is ripe for immediate judicial review.
the district court based its determination that the case is not ripe for review on ohio forestry ass sierra club,d.in that case,a challenge to a forest service land resource management plan for allowing too much logging and clearcutting was deemed unripe for review because the plan could not be implemented without further environmental review.however,the ohio forestry the plaintiffs had brought a substantive challenge to the plan,rather than a procedural challenge under nepa.the court carefully distinguished the case at issue from a procedural challenge 
nor does the plan,which through standards guides future use of the forests,resemble an environmental impact statement prepared pursuant to nepa.that is because in this respect nepa,unlike the nfma,the statute under which the challenge was brought simply guarantees a particular procedure,not a particular result hence a person with standing who is injured by a failure to comply with the nepa procedure may complain of that failure at the time the failure takes place,for the claim can never get riper.
since ohio forestry was decided,we have recognized the distinction between substantive challenges which are not ripe until plans are formulated,and procedural challenges which are ripe for review when a programmatic eis allegedly violates nepa see kern blm,cir basing holding that challenge to programmatic eis was ripe for review on substantive procedural distinction drawn in ohio forestry,adding i f there was an injury under nepa,it occurred when the allegedly inadequate eis was promulgated see also west sec y of dep t of,cir citing ohio forestry for proposition that failure to comply with nepa procedures is ripe when failure takes place wilderness soc y thomas,cir noting that under ohio forestry procedural challenges under nepa are ripe when procedural failure takes place.therefore,because plaintiffs challenge is a procedural one under nepa,it is ripe for review 
the federal defendants reliance on rapid transit advocates,cal.rapid transit,cir,to support their assertion that plaintiffs claims are unripe for review is unavailing.in that case,the court determined that a challenge to the decision of the urban mass transit administration umta to grant federal funds to a state transit agency to design and engineer a mass transit system was not ripe for review because no final agency action had taken place.defendants argue that the administrative process in that case is analogous to the one at issue here.in rapid transit,the local transit authority had prepared a environmental impact statement which studied various alternatives for rapid transit and selected a preferred alternative.id.at.at this point,the umta granted federal funds for the design and engineering of the preferred alternative.the court rejected a challenge to this decision on ripeness grounds because a decision whether to fund the construction of the project would not occur until the applicant prepared a eis analyzing the effects of the chosen alternative.id.because the grant of funds for the proposed alternative did not commit the agency to approve the final design or fund construction,we determined judicial review would be premature since the process may never be completed the project may never be funded.id.at.the federal defendants argue that rapid transit controls here because likewise,a eis is required before the proposed calfed projects may go forward,and the implementation of the project is contingent on it receiving the requisite funding 
however,in rapid transit there was no tiering between the two stages of the program.thus,funding approval at stage one did not commit the agency to design approval at stage two.see at.moreover,the agency ha d explicitly disavowed any advance commitment to approve construction.id.at.by contrast,in this case the implementation of the preferred program alternative will tier from the final programmatic eis at issue here.furthermore,the rod describes its purpose as follows 
this record of decision for the calfed final programmatic environmental impact statement and report represents the culmination of the national environmental policy act nepa and the california environmental quality act ceqa processes.the rod reflects a final selection of a plan preferred program alternative,which includes specific actions,to fix the,describes a strategy for implementing the plan,and identifies complementary actions the calfed agencies will also pursue.
emphasis added.
therefore,because the rod the future through the selection of a plan to the exclusion of others which will not be among the available options at the implementation phase,it is ripe for review.see res.robertson,cir holding that nepa challenge to timber management plan was ripe for review at programmatic stage rather than when individual sales were announced because the plan the future seattle audubon soc y espy,cir challenge to timber management plan was ripe before specific sales were announced because individual sales would be driven by the ov
