as a result of this court opinion in gifford pinchot task force united states fish wildlife service,cir,the fish and wildlife service fws voluntarily reinitiated consultation with two federal agencies regarding the impact of a portion of a proposed timber harvest on the endangered northern spotted owl.the fws accordingly withdrew its favorable biological opinion biop or biop regarding that portion of the timber harvest,but did not withdraw the accompanying incidental take statement,which would authorize the taking of all northern spotted owls associated with the full timber harvest.the oregon natural resources council and several other conservation groups collectively,onrc challenge the validity of this incidental take statement.we have jurisdiction under.we hold that the take statement is invalid because the withdrawal of a portion of the biop leaves the incidental take statement without an underlying factual predicate the incidental take statement presents a measure of take without explaining why no number was provided and the incidental take statement sets a measure of take that does not allow for reinitiation of consultation.
background 
the endangered species act esa,evidences a congressional intent to afford endangered species the highest of priorities.tva hill,d.the plain intent of congress in enacting this statute was to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction,whatever the cost.id.at.to accomplish this ambitious goal,the esa sets forth a comprehensive program to limit harm to endangered species within the united states.section of the esa establishes a blanket prohibition on the taking of any member of a listed endangered species.a b.section affirmatively commands each federal agency to insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by the agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species.a.however,carves out limited exceptions for federal agencies and certain applicants,allowing those contemplating action that may harm endangered species to obtain a limited exemption from penalties under certain circumstances a c,o.
under,if any listed or proposed listed species may be present in the area of the proposed action,the federal agency the action agency must conduct a biological assessment in order to determine the likely effect of its proposed action on the species.c see also.if the action agency concludes that its proposed action may affect listed species or critical habitat,it must initiate consultation with the fws or the national marine fisheries service.see.
in,the bureau of land management and the forest service agencies desired to conduct approximately timber sales on acres of land in the pacific northwest,primarily within the rouge river basin in oregon.these forests also house the northern spotted owl,strix occidentalis caurina,a listed threatened species.see h.the agencies conducted a biological assessment of the proposed sales and concluded that the sales may affect the northern spotted owl,as well as three other listed species.the agencies initiated formal consultation with the fws.
during the consultation process,the fws assessed the proposed action for its potential to harm the spotted owl and other endangered species and their critical habitat.see g.the fws summarized its findings in a biop,issued in october.see g h.the biop found that the proposed timber harvest would remove acres of forest designated as spotted owl suitable habitat,habitat suitable for nesting,roosting foraging.the timber harvest would impact acres of spotted owl critical habitat removing or downgrading acres of nesting,roosting,and foraging critical habitat,degrading acres of nesting,roosting,and foraging critical habitat,removing acres of dispersal critical habitat and degrading acres of dispersal critical habitat.nevertheless,the biop concluded,the anticipated harvest was not likely to jeopardize the existence of the spotted owl and was not likely to destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat for the spotted owl.
when the fws concludes that an action will not jeopardize the existence of a listed species or adversely modify its habitat,but the project is likely to result in incidental takings of listed species,the fws must provide a written statement with the biop that authorizes such takings.b,o.cattle growers ass fish wildlife,cir.the incidental take statement must specify the impact of the incidental taking on the species specify the reasonable and prudent measures that the fws considers necessary or appropriate to minimize such impact set forth terms and conditions with which the action agency must comply to implement the reasonable and prudent measures including,but not limited to,reporting requirements and specify the procedures to be used to handle or dispose of any animals actually taken.b i.as long as any takings comply with the terms and conditions of the incidental take statement,the action agency is exempt from penalties for such takings.o.thus,a biop with a finding effectively the proposed action under the esa,subject to the incidental take statement terms and conditions.see bennett spear,d noting that,while a biop is technically advisory only,an agency disregards the biop at its own peril.
however,the esa implementing regulations require the agencies completing the project to report back to the fws on the action progress and its impact on the species i n order to monitor the impacts of incidental take.i.the agency must immediately reinitiate consultation with the fws if the amount or extent of incidental taking is exceeded.i,a 
the biop accompanying incidental take statement authorized the incidental take of all spotted owls associated with the removal and downgrading of acres of suitable spotted owl habitat.the reasonable and prudent measures include the following statement the service believes that the following reasonable and prudent measures are necessary and appropriate to minimize the impacts of incidental take of the spotted owl provide appropriate amounts of spotted owl dispersal and suitable habitat in a condition and distribution that facilitates spotted owl movement across the landscape.the terms and conditions specify procedures for handling species specimens and require that certain of the timber harvest projects be reviewed for consistency with the biop.the terms and conditions also require the agencies to report annually on the actual impacts of the proposed projects,and state that i f take is exceeded,consultation will have to be reinitiated.
ii.proceedings below 
in,onrc commenced this action,challenging the validity of the biop and the incidental take statement.the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment in february,and onrc appealed.
while this case was pending on appeal,we decided gifford pinchot.we held that the definition of destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat employed by the fws in assessing jeopardy to the northern spotted owl violated the esa.gifford pinchot,at.the definition in use set the bar too high by finding adverse modification only where proposed actions impacted both the survival and recovery of a listed species.id.at emphasis added.we ordered this case remanded to the district court for consideration in light of gifford pinchot relevant holdings.see or.natural res.council allen,fed.app x cir.
the fws subsequently acknowledged that gifford pinchot rendered a portion of the biop invalid.it voluntarily reinitiated consultation on the land designated as northern spotted owl critical habitat,represented by the fws to be acres.based on this action,the district court found that the only live issue presented was the continuing validity of the incidental take statement.the district court concluded that the original incidental take statement remained valid despite the partial withdrawal of the biop,and again granted summary judgment in favor of the fws.onrc again appeals the validity of the incidental take statement,arguing that the fws voluntary reinitiation of consultation on some of the timber sales approved by the biop renders the incidental take statement invalid and the incidental take statement fails to quantify adequately the authorized take of northern spotted owls or explain why no number was provided.
iii.analysis 
standard of review 
the biop and its accompanying incidental take statement represent final agency action subject to judicial review.bennett,at.as the esa does not itself specify a standard of review of its implementation,we apply the general standard of review of agency action established by the administrative procedure act apa.see.the incidental take statement is thus subject to review under the arbitrary and capricious standard found in the apa.see.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.alaska envtl.ctr.kempthorne,cir.thus,we must determine whether there is a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made by the fws and whether it has committed a clear error of judgment.cattle growers ass n,at.
review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is to be narrow,but searching and careful.marsh or.natural res.council,d.the supreme court has explained that an agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.a court can not,however,substitute its judgment for that of the agency or merely determine that it would have decided an issue differently.marsh,at.
withdrawal of a material portion of the biop renders the incidental take statement invalid.
onrc contends that reinitiating consultation on the portion of the timber sales impacting northern spotted owl critical habitat materially changed the scope of the biop,necessitating a new incidental take statement.we agree.even a cursory review of the regulations governing formal consultation demonstrates that incidental take statements supplement biops,and were not meant to stand alone.
the fws must issue an incidental take statement if the biop concludes no jeopardy to listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat will result from the proposed action,but the action is likely to result in incidental takings.b i.cattle growers ass n,at.both the biop and the incidental take statement must be formulated by the fws during the formal consultation process indeed,the regulations specifically require the fws to provide the incidental take statement with the biological opinion.g,i.
the incidental take statement must be associated with an underlying biop because the incidental take statement primary function is to authorize the taking of animals incidental to the execution of a particular proposed action.the approval is effectively conveyed through the biop no jeopardy determination.see g h bennett,at.without the no jeopardy determination contained in the underlying biop,the incidental take statement potentially take for an action that could subsequently be determined to jeopardize the existence of an endangered species.such a result would be contrary to the esa fundamental purpose and scheme.see b c,a b.
moreover,under the esa implementing regulations,in order to be considered a proper taking,the taking must be incidental to the purpose of the action.see also b providing for authorization of takings incidental to approved agency actions.without understanding the scope and purpose of the action contained in the is no way to know whether the take being authorized is properly incidental.
the facts of this case acutely demonstrate the incidental take statement necessarily auxiliary nature.here,the biop initially approved timber sales impacting acres of suitable habitat for the northern spotted owl.the fws has withdrawn its approval of the logging of at least acres of critical habitat.however,the accompanying incidental take within the the taking of all spotted owls associated with the removal or downgrading of acres of suitable spotted owl habitat,which may include most or all of the critical habitat acreage at issue.thus,as it stands,the incidental take statement is now broader than the project and allows for the take of more spotted owls than are affected by the remaining portions of the biop.allowing the incidental take statement to stand alone would also presuppose the reapproval of the timber harvest on spotted owl critical habitat,even though the fws has acknowledged that the action propriety must be reevaluated in the light of the proper definition of destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.
because there is no rational connection between the authorization of take and the scope of the underlying proposed action,we conclude that the incidental take statement is arbitrary and capricious.see.cattle growers ass n,at.
c.the incidental take statement is invalid because the fws failed to establish that it could not set a numerical measure of take.
congress has clearly declared a preference for expressing take in numerical form,and an incidental take statement that utilizes a surrogate instead of a numerical cap on take must explain why it was impracticable to express a numerical measure of take.because the incidental take statement at issue contains no numerical cap on take and fails to explain why it does not,it violates the esa.
section of the esa requires incidental take statements to specify the impact of the incidental takings on the species.b i.in its discussion of b,congress indicated that it preferred the incidental take statement to contain a numerical value where possible,the impact should be specified in terms of a numerical limitation on the federal agency or permittee or licensee,at,reprinted in.congress recognized,however,that a numerical value would not always be available the committee recognizes it may not be possible to determine the number of eggs of an endangered or threatened fish which will be sucked into a power plant when water is used as a cooling mechanism.the committee intends only that such numbers be established where possible.id.
accordingly,we have recognized that the permissible level of take ideally should be expressed as a specific number.see.cattle growers ass n,at referencing,as examples of numerical limitations,several cases in which the incidental take statements stated the specific number of species members that would be affected.further,if it does employ some other measure,the fish and wildlife service must establish that no such numerical value could be practically obtained.id.at.
contrary to the fws argument,quantifying take in terms of habitat acreage lost is simply not the type of numerical limitation on take contemplated by congress or this court precedent.moreover,the biop offers no explanation of why the fws was unable numerically to quantify the level of take of northern spotted owls.the biop appendix declares that spotted owl survey data are currently and surveys have been discontinued or reduced.the fws,however,never states that it is not possible to update the survey data in order to estimate the number of takings,only that it has not actually done the surveys.this does not establish the numerical measure impracticality.we therefore conclude that the fws unexplained failure to comply with this requirement renders the incidental take statement invalid.see ctr.for biological diversity bureau of land,d,finding that the fws did not adequately establish that no numerical value of take of desert tortoises could practically be obtained where incidental take statement relied on fact that the service simply had not estimated the number of desert tortoises in the action area natural res.def.council,evans,d,rejecting incidental take statement that failed to quantify numerically the authorized incidental take of some twenty endangered species and offered no evidence that it was impractical to obtain such numerical estimates.
d.the incidental take statement does not provide for reinitiation of consultation.
as discussed above,congress preferred take be specified in terms of a numerical limitation,at.a surrogate is permissible if no number may be practically obtained.the chosen surrogate,however,must be able to perform the functions of a numerical limitation.in particular,incid
