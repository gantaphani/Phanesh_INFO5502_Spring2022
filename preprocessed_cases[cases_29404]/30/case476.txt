david charvat,a former superintendent of the eastern ohio regional wastewater authority eorwa,filed suit under,claiming that he was terminated in violation of his first amendment rights.on september,the board of trustees of eorwa voted to fire charvat on the basis of his alleged managerial incompetence.charvat,however,claims that the board fired him because he reported eorwa violations of several environmental regulations.he initially filed an administrative complaint pursuant to the whistleblower provisions of the clean water act cwa and the safe drinking water act sdwa.charvat later filed this action in federal court against eorwa,the four members of eorwa board of trustees,and two additional eorwa employees.all parties to the dispute filed motions for summary judgment.the district court issued an order denying the motions for summary judgment filed by charvat and eorwa,as well as the individual defendants motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.
eorwa and the six individual defendants jointly appealed.they argue that the district court erred in failing to grant the individual defendants qualified immunity,in denying their collective motion for judgment on the pleadings,and in failing to hold that the whistleblower provisions of the cwa and the sdwa preclude a separate action under.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
officials of belmont county,ohio created eorwa pursuant to ohio revised code.this facility is a wastewater treatment plant on the ohio river that serves four municipalities.each of the four mayors appoints a trustee to eorwa.the board of trustees governs the operations of eorwa under ohio revised code.
charvat began working as the superintendent of eorwa on july.at the time of charvat employment,the board consisted of charles wilson,the president,michael thomas,the,james tekely,the secretary,and felipe lavapies.charvat worked alongside david thomas,the office manager of eorwa who reported directly to the board,and paul pollock,then eorwa chief operator.eorwa employed about twenty persons to operate its wastewater and sewage treatment facility at the time when charvat was superintendent.
charvat assumed his position unaware of eorwa noncompliance with various environmental regulations.he quickly learned,however,of its numerous regulatory violations.the cwa,a,requires eorwa to obtain a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit from the ohio environmental protection agency oepa in order to operate as a wastewater treatment facility.eorwa is also required to follow oepa standards for the maintenance of three things the wastewater collection system at the plant,the plant facilities,and the sludge farm where waste is treated.oepa regulations require that treatment facilities test the final effluent that they produce and any violations of the regulations to oepa.
charvat soon uncovered problems at eorwa facilities.for example,he discovered that sometime between and a water pump at eorwa that provided nonpotable water for cleaning equipment had broken.rather than fix the pump,an eorwa employee had the system with the public water supply without installing any backflow preventers.this modification created the potential for raw sewage to enter the public water supply.furthermore,charvat became aware that eorwa had evaded enforcement by failing to its regulatory violations to oepa.
in july of,charvat attended his first meeting with the board.he reported to them that the plant had operational problems that required immediate attention,that staff morale and motivation were low,and that he intended to improve communications with oepa.to better assess the situation,he requested support from the board,particularly in the form of an engineering study of the treatment facilities.the board took no action in response to charvat request.charvat repeated his concerns to the board in another meeting in august of.the board again failed to respond.
eorwa employees were not accustomed to reporting operational violations under charvat predecessor.in fact,charvat claims that the employees feared losing their jobs if they did so.one plant operator,paul russell,had written anonymous letters to board member wilson outlining eorwa permit violations.when wilson failed to take action,russell made his reports available to oepa,which conducted an investigation of eorwa in collaboration with ohio bureau of criminal investigations.oepa issued a letter to eorwa in december of that listed many of eorwa violations.russell alleged that his coworkers subjected him to a hostile work environment as a result of his attempt to report regulatory violations to oepa.
charvat efforts resulted in a greater reporting of permit violations.in november of,charvat asked oepa to provide a technical assist team to visit eorwa plant.oepa subsequently placed eorwa on its significant noncompliance list.an oepa staff person contacted charvat on december,to inform him that oepa would reopen its investigation of eorwa.shortly thereafter,wilson called charvat and expressed his anger that charvat actions had resulted in the reopening of the oepa investigation.wilson also allegedly made a statement to charvat to the effect that wilson would not have his political career ruined by the sewage authority.
charvat later informed board member tekely that office manager pollock,among others,was in charvat opinion responsible for operating the plant in violation of permit requirements and for discouraging employees from reporting the violations.tekeley suggested that charvat reorganize the staff.charvat alleges that the board initially assured him of its support for his reorganization plan.the board,however,later criticized the plan that he eventually devised and cited it as an example of his incompetence in managing the workplace.it also invited employees to a confidential meeting to discuss the implications of charvat reorganization plan.the board later told charvat that pollock was the only employee who complained about charvat performance as superintendent.
the rancor between charvat and the board intensified from january of until the time of charvat termination in september of that year.furthermore,charvat and pollock had a dispute in may of that resulted in charvat disciplining pollock for insubordination.pollock subsequently filed charges against charvat with oepa.charvat responded with a letter detailing pollock mismanagement of eorwa operations.the letter also highlighted more eorwa permit violations.the board held a meeting on may,after which it informed charvat that he had days to improve employee morale and plant operations.
on june,the ohio attorney general oag notified eorwa that he was commencing a civil enforcement action that could impose a substantial civil penalty on eorwa.the letter also proposed that eorwa engage in negotiations with the oag to settle the dispute.aware of the gravity of the situation,charvat sent a formal letter to the board,recommending the disclosure of known regulatory violations and a comprehensive internal investigation to uncover the extent of eorwa noncompliance with oepa permit requirements.charvat maintains that this letter constituted protected speech under the first amendment,yet was a substantial cause of the board decision to terminate him later that year.the board held a special meeting to discuss charvat letter and its position regarding the oag civil enforcement action.it decided to exclude charvat from meeting with the oag and from participating in eorwa negotiations with the ohio authorities.
charvat alleges that the board,and board member thomas in particular,orchestrated a plan to convince the oag that the board was largely ignorant of the extent of eorwa environmental violations.as part of the plan,the board made it clear to eorwa employees that they were not permitted to speak directly with the oag without first gaining approval from the board.board member thomas admitted that charvat would have been fired had he approached the oag with any information regarding eorwa permit violations.the board efforts paid off,literally.the oag concluded his negotiations with eorwa by imposing a fine of approximately,rather than the million that the oag had initially sought.
charvat efforts to discover,report,and correct regulatory violations created tension among the employees at eorwa.as a result,the board invited all employees to a meeting to express their complaints about charvat in august of.only one employee attended,and his testimony did not constitute a strong complaint against charvat.
on august,the board voted to commence termination proceedings against charvat.fifteen grounds were listed to justify termination.the reasons mostly involved complaints about charvat management style and his failure to follow orders from the board.a hearing was held by the board.board members thomas,tekely,and lavapies then met on september,in executive session.they voted to terminate charvat employment and to name pollock and another employee as cosuperintendents.
procedural background 
charvat filed a complaint with the department of labor dol on october,pursuant to the whistleblower provisions of the cwa and the sdwa.the only named defendant in that action was eorwa.his complaint alleged that eorwa unlawfully retaliated against him for reporting the facility regulatory violations to eorwa board and to oepa.the dol employment standards administration,wage and hour division,found charvat complaint to be without merit.charvat then requested a hearing.a dol administrative law judge alj held a series of hearings throughout on his claim.
on july,the alj issued a recommended decision and order,holding for charvat.the order details at length the testimony of the witnesses that appeared before the alj.charvat presented evidence of the board attempts to undermine his efforts at uncovering,reporting,and fixing various regulatory violations at the treatment facility.eorwa offered the testimony of board member wilson and several employees.they claimed that charvat was ineffective as a superintendent,that he lowered morale among eorwa employees,and that he was insubordinate in not complying with the board orders.
the alj found that charvat had met his burden by proving that eorwa justifications for termination were a pretext to mask its unlawful motive of preventing charvat from reporting regulatory violations.as a result of his findings,the alj ordered eorwa to reinstate charvat as superintendent under his original employment terms and to pay charvat in back pay with interest,for emotional distress and loss of reputation,in exemplary damages,and attorney fees incurred in the litigation before the alj.both parties filed an appeal of the alj decision,a proceeding inexplicably still pending before the dol.
charvat also commenced an action in federal court on september,against eorwa and the six named defendants,claiming violations of and various provisions.he contends that his termination was in retaliation for the exercise of his first amendment rights.eorwa and the four board members filed a combined answer.pollock and thomas jointly filed a separate answer.on february,the district court stayed the case pending the disposition of charvat administrative claim before the dol.the district court lifted the stay once the alj issued his order.
charvat then filed a motion for partial summary judgment,arguing that the alj order was res judicata in his favor on the issues of liability and injunctive relief under.eorwa,the four board members,pollock,and thomas jointly opposed charvat motion.they also for judgment on the pleadings,or alternatively,summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.pollock and thomas filed an additional supplemental motion for summary judgment,arguing in particular their lack of liability because they had no authority to hire or fire charvat.the district court granted charvat motion to amend his complaint by adding a claim for conspiracy under.
on march,the district court ruled on all of the pending motions.it held that charvat had stated a viable claim for a first amendment violation under,and that the statutory whistleblower provisions providing for administrative remedies do not preclude him from proceeding with his action.furthermore,it denied the for judgment on the pleadings and denied the motions of the six individual defendants for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.finally,it granted the defendants motion to dismiss charvat conspiracy claims under.
ii.analysis 
a.the whistleblower provisions of the cwa and sdwa do not preclude charvat from pursuing a first amendment retaliation claim under 
the defendants maintain that there is a threshold question that must be resolved before reviewing whether charvat has stated a claim under.they argue that congress intended to foreclose the type of retaliation suit brought by charvat under by enacting the whistleblower provisions of the cwa and sdwa.in its pretrial order,the district court held that the whistleblower provisions do not preclude charvat suit.
although we have jurisdiction only over final judgments of the district court pursuant to and specific kinds of interlocutory orders,we retain the discretion to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction.the doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction allows an appellate court,in its discretion,to exercise jurisdiction over issues that are not independently appealable when those issues are inextricably intertwined with matters over which the appellate court properly and independently has jurisdiction.chambers ohio dep t of human,cir.because we have proper jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal by the four board members,pollock,and thomas from the district court denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity,and because the threshold question raised is inextricably intertwined with charvat claim,we shall exercise our pendent appellate jurisdiction to review the district court determination that the whistleblower provisions of the cwa and the sdwa do not foreclose charvat from pursuing his claim.
the cwa provides an administrative remedy that protects employees who report violations of that act.it states 
no person shall fire,or in any other way discriminate against,or cause to be fired or discriminated against,any employee or any authorized representative of employees by reason of the fact that such employee or representative has filed,instituted,or caused to be filed or instituted any proceeding under this chapter.
a.the section then outlines the procedure for filing a complaint with the secretary of labor.a whistleblower provision in the sdwa sets forth the same procedures for administrative remedies for employees covered by that act.see i.both statutes provide for a investigation and hearing by the secretary of labor.the secretary is then authorized to issue an initial order and grant appropriate relief.these orders are appealable to an alj,whose decision may also be appealed to the administrative review board of the dol.see d,a.final administrative orders are appealable to the court of appeals in the region where the alleged violation occurred.see b,b i a.
the defendants contend that the congressional intent behind the whistleblower provisions contained in the cwa and the sdwa was to create an exclusive remedy that precludes employees such as charvat from bringing a claim in federal court.no legislative history is cited to support their position.moreover,the statutes are silent on this issue.the defendants claim,however,that their argument is supported by the doctrine set forth in middlesex county sewerage authority national sea clammers ass n,d.
in national sea clammers,individual fishermen and an association of fishermen brought a class action against various federal,state,and local officials for violating regulations under the federal water pollution and control act fwpca,the marine protection,research,and sanctuaries act of mprsa,and other federal environmental statutes.see id.at.both of the named statutes have provisions that authorize private persons to sue for injunctions to enforce the requirements of the statute.they also spell out specific procedures for filing such citizen suits.see id.at.the court determined that i n view of these elaborate enforcement provisions it can not be assumed that congress intended to authorize by implication additional judicial remedies for private citizens suing under mprsa and fwpca.id.furthermore,it stated that w hen the remedial devices provided in a particular act are sufficiently comprehensive,they may suffice to demonstrate congressional intent to preclude the remedy of suits under.id.at.finally,the court concluded that the existence of these express remedies demonstrates not only that congress intended to foreclose implied private actions but also that it intended to supplant any remedy that otherwise would be available under.id.at.
the national sea clammers doctrine,however,is not directly parallel to the question of whether the whistleblower provisions of the cwa and sdwa foreclose a suit based on the violation of an individual constitutional rights.first,the plaintiffs in national sea clammers were suing to enforce substantive rights set forth in the very statutes that provide for citizen suits,whereas charvat is seeking relief for an alleged violation of his first amendment rights.second,the provisions of the fwpca and the mprsa create a direct cause of action in federal court,whereas the whistleblower provisions at issue in charvat case only provide for an administrative remedy,with final review available in federal court.
charvat responds to the defendants contention by insisting that english general electric,d,is directly on point.the plaintiff in english filed a complaint with the secretary of labor under the whistleblower provision of the energy reorganization act.see english,at.she then initiated a separate diversity suit in federal court against her employer,raising claims for wrongful discharge and for the intentional infliction of emotional distress.see id.at.the court was faced with the question of whether the federal government has petitioner tort claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.id.at.because the issue of federal preemption of state law differs from the national sea clammers question of whether statutory enforcement mechanisms preclude federal suits under,english is not as on point as charvat claims it to be.
the supreme court,however,has narrowed the national sea clammers doctrine through subsequent caselaw,which leads to the conclusion that the whistleblower mechanisms provided by the cwa and the sdwa do not preclude an employee of a public employer from suing under for a violation of his or her first amendment rights.in particular,the court has held that t he availability of administrative mechanisms to protect the plaintiff interests is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that congress intended to foreclose a remedy.golden state transit city of los angeles,d holding that the national labor relations board exclusive jurisdiction to remedy unfair labor practices by employers and unions does not preclude a plaintiff from filing suit under to protect labor rights under the national labor relations act against governmental interference.rather,the statutory framework must be such that allowing a plaintiff to bring a action would be inconsistent with congress carefully tailored scheme.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
the burden thus lies with the defendant in a action to prove preclusion.i f there is a state deprivation of a right secured by a federal statute,provides a remedial cause of action unless the state actor demonstrates by express provision or other specific evidence from the statute itself that congress intended to foreclose such private enforcement.wright city of roanoke redevelopment hous,d holding that the brooke amendment to the housing act,which provides the department of housing and urban development with mechanisms to enforce the rights in the act,does not preclude plaintiffs from also enforcing the act through suits under.
in essence,the defendants argue that because congress has created a federal statutory right to be free from adverse employment action as a result of bringing to light an employer violations of the cwa and sdwa,the administrative remedies provided by the whistleblower provisions of these acts should be exclusive.the crucial point,however,is that charvat suit raises the issue of whether the defendants violated his constitutional right to free speech,not simply whether charvat suffered from an adverse employment action.this distinction is perhaps best demonstrated by our circuit in the case of lillard shelby county board of education,cir,which held that title ix statutory remedy for claims of discrimination in an educational program receiving federal financial assistance does not preclude plaintiffs from bringing a substantive due process claim under.in sum,the defendants have failed to prove that congress intended for the whistleblower provisions of the cwa and sdwa to preclude the enforcement of constitutional rights through.
finally,the defendants cite bush lucas,d,in support of their contention that the cwa and sdwa whistleblower provisions preclude charvat from pursuing a remedy under.the plaintiff in bush,a federal employee,sued his employer,the national aeronautics and space administration nasa,for damages based on the doctrine of bivens six unknown federal narcotics agents,d.given the uniqueness of the bivens remedy,the supreme court held that administrative remedies available to federal employees were sufficient to preclude bivens actions for claims based on first amendment retaliation.it did so,however,in light of the complex regulations applicable to federal employees.see id.at.as such,the holding of bush and its progeny that federal employees can not pursue damages remedies against their employers for first amendment retaliation is distinguishable from our analysis under.
in conclusion,we agree with the district court holding that the whistleblower provisions of the cwa and the sdwa do not preclude charvat from bringing suit under for alleged retaliation in violation of his protected first amendment rights.
b.the district court properly held that the six individual defendants named in charvat suit were not entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity 
standard of review 
the doctrine of qualified immunity shields government officials from liability,as well as from suit,as long as their official conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.a district court must engage in a inquiry when determining whether a state actor is entitled to qualified immunity.first,the court must ask whether the plaintiff in the civil action has demonstrated the violation of a constitutionally protected right.second,the court must examine whether the right is so clearly established that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.brennan township of northville,cir citation omitted.
the four board members,pollock,and thomas question whether charvat reporting of the environmental violations constituted speech protected by the first amendment,thereby raising a question of law properly reviewable on interlocutory appeal.see johnson jones,d holding that the denial of qualified immunity is reviewable on interlocutory appeal only if the case presents abstract issues of law.we review the denial of a motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity de novo.see estate of dietrich burrows,cir.
charvat letters were protected speech because they involved matters of public concern 
even if charvat has the right to sue under,the defendants contend that he has failed to state a claim of retaliation under the first amendment because he has not shown that he was punished for speaking on a matter of public concern.they further maintain that under pickering board of education,d,eorwa interest as a public employer in restraining charvat speech outweighs any burden imposed on his rights under the first amendment.their position,therefore,is that charvat has failed to prove that the board members,pollock,or thomas violated a clearly established constitutional right.
