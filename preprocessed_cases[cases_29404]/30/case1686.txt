this is an appeal from an order of the superior court of kern county denying a petition for a writ of mandamus in favor of respondents county of kern the county and kern county board of supervisors the board.
real parties in interest north sky river energy,llc north sky river,and jawbone wind energy,llc jawbone applied for rezoning and a conditional use permit for mobile concrete batch plants in order to build and operate a wind farm in the tehachapi wind resource area.pursuant to the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et and its guidelines the county conducted an initial study,determined that the project might impose a significant impact on the environment,and prepared a draft environmental impact report eir.the draft eir,inter alia,indicated that the project wind turbine generators wtg might pose a significant safety hazard to aircraft and gliders using kelso valley airport kva,and described mitigation measure mm which required north sky river and jawbone to obtain a determination of no hazard to air navigation from the federal aviation administration faa for each wtg prior to issuance of building permits.after the county circulated the draft eir for public review and prepared a final eir responding to comments,the board concluded that mm minimized the wtg potential adverse effects on aviation safety,certified the final eir,and approved north sky river and jawbone rezoning and conditional use permit requests.
on october,appellant citizens opposing a dangerous environment code timely petitioned for a writ of mandamus to set aside eir certification and project approval on the grounds that mm was ineffective and respondents failed to comply with ceqa requirements the superior court tentatively denied the petition on february,affirmed its ruling on april,and signed its order on may.respondents served and filed a notice of entry of the court order on may,and code filed a notice of appeal on june,
on appeal,code presents the following issues 
whether federal aviation law preempted the county from identifying and imposing feasible alternatives mitigation measures on the project to avoid or eliminate the project admitted potentially hazardous impacts on kva 
whether the county responses to code comments on the eir and the project complied with ceqa and the guidelines 
whether substantial evidence in the administrative record supports the county finding that mm reduces the project admitted potentially hazardous aviation impacts on kva to a level of insignificance 
whether the county improperly rejected code proffered feasible alternatives and mitigation measures to eliminate the project admitted potential impact on aviation at kva and 
whether substantial evidence in the administrative record supports the county rejection of the eir environmentally superior alternative.
we conclude as a matter of law,the county eir described a legally feasible mitigation measure as a matter of law,the county was not required to respond to late comments substantial evidence supported the board conclusion that mm mitigated significant impacts on aviation safety and the board was not required to consider either code proffered mitigation measure or the eir environmentally superior alternative.therefore,we affirm the superior court order denying code petition for a writ of mandamus.
factual history 
north sky river and jawbone proposed the construction and operation of a megawatt wind farm,consisting of wtg,ancillary facilities,and supporting infrastructure,on a acre site in the tehachapi wind resource area they requested the rezoning of acres from exclusive agriculture districts to wind energy combining districts and a conditional use permit for mobile concrete batch plants the county conducted an initial study,determined the project might impose a significant environmental impact,prepared a draft eir,and circulated the document for public review from may,to june.the comment period closed june.
the draft eir enumerated the following project objectives 
north sky river objectives for the project are to 
make a significant contribution toward achieving the california renewable portfolio standard goal that percent of electricity be generated by renewable energy by

support california goal of percent renewable energy generation by.
concerning the project potential adverse effects on aviation safety and the mitigation of these effects,the draft eir detailed 
impact for a project within the vicinity of a private airstrip,would the project result in a safety hazard for people residing or working in the project area 
the project could pose a navigation hazard to private aircraft and high performance gliders using nearby private airstrips due to the height of the wtg structures maximum height of feet above ground surface.the proposed project is located near one unpermitted private airstrip kva,which is located miles northwest or west of the project site boundary.mm would ensure that the proposed project complies with all faa regulations regarding structures located within proximity to airstrips.
mitigation measures implement mm.
level of significance after mitigation impacts would be less than significant.
mm prior to issuance of building permits,the project proponents shall submit form noti ce of proposed construction or alteration to the faa,in the form and manner prescribed in code of federal regulation s part.the project proponents shall also provide documentation to the county planning and community development department demonstrating that the faa has issued a determination of no hazard to air navigation.this documentation shall include written concurrence from the military authority responsible for operations in the flight area depicted in the county zoning ordinance figure that all project components would create no significant military mission impacts a wind turbine generator lighting plan and a helicopter lift plan demonstrating compliance with all requirements set forth by the faa and the county.documentation shall also be furnished to the county planning and community development department demonstrating that a copy of the approved form s has been provided to the operators of kva,california city municipal airport,tehachapi municipal airport,edwards air force base,china lake naval air weapons station,and fort training center.
the faa regulates aviation at regional,public,private,and military airports the faa regulates objects affecting navigable airspace and structures taller than feet according to code of federal regulations part.the and california departments of transportation also require the proponent to submit faa form,notice of proposed construction or alteration.according to code of federal regulations part,notification allows the faa to identify potential aeronautical hazards in advance,thus preventing or minimizing any adverse impacts on the safe and efficient use of navigable airspace 
as described in code of federal regulations part construction or alteration requiring notice,each sponsor who proposes any of the following construction or alteration scenarios shall notify the faa in the form and manner prescribed in code of federal regulations part any construction or alteration of more than feet in height above the ground level at its site.
per code of federal regulations part,notification requirements include sending one executed form set four copies of faa form,notice of proposed construction or alteration,to the manager,air traffic division,faa regional office having jurisdiction over the area within which the construction or alteration will be located.the notice required must be submitted at least days before the earlier of the following dates the date the proposed construction or alteration is to begin or the date an application for a construction permit is to be filed.
the draft eir also described three alternatives alternative a no project precluded construction and maintained the environmental status quo for the foreseeable future.alternative b relocate to san gorgonio wind resource area moved the project to a comparable site in riverside county.lastly,alternative c reduced project size eliminated up to wtg in areas of high biological and cultural resource sensitivity.the draft eir concluded 
alternative a,the no project alternative,would be environmentally superior to the project on the basis of the minimization or avoidance of physical environmental impacts.section e of the guidelines states that if the no project alternative is found to be environmentally superior,the eir shall also identify an environmentally superior alternative among the other alternatives.
due to the reduction of impacts to aesthetics,biological resources,and cultural resources achieved by alternative c reduced project size,it is considered the environmentally superior alternative.alternative c reduces the significant and unavoidable impacts of the proposed project and has less severe significant impacts as compared to alternative b 
alternative c would achieve some of the project proponents objectives.because the alternative would reduce the project by up to wtg s,it would reduce the contribution towards achieving the california renewable portfolio standard goal and would subsequently reduce the benefit renewable energy offers to greenhouse gas emissions 
kva,a private airport owned by philippe athuil ante,fn,is located on a acre plot adjacent to the tehachapi wind resource area about miles from the project site.one of athuil attorneys,dale goldsmith,sent the following letter dated june,to the county 
athuil is very concerned that the construction and operation of the project as proposed will present severe safety risks to the glider pilots who use kva.the project proposes to erect a number of up to foot tall wtg in the glide path of the gliders.a collision between a glider and a wtg could maim or kill the pilot.the project can and should be modified to eliminate this safety hazard to allow kva and the project to coexist.
e xisting terrain limits the number of feasible ingress and egress routes to and from kva.the proposed wtg would block or severely limit the use of two of the three primary approach routes,leaving only one practical air route to and from kva.moreover,the proposed wtg sites are densely clustered and positioned on ridges that normally provide additional lift for gliders attempting to return to the airport.unpowered aircraft such as gliders have extremely shallow descent ratios,ranging from to without the use of spoilers or other lift reducing equipment techniques.increasing the height of the obstruction field with wtg s and eliminating a pilot ability to safely use the ridgeline will change the pilot transit strategy and substantially decrease margins of safety for landing at kva.this could result in tragic consequences.
the draft eir does not consider the project land use compatibility with adjoining land uses,including kva.as discussed above,the wtg s along the nearby ridgeline will severely impact current glider operations at kva and create significant safety hazards.it also will likely preclude future commercial use of kva.the draft eir should be revised to include this analysis,disclose adverse impacts,and require mitigation measures,such as relocating the wtg s from the ridgelines,to reduce the impacts to less than significan t.
in july,the county published the final eir,which contained the following response to goldsmith june,letter 
kva was considered in the analysis and the implementation of mm mm would require that the project proponent file a form,noti ce of proposed construction or alteration,with the faa for each wtg,met eorological evaluation tower,transmission line tower and construction crane meeting the faa requirements for a determination of no hazard to air navigation.if the faa determines that the project would result in a potential obstruction unless reduced to a specified height,the project proponents would be required to work with the faa to resolve any adverse effects on aeronautical operations.this mitigation measure would ensure less than significant impacts to existing aviation facilities and airspace use.the faa makes the final determination on safety issues related to flight hazard.
howard weinberg,another of athuil attorneys,provided the county with a report by william long dated august.in his report,long detailed 
as an aviation services professional,my career includes experience in aircraft ground services,air traffic control,airspace management,airport operations management,aviation system development and as a senior aviation consultant and former faa airport inspector.i possess a rich and uniquely diverse foundation of ensuring airport environments that support and encourage safe and practical aircraft operations which in turn enhances the safety of communities enhanced impacted by aviation 
it is my understanding that two separate faa form applications were made by the project proponents with regard to proposed construction of wtg athuil and his representatives have never been contacted by the faa,have never been invited to submit comments to the safety analysis performed by the faa,and have never received copies of the determinations allegedly issued by the faa.all of this is a direct violation of the formal process,procedures and protocol required by the operating rules and policies of the faa.there is little credibility to any faa safety study conducted based solely upon the faa form submitted by the project applicants.the only legitimate safety review must be conducted as part of a public process,including comments by the stakeholders who will be the direct beneficiaries of a proper safety study,and who,without a proper safety study,will be the injured parties colliding with dangerously placed wtg 
on august,the county planning commission conducted a public hearing and recommended eir certification and project approval.
on or after august,zachary walton,counsel for north sky river,provided the county with an airspace and obstacle evaluation study by ron morgan of jda aviation technology solutions.in this study,morgan disputed long august,report 
kva is a airport and not subject to the same protections afforded to airports that serve the public.that being said,the faa has means to mitigate turbine development in close proximity to airport finals and has done so at many airports around the country 
analysis conducted by the faa shows that there is no airspace compatibility issue to kva as a result of north sky river share of wtg.all turbines have been issued determinations of no hazard.very few airports in the united states,either private or public,have an obstruction free ground up surface around the airport.
long finding that no valid conclusions of airspace safety could be concluded are based upon the assumption that a not all faa offices were consulted in the obstruction evaluation process and b that comments were not solicited from the airport owner.jda contacted the faa specialist who handled these cases and found that all offices either responded to the case or were.in the development of the obstruction airspace analysis automation system,the faa developed criteria for the assessment of aeronautical studies by the disparate lines of business.certain offices opted to allow for automated review of certain cases based upon the location and height of the planned obstacle.the office of airports,for example,all cases with planned structures that are greater than nautical miles from a airport reference point.however,the office with responsibility for assessing impact on visual flight rule operations did review the case and found that the planned structures would have no adverse impact on visual flight rule operations.
faa order h paragraph a states that normally,any structure that would exceed obstruction standards,affect an airport,have possible visual flight rule effect,require a change in aeronautical operations or procedures should always be circularized.the planned turbines do not exceed the obstruction standards specified in code of federal regulations part.the planned turbines were found to have no impact on a public use airport and have no possible visual flight rule effect.no aeronautical operations or procedures would be changed as a result of the planned turbines.therefore,it was not necessary to circularize the cases.however,had the cases been circularized and had kva owner objected to the planned turbines based on perceived impacts to kva,the faa would likely have found that neither the standards for adverse effect nor substantial adverse effect would have been met.this would have resulted in the issuance of determinations of no hazard for all cases reviewed.
in a letter to the board dated september,weinberg remarked 
we have repeatedly asked for aviation safety studies to be performed,but the county has refused.we are now informed that north sky river has had the faa conduct some sort of automated or desktop review of the aviation risks posed by north sky river portion of the project.as discussed below,these faa determinations which have not been provided to us or to the public are inaccurate and inadequate.
our client,at some considerable expense,has had an aviation expert develop a map of the project area and the areas of intersection between the proposed wtg s and the flight paths of aircraft to and from kva one can,with no engineering or surveying expertise,immediately determine from the m ap that the proposed wtg locations will result in an unavoidable safety problem for aircraft using kva.in fact,if the project is approved and constructed,it would be so dangerous to fly near the wtg s that it is likely kva would become unusable.as the m ap make s clear,the project can not be approved until a detailed and proper aviation safety study is conducted and then the county can consider the aviation safety impacts of the project.
the project can not be now approved,because there is no required mitigation at all.in the case of kva,the faa has no authority to require the relocation of the wtg s,the change in their size or orientation in fact,the faa has no authority whatsoever regarding the construction of the proposed project.all that the faa can do is study the wtg s to be constructed and then determine the nature and extent of the aviation safety risk that will be created by such construction.simply requiring the project applicant,at some time in the future,to obtain a determination of no aviation risk prior to the issuance of a building permit is not a well defined or adequate mitigation measure.also,the county has failed to identify and consider all feasible mitigation measures.one example of a feasible mitigation measure is to relocate or eliminate all of the wtg s in the flight paths of aircraft using kva the wtg s shown on the m ap as interfering with aviation flight paths.this one mitigation measure alone is both feasible and necessary.
morgan letter states that north sky river has obtained determinations of no hazard from the faa as you know from our previous comment letters,the owner of kva has never been contacted by the faa or north sky river and has never given input into any faa safety determination,nor has athuil or this firm ever received a copy of the faa determinations.to date,the applicants for the project have spent a considerable amount of time and legal maneuvering to avoid disclosure of their interaction with the faa and the results of the faa review.even now,neither the county nor the public has reviewed the faa determinations.we believe that when a proper and fully public aviation safety study is completed,it will show the dire and unmitigated aviation safety impacts that would be created if the project was constructed.
i f the faa determinations were issued,they have been issued in violation of numerous applicable codes and regulations.athuil has never been contacted by the faa in connection with any such determination,no member of the faa has ever visited kva to consider the physical layout of the airport and its orientation and proximity to the proposed wtg s,no r has any hearing been held to consider this determination.these facts were confirmed by morgan letter that explained the faa determinations were technical jargon for the faa analyzing hazards based only upon the data presented to them by north sky river,without any confirmation that the data in fact comports with conditions on the ground and without contacting kva to our knowledge,the only way that the faa could have analyzed the aviation safety impacts of the wtg s would have been to use the old data in their database that showed the old runway configurations for kva.of course,if the faa did use these old runways as the basis of the faa determinations,they would have made significantly different conclusions about safety,because the old runway configurations did not have the direct flight path impacts into the wtg s that exist now for the current runway configurations.original fns.omitted.
in a report to the board dated september,the county staff responded to weinberg september,letter 
t he d raft eir discussed kva and it was considered in the analysis and implementation of d raft eir mm.mm would require that the project proponents file a form,noti ce of proposed construction or alteration,with the faa for each wtg,met eorological evaluation tower,transmission line tower,and construction crane meeting the faa requirements for a determination of no hazard to air navigation.if the faa determines that the project would result in a potential obstruction unless reduced to a specified height,the project proponents would be required to work with the faa to resolve any adverse effects on aeronautical operations.this mitigation measure would ensure that the project impacts on the environment would result in less than significant impact to existing aviation facilities and airspace use.
with regard to the concerns raised by weinberg regarding the adequacy of the faa determinations on no hazard to air navigation,staff notes that the faa is the expert federal agency in the field of air navigation and in determining hazards to air navigation.a major component of the faa purpose is to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace.the faa has issued a determination of no hazard for both components of the project,including north sky river and jawbone wind energy portions.
this expert opinion is supported by a professionally prepared aeronautical study additionally,staff notes that code of federal regulations part requires the faa to evaluate and produce a report on the construction of objects that may constitute a hazard to air navigation,for the purpose of ensuring the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace.thus,staff concludes that it is appropriate for the county to rely upon the faa expertise in evaluating whether the project will have an impact on air navigation.
the county staff further advised in an addendum report to the board dated september,
generally,airports are protected from encroachment by surrounding properties through the establishment of land use compatibility plans for public use airports,by airports acquiring avigation easements,or by the purchase of buffer lands.staff notes that the proposed project is not located within the sphere of influence of any adopted airport land use compatibility plan,nor has kva actively pursued or attempted to establish any avigation easements on adjacent properties.with no other land use mechanism having been established by kva,the county concludes that the faa is the most appropriate agency to make any final determinations as related to any hazards to flight associated with the proposed project.
staff notes that an analysis of the proposed project and its potential impacts to kva was prepared by ron morgan in association with jda aviation technology solutions.morgan is the former director of the faa air traffic services division and is an expert in the field of aviation 
as previously stated,it was the determination of the county that impact to kva could be reduced to less than significant with implementation of the identified mitigation measure.this conclusion was further verified by morgan.your board should be advised that weinberg disagrees with this conclusion.section specifically states that a disagreement among experts does not make an eir inadequate,but that the eir should summarize the main points of disagreement among the experts.staff notes that these points of contention as raised by weinberg have been described in the final eir,and in subsequent staff reports prepared for this project,pursuant to ceqa.additionally,the faa has been provided copies of the eir and notifications of the proposed hearings.as of the time of this writing,staff has not received any comments from the faa indicating that additional analysis is required to determine whether or not construction of wtg within the project boundary would result in a significant hazard to flight.it is the county determination that under ceqa,sufficient information has been included into the record regarding the potential impacts to kva for your board to take action today regarding the proposed project.based on all information in the record,the county continues to believe that with implementation of mm,requiring submittal of a form with the faa,impacts will be reduced to a less th a n significant impact.
t he project before your board for consideration is a request to incorporate the wind energy combining district to various parcels within the project area.although the final eir prepared for the project has identified preliminary locations for future wtg,these locations are subject to change based on compliance with the county zoning ordinance and other requirements presented in the eir that have yet to take place.the faa determinations have not been included into the record because at this time the existing zoning would not allow for the installation of any wtg on site.although the applicant may have formal determinations by the faa as they relate to determinations of no hazard to flight,staff notes that these faa determinations are preliminary and were submitted by the applicant to the faa to determine whether there were any existing conditions that would prevent the implementation of wtg within the project boundary.any change in location and or size of the proposed wtg would require the project proponent to resubmit their form to the faa for consideration.
the commenter states that the owner of kva was not contacted by the faa regarding any hazard to flight determinations.staff notes these determinations are made by the faa and are outside the legal authority and control of the county.how the faa makes these determinations are not germane to the land use actions before your board for consideration today and are not subject to ceqa as it relates to this project.
if approved,the project proponent will be required to submit building permits for proposed turbines.prior to issuance of that building permit,mm requires the project proponent to submit to staff an adequate faa determination.implementation of this measure will ensure that any restrictions identified by the faa will be incorporated into the proposed project t he faa has been provided copies of the eir and hearing notices for the proposed project.no evidence has been submitted into the record by the faa indicating that additional information is necessary at this time should the faa determine that construction of wtg at specific locations would result in significant hazards to flight,the project proponent will be required to either reduce the turbine size,relocate the turbine or simply not construct that turbine at that location 
staff explains that the final layout o f wtg s will be determined through final engineering and if the project is approved,and that the full extent of the proposed wind energy combining district zone corridors where the wtg s could be located have been fully analyzed in the eir.staff also explains that in analyzing the proposed e ffects of the wtg,the final eir took a scenario approach and assumed that the applicants would utilize the largest and tallest possible wtg and analyzed for a maximum height of feet.therefore,the possible impacts of any of the proposed wtg models have been disclosed.staff notes that since that time,north sky river has selected a wtg type that is less than feet in height,which was analyzed in the eir.
the board conducted a public hearing on september.at the hearing,morgan testified 
my last six years i spent as the director of air traffic for faa,responsible for all the air traffic operation,all the air space operation in the united states.
the organization that deals with obstruction evaluation is an organization that worked for me when i was the director,so i fairly familiar with the processes and and rules that are are used by that organization.i continue as consultant working in that area with my partner,ben doyle and we probably work a thousand wind turbines a year related to obstruction evaluation issues.
there been a lot said about the obstruction evaluation process and documentation provided to this case and the fact that it was not done correctly.i personally had the discussion with the obstruction evaluation specialist who performed the work.there are a number of activities that she needed to go through to make sure it was correct.i asked her about those,and i can stand here tonight and tell you that she did every one of those.
we stand with determinations of no hazard issued by the federal government authority with the appropriate standing to make that decision.and with those determinations,i can tell you that kva and the turbines which are being proposed can with no hazard.
the board thereafter determined that mm mitigated the adverse effects of the project wtg on aviation safety,certified the eir,and approved the project.the board outlined the following in its mitigation monitoring program 
steps to compliance 
a.the project proponents shall comply with all requirements to maintain the faa determination of no hazard to air navigation.
b.the project proponents shall consult with the faa to resolve adverse effects on aeronautical operations.
c.the project proponents shall submit documentation of all communications with the faa and evidence of compliance with faa requests to the county planning and community development department.
d.the county planning and community development department will verify prior to issuing building and grading permits for the disputed wtg or areas.

iii.as a matter of law,the county eir described a legally feasible mitigation measure.

second,we reject code claim that the county hid behind the fig leaf of a federal preemption and consequently failed to exercise its express or implied powers to mitigate a significant environmental impact.the goal of a mitigation measure is to reduce the impact of a proposed project to insignificant levels.save panoche valley san benito county th.in the instant case,the impact at issue concerned aviation safety.f ederal law occupies the entire field of aviation safety montalvo spirit airlines cir,accord sierra pacific holdings,county of ventura th,booth santa barbara biplane tours,llc th,see a the united states government has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the united states.and the faa exercise s sole discretion in regulating air safety abdullah american airlines,cir,italics added see b air line pilots association,international quesada cir,the federal aviation act was passed by congress for the purpose of centralizing in a single authority indeed,in one administrator the power to frame rules for the safe and efficient use of the nation airspace.
