the hanford nuclear reservation hanford in washington is one of the largest sites in the country for the treatment,storage and disposal of radioactive and hazardous waste,currently storing over million gallons of mixed radioactive and nonradioactive hazardous waste.during world war ii,the united states government constructed hanford to manufacture plutonium for military purposes.in re hanford nuclear reservation,cir as amended over the decades,the united states department of energy doe has disposed of approximately billion gallons of contaminated water and liquid mixed waste on the site.at least one million gallons of mixed radioactive and hazardous waste have leaked into the environment and approximately miles of groundwater beneath hanford are contaminated.in addition,tens of millions of gallons of waste are stored at hanford in tanks that were constructed in the and meant to last only twenty years.as of,there was a backlog of over cubic meters of mixed waste and transuranic mixed waste awaiting treatment and disposal.
in,washington department of ecology ecology,the doe,and the united states environmental protection agency epa entered into the hanford federal facility agreement and consent order,also known as the agreement,to bring hanford into compliance with federal and state environmental laws.however,according to ecology,since signing the agreement,the doe and its contractors have been cited numerous times for violations of federal and state hazardous and mixed waste laws and requirements.
the present appeal arises out of an effort by washington voters to prevent the addition of new radioactive and hazardous waste to the hanford nuclear reservation until the cleanup of existing contamination is complete.united states hoffman.although the desire to take action against further environmental contamination and to protect the health and welfare of the community is understandable,we conclude that the statute enacted through the passage of initiative,the cleanup priority act cpa,is preempted by federal law.this result is dictated by a plain reading of the washington statute,as interpreted by the washington supreme court,as well as longstanding principles of federal preemption.
background 
the field of environmental law has spawned multiple acronyms.many of these acronyms are well recognized,like epa,while others,like hwma,are not.for ease of reference,we offer the following glossary of terms 
statutory framework for hazardous waste management 
hazardous waste is regulated at both the federal and state levels.the resource conservation and recovery act rcra,enacted in in response to the environmental and public health risks associated with the mismanagement of hazardous waste,created a permit scheme for the treatment,disposal,or storage of hazardous waste.see id.a united states kentucky,cir.under the rcra,states may apply to the epa for authorization to administer a hazardous waste program in lieu of the federal program.b.washington is authorized to administer its own program,and does so through the hazardous waste management act hwma,rcw.
despite federal cleanup efforts,hazardous waste contamination continued to be a problem.ecology claims that federal facilities,including hanford,were among the worst offenders.in,congress enacted the federal facilities compliance act ffca to make it as clear as humanly possible that congress was waiving federal sovereign immunity and making federal facilities subject to state laws.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of dingell see.this act also added a provision to the rcra that requires the doe to submit its treatment plans for mixed waste to the states for approval,modification,or disapproval.
disposal of nuclear and radioactive materials falls,however,into a special category and is separately regulated by the federal government.thus,solid waste regulated by the rcra does not include source,special nuclear,or byproduct material as defined by the atomic energy act of.the atomic energy act,aea,enacted in,established a comprehensive regulatory scheme for military and domestic nuclear energy.natural res.def.council abraham,cir.amendments to the aea in gave states some regulatory authority,but the atomic energy commission,now the nuclear regulatory commission,retain ed exclusive regulatory authority over the disposal of such byproduct,source,or special nuclear material as the commission determines should,because of the hazards or potential hazards thereof,not be disposed of without a license from the commission.silkwood,d quoting c.
radioactive waste that is subject to regulation under the aea frequently may be mixed with waste that is regulated by the rcra.no separate federal statute regulates this mixed waste.see kentucky,at.however,the doe and the epa have issued rules stating that mixed waste will be subject to dual regulation the aea will govern the radioactive component and the rcra or comparable state legislation will govern the component.see.july.may.this dual regulatory structure is the source of the conflict engendered by the cpa.
c.the cleanup priority act 
the ballot description of declared that t his measure would add new provisions concerning mixed radioactive and nonradioactive hazardous waste,requiring cleanup of contamination before additional waste is added,prioritizing cleanup,and providing for public participation and enforcement through citizen lawsuits.thus,the cpa became part of a complex state and federal system for regulating materials that are variously described as hazardous,dangerous,radioactive,or having some combination of these attributes.hoffman,at.counsel explained at oral argument that the cpa,passed by washington voters in november,was meant to eliminate ecology discretion in issuing permits under the rcra and the hwma and in taking action regarding investigation and cleanup.
toward those ends,of provides that a final facility permit can not issue until all units of a facility are in compliance with federal and state cleanup laws.significantly,a facility can not import mixed waste until it obtains a final facility permit.section requires that ecology take remedial and corrective action against releases of radionuclides into the environment.section contains mandates to ecology regarding the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances that have been disposed of in unlined trenches,and the closure of mixed waste tank systems.section requires ecology to obtain from mixed waste facility owners the projected costs of remedial and corrective actions.section grants exemptions from the cpa requirements for certain naval waste,in accordance with the state obligations under the northwest interstate compact.section requires facilities where there has been a release of mixed waste to provide for and fund a broadly representative advisory board,and directs ecology to make available public participation grants that will be funded by a mixed waste surcharge assessed against permit applicants and permit holders.finally,under,the cpa is enforceable through citizen suits.
the united states sought and obtained a temporary restraining order in federal district court against the enforcement of the cpa the day before its effective date,december,various sponsors of intervened as defendants sponsors.the united states argued that the cpa was invalid in its entirety because it violated the supremacy clause and the commerce clause of the united states constitution,and the sovereign immunity of the united states.fluor hanford fluor,a private contractor operating at hanford,intervened as a plaintiff.the industrial development council tridec,a corporation that represents local businesses and public entities in the area around hanford,also intervened as a plaintiff and asserted that the cpa violated the contract clause.
questions certified to the washington state supreme court 
the united states and fluor moved for summary judgment and tridec moved for partial summary judgment.in opposing the united states motion,the state argued that many of the claims could be narrowed or eliminated through statutory interpretation.see hoffman,at.the parties agreed that if the cpa covered only material that could be regulated under state law or the rcra,then the statute was not preempted by federal law.the district court granted the state motion to certify five questions to the washington supreme court,including the following question and its subparts that are directly relevant to this appeal 
what materials are encompassed within the definition of mixed waste set forth in section of the cpa rcw 
a specifically,does the definition of mixed waste encompass materials that consist solely of radioactive source,special nuclear,or byproduct materials and,if so,under what circumstances does the cpa apply to such materials 
b specifically,does the definition of mixed waste encompass materials that are mixtures of radioactive source,special nuclear,or byproduct materials and other hazardous substances that do no t designate as dangerous waste under state laws if so,under what circumstances does the cpa apply to such materials 
c specifically,does the definition of mixed waste encompass materials that are not solid wastes under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and,if so,under what circumstances does the cpa apply to such materials 
d in light of the court answers to subparts a through c,above,does the definition of mixed waste expand the scope of materials regulated as mixed waste under the washington hazardous waste management act hwma and rcra 
the washington supreme court accepted certification and,among others,answered question.the court began its analysis by tracing the definition of mixed waste,as used in the cpa,through its to other federal and state statutes.see id.at.under the cpa,mixed waste is defined as 
a ny hazardous substance or dangerous or extremely hazardous waste that contains both a hazardous component and a radioactive component,including any such substances that have been released to the environment,or pose a threat of future release,in a manner that may expose persons or the environment to either the nonradioactive or radioactive hazardous substances.
rcw.the court observed that the cpa definition of mixed waste incorporated the term hazardous substance,which is,in turn,defined as having the same meaning as the term is defined in the model toxics control act mtca,rcw.hoffman,at.the mtca is designed to deal both with the remediation of former environmental hazards and to prevent environmental hazards in the future,and makes a property owner strictly liable for the remediation of environmental hazards caused by hazardous substances it released or were released on its property.goodstein cont l cas,cir quoting,commercial union ins.the mtca definition of hazardous substance,in turn,the definition of hazardous substance in the hwma,rcw b hoffman,at.
as to question a,the parties agreed that the cpa does not address materials that are solely of radioactive source,special nuclear,or byproduct materials.id.in response to question b,the court concluded that the cpa definition of mixed waste includes material that does not designate as dangerous waste under the mtca and the hwma.id.at.waste must meet certain threshold quantity requirements of certain materials before it will designate as dangerous waste,id.at wac a c,but a hazardous substance,as defined by the hwma,has no threshold requirement.hoffman,at rcw.because the hwma definition of hazardous substance is incorporated into the cpa definition of mixed waste,mixed waste can include materials that will not designate as dangerous waste because those materials do not meet the threshold quantity requirement.
with respect to question c,the court concluded that the cpa definition of mixed waste included materials that were not solid waste under the rcra.hoffman,at.in light of its analysis of questions a c,the washington supreme court held that the cpa does expand the scope of materials currently subject to regulation as mixed waste beyond the hwma and the rcra.id.at responding to question d.
e.the district court decision 
the district court addressed the motion for summary judgment in a careful and extensive order.relying on the washington supreme court conclusions that the cpa definition of mixed waste includes materials that do not designate as dangerous waste and materials that are not solid waste under the rcra,the district court held that the cpa was preempted by federal law because it improperly intruded on the field governed by the aea by regulating byproduct,source,or special nuclear material.the court further held that specific provisions of the statute violated federal sovereign immunity and the commerce clause.in addition,the court granted tridec motion for partial summary judgment and held that the cpa also violated the contract clause.the court denied tridec motion for attorney fees under,which is the subject of its.we review de novo the district court rulings on summary judgment.buono norton,cir.
ii.analysis 
generally speaking,mixed waste is waste that has both a nonradioactive hazardous component and a radioactive component.unquestionably,the state has the authority to regulate nonradioactive hazardous materials,and does so primarily through the rcra and the hwma.the parties also agree that the regulation of pure radionuclides is governed by the aea.the question we address here is whether the regulation of the radioactive component of mixed waste is preempted by the aea.
field preemption 
as the supreme court observed,state law can be preempted in either of two general ways if congress evidences an intent to occupy a given field,or,if the field has not been occupied entirely,to the extent it actually conflicts with federal law or where the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of congress.silkwood,at.in a landmark case involving nuclear regulation,the court declared that the federal government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns,except the limited powers expressly ceded to the states.pac.gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm n,d.to determine whether the cpa is preempted by the aea,the test is whether the matter on which the state asserts the right to act is in any way regulated by the federal government.id.at.quoting rice santa fe elevator.the aea preempts the cpa if the purpose of the cpa is to regulate against radiation hazards,or if the cpa directly affects decisions concerning radiological safety.see english,d.we hold that the cpa is preempted on both grounds.
the district court concluded that the cpa intruded into the aea field because its purpose was to regulate the safety of radionuclides.relying on the washington supreme court analysis,it held that t he cpa exceeds rcra authority and,as such,intrudes upon a field regulation of aea radionuclides for radiological safety purposes,which is preempted by the aea.see.the court noted that t he cpa makes the presence of radioactive materials,whether or not a component of mixed waste,as defined by the cpa,the trigger for all of its requirements.as a further basis for preemption,the district court order listed eight ways in which the cpa would have a direct and substantial effect on the decisions made by those who build or operate nuclear facilities concerning radiological safety levels.
the cpa purpose is to regulate radioactive materials 
the cpa is preempted because it regulates within the field that is occupied by the aea it is abundantly clear from the text of the cpa that it is intended to regulate both nonradioactive hazardous substances and radioactive hazardous substances in order to protect health and environmental safety.
the policy section of the cpa,which corresponds to of,is telling as to the state intent to regulate radioactive safety.section describes hanford as a dump for radioactive hazardous or toxic wastes.rcw emphasis added.subsection warns that washington economy could be harmed from any accident releasing radiation.rcw emphasis added.subsection expresses the state policy of protecting residents from substances,including radionuclides.rcw.
the substantive provisions of the statute also squarely regulate both the nonradioactive and radioactive components of hazardous waste.for example,the first sentence of states 
any facility o
