since,the environmental protection agency epa has been responsible for regulating air pollution from offshore sources on the outer continental shelf ocs under the clean air act the act.we consider here whether the epa environmental appeals board eab properly upheld two air permits authorizing exploratory drilling operations in the arctic ocean by a drillship and its associated fleet of support vessels.the petition for review challenges two aspects of the permits the determination that support vessels,unlike the drillship itself,do not require the best available control technology bact to control emissions and the exemption of the area within a meter radius of the drillship from ambient air quality standards.
the application of bact to support vessels requires us to reconcile conflicting provisions of the act.in doing so,under chevron,nrdc,we defer to the eab reasonable interpretation of those provisions and related regulations.likewise,we evaluate whether the eab decision on the ambient air boundary is a permissible application of the epa regulations.in both cases,we uphold the epa statutory and regulatory interpretations,and we deny the petition.
background 
shell gulf of mexico,and shell offshore,collectively shell purchased lease in the chukchi and beaufort seas off the north slope of alaska for oil and gas exploration.shell plans to conduct this exploration via its drillship,the discoverer,along with an associated fleet of support vessels,including icebreakers,oil spill response vessels,and a supply ship.as required by the act,shell applied for permits to emit pollutants in connection with its exploration activities.the epa granted the permits,which were upheld in two administrative appeals to the eab.petitioners,resisting environmental destruction on indigenous lands,an environmental organization,and other environmental groups collectively redoil,challenge the permits on the basis that they do not satisfy the act air permit requirements.shell intervened to oppose redoil petitions.
two permits are at issue,one for operation in the chukchi sea and the other for the beaufort sea.the permits allow shell,subject to conditions,to construct and operate its discoverer drillship and use its associated fleet for exploratory drilling activities between july and november each year.the chukchi permit underwent two rounds of before it was issued in march.the beaufort permit underwent one round of before it was issued in april.the eab addressed the two permits together in the administrative proceedings that followed.
under the permits,shell must apply bact consisting of specific technologies selected by the epa,such as good combustion practices,a particular ventilation system,or a type of fuel to limit the emissions of specific pollutants subject to regulation under the act.central to this appeal,the epa determined that bact applies to the discoverer when it is attached to the seabed at a drill site by at least one anchor,and to any vessel that is tied to the discoverer under that condition.in short,the permits require shell to comply with technological requirements for the discoverer and the supply vessel whenever it is tied to the discoverer.however,the permits do not prescribe technological requirements for the remaining vessels in the associated fleet because they will not be physically attached to the discoverer.
redoil appealed the approval of the permits to the eab,seeking to have bact applied to the entire associated fleet whenever it is operating within miles of the discoverer,regardless of whether the vessels are tied to the drillship.redoil argued that establishes an unambiguous mandate requiring the epa to do so.citing ambiguity in requirements,the eab denied review in december,but remanded for reasons not at issue here.in re shell gulf of mexico,shell offshore,wl.
on remand,the epa issued revised air permits in september.the revised permits allow the discoverer an area with a meter radius,measured from the center of the drillship,that is exempt from ambient air standards.the exemption is conditioned on the united states coast guard establishment of an effective safety zone that prohibits members of the public from entering the area.shell must also develop and implement a public access control program to notify the general public of the prohibition on entering the safety zone,and communicate to north slope communities relevant information about exploration operations,such as timing and location.
redoil appealed the revised permits to the eab,this time targeting the ambient air exemption.redoil urged that the exemption contravened both the definition of ambient air in the epa regulations and the agency longstanding interpretation of those regulations.the eab dismissed this second round of appeals in a january order,noting that ambient air exemptions are determined on a basis.in re shell gulf of mexico,shell offshore,wl,at.the permits became effective on january.notice of approval of clean air act outer continental shelf permits issued to shell gulf of mexico,and shell offshore,for the discoverer drillship.
redoil now seeks review of both the december eab ruling declining to apply bact to the entire associated fleet and the january eab ruling on the meter ambient air exemption.
ii.application of bact to the associated fleet 
statutory framework 
enacted in,the clean air act established a comprehensive program to protect and enhance air quality by limiting emissions from both stationary industrial sources and mobile sources.et.central to this legislation are national air standards,known as national ambient air quality standards naaqs,set by the epa for pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment.the act has been significantly amended twice,in and.clean air act amendments of,stat.clean air act amendments of,stat.the prevention of significant deterioration psd program and its related bact requirement were first included in the amendment,which dealt with onshore sources of air pollution.the psd program was later applied to offshore sources on the ocs through the amendment.the extent to which bact applies to an associated fleet turns on the interaction between the two amendments.
the amendment directed that major new stationary sources of pollution and major existing stationary sources that are being significantly modified must obtain preconstruction permits through a process called new source review.psd is the new source review program for areas with relatively clean air those areas that the epa designates as in attainment with naaqs or as unclassifiable due to insufficient data.the program purpose is to protect the public from any adverse health or welfare effects of air pollution that may occur despite achievement of naaqs,and to require careful evaluation of all consequences of new industrial development.
under the psd program,n o major emitting facility may be constructed without a conforming permit.a.major emitting facility is defined,in part,as a stationary source of air pollutants with the potential to emit certain threshold levels of specified air pollutants subject to regulation.to obtain a psd permit,such a facility must,among other things,satisfy two independent requirements.the first requirement concerns emissions the owner or operator of the major emitting facility must conduct air quality analyses demonstrating that emissions from the facility will not cause or contribute to air pollution in violation of various air quality standards.a.the second requirement,and the one at issue here,concerns technology the proposed facility is subject to the best available control technology for each pollutant subject to regulation emitted from such facility.a.the obligation to apply bact requires the epa to select emission control technologies that result in the maximum reduction of specified pollutants in view of energy,environmental,and economic impacts and other costs.
the amendment extended the applicability of the psd requirements beyond major onshore stationary sources of air pollution.as a result of the amendment,the epa,for the first time,was given jurisdiction to regulate ocs sources located offshore of the states along the pacific,arctic and atlantic coasts and certain areas of the gulf coast.a.to achieve the goals of the psd program,congress directed the epa to establish requirements so that ocs sources would attain and maintain ambient air quality standards and comply with the psd program.id.
a key provision of is the definition of the term outer continental shelf source,which means any equipment,activity,or facility that i emits or has the potential to emit any air pollutant,ii is regulated or authorized under the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla,et,and iii is located on the outer continental shelf or in or on waters above the outer continental shelf.a c.significantly,jurisdiction under ocsla extends only to the subsoil and seabed of the outer continental shelf and all installations and other devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed.a.the statutory definition of ocs source additionally directs that,f or purposes of this subsection,emissions from any vessel servicing or associated with an ocs source,including emissions while at the ocs source or en route to or from the ocs source within miles of the ocs source,shall be considered direct emissions from the ocs source.a c iii.
in regulations adopted in,the epa incorporated sections i,ii and iii of the statutory definition of ocs source and added that it would include vessels only when p ermanently or temporarily attached to the seabed,or p hysically attached to an ocs facility,in which case only the stationary sources aspects of the vessels will be regulated.c.
b.the clean air act is ambiguous as to bact application to associated vessels not attached to an ocs source 
we next consider whether the act clearly and unambiguously requires the application of all aspects of the psd program,including bact,to associated vessels operating within miles of the ocs source,regardless of whether they are tied to the ocs source,as urged by redoil.in contrast,the epa and shell argue that the statute is ambiguous and that we owe deference to the epa permissible construction that bact applies to the discoverer,which is a stationary ocs source,but not to mobile support vessels unattached to the drillship.
to interpret the statute,we look first to the statute language itself and the specific context in which that language is used.mcneill united states,quoting robinson shell oil,internal quotation marks omitted.if the expressed intent of congress is clear,then the court and the agency must give effect to that unambiguously expressed intent.chevron,at.if,however,congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,then we must not simply impose our construction on the statute,as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation,but rather ask whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
an additional question is whether the eab interpretation deserves chevron deference.congress explicitly granted to the epa the authority to promulgate regulations and grant air permits for activities on the ocs.the epa exercised that authority through a formal process that included multiple rounds of public notice and comment,various petitions for administrative review,and two reasoned eab decisions upholding the air permits at issue.we join our sister circuits in concluding that the eab proceeding is a formal adjudication that warrants chevron deference.see in re lyon cnty.landfill,cir eab decisions are formal adjudications consistent with the administrative procedure act,and due chevron deference.citing united states mead,sultan chemists,epa,cir holding that an eab proceeding is a formal adjudication to which courts should defer under mead if the statutory language is ambiguous piney run ass cnty.com rs of carroll,cir noting that an earlier eab decision articulating a reasonable statutory interpretation is entitled to chevron deference.chevron deference also extends to the eab interpretation of the clean air act,which is administered by the epa.
it is useful to begin with what is clear and undisputed,both in the statute and by the parties.under a plain reading of the statute,the psd program and the bact requirement apply to an outer continental shelf source.a the epa is required to control air pollution from outer continental shelf sources by establishing requirements to ensure that such sources comply with the provisions of part c of subchapter i of this chapter the psd program.the discoverer,when it is attached to the seabed by an anchor,is an ocs source.additionally,an associated vessel that is tied to the discoverer while it is anchored to the seabed also becomes an ocs source because it is p hysically attached to an ocs facility,an alternative way to qualify as an ocs source under the epa regulatory definition.however,support vessels that are not p ermanently or temporarily attached to the seabed,or p hysically attached to an ocs facility,are not regulated or authorized under the outer continental shelf lands act and thus can not be an ocs source under the statute or under the epa regulatory definition.see a a c ii.congress therefore did not express an intention to regulate associated vessels as ocs sources,or to apply bact to associated vessels on that basis.
here is the rub.section also provides that f or purposes of this subsection,emissions from any vessel servicing or associated with an ocs source,including emissions while at the ocs source or en route to or from the ocs source within miles of the ocs source,shall be considered direct emissions from the ocs source.a c iii.redoil elliptically argues,based on this direct emissions clause,that congress intended to apply all psd requirements,including bact,to support vessels operating within miles of the ocs source,thereby effectively turning such support vessels into ocs sources.however,that conclusion does not follow unambiguously from the statutory language because the direct emissions clause does not redefine ocs source.
the statute does not instruct that any vessel servicing or associated with an ocs source while at the ocs source or en route to or from the ocs source within miles of the ocs source shall be considered an ocs source.rather,the direct emissions clause maintains a distinction between an ocs source,to which all psd requirements apply,and vessels servicing an ocs source,to which unspecified requirements apply because their emissions must be considered direct emissions from the ocs source.as noted in the eab decision,provides no further explanation as to why emissions from associated vessels should be considered direct emissions from the ocs source or to what effect.see in re shell gulf of mexico,wl,at.thus,congress gave conflicting signals by clearly and unambiguously excluding the associated fleet from the definition of ocs source and yet including the associated fleet emissions as direct emissions of the ocs source.
the act structure provides a further wrinkle suggesting that associated vessels may be treated differently from an ocs source.the psd program is found in title i of the act,which governs major stationary sources such as industrial plants,while mobile sources such as motor vehicles are regulated separately by title ii.id.at.by definition,a stationary source excludes any source of emissions resulting directly from an internal combustion engine for transportation purposes or from a nonroad engine or nonroad vehicle.z.the epa regulations in turn define marine engine as a nonroad engine that is installed or intended to be installed on a marine vessel.reading within the context of the psd provisions points to the conclusion that psd requirements should apply to stationary sources on the ocs,but not mobile marine vessels.we agree with the eab ruling that this distinction between stationary and mobile sources is consistent with application of bact to installations attached to the seabed but not to vessels,such as those in the associated fleet,moving freely in the waters above the ocs.in re shell gulf of mexico,wl,at.whether congress expressed an intention that bact were to apply to associated vessels that are not attached to an ocs source is,at the ver
