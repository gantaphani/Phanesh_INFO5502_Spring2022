asarco,llc asarco appeals the district court dismissal of its contribution action brought under f of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla.asarco seeks to recover from union pacific railroad and union pacific together,union pacific a share of million in cleanup costs asarco paid for environmental harm at the coeur superfund site in northern idaho.the district court dismissed the action under federal rule of civil procedure b,concluding that although asarco claim was timely,it was barred by a settlement agreement between the parties that settled union pacific claims against asarco at the same site.we conclude that asarco claim was timely,but that the parties settlement agreement did not unambiguously release asarco claim here.we therefore reverse the district court judgment dismissing the case under rule b.
background 
asarco and union pacific both participated in nearly a century of mining operations in the coeur river watershed,a square mile area located in idaho northern panhandle.asarco operated over mines in the coeur site,and union pacific built rail lines and transported ore and other materials for the region mining and smelting facilities.in,the environmental protection agency epa listed the coeur site on the cercla national priorities list.since then the site has undergone over years of cleanup efforts by the epa,the state of idaho,and potentially responsible parties,including asarco and union pacific.
in the,the united states,the state of idaho,and the coeur tribe each filed various claims against asarco and other mining companies for response costs and natural resource damages at the coeur site.these actions were consolidated in and,after a day trial,judge lodge of the united states district court for the district of idaho issued an order apportioning liability based on the volume of mining waste released into the basin waterways.asarco was found at least percent responsible.coeur tribe asarco,d.
in,before the damages portion of the consolidated case was concluded,asarco filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code.through bankruptcy,asarco sought to resolve approximately billion in environmental liabilities at sites throughout the country.union pacific and the united states both filed proofs of claim.
union pacific proofs of claim sought a general unsecured claim for payment of freight charges and response costs at numerous sites,including million in cercla response costs union pacific had paid at the coeur site.in,the parties entered into a settlement agreement the up settlement,which resolved all the claims by up or claims which up could have filed against asarco,and allowed union pacific a general unsecured claim of about million.upon the parties joint motion,the bankruptcy court approved the settlement.
the up settlement contains a mutual release provision,which states in relevant part 
asarco agrees to hereby release,remise,and discharge up from any and all damages,losses,expenses,costs,liabilities,claims,demands,suits,causes of action,and complaints,of any kind,character or description,in law or in equity,whether known or unknown,arising out of or in any way connected with remaining sites costs.emphasis added.
the up settlement defines remaining sites costs to mean costs of response under cercla incurred by up at the remaining sites,including the coeur site.emphasis added.
the united states also filed proofs of claim in asarco bankruptcy case,asserting that asarco was jointly and severally liable for more than billion in cleanup costs at the coeur site.the bankruptcy court held a hearing to estimate the united states claims against asarco,but before the court ruled,asarco and the united states executed an agreement settling the united states coeur claims us cda settlement.
the cda settlement resolved asarco liability for all remaining response costs and natural resource damages associated with the coeur site.under the settlement,asarco agreed that the united states would be entitled to general unsecured claims totaling about million.for its part,the united states covenanted not to sue asarco for further cercla costs w ith respect to the coeur site.the bankruptcy court approved the proposed settlement on june.
on june,asarco filed the underlying contribution action,seeking to recoup from union pacific a share of the million it paid under the cda settlement.asarco alleged that it had paid more than its allocable share of costs at the coeur site and demanded that union pacific pay its equitable share of any overpayment of costs by asarco.asarco original complaint defined the coeur site as a square mile area located in northern idaho and eastern washington,including a square mile area around the bunker hill mining complex and the upper and lower basins of the coeur river.the original complaint provided that f or purposes of this action,the coeur basin excludes the drainage of the north fork of the coeur river.less than two months later,however,asarco filed a first amended complaint fac as of right under rule a,and amended the definition of coeur basin to include the north fork drainage area that was originally excluded.
union pacific filed a motion to dismiss asarco fac under rule b,arguing that asarco claim was barred by the statute of limitations,the up settlement,res judicata,judicial estoppel,union pacific contribution protection,and asarco lack of any contribution rights.the district court rejected union pacific statute of limitations arguments,but nevertheless granted the motion because it concluded that the action was barred by the up settlement release provisions.
the district court acknowledged asarco argument that the defined term remaining sites costs limited asarco release to claims for costs incurred by up,but reasoned that if it read the agreement as limiting the releases to only union pacific claims the releases would then be anything but mutual.asarco,llc union pac,d.the district court concluded that g iven the scope of the definitions used in the fac and the plain language of the up settlement,it is clear that the claim raised in the fac is precluded by the mutual release language of the up settlement.id.at.the district court therefore dismissed asarco action and declined to rule on union pacific remaining defenses.id.at.
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim under rule b.hartmann cal.dep t of corr,cir.we may affirm the district court dismissal on any ground supported by the record.id.citing tahoe sierra council,tahoe reg l planning agency,cir.
dismissal under rule b on the basis of an affirmative defense is proper only if the defendant shows some obvious bar to securing relief on the face of the complaint.see sams,cir t he assertion of an affirmative defense may be considered properly on a motion to dismiss where the allegations in the complaint suffice to establish the defense.quoting jones bock,charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.a dismissal under rule b is likely to be granted by the district court only in the relatively unusual case in which the plaintiff includes allegations that show on the face of the complaint that there is some insuperable bar to securing relief.if,from the allegations of the complaint as well as any judicially noticeable materials,an asserted defense raises disputed issues of fact,dismissal under rule b is improper.scott kuhlmann,cir per curiam.
we first consider whether asarco fac is barred by cercla statute of limitations for claims seeking contribution after entry of a judicially approved settlement.see g.union pacific contends that asarco fac was untimely because it did not relate back to the date of the original complaint under rule c b,and even if it did,the original complaint was filed one day too late.we review de novo both the question whether an amended pleading relates back under rule c b,martell trilogy,cir,and the question whether a claim is barred by the statute of limitations,orr bank of,nt sa,cir.
an otherwise claim in an amended pleading is deemed timely if it relates back to the date of a timely original pleading.under rule c b,an amendment asserting a new or changed claim relates back to the date of the original pleading if the amendment arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set out in the original pleading.an amended claim arises out of the same conduct,transaction,or occurrence if it will likely be proved by the same kind of evidence offered in support of the original pleading.percy,cir quoting rural fire prot.hepp,cir.to relate back,the original and amended pleadings must share a common core of operative facts so that the adverse party has fair notice of the transaction,occurrence,or conduct called into question.martell,at.the relation back doctrine of rule c is liberally applied.clipper exxpress rocky mountain motor tariff bureau,cir.
this case presents an issue of first impression in this circuit can an amended pleading relate back if it includes allegations that were expressly disclaimed in the original pleading we hold that it can,and that in such cases the test continues to be the rule c b standard itself whether the amended claim arises out of the same conduct,transaction,or occurrence as that set forth in the original complaint.
in so holding,we are mindful of two competing concerns.on the one hand,the relation back doctrine is to be liberally applied.see see also rural fire,at noting that rule c is liberally applied especially if no disadvantage will accrue to the opposing party.indeed,rule purpose is to provide maximum opportunity for each claim to be decided on its merits rather than on procedural technicalities.wright et,supra.gone are the code pleading days when a party was irrevocably bound to the legal or factual theory of the party first pleading.id.
on the other hand,the purpose of the statute of limitations protecting defendants from stale claims is also to be respected.see credit suisse sec.usa llc simmonds,see also fdic conner,cir.amendments that significantly alter the pleadings could require the opposing party to start over and prepare the case a second time.wright et,supra.consistent with the protective purpose of the statute of limitations,f airness to the defendant demands that the defendant be able to anticipate claims that might follow from the facts alleged by the plaintiff.percy,at.
rule c strikes a balance between these competing concerns by providing that once litigation has been commenced,an opposing party is on notice that the pleading party may subsequently raise any claims or defenses that form part of the same conduct,transaction,or occurrence as the original pleading.thus,we have said,i t is the conduct,transaction,or occurrence test of rule c which assures that the relation back doctrine does not deprive the defendant of the protections of the statute of limitations.santana holiday inns,cir see also conner,at in the end,the best touchstone for determining when an amended pleading relates back to the original pleading is the language of rule c wright et,supra,explaining that even where a mendments go beyond the mere correction or factual modification of the original pleading and significantly alter the claim or defense alleged in that pleading,the search under rule c is for a common core of operative facts in the two pleadings.
our decision in rural fire protection hepp is instructive.there,the plaintiffs timely original complaint claimed unpaid wages under the fair labor standards act for pay periods between september,and april.at.during trial,and after the statutory limitations period had expired,plaintiffs were granted leave to amend their complaint to claim wages for an additional pay period from april to may.id.ruling on the defendants statute of limitations argument,we reasoned that there could be no question but that the amended pleading was based on the same transaction,was to be proved by the same kind of evidence appellant time records,and did not take appellant by surprise.id.at.the amendment,therefore,related back.id.
we do not believe it would have made any difference had the original complaint in rural fire explicitly excluded wages for the april to may,pay period.the plaintiffs there could have conceivably done so because,for example,they incorrectly believed they had no colorable claim to wages for that pay period and thus determined in good faith to limit the scope of their original claim.but suppose they were to learn later while conducting discovery that they in fact did have a colorable basis to seek wages for that period would they then be confined to the boundaries of their precise claim 
we think not,for such a rule would clearly be inconsistent with the limited role rule c assigns to the initial pleading.under rule c liberal standard,a plaintiff need only plead the general conduct,transaction,or occurrence to preserve its claims against a defendant.the exact contours of those claims the facts that will ultimately be alleged and the final scope of relief that will be sought can and should be sorted out through later discovery and amendments to the pleadings.see wright et,supra,initial pleadings no longer carry the burden of fact revelation and issue formulation,which now is discharged by the discovery process.we see no reason to disturb the limited role assigned to initial pleadings under rule where a party in good faith initially disclaims certain facts or relief.parties should not be discouraged from limiting their initial pleadings to claims and defenses that have evidentiary support.nor should they fear that doing so will foreclose them from amending their pleadings if new facts come to light after further investigation and discovery.
of course,union pacific is correct that notice is an essential element in the relation back determination.but rule does not require that a pleading give notice of the exact scope of relief sought.rather,it must give fair notice of the transaction,occurrence,or conduct called into question.martell,at.so long as a party is notified of litigation concerning a particular transaction or occurrence,that party has been given all the notice that rule c requires.when a defendant is so notified,the defendant knows that the whole transaction described in it will be fully sifted,by amendment if need be,and that the form of the action or the relief prayed or the law relied on will not be confined to their first statement.id.at quoting barthel stamm,cir.
accordingly,we hold that even where an amendment trenches on factual ground that the original pleading said would be off limits,the standard is the same.in such cases,the standard to be applied is rule c liberal conduct,transaction,or occurrence test.
applying the rule c b standard here,we agree with the district court that asarco fac relates back to the date of its original complaint.the key change in asarco fac was its inclusion of a geographical area within the coeur basin the drainage of the north fork of the coeur river that was explicitly excluded in its original complaint.asarco original complaint asserted that 
f or purposes of this action,the coeur basin refers to the watershed of the south fork of the coeur river,the main stem of the coeur river and its floodplain,including the lateral lakes and associated wetlands,and lake coeur,but excludes the drainage of the north fork of the coeur river.emphasis added.
less than two months later,asarco filed its fac,which redefined the coeur basin to encompass the the watersheds of the north fork and the south fork of the coeur river,the main stem of the coeur river and its floodplain,including the lateral lakes and associated wetlands,and lake coeur.emphasis added.
notwithstanding that change,we conclude that asarco original complaint clearly put union pacific on notice of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set forth in the fac.both pleadings concern asarco and union pacific historical activities at the coeur site a square mile area located in northern idaho and eastern washington.both pleadings seek contribution based on the same consent decree,which resolved asarco liability for cercla response costs in the entire coeur basin.and,in order to determine the scope of union pacific contribution protection,both pleadings would inevitably requir
