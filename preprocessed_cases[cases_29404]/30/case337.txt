plaintiff paving,tcp claims that ashe county,north carolina and the ashe county board of commissioners collectively the county violated its due process and equal protection rights by not issuing a building permit for tcp proposed asphalt plant,by enacting a moratorium on the building of asphalt plants,and by subsequently enacting a polluting industries development ordinance.tcp seeks damages and injunctive relief pursuant to and the north carolina constitution.the district court granted summary judgment for the county.because tcp was not deprived of a property interest without due process of law,and because the county actions were rationally related to a legitimate state interest,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in the,paving began to consider constructing an asphalt plant on its property in an unincorporated portion of ashe county,north carolina.some time prior to august and again in august,tcp principal shareholders,leonard and lucian jordan,informally discussed their plans to construct the plant with george yates,chairman of the ashe county board of commissioners.in august,tcp purchased a used asphalt plant and moved the disassembled plant to its property.leonard jordan also informed the county planner that tcp was applying to the north carolina department of environment and natural resources ncdenr for an air quality permit to operate the plant and requested a consistency determination.on august,the county planner wrote that tcp proposed site did not violate any existing county ordinances.
however,tcp plans to construct and operate an asphalt plant soon met with community resistance.at the october,commissioners meeting,chairman yates voiced concerns over tcp proposed plant and urged the citizens of the town of west jefferson to exercise territorial jurisdiction rights to stop the project.the news of tcp plans quickly spread through the small,rural county.two citizen advocacy groups,the ashe county citizens against pollution and the blue ridge environmental defense league,requested that a discussion of tcp proposed plant be included on the agenda of the october commissioners meeting.
meanwhile,on october,leonard jordan requested a building permit for the asphalt plant from the county inspector office.she was told that tcp had to submit a set of signed and sealed blueprints before the county could issue a building permit the following day,tcp returned to the office to again seek a permit.taking the evidence in the light most favorable to tcp,the jordans submitted a set of properly signed and sealed blueprints.it is undisputed however that robert reed,the director of building inspections,never issued a building permit to tcp for the plant.
furthermore,tcp application for a building permit remained deficient in several respects.tcp did not submit a written application for a building permit,even though the north carolina building code and ashe county ordinances expressly require a written application before a building permit can be issued further,it is undisputed that tcp did not have a wastewater permit and that,under north carolina law,a wastewater permit is required before a building permit can be issued tcp did not obtain a wastewater permit until october,a year after tcp applied for a building permit.it is also undisputed that tcp initial application to the ncdenr for an air permit was incomplete and that the ncdenr did not issue an air permit until may,seven months after tcp applied for a building permit.under north carolina law,tcp could not have commenced construction of its asphalt plant without an air permit in fact,on november,the ncdenr called tcp engineer to inform him that if tcp commenced construction of the plant without an air permit,tcp would be in violation of state law.robert reed also stated under oath that he would have issued a building permit without an air quality control permit.
following their failed attempt to obtain a building permit,leonard and lucian jordan attended the october,commissioners meeting,where a spirited public debate ensued regarding tcp proposed asphalt plant.it is clear that the jordans had notice that tcp plant would be discussed at the meeting and that the jordans spoke on behalf of the project during the meeting.the commissioners ultimately passed,by a vote of,an ordinance placing a moratorium on the construction of asphalt plants in unincorporated portions of ashe county.because the first vote on the moratorium was not unanimous,a second reading was required and the moratorium was scheduled to be taken up at the next commissioners meeting on november.the jordans had notice that tcp asphalt plant would be discussed at the november meeting by virtue of their attendance at the first meeting.and leonard jordan actually attended the second meeting,where the moratorium again passed by a vote of.the moratorium included a provision allowing a party to appeal to the commissioners for a variance in cases of severe hardship.however,tcp did not apply for or receive a variance under the moratorium.
near the end of the moratorium period,the commissioners passed the ashe county polluting industries development ordinance pido,which required a polluting industry to obtain a special use permit from the county planning department,and prohibited the location of a polluting industry within feet of a residence or within feet of any school,daycare,hospital or nursing home.see ashe county ordinance.because it does not have a comprehensive zoning ordinance,the county enacted both the moratorium and the pido pursuant to its general police power under,which allows a county to pass ordinances to protect the health,safety,or welfare of its citizens.like the moratorium,the pido contained a variance process and authorized the county planning board to issue a variance if strict adherence to the pido would cause an unnecessary hardship.ashe county ordinance.tcp did not receive a variance or permit to construct its asphalt plant after the enactment of the pido.
in july,tcp initiated this action,alleging that the county violated its due process and equal protection rights by denying it a building permit and by passing the moratorium and the pido.tcp also alleged that the pido was unconstitutionally vague tcp sought relief pursuant to and the north carolina constitution the district court granted summary judgment to the county with respect to all of tcp claims.the court held that tcp procedural due process claim failed because tcp did not have a vested property right to construct or operate an asphalt plant.the court concluded that tcp substantive due process claim also failed because tcp lacked a valid property interest and because the county actions were not beyond the broad limits of legitimate governmental action.the district court similarly rejected tcp equal protection claim,finding that the county actions were rationally related to a legitimate governmental end.finally,the district court rejected tcp vagueness claim,finding that the terms in the pido were reasonably determinable by people of common intelligence.tcp appeals.
we begin by considering tcp procedural due process claim.in order to state a valid procedural due process claim,tcp must demonstrate that it had a property interest of which the county deprived it without due process of law.sylvia dev.calvert county,cir.it is that the fourteenth amendment itself does not create property interests.rather,they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.bd.of regents roth,d.further,to have a property interest in a benefit,a person must have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.id.a mere abstract need or desire for it or a unilateral expectation of it is insufficient.id.
due process of law generally requires that a deprivation of property be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.mullane cent.hanover bank trust.see also cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d.however,to determine whether a procedural due process violation has occurred,courts must consult the entire panoply of predeprivation and postdeprivation process provided by the state.fields durham,cir citing zinermon burch,d.the procedures due in zoning cases,and by analogy due in cases such as this one involving regulation of land use through general police powers,are not extensive.for example,the supreme court held in city of eastlake forest city enterprises,d,that a local government could,consistent with the due process clause,make zoning decisions through the political process in a referendum with no hearings of any kind.see id.at.see also river park,city of highland park,cir discussing eastlake and concluding that the procedures due in zoning cases are minimal.
we will assume without deciding that tcp had a property interest in obtaining a building permit to construct an asphalt plant and that the county deprived tcp of this property interest.however,the county did not deprive tcp of its property interest without due process of law.summary judgment was therefore appropriate on tcp procedural due process claim.tcp was provided with more than constitutionally adequate postdeprivation process in this case.tcp failed to take advantage of much of it.and when tcp did take advantage of the available process,the outcome was not what it had hoped for.but procedural due process does not require certain requires only fair and adequate procedural protections.
the county provided tcp with an abundance of predeprivation process.first,there is no evidence that tcp was denied the opportunity to submit the documentation necessary to qualify for a building permit.tcp was allowed full access to the county building inspector office on numerous occasions and the jordans often spoke directly with robert reed,the director of building inspections,regarding tcp permit application.lucian jordan stated in deposition testimony that he and leonard jordan applied for a permit several times in october and november and many times after that and would just drop in at reed office and tell them we needed a building permit.leonard jordan similarly testified that he and lucian asked for a building permit on many occasions.however,tcp never submitted a complete lacked a written application,a wastewater permit,and an air quality permit.the county was under no obligation to issue a building permit without the required documentation and permits.indeed,if the county had issued a building permit it would have violated north carolina statutes,the north carolina building code,and an ashe county ordinance.see written application requirement ashe county ordinance same.wastewater permit requirement.air quality permit requirement.
the county also provided tcp with adequate process before the moratorium and the pido were enacted by giving tcp both notice and an opportunity to be heard.the jordans were given notice that tcp asphalt plant would be discussed at the commissioners meeting on october.lucian jordan testified that the county manager informed him and leonard that there was a group that was going to speak at the commissioners meeting in opposition to the plant.the commissioners meeting was open to the public and the jordans attended.at the meeting,members of citizen advocacy groups spoke against the asphalt plant,while the jordans spoke on behalf of it.the jordans explained that they had spoken to chairman yates several months ago and told him of their intentions to build a plant,that they had received a consistency determination from the county planner,and that they ha d been working with the county planner and the ncdenr to apply for permits.the commissioners listened to both sides of the debate before passing the moratorium.
during the october meeting,the jordans were given notice that the plant and the moratorium would again be discussed at the november,commissioners meeting.leonard jordan testified that he attended this second meeting and that he also attended the commissioners meeting on november,when the pido was discussed and passed.tcp was given the opportunity to comment at these public meetings.tcp simply lost the political battle in the county.if,as eastlake teaches,a community can make decisions through a popular referendum with no hearings of any kind and still satisfy the mandates of due process,certainly conducting open community meetings and giving affected parties the opportunity to speak on behalf of their project is constitutionally sufficient.
however,predeprivation process was not the only avenue open to tcp.postdeprivation process was likewise available.and a due process violation actionable under is not complete when the deprivation occurs it is not complete unless and until the state fails to provide due process.fields,at quoting zinermon,at.
there were numerous postdeprivation remedies available to tcp to rectify what it believed to be a wrongful denial of its right to build an asphalt plant.tcp failed to take advantage of them.first,tcp could have applied to the commissioners for a variance under the moratorium,or could have applied to the county planning board for a variance under the pido.the moratorium contained a provision allowing parties to apply to the commissioners for a variance in situations where a severe hardship may arise,and mandated that the commissioners hold a public hearing on the subject before making a decision on any variance request.the pido contained a similar provision allowing parties to apply to the planning board for a variance w here strict adherence to the provisions of the pido would cause an unnecessary hardship.ashe county ordinance.yet tcp did not apply for a variance under the moratorium and has never properly applied for one under the pido 
additionally,tcp had remedies available to it in the state courts but chose not to utilize them.for example,tcp could have petitioned a state court for a writ of mandamus to compel the county to issue a building permit if it was unlawfully withheld.north carolina courts have stated that mandamus is the proper procedure to compel local officials to issue a building permit when a party shows that it has met all of the permit requirements.see,lee walker,clinard city of,buckland town of haw river,tcp also could have filed an inverse condemnation suit in state court.see,robertson city of high point,smith city of charlotte.tcp chose not to pursue any of these avenues of relief in the state courts.it therefore can not complain now that the state did not provide adequate procedures.
we next turn to tcp claim that the county violated its equal protection rights.the supreme court has made clear that when no fundamental right or suspect classification is at issue,the equal protection clause allows a legislative body wide latitude in drawing classifications.social or economic legislation will be sustained if the classification drawn is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.city of cleburne cleburne living,d citing city of new orleans dukes,d.tcp does not allege that the county has burdened a fundamental right or employed a suspect classification.therefore,we apply the most deferential standard of review to the county actions under the equal protection clause.see,sylvia,at int l sci.tech,inacom communications,cir.
the district court properly granted summary judgment with respect to tcp equal protection claim.first,as the district court noted,we need look only to the text of the moratorium and the pido to uncover the county legitimate governmental purpose.the moratorium stated that its purpose was to protect the public health,safety,general welfare,and property values of citizens of ashe county from potential adverse health effects caused by asphalt facilities.the pido stated a similar purpose with respect to all polluting industries and went on to make clear that it was intended to allow for the placement and growth of polluting industrial activities,while maintaining the health,safety and general welfare standards of established residential and commercial areas in ashe county.ashe county ordinance.further,there is no evidence that the county objectives were any less legitimate when it denied tcp building permit.promoting the health,safety,and of the county citizens are basic governmental functions.and this court will not substitute its p
