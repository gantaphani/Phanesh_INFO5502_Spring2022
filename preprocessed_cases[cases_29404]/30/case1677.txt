background 
the forest practice act 
timberland use in california is governed in significant part by the nejedly forest practice act of et hereafter forest practice act and the forest practice rules promulgated by the state board of forestry,tit,et the purpose of the forest practice act is to regulate the use of timberlands to ensure their productivity while also giving consideration to values relating to sequestration of carbon dioxide,recreation,watershed,wildlife,range and forage,fisheries,regional economic vitality,employment,and aesthetic enjoyment.see also,subd.c.these purposes are accomplished in part by management of nonindustrial timberlands.
an ntmp,as provided in the forest practice act,is a plan for sustained yield timber production which may be utilized by owners of less than acres of timberland who are not primarily engaged in the manufacture of forest products.the plan must be prepared by a registered professional forester forester fp rules,rule.cal fire is the public agency initially charged with the duty of determining whether or not a proposed timber harvesting plan incorporates feasible silvicultural systems,operating methods,and procedures to substantially lessen significant adverse impacts on the environment.fp rules,rule c.sierra club state bd.of forestry cal th,sierra club.cal fire serves as the lead agency in conduct of environmental reviews for such projects.fp rules,rule c.the forest practice rules require cal fire to establish interdisciplinary review teams to review plans and assist it in the evaluation of proposed timber operations and their impacts on the environment,rule a dfw representative is to be included when possible,rule a.dfw and other members of the review team serve in an advisory capacity and assist the director in determining if plans conform to the forest practice act and forest practice rules,rule b.

the bower ntmp and unit parcel 
on october,real parties in interest john and margaret bower,bower limited partnership,and north gualala water company collectively bower submitted a proposed ntmp to cal fire,seeking authorization for timber harvesting activities in an area of approximately acres located adjacent to and to the north and northeast of the town of gualala.the plan was divided into harvest units,across four cal fire planning watersheds roseman creek,big pepperwood creek,doty creek,and robinson creek forest stands in the ntmp units generally range from young trees to second and third growth redwood and douglas fir forests,with scattered late seral residual components.
at issue here is cal fire approval of and dfw nonobjection to logging activity on an approximately acre section of unit,located in the doty creek watershed unit covers approximately acres in total,composed primarily of second growth redwood and douglas fir.the portion of unit that is the focus of this litigation was identified by dfw as a stand embedded in unit that meets the structural definition of late succession forest stands as defined in the forest practice rules,rule.we refer to this stand,as have the parties,as the lsfs.
the marbled murrelet 
it appears largely undisputed that the lsfs in its present condition is potentially a functional nesting habitat for the marbled murrelet,a small seabird which is federally listed as a threatened species and classified under cesa as an endangered species.the murrelet is found off california coastal waters from del norte to santa cruz counties in marine and pelagic habitats and nests in coastal coniferous forests,and requires dense old growth or mature forests of redwood and and l arge diameter,moss covered or mistletoe branches that create a broad flat surface referred to as a platform for nesting and breeding.it also appears undisputed that murrelets have no known history of actually nesting in the lsfs.as discussed post,the parties take very different views as to the ntmp impact on the functionality of the murrelet habitat and on murrelet populations generally.
procedural history 
the bower ntmp was resubmitted to cal fire in late october cal fire,dfw and other agency personnel attended a preharvest inspection of bower property in december.during that inspection,a dfw biologist characterized certain areas in unit as emerging late seral forest and suggested that the area might need to be evaluated for murrelet habitat.a preharvest inspection report,discussing unit and murrelet habitat,was filed by cal fire on december.dfw recommended a murrelet consultation and requested that the perimeter of the late seral area in unit be walked and estimated.bower forester subsequently inventoried and photographed all large trees in the area.a second preharvest inspection was conducted by cal fire,dfw,bower and bower forester in february,focusing on the large tree area.the inspection and consultation included an assessment of several residual old growth redwood trees and one residual old growth and assessment of murrelet habitat.dfw submitted its preharvest inspection and murrelet consultation reports in june.the consultation report opined that suitable murrelet habitat existed within the lsfs and proposed specific mitigation measures to avoid take of murrelets pending completion of protocol surveys within the lsfs 
bower forester submitted a response to the dfw murrelet consultation report on august,identifying and mapping a total of trees meeting the dfw definition and description of late seral habitat,ranging from to inches dbh a majority of the trees are located within a acre core area of the lsfs.bower forester characterized only seven as late seral and asserted that the lsfs had only marginal potential for marbled murrelet occupation,given the parcel small size and close proximity to a local airport and a residential area.dfw recommended retention of large diameter trees inch dbh identified in and around the lsfs.a revised ntmp submitted in november,required retention of out of the large diameter trees to provide structural characteristics beneficial to wildlife,with seven of these being adjacent to,but outside the boundaries of the lsfs 
on december,the cal fire review team chair recommended approval of the revised ntmp,subject to compliance with additional mitigation measures which were incorporated into the ntmp.these measures included replacement of fallen or dead wildlife trees,in a two for one ratio,with other trees selected for their wildlife value prohibition of all group selection harvesting within the lsfs and within a foot buffer zone around the lsfs retention of two additional trees per acre with minimum of inches dbh throughout unit and imposition of a harvest moratorium within lsfs area,to allow dfw to attempt acquisition of a conservation easement on the lsfs.
after close of the public comment period cal fire issued its official response to public comments and approved the ntmp on december,concluding that large wildlife trees were being preserved,and species largely dependent on late seral habitat features would not be adversely impacted.dfw did not submit a nonconcurrence.see fp rules,rule e i f a member of the review team does not concur with the chairperson recommendation to the director,the member shall submit in writing,within days of the review team meeting and before the action required by rule,the specific reasons why the recommendation does not provide adequate protection of the resources for which his or her agency has responsibility.
the litigation 
on february,petitioners filed their verified petition for writ of mandate,complaint for declaratory relief for breach of public trust,and request for injunctive relief petition.the petition sought orders requiring cal fire to set aside approval of the ntmp,a declaration that dfw was in violation of its statutory and public trust obligations,and an injunction prohibiting timber harvesting pursuant to the ntmp.the matter was tried to the court on may,the court issued a statement of decision on may,denying the petition in its entirety a notice of appeal was filed on june.judgment was entered on june.on july,we granted petitioners request for a writ of supersedeas to stay logging activities within the lsfs pending resolution of this appeal.
ii.discussion 
petitioners contend that cal fire,in approving the ntmp,failed to comply with the requirements of ceqa and the forest practice rules.they insist that cumulative impacts of proposed logging in the ntmp will eliminate over percent of the large trees in the lsfs,significantly reducing the overhead canopy,and rendering the stand unsuitable for murrelet nesting.they argue that approval of the ntmp also violates cesa by authorizing logging that would adversely modify late seral nesting habitat essential for survival and recovery of the murrelet.finally,they contend that dfw violated its public trust obligations by failing to oppose the ntmp.

standard of review 
cal fire approval of timber operations is subject to ceqa standard of judicial review,sierra club,supra,cal th at pp.in reviewing an agency compliance with ceqa in the course of its legislative or actions,the courts inquiry shall extend only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.citation.such an abuse is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.citations.vineyard area citizens for responsible growth,city of rancho cordova cal th,fns.omitted vineyard.judicial review of these two types of error differs significantly while we determine de novo whether the agency has employed the correct procedures,scrupulously enforc ing all legislatively mandated ceqa requirements citation,we accord greater deference to the agency substantive factual conclusions.ebbetts pass forest watch california of forestry fire protection,supra,cal th at.

sufficiency of the ntmp 
petitioners present several challenges to the sufficiency of the ntmp as an informational document.petitioners first contend that the ntmp failed to adequately assess cumulative impacts of logging in the lsfs,and that approval of the plan under such circumstances resulted in cal fire failure to proceed in the manner required by law.failure of the environmental review process to provide adequate information and analysis constitutes a failure to proceed according to law and is an abuse of discretion under code of civil procedure section.joy road area forest watershed california of forestry fire protection th.
petitioners assert that the ntmp contains no analysis of how the lsfs will be retained as functional habitat.in petitioners view,the cumulative effects of proposed logging activities will eliminate the last remnant late seral forest in the entire acre doty creek watershed,and that the resulting loss of this stand would mean that late seral wildlife,such as the murrelet,could not survive or reproduce in the watershed.petitioners insist that the resulting forest,although retaining some large trees,will not provide functional nesting habitat because it will no longer contain overstory canopy and dense surrounding forest the forest structure that allows large nesting trees to function as habitat.they fault the ntmp for providing an inadequate description of the environmental setting,murrelet presence within the assessment area,and importance of the lsfs to murrelet survival and recovery.petitioners contend that these errors in assessment of cumulative impacts are informational in nature in that they fail to provide adequate information to ensure a meaningful evaluation of potentially significant impacts of logging the lsfs.we disagree.
the forest practice rules adopt the ceqa definition of cumulative impacts from related projects the change in the environment which results from the incremental impact of the project when added to other closely related past,present,and reasonably foreseeable probable future projects.cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time,tit,subd.b fp rules,rule.cumulative impacts must be considered in timber harvest plans and are assessed based upon the methodology described in board of forestry technical rule addendum no.fp rules,foll.rule.fp rules,rule see ebbetts pass forest watch california of forestry fire protection,supra,cal th at.
all elements required under technical rule addendum,including biological resources and habitat,are analyzed and considered in section iv of the ntmp.in evaluating cumulative impacts,the ntmp utilizes a biological assessment area baa encompassing approximately acres within a mile radius of the plan area.the ntmp discloses that the plan area is within the known range of the murrelet,and identified the murrelet as a threatened species known or suspected to be in the assessment area.it identified the murrelet habitat requirements,and two preharvest inspection reports identified functional murrelet habitat in the lsfs.the ntmp specifically identifies trees with habitat elements suitable for the murrelet.the dfw murrelet consultation report,with its recommendations,is also part of the administrative record.
murrelet presence 
petitioners accuse bower of falsely denying in the ntmp murrelet sightings within the baa,which extends offshore approximately one mile.in a record comment submitted to cal fire,friends of the gualala river cited undisclosed surveys compiled by bower forester noting two positive marine sightings of murrelets within the baa.they argue that this information made misleading the ntmp disclosure of murrelet detection in an area miles southeast of the plan area.the compilation,however,covered a year period from to,with the latest positive marine detection in.cal fire confirmed that no murrelet detections had been associated with terrestrial portions of the baa,and no more recent positive detections of any nature proximate to the baa.cal fire considered the comment and found that the information did not change the conclusions arrived at in the ntmp,finding no evidence establishing a connection between marine detections and local nesting sites.
continuity of habitat 
petitioners heavily rely on a united states fish and wildlife service report the murrelet recovery plan in support of its assertion that the lsfs is critical to avoiding gaps in population distribution of murrelets in the coastal forests of mendocino county.the murrelet recovery plan places mendocino county in conservation zone,which is identified as a significant gap in murrelet population distribution.the murrelet recovery plan notes that t he more contiguous the habitat distribution,the lower the likelihood of future large gaps in distribution of the species due to catastrophic events such as oil spills or large wildfires.preventing further erosion of the already nesting habitat is a key element in buffering the species against such catastrophic events.this is especially important in areas where gaps already occur.petitioners insist that the ntmp is deficient in failing to disclose or acknowledge the importance to murrelet survival of maintaining all remnant late seral habitat,particularly in light of existing murrelet habitat shortage.
the ntmp concluded,however,that based on actual site inspections n o continuity of late seral habitat exists within the baa.the scattered and infrequent distribution of individual late seral trees does not provide continuity of this habitat type.cal fire official response found no adjacent or nearby similar habitats and agreed that there was no existing continuity of habitat within the plan area,and likely none within the baa,as a result of years of timber production.cal fire concluded that the logging activities proposed under the ntmp will not cause fragmentation or loss of interconnectivity of suitable marbled murrelet nesting habitat available to local nesting murrelet populations within conservation zone the habitat gap between zones of the federal murrelet recovery plan.
impacts of logging on late seral habitat functionality 
petitioners contend that the ntmp fails to acknowledge that proposed logging activity will effectively eliminate late seral habitat within the lsfs by substantially reducing forest density,opening up the existing forest canopy and removing buffer forest around potential murrelet nest sites.the parties again draw dramatically differing conclusions from the same record.
the dfw,in its june preharvest inspection report,found the lsfs to be a stand,with large dominant trees over smaller understory trees.dfw estimated the overstory layer as a size class and the understory layer as at least a size class in petitioners view,logging will reduce the number of large trees inch diameter from per acre,to or larger trees inch diameter per acre and two additional trees over inches in diameter.by petitioners calculations,the ntmp will reduce the overall number of large trees in the lsfs inch diameter by approximately percent and entirely eliminate class habitat in the stand.
bower acknowledges that there will be removal of certain overstory trees within the lsfs,but notes that of large diameter trees percent,selected in consultation with dfw,will be retained and continue to contribute to the overstory.these retained trees will provide stocking control,uneven aged diameter distribution,wlpz canopy protection,shade and temperature control,and biological diversity for wildlife habitat.two replacement trees must be recruited for any large diameter tree scheduled for retention that falls or becomes a snag,and must be selected from the upper percent of tree diameters in or within feet of a wlpz.beyond the initial inventoried trees to be harvested,the lsfs basal area of conifers and hardwoods may not be reduced below square feet,with trees of inch dbh or greater constituting not less than percent of the lsfs basal area,and not less than percent of the basal area of trees over inch dbh must be in trees inch dbh or greater.harvesting activities must leave at least of the total canopy covering the ground in a well distributed stand configuration.the ntmp concludes that multistoried characteristics which exist on the plan area within the wlpz will be represented in the stand.
maintenance of functional late seral nesting habitat 
petitioners argue that the ntmp contains no discussion or analysis about how an adequate amount of large trees,canopy or stand structure around potential nest trees will be retained to ensure preservation of functional nesting habitat for murrelets.
petitioners ignore the fact that the ntmp requires permanent retention of trees specifically identified within the lsfs as presenting nesting elements suitable for the murrelet.in addition to multistory canopy elements discussed ante,the ntmp further requires compliance with specific dfw recommendations to retain and buffer suitable nesting habitat until completion of protocol murrelet surveys,including no logging activity within a foot zone around suitable nesting habitat.only if dfw determines that proposed logging activity will not adversely affect the murrelet,will a logging moratorium in this area be lifted,and only for a period of three years,following which protocol surveys must again be conducted if logging is proposed within feet of the lsfs 
retention of only elements of late seral forest 
petitioners assert that the ntmp proposes only to retain elements of late seral forest,rather than a functional late seral habitat.they contend that the ntmp is not designed to maintain the mature forest density and canopies necessary for the stand to function as late seral nesting habitat,and that following logging activities,the remaining forest will not look or function like late seral habitat,but rather as young,second and third growth forest with a smattering of old forest elements.they contrast what they argue are higher resulting basal areas and number of large trees in other ntmp units that are not considered late seral,with those that they calculate will result in the lsfs.respondents challenge the accuracy of petitioners calculations,and the assumptions upon which those calculations are based.more significantly,however,the calculations and comparisons petitioners attempt to make,even if accurate,do not appear to offer a complete description of the resulting environment.the record does not indicate that late seral habitat is defined by basal areas or tree size or species alone.the definition of a late succession forest stands in the forest practice rules includes not only tree size and canopy,but also notes that f unctional characteristics of late succession forests include large decadent trees,snags,and large down logs.fp rules,rule.the forest practice rule definition of functional nesting habitat likewise includes not only canopy parameters,but includes trees including hardwoods of mixed sizes.all nests,snags,down logs,and decadent trees shall also be considered as part of the habitat.ibid.dfw criticized the focus of the forest practice rule definition of late succession forest stands on tree size and tree density and its own more ecological late seral forest habitat definition focused on broader structural complexity elements of such a habitat and multiple environmental factors that affect the ecological function of the stand.the concerns voiced by dfw,and addressed in the revised ntmp,were identification and preservation of specifically identified late seral components in the lsfs,which petitioners elsewhere repeatedly insist are unique within the ntmp.petitioners claim that there is no basis for assuming the acre stand will be any different from the other units in the ntmp which are considered nonfunctional for late seral wildlife thus lacks support.
feasibility of alternatives 
petitioners fault the ntmp and cal fire for failure to address feasibility of alternatives that might avoid significant impacts of logging.specifically,it criticizes the absence of a analysis in the record why regulation to prevent logging in the lsfs would render the overall ntmp an economically infeasible proposition.
the ntmp analysis of project alternatives included consideration,and rejection of,a alternative,a reduced project size,public purchase of the lsfs,or sale of a conservation easement on that parcel the official response also dealt with comments that the ntmp did not adequately consider alternatives.cal fire concluded that because mitigation measures included in the plan would avoid significant impacts and address the environmental concerns expressed by the review team agencies,there were few reasonable alternatives that would actually lessen impacts below the level produced by the revised ntmp,and that it is not demonstrated that simply no harvesting in unit would reduce impacts.an eir need not consider every conceivable alternative to a project.citation.moreover,alternatives shall be limited to ones that would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project.citations.north coast rivers alliance marin municipal water dist.bd.of directors th,italics omitted.
substantial evidence 
while petitioners seek to frame the issues as failure to provide adequate information and analysis,the real question presented is whether cal fire conclusions are supported by substantial evidence.we find that they are.
petitioners challenges to the ntmp adequacy ultimately arise from fundamental disagreement with the conclusions reached by cal fire in its approval of the plan.petitioners envision intensive logging within and around the lsfs resulting from the ntmp,with a consequent total and catastrophic loss of viable murrelet habitat.cal fire concludes that,with appropriate mitigation measures,the selective and limited timber harvesting permitted in and around the lsfs will have no significant impact on an existing marginal but viable habitat,which will be preserved without significant adverse impact on wildlife,including the murrelet.m ere disagreement is insufficient.citations.north coast rivers alliance marin municipal water dist.bd.of directors,supra,th at.the burden is on petitioners to affirmatively show there was no substantial evidence in the record to support cal fire findings.california native plant society city of rancho cordova th.
cal fire views were based on silvicultural analysis by bower forester and its own experts,its participation in at least two site inspections of the lsfs,consideration of dfw recommendations and its murrelet consultation,and public participation and comment.a public agency may choose between differing expert opinions,and may also properly rely upon the opinion of its staff in reaching decisions.oakland heritage alliance city of oakland th.we have neither the authority nor the expertise to resolve the conflicting views of petitioners and cal fire and to determine whose view of the future of the lsfs and the murrelet is more prescient.see laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d,north coast rivers alliance marin municipal water dist.bd.of directors,supra,th at.we are limited to a determination of whether substantial evidence supports cal fire determination.it does.
failure to recirculate the ntmp 
petitioners contend that significant new information was added to the ntmp prior to certification,requiring recirculation for public review.see fp rules,rule d.petitioners cite a december,memo from cal fire wildlife biologist,robert motroni,commenting on bower november,revised ntmp proposal for retention of large trees within the lsfs.motroni recommended four additional protective measures,including retention of all trees with basal fire scars and hollows,and retention of trees immediately adjacent to the retained tree of interest to create a management zone approximately feet in diameter,dependent on site specific conditions,to maintain wind firmness.the internal memo was not circulated for public review.the issues motroni raised were,however,presented and discussed in a second review by the cal fire interdisciplinary review team on december.each of motroni recommendations were addressed in additional mitigation measures,including creation of a foot buffer area adjacent to the boundary of the lsfs,from which group harvest was excluded,and requiring a minimum postharvest conifer basal area of square feet.bower accepted these additional measures,as well as others,on december.petitioners argue that,by failing to circulate motroni comments,the public was deprived of the right to address whether these mitigation measures were adequate.
a final eir will almost always contain information not included in the circulating draft.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal th.recirculation based on the addition of new information after the close of the public comment period is not required unless that information is significant.id.at.the information is not considered significant unless the document is changed in a way that deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon a substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an effect including a feasible project alternative that the project proponents have declined to implement.citation.ibid.r ecirculation is not required where the new information added to the eir merely clarifies or amplifies citations or makes insignificant modifications in citation an adequate eir.citation.on the other hand,recirculation is required,for example,when the new information added to an eir discloses a new substantial environmental impact resulting from the project or from a new mitigation measure proposed to be implemented citation a substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact unless mitigation measures are adopted that reduce the impact to a level of insignificance citation a feasible project alternative or mitigation measure that clearly would lessen the environmental impacts of the project,but which the project proponents decline to adopt citation or that the draft eir was so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature that public comment on the draft was in effect meaningless citation.id.at pp,fn.omitted.recirculation is an exception,rather than the general rule.id.at.an agency decision not to recirculate a draft eir is entitled to substantial deference the petitioner bears the burden of proof to show no substantial evidence supports the agency decision.citations.north coast rivers alliance marin municipal water dist.bd.of directors,supra,th at.w e resolve reasonable doubts regarding the agency decision in favor of upholding the administrative decision.citation.california oak foundation regents of university of california th.
here,the motroni memo disclosed no new environmental impacts nor any substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact.motroni,during the comment period,suggested strengthening of certain mitigation measures already proposed by dfw for protection of habitat within the lsfs.the protection of habitat for the murrelet and other species within the lsfs had been a principal focus of environmental review for the ntmp since at least the first dfw preharvest inspection report in june.the time for public comment had been extended from november to december,to allow consideration,among other things,of a dditional information pertaining to retention of trees with structural features,and the maintenance of functional wildlife habitat within the lsfs.the public was not deprived of a meaningful opportunity to comment on these matters.in fact,members of the public,including petitioner friends of the gualala river,participated in the second review in which the additional recommendations and alternatives were discussed.finally,bower did not decline to adopt the additional measures cal fire required,but accepted these measures on december,eight days prior to the close of the public comment period.substantial evidence supports cal fire decision not to recirculate the ntmp.
petitioners contend that,in approving the ntmp,cal fire violated the mandate of cesa to conserve endangered species such as the murrelet.fish.petitioners argue that even unoccupied nesting habitat is critical to the viability of murrelets in the region.they assert that the record demonstrates that preserving remnant stands of late seral habitat,especially in the zone region,will be necessary to maintain the ability of murrelets to persist into the future and that logging in the lsfs will contribute to the catastrophic,incremental loss of habitat essential to the long term conservation of the murrelet.cal fire addressed this contention in the official response,finding that,with the mitigation measures imposed,the ntmp would not cause significant impacts to any threatened or endangered species.as discussed ante,we have already found this conclusion to be supported by substantial evidence.moreover,the mitigation conditions imposed in and adjacent to the lsfs require adherence to specific dfw recommendations to retain and buffer suitable nesting habitat until completion of protocol murrelet surveys,including no logging activity within a foot zone around suitable nesting habitat.dfw must determine that proposed logging activity will not adversely affect the murrelet before logging activity is permitted cal fire found that implementation of the plan,as mitigated,would not result in take,jeopardy or adverse modification of habitat in violation of cesa.that finding is supported by substantial evidence.
petitioners claim against dfw 
petitioners presented a separate claim against dfw,seeking ordinary mandamus code civ,and declaratory relief,alleging that dfw failed to fulfill its public trust and statutory obligations by failing to submit a nonconcurrence in the ntmp the petition as to dfw seeks a writ setting aside approval of the ntmp based on dfw violations of,and failure to fulfill,its public trust and statutory obligations they allege that the public has a right to a judicial determination of whether dfw actions in failing to submit a nonconcurrence to the ntmp violated its common law and statutory duties to protect and conserve wildlife resources,and were consequently arbitrary and capricious,citing center for biological diversity,fpl group,th center for biological diversity the trial court found that the petition did not state a cause of action against dfw.we agree and find no authority for petitioners position that they may compel,through traditional mandamus,an administrative agency with only advisory authority to provide that advice in a particular manner.
