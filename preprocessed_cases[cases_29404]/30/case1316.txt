introduction 
appellants are gale norton,secretary of the interior,the united states fish and wildlife service fws,and fws officials.they appeal the district court decision ordering fws to prepare an environmental impact statement eis and issue a critical habitat designation for the rio grande silvery minnow within days.this court has jurisdiction under and affirms.
ii.background 
this appeal arises from fws efforts to designate part of the middle rio grande as critical habitat for the rio grande silvery minnow.the silvery minnow is a stout silvery fish with emerald reflections reaching lengths of up to inches.forest guardians babbitt,cir.the minnow was once common in several western rivers including the rio grande and the pecos.see final rule to list the rio grande silvery minnow as an endangered species,july,hereinafter silvery minnow listing.due to damming of these rivers and accompanying water diversion,the silvery minnow is confined now to a short stretch of the rio grande representing five percent of its historic range.see forest guardians,at.the minnow was listed as an endangered species in july.see silvery minnow listing.at.
the endangered species act esa requires the secretary of the interior to designate critical habitat of an endangered species concurrently with a determination that the species is endangered.see endangered species act,a a.critical habitat is area inside and outside the geographical range of the species that is essential to the conservation of the species.id.a.pursuant to b c,fws did not designate critical habitat at the time of listing but gave itself until march.see forest guardians,at.even with the extension,fws did not issue a designation until july,a few months after this court ordered it to do so.see id.at final designation of critical habitat for the rio grande silvery minnow.july,hereinafter final designation,as corrected.july,
the designation consisted of miles of the mainstem rio grande in new mexico from cochiti dam in the north to elephant butte reservoir in the south.see final designation.at.this portion of the rio grande is known as the middle rio grande and is divided into four reaches separated by diversion dams cochiti,angostura,isleta,and san acacia.as of,approximately seventy percent of the silvery minnow population lived in the southernmost reach,san acacia due to channelization,accompanying changes to the river speed and temperature,and introduction of nonnative fishes,very few minnows live in the cochiti reach.deprived of water by diversion dams,the isleta reach also supports relatively few minnows.
numerous parties challenged the final designation,arguing,among other things,that the designation did not comply with the national environmental policy act nepa.nepa purpose is to ensure that federal agencies fully consider the environmental ramifications of their actions.see custer county action ass garvey,cir.to this end,nepa requires that a detailed statement on the environmental impact of the proposed action be made before an agency undertakes a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.this detailed statement is labeled an environmental impact statement,or eis.see.before conducting the lengthy and expensive investigation necessary to issue an eis,federal agencies frequently conduct an environmental assessment ea,a preliminary step to determine if the proposed action requires an eis,whether the action is one that may significantly affect the quality of the human environment.see id.b,c.the ea is intended to be a concise summary of the agency analysis of whether the proposed action could result in significant impacts.see id.if the ea results in a finding of possible significant impacts,nepa requires preparation of an eis.see airport neighbors alliance,united states,cir.if the agency instead makes a finding of no significant impacts fonsi,an eis is not required.see.
in this case,fws conducted an ea and concluded that the july critical habitat designation would not result in significant impacts on the human environment.it therefore issued a fonsi and did not conduct an eis.the state of new mexico,the city of socorro,and the middle rio grande conservancy district argued to the district court that the ea failed to consider all the possible impacts of the designation,ignored data,and did not consider alternative designations.
the district court ruled that the fws decision to forego an eis was contrary to this circuit caselaw.it concluded that the circumstances in the tenth circuit which would relieve the secretary of the interior from the duty to prepare an eis when designating critical habitat will be unquestionably rare.catron county board of commissioners united states fish and wildlife service cir.the present case does not at this point present that rare exception.middle rio grande conservancy dist.babbitt,d.the district court ordered fws to conduct an eis and propose a new critical habitat designation within days of the order see id.at.fws proposed a new critical habitat designation on june.see designation of critical habitat for the rio grande silvery minnow.proposed june,to be codified at pt.hereinafter new proposed designation.it has not yet conducted an eis.the government appeals the eis requirement and the district court refusal under rules b and c of the federal rules of civil procedure to modify the injunction to extend the day deadline 
iii.standard of review 
fws has not appealed the district court decision that the was arbitrary and capricious.rather,fws appeals the district court injunction requiring it to conduct an eis without first allowing fws to reconsider whether an eis is necessary.we review such an injunction for an abuse of discretion.see ross fed.highway,cir.
a district court should grant relief from judgment under rule b only when it offends justice to deny such relief.yapp excel,cir quotation omitted.we review the district court decision for abuse of discretion and will reverse the denial of a b motion only if we find a complete absence of a reasonable basis and are certain that the decision is wrong.id.emphasis added,quotation omitted.we similarly review a decision under rule c for abuse of discretion.see.c.
iv.mandating preparation of an eis 
it is that the judiciary role in the nepa context is merely to ensure that the federal agency takes a hard look at the environmental consequences of its actions.see kleppe sierra club,d.the initial decision as to the necessity of an eis is the agency,not a reviewing court.see airport neighbors alliance,at.accordingly,a reviewing court normally remands when it finds an agency decision not to conduct an eis arbitrary or capricious.in rare circumstances,however,a remand is not appropriate.in sierra club hodel,this court observed 
if the record before the agency does not support the agency action,if the agency has not considered all relevant factors,or if the reviewing court simply can not evaluate the challenged agency action on the basis of the record before it,the proper course,except in rare circumstances,is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.
cir emphasis added,quotation omitted,overruled on other grounds,vill.of los ranchos de albuquerque marsh,cir en banc.because fws delayed and inadequate compliance with nepa and the esa have helped to push the silvery minnow perilously close to extinction,and because the record contains overwhelming evidence of the environmental impacts of a critical habitat designation,this case represents one of the rare circumstances when a remand to the agency to conduct yet another ea is not appropriate.
fws compliance with nepa and the esa has been marked by massive delays and inadequate.although the silvery minnow was listed as endangered in,fws did not designate critical habitat until this court ordered it to do so in,four years after the deadline.see forest guardians,at.as this court noted in new mexico cattle growers ass united states fish wildlife service,such delay by fws is not uncommon.see,cir.the critical habitat designation finally issued was denounced in the strongest terms by the district court 
fws has failed to consider important aspects of the problem before them,were predisposed to their conclusions without a thorough examination of the facts or situation presented,in the designation of critical habitat for the silvery minnow have neglected to follow nepa and esa requirements,and have put forward a grossly inadequate explanation of their decision to designate the whole of the middle rio grande as critical habitat the latter has only minimal factual and rational support in the record and fails to accord with what the endangered species act intends or requires.the final rule must therefore be set aside.
middle rio grande conservancy dist.babbitt,d at.fws has not appealed the district court decision setting aside the designation as arbitrary or capricious.fws also failed its mandate under nepa to determine if the designation would significantly affect the human environment.as the district court stated,t he finding of no significant impact contained in the ea does not represent a reasoned judgment.id.at.fws likewise does not contest this conclusion on appeal.
these delays and irrational decisions come at the expense of the silvery minnow,officially endangered for nearly eight years.as fws recognizes,damming,channelization,and the introduction of nonnative predatory fish have decimated the silvery minnow population.the minnow currently occupies only five percent of its historic range.see final designation.at.the species could be exterminated by a single naturally occurring chance event.id.in,when extreme drought conditions reduced the predicted rio grande flow to seventeen percent of normal,thirty percent of the entire population may have been lost.in an emergency measure,a large number of minnows trapped in isolated pools were moved upstream by tanker truck.it is clear that to fulfill the esa goal of halting and reversing the silvery minnow decline,no matter the cost,fws should designate critical habitat as soon as possible.valley auth.hill,d.
furthermore,there is overwhelming evidence that the designation will significantly affect the quality of the human environment,requiring preparation of an eis.the effects of the designation are first,it will require pervasive changes in the distribution of middle rio grande riverwater resulting in the reduction of irrigated agriculture acreage second,it may require the curtailment of river maintenance activities resulting in decreased water transport efficiency and an increased risk of flooding.
the entire designation is rio grande riverbed which contains,or is capable of containing,three p rimary constituent elements.final designation.at.these elements are 
stream morphology that supplies sufficient flowing water to provide food and cover needed to sustain all life stages of the species 
water of sufficient quality to prevent water stagnation elevated temperatures,decreased oxygen,carbon dioxide buildup,and 
water of sufficient quality to prevent formation of isolated pools that restrict fish movement,foster increased predation by birds and aquatic predators,and congregate pathogens 
id.the portion of the rio grande designated as critical habitat is heavily dammed and diverted,and the riverbed is often completely dry.under current water management,isolated pools often form.the ea recognizes this in describing the isleta reach of the middle rio grande m any extensive portions of isleta reach are frequently isolated during summer and autumn months and eventually dry.san acacia reach has more severe desiccation problems because of a lack of facilities returning diverted water back to the main channel.in dry years,the thirty eight mile stretch immediately below san acacia diversion dam may be dry for two months or more.
the federal agencies charged with management of rio grande water are prohibited from taking or authorizing any action which diminishes the value of critical habitat for the survival or recovery of the silvery minnow.see a requiring federal agencies to avoid any actions,or authorize any actions,which destroy or adversely modify critical habitat defining adverse modification to be any action which diminishes the value of critical habitat for the survival or recovery of the species.consequently,federal agencies are prohibited from taking or authorizing any action which deprives critical habitat of its primary constituent elements,those physical and biological features essential to the conservation of the species.see including adverse modification of constituent elements in definition of adverse modification of critical habitat.because extensive reaches of the middle rio grande are dry under current water management practices and do not contain w ater of sufficient quality to prevent formation of isolated pools,the designation will require the federal water managers to reallocate water for the minnow use.the draft economic analysis relied upon by fws in conducting the ea,recognized that a primary effect of the designation would be to reduce the expenditure of federal funds used to make water available for municipal and agricultural uses.the silvery minnow recovery plan recognizes that up to cubic feet per second of water must be released into the san acacia reach to maintain flowing water to provide suitable habitat.one commentator estimated that to provide that amount of water could require an additional of water per year.other commentators to the economic analysis and the ea indicated that the designation may require anywhere from to of additional water per year,depending on weather conditions.
the middle rio grande is fully appropriated.any reallocation of water will be at the expense of water users.the draft economic analysis and comments submitted to fws indicated that a change in water management practices would result in a substantial reduction of irrigated farmland acreage.the estimates range from acres to acres.
a loss of irrigated agriculture is not the only possible effect of the designation.in response to a questionnaire from fws,the united states bureau of reclamation reclamation indicated it might curtail river management practices in response to the designation.reclamation needs heavy machinery to perform the numerous tasks necessary to ensure swift water delivery and flood prevention.reclamation indicated in its response to fws that some of its activities might alter or damage silvery minnow habitat even if no individual species member was harmed.thus,the designation may require reclamation to adopt different design and construction techniques which may increase costs by as much as forty percent.because reclamation budget may remain stable or decrease,the adoption of maintenance techniques could result in the decrease of overall maintenance services.reclamation estimated that the costs of such a curtailment of maintenance activities include reduced water transport efficiency and a heightened risk of failure of water transport systems and flood protections.the economic analysis relied upon by fws conceded that reclamation curtailment of maintenance activities and corresponding water transport inefficiency could result in a loss of of water every year and would reduce flood protection.commentators to the economic analysis and the ea emphasized the potential costs of more numerous flooding events.while fws discounted in the ea the possibility of reduced maintenance activities,it recognized earlier in the silvery minnow recovery plan that current river maintenance practices have degraded the quality of silvery minnow habitat 
the evidence in the record thus demonstrates that the designation will result in a reallocation of water back into the riverbed and could result in a curtailment of river maintenance operations.the effects of these impacts,the loss of irrigated farmland and increased risk of flooding,however,only require preparation of an eis if they significantly affect the quality of the human environment.see c.human environment should be interpreted comprehensively to include the natural and physical environment and the relationship of people with that environment.significance is determined by looking at both the context of the action and its intensity.id.effects or impacts inclu
