the lands council and wild west institute challenged the united states forest service forest service decision to thin acres of forest in the mission brush project project area,located in the idaho panhandle national forest ipnf,claiming that the project violates the national forest management act nfma,u.et,the ipnf plan,and the national environmental policy act nepa,et.on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the forest service and denied lands council and wild west institute motion for summary judgment.lands council appeals.we affirm the decisions of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
a.the mission brush project 
the mission brush project area is located in the northern portion of the bonners ferry ranger district in the ipnf.the project assessment area encompasses approximately acres and includes the mission and brush creek watersheds.historically,the forest was primarily composed of ponderosa pine,western larch,and western white pine.however,the forest composition has shifted as the result of a number of factors,including fire suppression,past logging practices and white pine blister rust fungus.presently,the forest is densely crowded with stands of younger,species of trees that are more prone to insect infestation,disease,drought,and stand replacing fires than was previously the case.the forest service determined in its supplemental final environmental impact statement sfeis that t he densely stocked stands we see today are causing a general health and vigor decline in all tree species.
the forest service estimated that without intervention old growth and mature forests would continue to decline and,choosing among plan alternatives,decided to harvest acres of forest.the forest service decided,as part of the project,to thin acres of forest by removing younger,understory trees and fuel ladders vegetation that conveys fire from the ground to canopy the forest service plan leaves large trees unaffected by not cutting trees over inches in diameter within the stands.lands council and wild west institute challenged the project.
prior proceedings 
in may,the forest service issued the mission brush final environmental impact statement feis and record of decision rod.lands council administratively appealed the rod.we then issued a decision in lands council powell,cir,holding that the timber stand management record system tsmrs database was inaccurate and unreliable.in response to the powell decision,the forest service updated the tsmrs database and prepared a supplemental eis.
on april,the forest service issued the sfeis and rod.responding to the powell ruling,the sfeis contained additional information on cumulative effects and the methodologies for analyzing forest conditions,including wildlife analysis and stands of trees.the sfeis also evaluated three alternative actions and one alternative.the forest service chose alternative,which included harvesting smaller trees within the acres of old growth in the project.
lands council administratively appealed the rod,but its appeal was denied.in october,lands council and wild west institute filed suit against the forest service alleging violations of the ipnf plan,nfma,and nepa.contemporaneously,lands council and wild west institute sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to halt the project.boundary county,city of bonners ferry,city of moyie springs,everhart logging,and regehr logging,collectively,intervenors intervened on behalf of the forest service.
the district court denied lands council motion for a temporary restraining order as moot,and also denied its motion for a preliminary injunction.lands council appealed,and we reversed the district court decision in lands council mcnair,cir.however,after rehearing the case en banc in lands council mcnair lands council,cir en banc,we unanimously affirmed the district court denial of injunctive relief.
following the issuance of our decision en banc,the parties filed for summary judgment in the district court.the district court granted the forest service motion for summary judgment,and denied lands council motion for summary judgment.lands council filed this appeal

discussion 
lands council makes three claims on appeal in its challenge to the mission brush project.specifically,it asserts that the methodology utilized by the forest service has failed and that,as a result,the ipnf plan b provision requiring forest is insufficient the forest service can not demonstrate that it is in compliance with the ipnf plan standard because the databases consulted by the forest service are flawed and the forest service has applied flawed habit suitability models.we disagree.
methodology and the ipnf plan standard 
exhaustion of the challenge to the ipnf plan standard 
before addressing lands council claim on this issue,we first address the forest service contention that lands council failed to exhaust its challenge to the standard.
the purpose of the exhaustion doctrine is to permit administrative agencies to utilize their expertise,correct any mistakes,and avoid unnecessary judicial intervention in the process.buckingham dep t of,cir.a party forfeits arguments that are not raised during the administrative process.see dep t of transp.pub.citizen.however,a claimant need not raise an issue using precise legal formulations,as long as enough clarity is provided that the decision maker understands the issue raised.native ecosystems council dombeck,cir.accordingly,alerting the agency in general terms will be enough if the agency has been given a chance to bring its expertise to bear to resolve the claim.id.at.
here,lands council raised the study authored by lesica in its administrative challenge,arguing that the forest service did not scientifically justify why habitat is sufficient to maintain viability for species.in addition,before the district court,lands council argued that the methodology is unreliable because it fails to provide enough habitat for of a population potential.before us,lands council combined these two arguments.while lands council arguments are now more fully developed than they were in prior proceedings,lands council clearly put the forest service on notice that it challenged the standard,claiming that it is insufficient to ensure enough habitat for species.we therefore find that lands council exhausted below its general argument that the standard is insufficient.
the forest service reliance on the ipnf plan standard 
the ipnf plan requires that a pproximately percent of the forest will be maintained in old growth as needed to provide for viable populations of dependent and management indicator species.lands council argues,however,that because the forest service utilizes the methodology,the minimum habitat should be of the forest.lands council arrives at this figure by asserting that,historically,the acreage average was at and then multiplies that figure by the figure for indicator species identified in the ipnf plan.lands council also relies on the lesica paper to argue that the standard is flawed.
we do not act as a panel of scientists that instructs the forest service how to validate its hypotheses regarding wildlife viability,chooses among scientific studies in determining whether the forest service has complied with the underlying forest plan,and orders the agency to explain every possible scientific uncertainty t his is not a proper role for a federal appellate court.lands council,at.rather,we defer to the agency technical expertise where the record demonstrates that the agency reasonably relied on data in concluding the project meets the standards imposed by the nfma.see id.at.
here,we conclude that the forest service reasonably relied on the standard as set forth in the ipnf plan.first,the ipnf plan goal of maintaining a population potential is an objective,not a requirement,unlike the standard.norton utah wilderness alliance.moreover,many species use a variety of habitats and do not rely exclusively on forest.for example,the pileated woodpecker thrives in different forest types and the northern goshawk lives in a mix of landscape stages.thus,simply applying a flat standard of population viability within forest does not account for the reality that wildlife use a variety of habitats.furthermore,while the forest service is not required to meet the level standard advocated by lands council,we note that the area where the project is located actually meets a threshold.
second,we have already rejected lesica study in a similar challenge based on the kootenai national forest plan.ecology ctr.castaneda,cir.in particular,we determined that lesica conclusion does not bear directly on the viable population standard.the fact that levels of forest were significantly higher prior to european settlement in no way disproves the conclusion that ten percent is enough to support viable populations.id.because the lesica study did not directly challenge the forest service conclusion that was sufficient to sustain viable populations of species,the agency was not required to respond to it.id.
in light of the foregoing,we conclude that the forest reasonably relied on the standard as set forth in the ipnf plan.
b.the forest service compliance with the ipnf plan standard 
lands council contends that the forest service can not demonstrate that it is in compliance with the ipnf plan requirement because the fia and tsmrs databases are unreliable.lands council contention fails.
when specialists express conflicting views,an agency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable opinions of its own qualified experts even if,as an original matter,a court might find contrary views more persuasive.lands council,at quoting marsh,at.it is within the forest service discretion to rely on its own data and to discount the alternative evidence proffered by lands council.id.as discussed infra,the forest service reasonably relied on the fia database and,after updating,the tsmrs database to conclude that more than of the ipnf is.moreover,because the project does not contemplate the removal of trees,it does not affect the amount of forest in the ipnf.
the forest inventory and analysis database 
the fia database design and methodology are scientific,publicly disclosed,and repeatable with stringent quality control standards and procedures.lands council,at.based on the fia database,the forest service estimated that in the percentage of forest in the ipnf was with a degree of certainty.this exceeds the forest requirement under the ipnf plan.even though lands council disagrees with this conclusion,the forest service is entitled to reasonably rely on its own scientific data and analysis.see id.at.
lands council contends that the fia database is flawed because it overestimates habitat due to the fact that actual stands are not examined.instead,lands council argues,the fia database is based on surveys of sample plots that are of an acre in size and,therefore,does not accurately represent the fragmented ipnf or meet the ipnf plan minimum size requirement.lands council further claims that the fia confidence level is undermined because the monitoring report had a reduction in two years in estimates,and that the forest service can not meet the standard as the monitoring report had a confidence interval range of to.according to lands council,these alleged flaws mean that the fia database can not validate the tsmrs database estimates.
contrary to lands council assertions,the forest service reasonably relied on the fia database as a scientifically valid measure of forest.first,the ipnf plan does not require a stand in order to count towards the minimum.section f of the ipnf plan states that one or more stand per unit should be acres or larger the remaining management stands should be at least acres in size.preferred size is acres.this plan objective is to be used as a guide for planning purposes,but does not prohibit counting stands less than as old growth.see,ecology,at concluding plan language was suggestive of how old growth should be managed,but was not mandatory.additionally,even if only or larger stands were counted,there is still enough old
