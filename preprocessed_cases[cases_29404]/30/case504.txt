in january,the environmental law and policy center,blue ridge environmental defense league,nuclear energy information service,nuclear information and resource service,and public citizen collectively the environmental groups intervened in nuclear regulatory commission nrc proceedings regarding an early site permit esp for new nuclear power facilities in clinton,illinois.the environmental groups contended,among other things,that the esp applicant and the nrc failed to consider various alternative energy sources.after permitting one contention to proceed for further adjudication,the nrc atomic safety licensing board board determined that the applicant consideration of alternative energy sources satisfied the requirements of the national environmental policy act nepa and granted summary disposition in favor of the applicant.the nrc affirmed the board ruling and issued a dismissal order against the environmental groups.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the decision of the nrc.
background 
federal guidelines require any entity commencing construction of a nuclear power plant to obtain a construction permit and an operating license.permit applicants must submit information related to the plant design,a safety assessment of the site,and a report that assesses the environmental impact of the plant construction and operation.after reviewing a permit application,the nrc prepares an environmental impact statement eis for the construction permit.if an entity is not yet ready to construct a nuclear power plant but desires to seek early approval for a potential construction site,nrc regulations permit the person to apply for an esp.the esp application process resolves key safety,environmental,and emergency preparedness issues before the nrc authorizes or declines to authorize construction on that site.if granted,the esp allows an applicant to maintain a site for possible future construction of new nuclear power facilities for up to twenty years.moreover,an applicant may renew the esp for an additional twenty year term.however,an esp does not authorize the holder to construct a nuclear plant.nrc regulations require applicants to obtain additional permits before commencing such construction.under and,an esp applicant must submit a complete environmental report and the nrc must issue an eis that addresses all issues nepa identifies regarding the construction and operation of a nuclear power plant on the proposed site,but a project benefits need not be discussed at the esp stage.if the benefits are not discussed,they must be evaluated at later permit or licensing stages before construction may begin.
persons whose interests may be affected by an nrc licensing proceeding may file a request for a hearing and a petition to intervene.the petition must demonstrate the petitioner standing and contain at least one admissible contention.an admissible contention is one that provides sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists on a material issue of fact or law.f vi.once the board chooses to admit a contention,however,and provide that any party may file a motion for summary disposition of a contention,and a contention may be dismissed if the board finds that no genuine dispute of material fact remains.
in this case,exelon generation company exelon applied for an esp,seeking approval for the construction of one or two new nuclear reactors on an existing clinton nuclear power station site.exelon is a merchant generator,which means that it sells power on the open wholesale market.unlike a traditional regulated utility,exelon is not required to supply the energy needs of any particular area.in its esp application,exelon stated that it sought to reserve the proposed site for future,baseload nuclear energy generation that is,the creation of new energy intended to continuously produce electricity at or near full capacity,with high availability.exelon intended to sell any new energy it generated on the open wholesale market.
as part of its esp application,exelon submitted an environmental report.although the report did not address the general need for power,it examined a number of alternative energy sources that could generate baseload power.exelon evaluated alternative sources in terms of their ability to produce a baseload power equivalent to the amount of electricity that the proposed nuclear facility would produce.in its initial report,exelon evaluated wind power coupled with energy storage mechanisms,solar power coupled with energy storage mechanisms,fuel cells,geothermal power,hydropower,burning wood waste or other biomass,burning municipal solid waste,burning energy crops,plants,plants,and natural plants.the report concluded that several of the alternatives were not viable baseload energy alternatives because,for example,they involved insufficiently matured technology fuel cells or the state lacked sufficient available fuel supplies geothermal power,hydropower,woodwaste,and biomass.the report stated that wind and solar power,by themselves,were not reasonable baseload alternatives because they are intermittent energy sources and therefore can not maintain continuous full rated capacity the sun is not always shining,and the wind is not always blowing.in addition,the report concluded that power generated from natural gas and coal had greater environmental impacts on air quality than a nuclear plant.
after exelon submitted its environmental report,the environmental groups filed a contention alleging several shortcomings in exelon evaluation of energy alternatives.in particular,the environmental groups alleged that exelon had failed to adequately consider energy efficiency or combinations of wind or solar power with fossil fueled plants.the environmental groups also claimed that exelon used flawed information in its evaluation of wind and solar power.the board rejected the energy efficiency claim,reasoning that energy efficiency is not an alternative generation method that independent power generators like exelon typically employ.in addition,the board reasoned,an energy efficiency analysis would essentially consider the need for power,an analysis that may be postponed until exelon requests an actual construction permit.the board acknowledged the environmental groups contention that exelon had failed to consider combining wind or solar power with fossil fueled facilities and had used potentially flawed and outdated information regarding wind and solar power generation methods contention.
after the board recognized contention,exelon provided a report evaluating facilities that combined wind or solar power with fossil fuel.exelon revised evaluation concluded that facilities,facilities,or facilities using a combination of these alternatives were not environmentally preferable to the proposed nuclear facility,because the combination would produce environmental impacts greater than or equal to a new nuclear facility.
after reviewing the submitted information,the nrc issued a draft eis,which evaluated a wide range of reasonable alternatives to nuclear baseload energy.the draft eis reached conclusions similar to those reached by exelon.specifically,the draft eis found that individual wind and solar facilities were not sufficient on their own to generate baseload power.the draft eis also concluded that,from an environmental standpoint,the nuclear facility would be preferable or equivalent to a combination facility using wind or solar power and fossil fuel.the draft also concluded that a new nuclear unit was preferable in terms of air resources,ecological resources,water resources,and aesthetics.
after the nrc issued the draft eis,exelon submitted a motion for summary disposition of contention.in its motion,exelon asked the board to find that exelon response to the request for additional information cured its alleged failure to consider all reasonable alternatives.after the board permitted the environmental groups to petition to amend contention,it concluded that no genuine disputes of material fact remained.as a result,the board granted summary disposition of contention in favor of exelon and terminated the contested portion of the esp proceeding.the envi
