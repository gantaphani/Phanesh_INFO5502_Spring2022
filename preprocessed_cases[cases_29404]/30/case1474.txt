haze obscuring the grand canyon and various other national parks and wilderness areas in the west is a problem.in the interests of developing a solution,the environmental protection agency in adopted a regional haze rule haze rule.section required states to impose best available retrofit technology bart on sources,a specified class of large stationary pollution sources that had been in operation since august.in american corn growers ass epa,we vacated parts of because we found epa methods for determining bart inconsistent with the clean air act.those aspects of the haze rule remain pending before epa on remand.
section of the haze rule,however,permitted states to reduce haze by alternative means,including a regional approach,so long as the alternative would be better than bart,improve visibility more rapidly than under bart.in the rule before us,which implements the haze rule,epa approved a regional alternative.to determine whether the rule was better than bart,epa used a bart methodology quite similar to the one american corn growers condemned.on a challenge by the center for energy and economic development,representing a group of pollution sources in the region,we find that the similarity fatally taints epa rule.
the disputed regulations in this case arise from two amendments to the clean air act.section,adopted in,declare d as a national goal the prevention of any future,and the remedying of any existing,impairment of visibility in mandatory class i federal areas which impairment results from manmade air pollution.a.it instructed epa to require covered states to submit state implementation plans sips that contain such measures as may be necessary to make reasonable progress toward meeting the national goal.b.in determining reasonable progress,epa was to consider four factors the costs of compliance,the time necessary for compliance,the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of compliance,and the remaining useful life of any existing regulated source.g.in imposing bart requirements on the states,epa was to consider those four factors,plus the degree of improvement in visibility which may reasonably be anticipated to result from the use of such technology.g.
on july,epa promulgated the haze.section sets out requirements for sips to achieve natural visibility conditions by.d.in american corn growers we addressed e,which had instructed states to measure the first four bart factors by source,but to measure the degree of anticipated visibility improvement by area effect,by groups of sources defined by area of impact.e ii a b.to treat one of the five statutory factors in such a dramatically different fashion distorts the judgment congress directed the states to make for each source.american corn growers,at.as a result,we found,a state could be compelled to impose bart on a source even if the imposition would have no appreciable effect on the haze in any class i area.id.at.we reversed and remanded,and the remand is now pending before epa.
section,adopted in,expressed a broadened congressional concern,instructing epa to research visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness class i areas.a.it also directed epa to establish a visibility transport commission for the region affecting the visibility of the grand canyon national park.f.one year later,epa created the grand canyon visibility transport commission the commission to conduct research and recommend remedial measures.the commission submitted recommendations to epa in a report,covering the grand canyon and fifteen other class i areas on the colorado plateau.
epa pursued the implications of by incorporating in the haze rule not only a bart mandate but a regional alternative.it allowed states to implement an emissions trading program or other alternative measure so long as the alternative would achieve better than bart results.e,a.under,the commission,or a regional body formed to implement a prior commission report,may opt for a regional alternative by submitting an annex to that report.if epa approved the program described in the annex,then any state among the nine covered by the commission could adopt the program in lieu of the requirements.see f.epa approval would turn largely on whether the regional alternative provides greater reasonable progress toward natural visibility levels than would be achieved by bart.f i.
the western regional air partnership wrap,a regional body formed to implement the commission report,submitted an annex in september.the resulting plan has a number of important similarities to and differences from the program before us in american corn growers.first,to develop milestones that would meet the haze rule standard,wrap estimated bart likely achievements with a methodology similar to what we rejected in american corn growers.it applied the four factors other than visibility improvement by source category rather than individually,but,just as had the approach rejected in american corn growers,it measured visibility improvement in terms of the cumulative effect on particular class i areas of changes in emissions from all covered sources in the transport region.see annex,attachment c at.ultimately,the milestones were negotiated numbers,see annex rule,june,but these estimations were evidently a core basis for the negotiations.
second,the annex does directly impose restrictions on any sources.rather,it sets various emission limitation milestones that steadily decline over time.if sources in the aggregate fail to meet these milestones voluntarily,a backstop emissions trading program will come into force.under it,sources may not emit the relevant pollutants in amounts exceeding their they will have received either via allotment from the state or via trading.it was plausible that the trading program would meet the benchmark because it covers many sources besides ones that are under the statutes and.and the provision for trading presumably would reduce the cost for any given level of emissions reduction.see generally acid rain program general provisions and permits,allowance system,continuous emissions monitoring,excess emissions and administrative appeals.
epa approved and promulgated the substantially similar annex rule.june.
the center for energy and economic development,representing a group of pollution sources in the region,petitions for review.it argues that the epa bart benchmark is unlawful under our analysis in american corn growers.after addressing various preliminary issues,we grant the petition.
epa raises two jurisdictional objections to the the petitioner lacks standing and that our judgment in american corn growers precludes review.we reject both.
standing of course comprises the familiar elements of injury in fact,causation,and redressability,lujan defenders of wildlife,d.epa has posed several objections to standing,some in its original brief and another in a round of briefing that we requested after oral argument.initially epa said that the annex rule voluntary system of trading emission allowances was more favorable to the center than are the command and control bart rules that would otherwise apply on remand from american corn growers.moreover,if the center is correct that the annex rule does not achieve enough visibility improvement to constitute reasonable progress,epa reasoned that a rule meeting that standard would necessarily be more stringent and thus would only worsen the center burden.
both arguments fail.the center rightly points out that the annex rule requires immediate compliance with certain reporting requirements,subject to sanctions,so the rule burdens the center members now,which normally is enough for standing.see sierra club epa.as to the difference between and the annex rule,epa argument that the annex rule is necessarily more lenient errs on two counts.first,as between a that has not yet been repromulgated,see.may,and a living annex rule,the injury from the latter seems clear.second,contrary to epa characterization,the center complaint about the method of calculating reasonable progress is not that the annex rule is too lenient,but that,in violation of american corn growers,it lacks legally required evidence of attendan
