opinion of the court 
section of the clean air act,and implementing regulations promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency epa require states to evaluate the impact that emissions from certain sources of pollution within their borders have on atmospheric visibility in national parks and wilderness areas.after conducting this evaluation,the commonwealth of pennsylvania declined to require its sources to implement additional pollution controls because it concluded that the costs associated with the controls outweighed the limited visibility improvements they would produce.the commonwealth conclusions were set forth in its state implementation plan sip,which was approved by the epa in.
alleging that the epa approval of pennsylvania sip was arbitrary and capricious,the national parks conservation association,sierra club,and clean air council collectively,conservation groups filed the petition for review presently before the court.for the reasons that follow,we will grant the petition in part and deny it in part,and remand the matter to the epa for further consideration.
statutory and regulatory framework 
in,congress enacted the clean air act,to address the increasing amount of air pollution created by the industrialization of the united states and the resulting threat to public health and welfare.employing cooperative federalism,the clean air act gives both the federal government and the states responsibility for maintaining and improving air quality the federal government develops baseline standards that the states individually implement and enforce.bell cheswick generating station,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.
as originally enacted,the clean air act did not elaborate on the protection of visibility as an related value.chevron,epa,cir emphasis added.in,however,congress added to the clean air act i n response to a growing awareness that visibility was rapidly deteriorating in many places,such as wilderness areas and national parks id.with,congress established as a national goal the prevention of any future,and the remedying of any existing,impairment in visibility in mandatory class i areas which impairment results from air pollution.am.corn growers ass epa,per curiam quoting a.the protected class i areas include certain national parks and wilderness areas under a visibility impairment means both reduction in visual range and atmospheric discoloration.id.g.
in connection with,congress directed the epa to issue regulations to ensure reasonable progress toward the national goal of restoring visibility conditions to their natural state in class i areas.id.a.congress dictated that the epa regulations require adoption of a state implementation plan sip by each state that has a class i area within its borders or whose emissions may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility in any class i area.id.b.each sip must include,inter alia,emission limits,compliance schedules,and a strategy for meeting the national visibility goal.id.in response to this statutory directive,the epa promulgated the regional haze rule in.regional haze regulations.july,
section and the regional haze rule also require each sip to include a determination of the best available retrofit technology bart for certain major stationary sources of pollution that are reasonably anticipated to cause or contribute to visibility impairment in any class i area.north dakota epa,cir citing b a,e.bart is defined as an emission limitation based on the degree of reduction achievable through the application of the best system of continuous emission reduction for each pollutant which is emitted by an existing stationary facility.
to satisfy the bart requirements,a state sip must first identify all sources within its borders.under the regulations,a stationary source of air pollution is if it was in existence on august,but not in operation prior to august,fits within one of identified categories and has the potential to emit annually at least tons of any air pollutant.id.
next,a state sip must determine which of these sources are subject to bart.a source is subject to bart if it emits any air pollutant which may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility in any mandatory class i federal area.id.e ii emphasis added.the epa recommends that a state consider a source to cause visibility impairment if it is responsible for a change in visibility in a class i area of at least deciview regional haze regulations and guidelines for best available retrofit technology bart determinations,july.the suggested threshold for determining whether a source contributes to visibility impairment at a level no higher than deciviews.id.
for each source that is subject to bart,the state must conduct a analysis to determine appropriate emission limitations.in so doing,states weigh the following five factors the costs of compliance the energy and non air quality environmental impacts of compliance any existing pollution control technology in use at the source the remaining useful life of the source and the degree of improvement in visibility which may reasonably be anticipated to result from the use of such technology.wildearth guardians epa,cir quoting g pt,app.y.
to aid states in identifying sources and determining appropriate emission limitations,the epa issued the bart guidelines.wildearth guardians,at.the guidelines,issued in,provide states with a process for making their bart determinations,and these five steps subsume the statutory considerations listed above.id.at citing.under the guidelines,a state is to first identify all available retrofit control technologies.second,technically infeasible options are eliminated.third,the effectiveness of the remaining control techniques is assessed.fourth,the impacts,including the cost of compliance,energy impacts,quality impacts,and the remaining useful life of the facility,are evaluated.finally,a state must estimate the visibility impacts at class i areas.id.at citing.while states are required to use the guidelines when making bart determinations for any fossil power plant with a total electricity generating capacity of megawatts or more,the guidelines are advisory for smaller sources.id.citing b b e ii b.
as an alternative to conducting this analysis,states may instead implement another program if they can demonstrate it is at reducing emissions.specifically,the regional haze regulations permit a state to opt to implement or require participation in an emissions trading program or other alternative measure if it can show that the program would result in greater reasonable progress toward the national goal of restoring natural visibility than would be achieved through the installation and operation of bart.e.states participating in such programs do not have to conduct a bart analysis or compel pollution sources within their borders to install,operate,and maintain bart at their facilities.id.
regardless of whether a state conducts the bart analysis or follows the approach,it must ultimately submit its sip to the epa.the epa,in turn,must review the sip and determine whether it meets the requirements of the clean air act.a.the epa is required to approve a sip as a whole if it meets all the statutory requirements,and it may approve any portion of a sip that meets the requirements.id.at k.if a state fails to submit a sip,submits an incomplete sip,or submits a sip that does not meet the statutory requirements,the epa must enact its own federal implementation plan fip,unless the state can provide a sip that the epa can approve within two years.north dakota,at citing c.
procedural background 
pennsylvania submitted its regional haze sip to the epa in december,identifying sources of pollution within its borders.app.these pollution sources various power plants,mills,refineries,and other facilities around the state emit particulate matter pm into the atmosphere,as well as the chemical precursors to pm,which include sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen nox.pennsylvania elected to treat each of these sources as subject to bart and it opted to follow the process outlined in the guidelines for making bart determinations pennsylvania,however,chose to follow the approach with respect to the eight fossil fuel electric generating stations with a capacity of megawatts or more.
thus,pennsylvania conducted a bart analysis regarding the and nox emissions of each source with an electricity generating capacity below megawatts,but did not do so for the fossil fuel electric generating stations having a capacity of megawatts or more.pennsylvania noted that these sources participated in the cap and trade for and nox emissions established by epa clean air interstate rule cair.may,and concluded that the sources participation in the cap and trade program was better than bart at reducing such emissions.
ultimately,pennsylvania sip found that requiring additional emission controls at any of the sources would result in only minimal visibility improvement in affected class i areas.weighing this minimal improvement against the cost of implementing the controls,pennsylvania concluded that additional controls were not warranted.
in january,the epa issued a proposed rule providing for a limited approval of pennsylvania sip proposed rule.approval and promulgation of air quality implementation plans commonwealth of pennsylvania regional haze state implementation plan.the epa concluded that pennsylvania bart analysis complied with the statutory requirements of the clean air act and the regional haze regulations.however,the epa declined to address pennsylvania reliance on the cair program regarding and nox emissions for certain pollution sources,noting that particular issue was the subject of a separate rulemaking proceeding.the epa also announced a period for interested parties to comment on the proposed rule.
on june,the epa issued its final rule the national rule in the separate proceeding referenced by the proposed rule,disapproving the sips submitted by pennsylvania and other states to the extent they relied on the cair program to limit and nox emissions.regional haze revisions to provisions governing alternatives to source specific best available retrofit technology bart determinations,limited sip disapprovals,and federal implementation plans.june.with this disapproval,the epa also promulgated fips for of the states including pennsylvania,effectively replacing the states reliance on the cair program with reliance on the newly promulgated cross state air pollution rule,better known as the transport rule.by issuing the national rule,the epa also finalized its conclusion that the transport rule was at reducing and nox emissions,and that it addressed the shortcomings of the cair program previously identified by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
shortly thereafter,on july,the epa finalized its limited approval of pennsylvania sip.approval and promulgation of air quality implementation plans pennsylvania regional haze state implementation plan.july.with this final rule,the epa responded to comments regarding the proposed rule and reaffirmed its conclusion that pennsylvania bart analysis was proper.
in response to the final rule,the conservation groups filed a petition for review with this court,challenging the rule on a number of fronts.parks conservation epa.we did not reach the merits of the petition,though,since the epa filed a motion for voluntary remand without vacatur in order to consider and respond in greater detail to the conservation groups concerns.we granted the motion on october,and remanded the matter to the epa.
following remand,the epa entered a final rule on april,final rule,reissuing its limited approval of pennsylvania sip.approval and promulgation of air quality implementation plans pennsylvania regional haze state implementation plan.with this rule,the epa expanded its responses to certain comments and acknowledged numerous deficiencies in pennsylvania bart analysis.in the end,however,the epa approved the sip,finding that pennsylvania reasonably concluded that no additional pollution controls were required at the sources given the low visibility impact of the sources in class i areas and the high cost of implementing the controls.
this petition for review followed,with the conservation groups alleging that the epa arbitrarily and capriciously approved pennsylvania sip.we subsequently granted motions to intervene filed by the pennsylvania department of environmental protection the state agency responsible for drafting pennsylvania sip and homer city generation,a power plant in indiana county,pennsylvania.

transport rule 
the conservation groups challenge the epa decision to allow pennsylvania to rely on the transport rule in lieu of conducting a bart analysis regarding and nox emissions from each source with an electricity generating capacity of at least megawatts.in particular,they argue that the transport rule is not at reducing and nox emissions,has not been implemented as the epa assumed it would be when it permitted pennsylvania to rely on the rule,and is subject to further delays and legal challenges.
the epa counters that this appeal is not the appropriate vehicle to challenge its finding that the transport rule is or its decision to approve states reliance on this rule,as both these determinations stem from a final rule and separate rulemaking proceeding not presently before this court.moreover,the epa argues that under b,the conservation groups must pursue any such challenge in the circuit.we agree with the epa on both points.
following extensive administrative proceedings,the epa issued its national rule on june.with it,the epa finalized the transport rule,a replacement to the cair program that had been invalidated by the circuit in north carolina epa,per curiam.the national rule included the finding that the emission trading programs established by the transport rule are.in this action,the epa is finalizing our finding that the trading programs in the transport rule achieve greater reasonable progress towards the national goal of achieving natural visibility conditions in class i areas than bart in those states covered by the transport rule.the epa also finalized its disapproval of the sips submitted by pennsylvania and other states to the extent they relied on the cair program to limit and nox emissions,and promulgated fips for states including pennsylvania,effectively replacing the states reliance on the cair program with reliance on the newly promulgated transfer rule.id.
by contrast,the final rule,which the conservation groups challenge here,does not address the merits of the transport rule or pennsylvania reliance on it.instead,it notes those issues were addressed in a separate but related action,referring to the national rule.see.prior to issuing the final rule,the epa repeatedly explained that the propriety of the transport rule,the cair program,and pennsylvania reliance on the transport rule or the cair program were beyond the scope of these rulemaking proceedings.see,final rule.comments related to the transport rule as an alternative to bart for electricity generating units are beyond the scope of this rulemaking.the epa addressed similar comments concerning the transport rule as a bart alternative in the national rule.proposed rule.w e are not taking action in this notice to address the commonwealth reliance on cair to meet certain regional haze requirements.
in short,the conservation groups seek to use this appeal from the administrative proceedings that culminated in the final rule to challenge decisions the epa reached in separate proceedings.we find no support for this approach in the text of the clean air act provision authorizing judicial review of epa actions.see b.additionally,as the administrative record upon which these decisions were made is not before us,we lack the information necessary to evaluate the epa action regarding the transport rule.see fed.power comm transcontinental gas pipe line,stating that we have consistently expressed the view that ordinarily review of administrative decisions is to be confined to consideration of the decision of the agency and of the evidence on which it is based citation and quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we can not entertain the conservation groups challenge to the transport rule.
moreover,even if the conservation groups could use this appeal to challenge the transport rule,we are not the proper court to hear the challenge.under b,petitions for review of nationally applicable regulations promulgated,or final action taken,by the administrator of the epa may be filed only in the circuit.id.emphasis added.we conclude that the epa national rule,which finalized the transport rule applicable to states and the district of columbia and resulted in fips permitting various states to rely on the transport rule,falls into this category.see texas epa,wl,at cir,unpublished our conclusion today that an epa action involving the sips of numerous states is nationally applicable and thus reviewable only in the circuit is consistent with the holdings of our sister circuits to have considered the question.chamber of commerce browner,wl,at cir,unpublished an epa rule need not span from sea to shining sea to be nationally applicable.footnote omitted puerto rican cement epa,cir finding epa regulations to be nationally applicable where they applied to any sip that ha d been disapproved with respect to prevention of significant deterioration of air quality in any portion of any state where the existing air quality is better than the national ambient air quality standards,and the list of states governed by the regulations changed as sips were approved and disapproved by the epa 
accordingly,we will deny the conservation groups petition for review to the extent it challenges the transport rule or pennsylvania reliance on it.
source specific bart analysis 
the conservation groups also contend that pennsylvania bart analysis failed to comply with the guidelines in many respects,and that the epa violated the clean air act by arbitrarily approving pennsylvania sip despite these fatal flaws.the epa counters that pennsylvania analysis was largely proper,and that the errors it committed did not affect the reasonableness of the state decision not to require its sources to implement additional pollution controls.in what resembles a argument,the epa asserts that,despite pennsylvania flawed analysis,the resulting overall picture supported its ultimate decision.as discussed below,while we reject some of the arguments advanced by the conservation groups,we are nevertheless compelled to conclude that the epa arbitrarily approved pennsylvania sip given the multiple flaws in pennsylvania bart analysis and the epa insufficient explanation as to why it could overlook them.
identification of all available retrofit control technologies 
the conservation groups contend that pennsylvania failed to satisfy the bart requirement of identifying all available pollution control technologies.in particular,they argue that the state did not consider upgrades to existing electrostatic precipitator esp control technologies for power plants within the state,or other available combinations of controls.
the epa counters that pennsylvania sip notes that esp upgrades were considered for all but two power plants,and that pennsylvania had declined to consider upgrades at those two facilities because they had recently installed esp controls.the epa also argues that pennsylvania did consider combinations of controls,including fabric filters on sources where technically feasible.
while we agree with the epa that pennsylvania sip states that upgrades and combinations were considered,we can not discern from the administrative record the specifics of pennsylvania analysis or why it rejected certain upgrades or combinations.as the conservation groups noted in their comments to the final rule,app,pennsylvania sip states in conclusory fashion that esp upgrades,enhancements,or replacements were considered for certain sources.see,app.stating that t he retrofit technologies reviewed during the course of the bart analysis for the mitchell power station included modifications,esp upgrades,enhancements or replacement,replacement of the esps with fabric filters or compact hybrid particulate collectors.what the sip fails to do,however,is identify or describe the upgrades considered or explain why these controls were rejected.similarly,the epa has failed to explain either in the final rule or now on appeal how it could meaningfully evaluate pennsylvania analysis described in such conclusory fashion.we acknowledge that epa and bart regulations do not require exhaustive analysis of every conceivable emissions control.see pt,app.y.explaining that i t is not necessary to list all permutations of available control levels that exist for a given technology.nonetheless,the epa has failed to satisfactorily explain why the sip conclusory listings are acceptable.
baseline level for pm emissions 
the conservation groups next challenge pennsylvania bart analysis regarding pm emissions from power plants.specifically,they contend the state improperly concluded that the filterable emission limit of pound of particulate matter per million british thermal units represents bart for those facilities the conservation groups argue the limit is not sufficiently stringent,and note that lower limits between and have qualified as bart at other facilities.in short,they assert that pennsylvania had no reasoned basis for selecting the emission limit that it did,and that the epa arbitrarily approved pennsylvania bart analysis regarding pm emissions predicated on this threshold.
in the final rule,the epa concedes that pennsylvania failed to determine whether the emission limit actually represents bart for those facilities.see.here,pennsylvania determined that pm bart for most of the electricity generating units was their existing permitted emission limits of,which can be achieved by the existing control technology.while the epa agrees with the commenter that pennsylvania ideally should have examined whether actually reflects the degree of reduction achievable for the particular control technology at each facility,epa thinks that pennsylvania failure to do so was not fatal in this instance footnote omitted.the epa excuses this failure for two reasons.first,it argues that pennsylvania error was essentially harmless,as imposing a stricter pm emission limit on these sources would have minimal visibility impact in class i areas since the pm emissions from these sources were responsible for only a minimal portion of the visibility impairment in these areas.second,the epa claims that the issue is largely moot.id.at.specifically,the agency notes that many of these power plants have retired or put in motion plans to retire or convert to cleaner burning fuels since pennsylvania conducted its bart determinations.the epa also notes that the remaining sources will have to comply with a more stringent pm emission limit of by due to the implementation of the mercury and air toxics standards mats rule.id.at.
we find the epa arguments unconvincing.as discussed in greater detail infra,part,the epa claim of harmless error is unpersuasive since the agency has offered scant justification for this position,apart from its own assurances that the multiple flaws in pennsylvania analysis did not impact the reasonableness of its conclusions.similarly,the epa has not identified,nor have we located,any legal support for the epa contention that it may excuse errors in a state bart analysis as moot based on events that are yet to transpire.to the contrary,the epa has a statutory obligation to disapprove a sip that does not comply with the clean air act and to promulgate a fip if the deficiencies are not timely cured.see k requiring the epa to review sips to ensure compliance id.l prohibiting the epa from approving a revision to a sip if it would interfere with any applicable requirement of the clean air act.
alternative pollution control limits bact,laer,and mact 
the conservation groups also contend pennsylvania bart analysis regarding pm emissions did not comply with the guidelines because the state did not consider more stringent emission limits developed as part of separate air quality permitting processes under the clean air act.in particular,they argue that limits imposed by other as best available control technology bact,lowest achievable emission rate laer,and maximum achievable control technology mact are relevant to the bart analysis because they demonstrate achievable emission reductions 
in response,the epa notes that the bart guidelines do not require states to consider the exact emission limits determined to be bact and laer.instead,they must consider the technologies used to achieve bact and laer when conducting the first step of the bart analysis identifying all available control technologies for their pollution sources.see bart guidelines,pt,app.y technologies required as bact or laer are available for bart purposes and must be included as control alternatives.emphasis added.moreover,the epa notes that the stringent emission levels determined to be bact or laer are not necessarily achievable by sources because those programs apply to new and newly modified sources,while bart governs pollution sources constructed before.
the epa also notes that,for sources of pm emissions that are subject to mact standards,the bart guidelines permit but do not require states to rely on the stringent mact standards for purposes of bart.in other words,the guidelines create a presumption that a state reliance on the mact standards satisfies bart,but they do not require the state to rely on the mact standard to satisfy bart.see bart guidelines,pt,app.y we believe that,in many cases,it will be unlikely that states will identify emission controls more stringent than the mact standards without identifying control options that would cost many thousands of dollars per ton.unless there are new technologies subsequent to issuance of the mact standards which would lead to increases in the level of control,you may rely on the mact standards for purposes of bart.
we agree with the epa reading of the bart guidelines on these points.as a result,we reject the conservation groups contention that pennsylvania improperly failed to consider bact,laer,and mact emission limitations.
cost effectiveness threshold 
the conservation groups argue that pennsylvania failed to properly evaluate the of the pollution controls available for each source.in particular,they note that pennsylvania did not set a threshold for that is,an amount of money at which it would reject any available control option as too expensive.absent such a threshold,the conservation groups contend,pennsylvania had no principled way of determining when a pollution control was a method of improving visibility in affected class i areas.
the epa asserts that nothing in the clean air act requires pennsylvania to set a fixed threshold of,and that the guidelines make no mention of such a threshold in their instructions on how to evaluate.see bart guidelines,pt,app.y parks conservation ass epa,cir to be sure,the act and the regulations do not specifically require that epa explain its decisions through use of a bright line rule.instead of drawing a line in the sand on,the epa notes that pennsylvania sip appropriately determined that pollution sources with a higher degree of potential visibility improvement from control would justify higher cost controls,and that only low cost controls would be justified for sources with a lower degree of potential visibility improvement.app.
because we agree that pennsylvania was not compelled to set a threshold for,we conclude that the epa did not act arbitrarily by approving pennsylvania sip absent such a threshold.
cost effectiveness metric 
the conservation groups also assert that pennsylvania used an improper metric when calculating the of additional pollution controls.specifically,they argue that pennsylvania evaluated the cost of controls based on the metric rather than the metric required by the guidelines the conservation groups contend that pennsylvania use of the metric distorted the true cost of pollution controls and led to the state conclusion that additional pollution controls were not warranted at any of the sources.
in responding to this argument during the period and now on appeal,the epa has taken seemingly inconsistent positions.in the text of the final rule,the epa states,without elaboration,that pennsylvania use of the metric was flawed.final rule.stating that epa agrees with the commenters that pennsylvania reliance on the metric was flawed for multiple reasons.on appeal,however,the epa responds that the guidelines specify that calculations be expressed in terms of,but they do not forbid the consideration of the metric as well the epa also notes that pennsylvania considered both metrics with respect to of its sources.resp.br.
our review of the epa decision is limited to the reasoning supplied in its final rule,not the justifications subsequently crafted and proffered by the agency appellate counsel.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at it is that an agency action must be upheld,if at all,on the basis articulated by the agency itself.citations omitted safe air for everyone epa,cir stating that our review of an administrative agency decision begins and ends with the reasoning that the agency relied upon in making that decision.as a result,we are left with the epa conclusion that pennsylvania use of the metric is flawed in multiple unidentified respects and no meaningful explanation as to why the epa ignored these flaws.this rationale is insufficient to justify the epa approval of pennsylvania analysis of.
cumulative visibility impact 
as part of its bart analysis,pennsylvania was required to calculate the visibility improvement that could be achieved in class i areas by implementing additional pollution controls at its sources.the state calculations for each source,however,took into account only the potential impact such controls would have on the visibility in the class i area most severely impacted by the source.pennsylvania did not consider the cumulative visibility impact that is,it did not calculate the total visibility improvement for all affected class i areas that would result from installing additional controls at each source.as a result,the conservation groups argue,pennsylvania underestimated the visibility impact of each source and,correspondingly,underestimated the of additional control technologies.
in the final rule,the epa admits that pennsylvania should have calculated the cumulative visibility impact from its sources.epa also agrees with the commenters that,in considering the visibility improvement expected from the use of controls,pennsylvania should have taken into account the visibility impacts at all impacted class i areas rather than focusing solely on the benefits at the most impacted area.the epa contends this error,among others,was harmless,a contention we address below.
harmless error 
to justify its approval of pennsylvania admittedly flawed bart analysis,the epa advances a harmless error argument.in particular,the epa contends it reasonably approved pennsylvania conclusion that pollution controls were not warranted as the overall picture that emerged from the state analysis demonstrated that the improvement in visibility at affected class i areas as a result of the controls would be minimal.based on the administrative record before us,however,that conclusion is
