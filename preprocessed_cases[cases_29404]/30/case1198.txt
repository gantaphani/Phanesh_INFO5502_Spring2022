glacier bay national park and preserve is a place of unrivaled scenic and geological values associated with natural landscapes and wildlife species of inestimable value to the citizens.the bay was proclaimed a national monument in and a national park in.unesco designated glacier bay an international biosphere reserve in and a world heritage site in.
not surprisingly,many people wish to visit the park.as there are no roads to glacier bay,most tourists arrive by boat.to be more specific,of the park on large,cruise ships.in the national park service parks service commenced implementation of a plan that increased the number of times cruise ships could enter glacier bay each summer season immediately by and overall by if certain conditions were met.in its environmental assessments,the parks service acknowledged that this plan would expose the park wildlife to increased multiple vessel encounters,noise pollution,air pollution,and an increased risk of vessel collisions and oil spills.the parks service also acknowledged that it did not know how serious these dangers to the environment were,or whether other dangers existed at all.nevertheless,declaring that its plan would have no significant impact on the environment,the parks service put it into effect without preparing an environmental impact statement eis.
the plaintiff national park and conservation association npca,a nonprofit citizen organization,alleges that the parks service failure to prepare an eis violated the national environmental policy act nepa,et.it seeks an order requiring the parks service to prepare an eis and enjoining implementation of the plan pending its completion.the district court ruled that an eis was not required because the parks service had made its findings after adequately canvassing the existing knowledge base.we reverse the district court ruling and remand with instructions to enjoin the plan increases in vessel traffic,including any portion already put into effect,until the parks service has completed an eis.
factual and procedural history 
there may be no place on earth more spectacular than the glacier bay.located in the alaskan panhandle,surrounded by mountain ranges,glacier bay extends sixty miles inland and encompasses ten deep fjords,four of which contain actively calving tidewater glaciers,and approximately square miles of pristine marine waters.the air quality,though fragile,is still unspoiled and permits those fortunate enough to be visitors a crisp,clear view of the bay with its glacier faces as well as the opportunity to breathe the fresh and invigorating air.the park is the habitat for an extraordinary array of wildlife.on the land,pioneer plant communities grow in areas recently exposed by receding glaciers.moose,wolves,and black and brown bears roam the park spruce and hemlock rain forest.bald eagles,kittiwakes,murrelets,and other seabirds nest along the shore sea otters,harbor seals,steller sea lions,harbor and dall porpoises,minke,killer,and humpback whales reside in the bay.
the steller sea lion and the humpback whale,two of the marine mammal species that inhabit glacier bay,are imperiled.the steller sea lion was listed as a threatened species under the endangered species act esa,et,in.the worldwide population of the species declined by as much as in the thirty years prior to glacier bay has several sites where hundreds of steller sea lions gather.the humpback whale,the most gamesome and lighthearted of all the whales,herman melville,moby dick,harrison hayford hershel parker,norton,has been listed as an endangered species since the enactment of the esa in.until a moratorium was instituted in,commercial whaling decimated the worldwide population of humpback whales.today only to remain a subpopulation of humpbacks spends the summer feeding season in southeast alaska,including the waters of glacier bay other humpbacks remain there throughout the year.
ships,tour boats,charter boats,and private primary access to glacier bay attractions.approximately of the park visitors are cruise ship passengers.according to the parks service environmental assessment,the key attraction of the visit to glacier bay is t he glaciers at the head of the west arm of the bay.they are larger,more active,and considered by the companies to offer a more spectacular experience.the ships linger at the glaciers from between fifteen minutes to an hour and provide a large,high viewing platform from which to witness the crack and crash of the great ice masses as they cast off huge shards of floating ice.although the ships height permits an unobstructed view of the park geologic features,it limits close views of the wildlife and vegetation that form such a significant feature of the park.
between and,vessel traffic in glacier bay increased dramatically.in the national marine fisheries service fisheries service produced a biological opinion based on its studies of the humpback whale population in glacier bay.the biological opinion expressed concern over the uncontrolled increase of vessel traffic in the whales departure from the bay during and,and cautioned that a continued increase in the amount of vessel traffic would likely jeopardize the continued existence of the humpback whale population frequenting southeast alaska.the fisheries service recommended that the parks service regulate the number of vessels entering glacier bay restrict vessels from approaching and pursuing whales and conduct studies on whale feeding behavior,the effect of vessels on whale behavior,and the acoustic environment 
the parks service soon thereafter promulgated regulations governing the entry and activity of cruise ships and other vessels in glacier bay.the regulations provided that only two cruise ships could enter the bay each day,with a maximum of cruise ship entries between june and august.smaller boats,designated craft,were limited to entries per day with a seasonal maximum of entries.vessels were prohibited from intentionally positioning themselves within a quarter of a nautical mile of a whale or attempting to pursue a whale.within designated whale waters,vessels had to operate at a constant speed of ten knots or less and follow a course.
in the fisheries service issued a second biological opinion,which concluded in part 
i f the existing restrictions on the operation of vessels within the bay were removed,the associated disturbance would be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the southeast alaska humpback whale stock a ny increase in vessel traffic in glacier bay probably will add to the level of traffic encountered by humpback whales in southeast alaska,and thereby add to cumulative impacts to the humpback whale.
nevertheless,the fisheries service opinion stated that a slight increase in vessel traffic was tolerable,provided that the number of individual whales entering the bay did not fall below the level and that appropriate corrective measures were taken.accordingly,in the parks service promulgated a vessel management plan vmp and regulations that provided for a increase,in increments,in the previously authorized vessel entry quotas.this overall for a total of cruise ship entries per fully realized in.
in september the parks service completed an internal draft of a new vmp that proposed to increase the then current level of cruise ship entries in glacier bay by an additional.on february,the fisheries service issued a third biological opinion expressing its concern about the decline in humpback whale use of glacier bay,and stating that there were no studies to show that this decline is not due to avoidance of vessel traffic.although the fisheries service did not oppose the draft vmp,it urged the parks service to take a conservative approach in all management actions that may affect humpback whales and to implement particular research and monitoring programs the fisheries service did not find that the parks service proposed action was likely to jeopardize the continued existence and recovery of steller sea lions.
as mandated by nepa,the parks service investigated whether a substantial increase would significantly affect the environment in glacier bay.see c.in may the parks service issued a combined proposed vmp and environmental assessment ea.an ea is a document that,under nepa,provides sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact aids an agency compliance with nepa when no eis is necessary and facilitates preparation of an eis when one is necessary.a.an ea is a less formal and less rigorous document than an eis.conner burford,cir.
the combined reported the existence of environmental questions that went far beyond the potential impact on the humpback whales.it also described and assessed six alternative approaches for managing vessels in glacier bay,ranging from alternative four reduction in vessel traffic by between and,to alternative one maintenance of the status quo,to alternative five increase of cruise ship entries by.notwithstanding the environmental problems it recognized,the parks service expressed its preference for alternative five.this alternative maintained the limit of two cruise ship entries per day,but increased the total number of seasonal entries from to it did not increase seasonal entries for other vessels.
the parks service conducted six public hearings on the vmp.the parks service received approximately comments,approximately of which opposed alternative five and favored alternative four.the sierra club,the alaska wildlife alliance,and the plaintiff npca spoke out against alternative five at the hearings,and submitted expert opinion and evidence in opposition to the parks service findings.on march,the parks service announced its decision to implement a modified version of alternative five as its new vmp.under this modified plan,the seasonal entry quota for cruise ships would increase by for and,and by as much as thereafter if certain conditions were met.also,the entry quotas for charter boats and craft would increase by and,respectively.an accompanying revised ea,titled impacts of the modified alternative,discussed the effects of the new vmp on threatened and endangered marine mammals,other marine mammals,birds,and the human environment,including air quality.
the revised ea included the following observations 
steller sea lions using open water would be subject to increased vessel traffic and its related disturbance.little is known about the effects of the disturbance.
the increased vessel traffic would expose the harbor seal,harbor porpoise,dall porpoise,humpback whale,killer whale,and minke whale to increased levels of disturbance,causing the animals to expend energy reserves and possibly compromising the survival and reproduction of individual animals.in addition,the potential for daily and seasonal exposure of humpback whales to underwater noise would increase.the effect of increased levels of disturbance on these cetacean populations,it concluded,was unknown.
marine mammals using habitats would be subject to increased vessel traffic and its related disturbance.however,little is known about the effects of the disturbance.the risk of vessels colliding with marine mammals would increase,although the degree of increase is unknown.similarly,there would be an increased risk of ship collisions,other accidents,and associated fuel spills.the rate of actual spills could increase,but the degree of increase in unknown.
the degree to which disturbance and displacement would affect the humpback whale populations in glacier bay is unknown.several mitigation measures implemented under this alternative would reduce the risk of interactions and the level of potential effects on individual whales.the implementation of response plans by the cruise ship industry could reduce oil spill risks to individual whales.
it was unknown whether populations of marbled murrelets and kittlitz murrelets would change under the vmp.
the overall effect on bald eagle populations is unknown.
it is unknown if waterfowl populations would change under this alternative.
finally,the revised ea acknowledged that the increase in cruise ship entries would result in more violations of state air quality standards,but stated that the biological effects of these air pollutants from stack emissions are unknown.
at the same time it released its revised vmp and ea the parks service also released a proposed finding of no significant impact fonsi.as its title suggests,a fonsi states the reasons why an agency proposed action will not have a significant effect on the environment and,therefore,it believes that the preparation of an eis is unnecessary under nepa.see.the parks service glacier bay fonsi stated,in relevant part 
the parks service has determined that the modified alternative five can be implemented with no significant adverse effect to natural and cultural resources as documented by the environmental assessment.key environmental issues associated with the modified alternative include effects on marine mammals and birds from vessel disturbance and air quality degradation from cruise ship stack emissions.some disturbance to these resources would be expected.however,the mitigation strategies included in this action would significantly reduce environmental effects resulting from vessel entries.
the npca submitted objections to the and the proposed fonsi on april.the parks service adopted the and issued its fonsi and final regulations on the plan on may.see,codified at b.
on may,the npca filed suit against secretary babbitt and dennis galvin,acting director of the parks service.the npca requested declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the parks service to rescind the new vmp and prohibiting any activities to be conducted pursuant to these rules until such time as the parks service has complied with nepa by preparing an adequate eis for use in evaluating the new vmp before reimplementing it.holland america line westours,westours,one of the two major cruise ship operators in glacier bay,intervened as a defendant pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a.
the npca,the parks service,and westours each filed motions for summary judgment.on august,the district court issued an order denying npca motion,granting the parks service motion,and denying westours motion as moot.the court observed that the ea made it fairly clear that interactions between whales and vessels might be seriously disruptive to wildlife residing in the park.it also acknowledged that the effects cruise ship operations have on glacier bay national park and the animals that live there are unknown,either before ship operations increased or since,and that the modified alternative description ea attached to the fonsi contains a long list of uncertainties about the potential effects of increased vessel traffic.while it proposed that further studies be conducted,it determined that the existence of the numerous uncertainties was not sufficient to require an eis.the ea in this case,the district court wrote,thoroughly canvasses all existing information and recognizes that theoretical harms might occur,but concludes that there is no evidence suggesting that a significant risk exists that the harms will occur.it concluded 
a modest increase in the number of visitors may be allowed while the studies are commissioned and the existing data base increased with care taken through ameliorization sic to recognize and eliminate problems as they arise.
the district court granted the parks service for summary judgment and dismissed the case.the npca appealed,and westours.
i.the parks service violated nepaa.standard of review 
we review a district court decision to grant or deny a motion for summary judgment de novo.metcalf daley,cir citation omitted.in reviewing an agency decision not to prepare an eis under nepa,we employ an arbitrary and capricious standard,blue mountains biodiversity project blackwood,cir,cert.denied,d,that requires us to determine whether the agency has taken a hard look at the consequences of its actions,based its decision on a consideration of the relevant factors,and provided a convincing statement of reasons to explain why a project impacts are insignificant.metcalf,at.
environmental assessment 
nepa requires that an environmental impact statement eis be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.however,if,as here,an agency regulations do not categorically require the preparation of an eis,then the agency must first prepare an environmental assessment ea to determine whether the action will have a significant effect on the environment.see salmon river concerned citizens robertson,cir.if the ea establishes that the agency action may have a significant effect upon the environment,an eis must be prepared.foundation for am.wild sheep united states dep t of,cir emphasis added see also blue mountains,at.if not,the agency must issue a finding of no significant impact fonsi,see blue mountains,at,accompanied by a convincing statement of reasons to explain why a project impacts are insignificant.blue mountains,at quoting save the yaak comm.block,cir.
whether there may be a significant effect on the environment requires consideration of two broad factors context and intensity.see c see also sierra club united states forest,cir context simply delimits the scope of the agency action,including the interests affected.intensity relates to the degree to which the agency action affects the locale and interests identified in the context part of the inquiry.here,the context is glacier bay national park,its natural setting,its variegated inhabitants,and its pure but fragile air quality intensity must be established in this case by using three of the standards enumerated in the unique characteristics of the geographic area the degree to which vmp alternative five possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain and the degree of controversy surrounding those possible effects.the unique characteristics of glacier bay are undisputed and of overwhelming importance.accordingly,we next consider the agency determination in light of the degree of uncertainty manifested,and the degree of controversy generated.either of these factors may be sufficient to require preparation of an eis in appropriate circumstances.sierra club,at,blue mountains,at.in the end,we conclude that the parks service clearly erred and that the high degree of uncertainty and the substantial controversy regarding the effects on the quality of the environment each necessitates preparation of an eis.
uncertainty 
an agency must generally prepare an eis if the environmental effects of a proposed agency action are highly uncertain.see blue mountains,at significant environmental impact mandating preparation of an eis where effects are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks preparation of an eis is mandated where uncertainty may be resolved by further collection of data,see id.at lack of supporting data and cursory treatment of environmental effects in ea does not support refusal to produce eis,or where the collection of such data may prevent speculation on potential.effects.the purpose of an eis is to obviate the need for speculation by insuring that available data are gathered and analyzed prior to the implementation of the proposed action.sierra club,at.
here,scientific evidence presented in the parks service own studies revealed very definite environmental effects.the uncertainty was over the intensity of those effects.the fonsi reported increased daily and seasonal exposure of humpback whales and other denizens of the bay to underwater noise and predicted a range of adverse behavioral responses,traffic effects including increased risk of collision,affecting whales,harbor seals,sea otters,murrelets,and molting waterfowl,and increased risk of oil pollution for all animal life in the park.an increase in cruise ships would also result in more violations of state air quality standards for cruise ship stack emissions.among the specific effects set forth in the upon which the fonsi was based were that increased vessel entry into the bay would subject stellar sea lions to additional disturbance increase the escape patterns of various types of whales potentially increase mortality rates and change the social patterns of the harbor seal preclude sea otters from colonizing the upper bay and increase disturbance of feeding murrelets,other seabird nesting colonies,and bald eagles.
the ea describes the intensity or practical consequences of these effects,individually and collectively,as unknown.see pages,supra.the uncertainty manifested through the ea stems from two sources an absence of information about the practical effect of increased traffic on the bay and its inhabitants and a failure to present adequate proposals to offset environmental damage through mitigation measures.the lack of data regarding the practical effect of increased traffic,like the failure to investigate environmental impacts in blue mountains,at,undermines t he parks service ea which is where the agency defense of its position must be found.id.that document states that l ittle is known about the effects of the cruise ship disturbance on steller sea lions t he effect of increased levels of disturbance on glacier bay cetacean populations is unknown and the degree of increase in oil spills as a result of increased traffic is unknown.it also states that the effect of noise and air pollution on murrelets,bald eagles,and waterfowls remains unknown because unstudied.moreover,the extent to which air pollution will diminish the beauty and quality of the natural environment is also unknown the parks service ea does,however,establish both that such information may be obtainable and that it would be of substantial assistance in the evaluation of the environmental impact of the planned vessel increase.the ea proposes a park research and monitoring program to fill information needs,and understand the effects of vessel traffic on air quality,marine mammals and birds to assist in the prediction,assessment,and management of potential effects on the human,marine,and coastal environments of glacier bay resulting from human use of the environment with particular emphasis on traffic.that is precisely the information and understanding that is required before a decision that may have a significant adverse impact on the environment is made,and precisely why an eis must be prepared in this case.
the parks service proposes to increase the risk of harm to the environment and then perform its studies.it has in fact already implemented the first part of its vmp.this approach has the process exactly backwards.see sierra club,at.before one brings about a potentially significant and irreversible change to the environment,an eis must be prepared that sufficiently explores the intensity of the environmental effects it acknowledges.a part of the preparation process here could well be to conduct the studies that the park service recognizes are needed.that might be done here by performing the studies of the current vessel traffic and extrapolating or projecting the effects of the proposed increase ultimately,the park service may develop other means for obtaining the information it currently lacks.the point is,however,that the hard look must be taken before,not after,the actions are put into effect.
the parks service lack of knowledge does not excuse the preparation of an eis rather it requires the parks service to do the necessary work to obtain it.in blue mountains,we found that general statements about possible environmental effects failed the hard look test required under nepa.at.here,the parks service repeated generic statement that the effects are unknown does not constitute the requisite hard look mandated by the statute if preparation of an eis is to be avoided.see id.general statements about possible effects and some risk do not constitute a hard look absent a justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided citing neighbors of cuddy mountain united states forest,cir.the park service statement of reasons does not provide a convincing explanation as to why the requisite information could not be obtained prior to placing the vmp into effect.id.in short,the information currently provided by the parks service in its ea leaves us with the firm impression that,absent successful mitigation measures,there is a substantial possibility that the vmp will significantly affect glacier bay park,including the air,the water,and the various species that inhabit the park.
the second source of uncertainty is the parks service ability to offset the environmental impact of the increase in vessel traffic through its proposed mitigation measures.an agency decision to forego issuing an eis may be justified in some circumstances by the adoption of such measures.wetlands action network united states army corps of eng rs,cir friends of payette horseshoe bend hydroelectric,cir.if significant measures are taken to mitigate the project effects,they need not completely compensate for adverse environmental impacts.wetlands action network,at quoting friends of payette,at.while the agency is not required to develop a complete mitigation plan detailing the precise nature of the mitigation measures,the proposed mitigation measures must be developed to a reasonable degree.id a perfunctory description,okanogan highlands alliance williams,cir quoting neighbors of cuddy mountain,at,or mere listing of mitigation measures,without supporting analytical data,is insufficient to support a finding of no significant impact.id.quoting idaho sporting congress thomas,cir.in evaluating the sufficiency of mitigation measures,we consider whether they constitute an adequate buffer against the negative impacts that may result from the authorized activity.specifically,we examine whether the mitigation measures will render such impacts so minor as to not warrant an eis.see greenpeace action,at.
there is a paucity of analytic data to support the parks service conclusion that the mitigation measures would be adequate in light of the potential environmental harms.by contrast,in okanogan the forest service conducted computer modeling to predict the quality and quantity of environmental effects,discussed the monitoring measures to be put in place,ranked the probable efficacy of the different measures,detailed steps to achieve compliance should the measures fail,and identified the environmental standards by which mitigation success could be measured.id.at.because the forest service considered extensively the potential effects and mitigation processes,the court found that discussion of the mitigation measures was adequate to constitute the convincing statement of reasons to permit preparation of a fonsi.id.at emphasis omitted.in this case,however,the parks service did not conduct a study of the anticipated effects of the mitigation measures nor did it provide criteria for an ongoing examination of them or for taking any needed corrective action except for the plan to conduct studies.as with the rest of its proposal,it planned to act first and study later.
the parks service first described its proposed mitigation measures in the initial ea.that document reflects the uncertainty that exists as to whether the mitigation measures would work moreover,it is unclear from that document whether the measures are sufficiently related to the effects they are designed to cure.the parks service simply noted,for example,that mitigation measures could mitigate some potential effects to humpbacks in concentrated areas could reduce collisions and reduce the noise emanating from the ships s closures and restrictions implemented under alternative five may offset some of the expected disturbance.air pollution measures would be expected to contribute to a reduction in cruise ship stack emissions over time.further,the service stated that it 
intends to institute a comprehensive research and monitoring program to fill informational needs and quantity the effects of vessel traffic on air quality,marine mammals,birds and enjoyment.the monitoring program,developed within one year of the record of decision,will stipulate research and protection actions parks service will undertake to ensure that environmental effects do not exceed acceptable levels 
the final ea was similarly uncertain with respect to the proposed measures effects.it recognized that a speed restriction to offset the increased vessel traffic might disturb the creatures in the park,but that very little is known about the effects of the disturbance.the ea also stated that the increase in seasonal entries could reduce collisions and reduce the noise level emanating from the ships,f research and monitoring will be essential to define humpback whale use patterns in glacier bay resulting from this alternative and that requiring cruise ships to implement response plans could mitigate the effects of oil spills.as for air pollution,the magnitude of increased violations would presumably be reduced over time.there is no indication,however,as to how long any such reduction might take or how great a reduction might ultimately be accomplished.in short,there is no evidence that the mitigation measures would significantly combat the mostly unknown or inadequately known effects of the increase in vessel traffic.the ea speculative and conclusory statements are insufficient to demonstrate that the mitigation measures would render the environmental impact so minor as to not warrant an eis.see greenpeace action,at.
it is instructive to contrast this case with wetlands action network.in that case,the court made clear that,though the mitigation measures were underdeveloped,the imposition of special conditions,enforced through a permit,and reviewed by various other agencies ensured that the measures would be enforced in a manner that properly reduced negative environmental impact.see wetlands action network,at.here,there were no such special conditions applied to the parks service or the tour boat operators in connection with the measures designed to mitigate the effects of the proposed increase in cruise ships.in fact,whether the mitigation measures are fully enforced or not,the ea reflects significant uncertainty as to whether they could provide an adequate buffer against the harmful effects of the plan.this is understandable in light of the fact that the extent of those harmful effects is itself unknown,and that in such circumstance it is particularly difficult to estimate the effects of mitigation measures.that fact,however,does not help make the measures adequate for purposes of avoiding the preparation of an the contrary.
as with the question of the extent of the unremediated injury that might otherwise occur,the question of the impact of the proposed mitigation measures must be studied as part of the preparation of an eis rather than after the injury has transpired.the fact that the agency plans to test the effect of its mitigation measures does not relieve it of the obligation to prepare an eis prior to the time of the threatened environmental damage.rather,the parks service testing proposal shows that the information necessary to determine the impact of any mitigation measures,like the information relating to the extent of the injurious effects,may well be obtainable before any environmental injury occurs.the proposed mitigation studies thus argue in favor of preparing an eis,not against it.
the district court found that the agency decision not to prepare an eis was justified because the uncertainty reflected the existing state of knowledge.the passage of cruise ships through glacier bay is not a new development,however.both the vessels sailings and the dispute over the potential environmental damage have existed for a substantial period of time.no new scientific developments are required in order to obtain the requisite information.the parks service itself proposes to conduct studies which it anticipates may provide the answers.we simply hold that,under these circumstances,where significant environmental damage may occur to a treasured natural resource,the studies must be conducted first,not afterwards.
controversy 
the district court also found that npca had not made a sufficient showing of controversy to require preparation of an eis.again,we disagree.
agencies must prepare environmental impact statements whenever a federal action is controversial,that is,when substantial questions are raised as to whether a project may cause significant degradation of some human environmental factor,northwest envtl.def.ctr.bonneville power,cir quoting laflamme ferc,cir reinhardt,concurring in part and dissenting in part,or there is a substantial dispute about the size,nature,or effect of the major federal action.blue mountains,at citing greenpeace action,at sierra club,at.a substantial dispute exists when evidence,raised prior to the preparation of an eis or fonsi,see greenpeace action,at holding that party may not establish controversy post hoc,when at the time of the agency action no controversy existed,casts serious doubt upon the reasonableness of an agency conclusions see idaho sporting congress,at blue mountains,at.nepa then places the burden on the agency to come forward with a explanation demonstrating why those responses disputing the ea conclusions do not suffice to create a public controversy based on potential environmental consequences.laflamme,at citing jones gordon,the term well reasoned explanation is simply a less direct way of saying that the explanation must be convincing.see metcalf,at.
after publication of the initial ea,and before publication of the ea and fonsi,the parks service received comments on the vmp,approximately of which opposed alternative five and favored alternative four.this volume of negative comment is more than sufficient to meet the outpouring of public protest discussed in greenpeace action see at.more important,to the extent the comments urged that the ea analysis was incomplete,and the mitigation uncertain,they cast substantial doubt on the adequacy of the parks service methodology and data.the dispute between npca and the parks service thus goes beyond a disagreement of qualified experts over the reasoned conclusions as to what the data reveal.see greenpeace action,at here,the agency conclusions were not reached by reasoned extrapolation from the data,rather the data were simply insufficient.the parks service acknowledged that an increase in vessel traffic would have an environmental impact.the data,however,did not establish the intensity of that impact,nor the efficacy of the mitigation measures designed to offset that unquantified impact.npca asserted that the effects on the environment would likely be substantial.the parks service responded that the extent of the effects was unknown.therein lay the controversy.in its response,the agency proposed to determine the extent of the effects by implementing the vmp and studying its consequences.as we have stated in section,the absence of currently available information does not excuse the parks service from preparing an eis when there is a reasonable possibility that such information can be obtained in connection with the preparatory process.the agency response is therefore not sufficient to resolve the controversy.accordingly,the case before us is controlled by blue mountains,idaho sporting congress,and sierra club and greenpeace action is not to the contrary.here,preparation of an eis is mandated by the controversy,as well as by the uncertainty,factor of the intensity provision.b.
ii.injunctive relief 
npca asks this court to reverse the district court and remand the case with instructions to enjoin further implementation of the vessel management plan until a full environmental impact statement is prepared.to determine whether injunctive relief is appropriate,even in the context of environmental litigation,we apply the traditional balance of harms analysis.forest conservation council united states forest,cir citations omitted see also amoco prod.village of gambell,d holding that unless congress directed otherwise,a court must balance the competing claims of injury in determining whether injunctive relief is appropriate.environmental injury,by its nature,can seldom be adequately remedied by money damages and is often permanent or at least of long duration,irreparable,amoco prod,at.when the proposed project may significantly degrade some human environmental factor,injunctive relief is appropriate.alaska wilderness recreation tourism morrison.see also sierra club,at save the yaak,at.
npca has made the requisite showing for injunctive relief.as we concluded in section i,an eis is required.we so held because of the significant adverse impact on the environment that might result from the implementation of the vmp.see blue mountains,at an eis is required of an agency in order that it explore,more thoroughly than an ea,the environmental consequences of a proposed action whenever substantial questions are raised as to whether a project may cause significant environmental degradation.where an eis is required,allowing a potentially environmentally damaging project to proceed prior to its preparation runs contrary to the very purpose of the statutory requirement here,the parks service has already undertaken a increase in traffic preliminary to a percent increase.the potential effects of its action extend beyond the endangered marine mammal population to the rest of the wildlife at glacier bay,as well as the park air quality.kittiwakes,murrelet,eagles,sea otters,seals,sea lions,porpoises,and killer and minke whales,as well as the better known humpbacks,are affected.until an eis is prepared and the effects of increased vessel traffic on the inhabitants and air quality of glacier bay are properly examined,there is a sufficient possibility of environmental harm that the vmp may not be implemented.
westours argues that the damage to its business should be considered when addressing injunctive relief,that its financial losses outweigh the potential damage to the environment,and that npca is not entitled to an injunction against the seasonal cruise ship entries that the parks service authorized for the seasons.as a general rule,only the federal government may be a defendant in a nepa action.wetlands action network,at.an exception may be made in the remedial phase of a case where the contractual rights of the applicant are affected by the proposed remedy.see forest conservation council,at.here,westours was permitted to intervene,and appears before us as a.westours has asserted financial damages premised upon its contracts of carriage.its loss of anticipated revenues,however,does not outweigh the potential irreparable damage to the environment.moreover,neither westours nor those of its passengers who may be unable to view glacier bay at the time they originally planned have cause to claim surprise as a result of any injunction.the plaintiffs filed their objections to the plan approximately five years ago and just one year later sought an injunction.if the passengers who booked cruises on any excess tours were not warned by westours of the pending litigation,their interests were not well served by that company.thus,while westours has standing to object to our grant of injunctive relief,its evidence fails to tilt the balance of harms in its favor.
for the purposes of injunctive relief,we may admit evidence not before the district court to show that an agency has rectified a nepa violation after the onset of legal proceedings.see friends of the clearwater dombeck,cir.here,westours asks us to consider evidence addressing one aspect of npca complaint,the humpback whale population.we will assume that such evidence is admissible.westour evidence shows a short term increase in the humpback whale population,but completely fails to address the other environmental effects at issue here.nor does it address the deficiencies in the parks service ea and fonsi.accordingly,westours evidence is insufficient to dissuade us from granting injunctive relief.
finally,we note that where the question of injunctive relief raise s intensely factual issues,the scope of the injunction should be determined in the first instance by the district court.see alaska wilderness,at.here,however,there are no such intensely factual issues and the scope of the injunction to which npca is entitled is quite plain.it is appropriate,therefore,for us to decide the injunction question on this appeal.
we direct the district court to enjoin the further increases in vessel traffic,and to return traffic levels to their levels.we agree,however,with the parks service contention that the current vessel regulations are
