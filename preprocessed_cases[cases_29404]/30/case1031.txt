burlington northern santa fe railway company burlington petitions this court for a writ of mandamus to overturn the district court of montana discovery ruling,which orders burlington to produce documents to plaintiffs brian and ryann kapsner the kapsners in underlying environmental litigation in which burlington is the defendant.the writ is denied.
facts and procedural history 
the kapsners brought an action on july,against burlington in the district court of montana for the sixth judicial district park county for burlington alleged intentional dumping of diesel oil and toxic solvents,resulting in contamination of the kapsners land,and for burlington intentional failure to contain and remediate this damage.burlington removed to the united states district court for the district of montana on diversity grounds.the amended complaint seeks recovery for nuisance,negligence,strict liability,trespass,wrongful occupation,violations of the montana constitution,unjust enrichment,and misconduct warranting punitive damages.
discovery has been underway since november,when the kapsners served their first set of document requests pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure rule.the discovery process has been characterized by delay,misunderstandings,and increasing acrimony between the parties.burlington responded to the kapsners first set of document requests on december.however,this response was not accompanied by a privilege log.the record suggests that both parties intended and expected from the outset that a privilege log would in fact be produced.thus,while burlington accuses the kapsners of gamesmanship in failing to assert the argument that the privilege was waived in their original motion to compel,burlington does not seriously dispute that a privilege log was expected.
the kapsners objected to the form of burlington original response,which was not accompanied by documents but recited an invitation to inspect documents on burlington premises.the kapsners complained to burlington as early as january that the production was neither organized according to the categories in the discovery requests nor kept in the usual course of business,as required by rule,and instead was simply produced in boxes with no rhyme or reason.underlying these disagreements about form was the kapsners belief that responsive documents were being improperly withheld.on april,the kapsners filed a motion to compel,arguing that in addition to producing documents in an impermissible form,burlington was withholding responsive documents,and had made no assurance that its production exhausted the universe of responsive documents.
before the magistrate judge ruled on the motion,burlington produced a privilege log.the kapsners continued to suspect that burlington was withholding unprivileged responsive documents,and were apparently unsatisfied with this log,which they allege made it difficult to determine whether burlington was complying with its discovery obligations or asserting its privileges in good faith.the magistrate judge ordered burlington to organize its entire production to correspond to discovery requests,and to produce documents responsive to the kapsners requests as stated rather than as unilaterally limited by burlington.
the parties continued to wrangle over the privilege issue during the next fourteen months,as the kapsners issued additional discovery requests insisting that responsive documents continued to be withheld.during this time,burlington modified its privilege log several times,removing entirely some documents that were previously marked as responsive but privileged.in a letter to burlington,the kapsners again articulated their position that unprivileged responsive documents were being withheld,demanded voluntary production,and declared their intention to file another motion to compel if the documents were not produced.after burlington refused to produce the contested documents,the kapsners filed a second motion to compel,this time demanding all responsive documents withheld from production on privilege grounds.the magistrate judge granted the motion,and upon appeal to the district judge,his order was upheld burlington then brought this petition for a writ of mandamus to overturn the district court order.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy limited to extraordinary causes.cheney dist.court,d.in order to gain the benefit of the writ,the party must have no other recourse the right to the writ must be clear and indisputable and the appellate court must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.id.at.distilling the court mandamus caselaw,the ninth circuit has articulated this standard in terms of a test,asking whether there are no other adequate means,such as direct appeal,to secure relief failure to grant the writ would result in damage to petitioner that is not correctable on appeal the district court order is clearly erroneous as a matter of law the order represents an error or patent disregard of the federal rules and the order raises new and important problems or legal issues of first impression.bauman dist.court,cir see also admiral ins.dist.court,cir applying the bauman factors.not every factor need be present at once indeed,the fourth and fifth will rarely be present at the same time.id.at.however,the absence of the third factor,clear error,is dispositive.see,gallo dist.court,cir,cert.denied,d.
thus,we review the district court order for clear error as a matter of law.in the present case,this standard is informed by the general principle,not unique to the mandamus context,that d istrict courts have wide latitude in controlling discovery.united states ex rel.aflatooni kitsap physicians,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because we hold that there was no clear error,we do not reach the remaining bauman factors.
proper assertion of privilege 
burlington argues that the district court erred as a matter of law by reading into federal rule of civil procedure b rule b and rule a per se rule that failure to produce a privilege log in a timely manner triggers waiver of privileges.while we reject the per se waiver rule,we affirm the district court order on the ground that the factual circumstances put the result well outside the realm of clear error.
the district court agreed with the kapsners that defendant waived its privilege objections by failing to provide a privilege log at the time it served its discovery responses.two propositions are embedded in the district court assertion,when read in the context of the decision as a whole that a general,boilerplate assertion of an evidentiary privilege in response to a discovery request does not satisfy the demands of rule b and rule,read together,and is not a proper assertion of the privilege and that the effect of untimeliness in properly asserting the privilege is to waive or otherwise abandon the privilege.
