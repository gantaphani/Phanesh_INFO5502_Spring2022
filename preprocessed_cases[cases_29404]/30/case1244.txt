the center for native ecosystems,the biodiversity conservation alliance,and the forest guardians collectively cne appeal the district court order denying a petition for review of the united states forest service authorization of livestock grazing in medicine bow national forest.cne first contends that the forest service violated a of the endangered species act,a,because its consultation with the united states fish and wildlife service fws after the designation of portions of the forest as critical habitat for the preble meadow jumping mouse preble mouse failed to consider how grazing in the mouse critical habitat would affect its recovery,and it must reinitiate consultation with the fws regarding the effects of grazing on the mouse itself because grazing has exceeded previously established limits.cne also contends that the forest service has violated a of the clean water act because it has not complied with wyoming requirements in the same manner,and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity,a.the pole mountain cattlemen association,the wyoming stock growers association,the wyoming farm bureau federation,and the laramie county farmers union collectively the cattlemen association,along with the wyoming association of conservation districts,intervened in the proceeding as defendants in support of the forest service actions.the state of wyoming,the pacific legal foundation,and the national association of home builders in conjunction with the american forest and paper association have filed amicus briefs supporting various aspects of the forest service actions.we have jurisdiction under and affirm the district court decision.
background 
a.the pole mountain area in medicine bow national forest 
the forest service has long permitted livestock grazing in the pole mountain area of medicine bow national forest,near laramie,wyoming.under federal regulations the forest service may allow grazing on national forest land by issuing an allotment management plan,and grazing or permits,id.a.the allotment management plan must be consistent with the land management plan for the area,id.c,which in this case is the medicine bow national forest and thunder basin national grassland land and resource management plan the forest plan,issued in october.
the pole mountain allotment management plan allows grazing of up to cattle and sheep during an annual season from june to october.it divides pole mountain into eight livestock allotments,seven of which are used for grazing.it also adopts certain best management practices for grazing,including a prohibition on grazing in a pasture,standards limiting the utilization of forage by livestock,and the use of a grazing system in which only one pasture in an allotment will be grazed at a time and the order in which the pastures are used will be rotated each grazing season.aplts.app.vol.at.such practices are outlined in a publication of the wyoming department of environmental quality entitled grazing best management practices.aplees.jt.supp.app.vol.at.
grazing permits,which generally are for a term,c,were issued for the seven pole mountain allotments in.they identify the maximum number of livestock and maximum length of grazing season for each allotment.they also explain that they can 
be cancelled,in whole or in part,or otherwise modified,at any time during the term to conform with needed changes brought about by law,regulation,executive order,allotment management plans,land management planning,numbers permitted or seasons of use necessary because of resource conditions,or the lands described otherwise being unavailable for grazing.
aplees.jt.supp.app.vol.at.the permits explicitly incorporate the allotment management plan into their terms.
the limits set by the allotment management plan and permits on the length of the grazing season and number of permissible livestock may be altered by annual operating instructions issued by the forest service to grazing permittees.annual operating instructions are not required by any statute or regulation but the forest service handbook for the rocky mountain region contemplates their use and describes their function they specify the annual actions necessary to implement the forest service decision to authorize grazing in a particular area.they identify the obligations of the permittee and the forest service,articulate annual grazing management requirements and standards,and set forth the monitoring necessary to document compliance.aplts.app.vol.at.they also take into account developments,such as a drought,occurring after issuance of the allotment management plan and accordingly specify the maximum amount of grazing authorized for a particular allotment,the precise sequence of grazing on the allotment,and any other standards the permittee must follow that year when grazing.
facts related to claims under the endangered species act 
in the fws added the preble mouse,which resided in areas of pole mountain where grazing was authorized,to the list.see fed.reg.may.the fws action triggered a of the endangered species act esa,a,which generally requires federal this case the forest consult with the fws,on behalf of the secretary of the interior,to insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined to be critical.for some species,federal agencies are required to consult with the national marine fisheries service on behalf of the secretary of commerce,instead of the fws.see ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d b.that is not the case here.
following the designation,the forest service began preparing revisions to the pole mountain allotment management plan.as it explained at the time,one of the reasons for doing so was to i ncorporate mitigation measures designed to protect sensitive and threatened and endangered species into the pole mountain allotment management plan.aplees.jt.supp.app.vol.at.at the same time,the forest service sought to satisfy its consultation obligation under a.fws regulations provide that an agency consultation obligation may be satisfied through either formal or informal consultation,depending on the agency determination of the possible effect on the species or habitat at issue.if the agency action may affect the species or habitat,a,formal consultation is generally required.if,however,as a result of the preparation of a biological assessment or as a result of informal consultation with the fws,the agency determines,with the written concurrence of the fws,that the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect the species or habitat,id.b,formal consultation is not necessary,a,a.
in recognition of its esa consultation obligation,the forest service completed a biological assessment the ba analyzing the effects on the preble mouse of the proposed revisions to the allotment management plan.the ba identified nine management requirements and mitigation measures designed to ensure the conservation of the mouse.aplts.app.vol.at see id.at ba there currently exists adequate forest plan standards and guidelines to allow for both livestock grazing in riparian areas and species conservation.these measures were 
in areas where documented jumping mouse populations exist,grazing management will maintain or enhance vegetative habitat characteristics for the jumping mouse.
prohibit grazing in riparian pastures.
implement winter grazing or short duration spring or late fall grazing where possible to insure seed production for jumping mouse forage during the majority of the grazing season.
implement total rest in riparian pastures with deteriorated range where conditions are not likely to improve with livestock grazing.
remove livestock from grazing units when average stubble heights on carex species reach to inches in spring or winter use pastures and to inches in pastures.
remove livestock from the grazing unit when streambank disturbance trampling,exposed soils,from current years livestock grazing reaches to percent of the key area stream reach.
limit utilization of woody plants to to percent of current animal growth.
control the length of grazing period in spring use riparian pastures to minimize utilization of.this is normally to days.
limit utilization of herbaceous species to to percent.
id.at.the ba also stated that l trend monitoring shall be conducted in representative riparian community types on a to year cycle to determine effectiveness of the mitigation measures.id.at.it provided that these measures would be added to the grazing permits.the ba concluded that w ith the implementation of the mitigation measures and monitoring,grazing was not likely to adversely affect the mouse or its habitat.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
on september,the fws concurred with the ba conclusion that the revisions,as described,are not likely to adversely affect preble mouse.id.at see b formal consultation not required if,as a result of the preparation of a biological assessment or as a result of informal consultation with the fws,the agency determines,with the written concurrence of the fws,that the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect any listed species or critical habitat.on october,the forest service informed the fws that the appropriate standard for the ninth mitigation measure listed in the ba should be rather than this change was necessary to ensure that the ba was consistent with the forest plan,which provided that utilization on allotments,aplts.app.vol.at,was to be limited to and that utilization levels could not exceed an amount above the limit.this results in a total permissible utilization rate of.on october,the fws,having been advised of the proper standard,once again concur red with the forest service assessment that the project,as described,is not likely to adversely affect preble.id.at.the same day,the forest service issued a decision notice and finding of no significant impact for the revisions to the pole mountain allotment management plan.it added two mitigation measures to the nine that were previously identified in the ba 
require the maintenance of a inch stubble height of sedges and rushes in all riparian areas within grazing allotments.
prior to weed spraying or other vegetation management activities burning,analyses will be conducted and biological evaluations will be prepared.
id.at.it then concluded that the revisions would not cause significant environmental effects and that no further environmental review was necessary.id.at.in particular,the revisions of the plan may a ffect but were not likely to adversely affect the preble meadow jumping mouse or its habitat.id.at.
the following year,the forest service issued grazing permits for each of the seven allotments the permits incorporated the pole mountain allotment management plan and established the maximum number of livestock and season of use for each allotment.as explained above,they also provided that the forest service may alter the grazing season and livestock numbers to meet the objectives of the allotment management plan and the forest plan.apparently there were no administrative appeals after the permits were issued,and annual operating instructions were later issued each year for each allotment.
in june the fws designated certain areas of pole mountain as critical habitat for the preble mouse,june.this critical habitat,the fws notice explained,consisted of those areas identified as essential to the mouse conservation.id.at.the notice defined conservation as the use of all methods and procedures that are necessary to bring the mouse to the point at which listing under the endangered species act is no longer necessary,rather than merely measures ensuring its survival and preventing extinction.the fws incorporated into the mouse designation and conservation strategy certain analysis from a working draft of a recovery plan for the mouse,which describe d actions considered necessary for its conservation,establish ed criteria for downlisting or delisting the species,and estimate d time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.id.at.the portion of the preble mouse critical habitat in pole mountain was designated to address two of three small recovery populations called for in our conservation strategy.id.at.it began along the eastern boundary of pole mountain and included roughly miles of streams in the north pasture and horse creek allotments.critical habitat extended feet from each side of these streams.id.at.
in the forest service prepared a new biological assessment the ba analyzing the effects of a proposed revision to the forest plan on endangered species,including the mouse,and their critical habitats in the area.it concluded that t here is no evidence of detrimental effects of livestock grazing on preble meadow jumping mouse,if the grazing meets plan standards.aplees.jt.supp.app.vol.at.the ba added that t he assumption that current regulation of livestock grazing provides conditions compatible with the recovery of the preble meadow jumping mouse will be tested in a study of the effects of grazing and fire on preble meadow jumping mouse.id.initially,it also found that the proposed plan provision for prescribed fires was likely to adversely affect mice and their critical habitat.after formal consultation,however,the fws concluded that the planned prescribed fires were not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the mouse or adversely modify its critical habitat.
on march,cne and others submitted to the forest service a notice of intent to file suit.they contended in part that s ince the designation of critical habitat for the mouse,the forest service ha d not yet addressed how the designation affect ed domestic livestock grazing in the pole mountain unit.aplts.app.vol.at.it added that b y failing to prepare a new biological assessment to address impacts to preble meadow jumping mouse critical habitat and by failing to reinitiate formal consultation with the fws,the forest service was violating the endangered species act.id.at.
shortly thereafter the forest service met with the fws to review the ba.as the forest service said at the time,its review considered the following developments 
designation of preble meadow jumping mouse critical habitat within pole mountain grazing allotments.
new livestock and grazing standards and guidelines in the revised forest plan.
results of forage utilization monitoring in preble habitat.
ongoing drought conditions since.
aplts.app.vol.at.among the review observations was that levels specified in the ba had been exceeded in certain key areas within allotments where vegetation was specifically sampled.id.at.a later forest service report,apparently quoting a forest service publication,defines key areas as a portion of the range,which,because of its location,grazing or browsing value,use,serves as an indicative sample of range conditions,trend,or degree of use seasonally.a key area guides the general management of the entire area of which it is part.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the review added,however,that these measurements had been taken in the hardest grazed areas of a pasture with the intention that,if we protect these areas,the rest of the drainage is in fairly good condition.as a result,exceedance of utilization standards in a key area does not indicate that utilization was exceeded across the entire pasture or riparian.id.at.the review noted that the ba had not clarif ied if utilization standards are to be met at a pasture level,on average across the allotments,or within each key area measured,and therefore recommended that a supplement to the biological assessment should,among other things,i dentify the monitoring protocol used to evaluate e ffects to preble mouse and their habitat.id.at.
the informal consultation between the forest service and the fws resulted in a december,update to the ba.the update reviewed the nine mitigation measures identified in the ba and the two mitigation measures added in the decision notice and finding of no significant impact,which had found that the revisions would not cause significant environmental effects.these mitigation measures,according to the update,had been thought to be important to the conservation of the preble mouse and its habitat.id.at.the update analyzed forage utilization by considering the average rate of utilization for all key areas within a given allotment.it explained 
by design,utilization cages were established in the most heavily grazed areas of a pasture with the intention that,if we protect these areas,the rest of the drainage would be in fairly good condition.as a result,higher utilization in a key area does not indicate that utilization was exceeded across the entire riparian area,pasture or allotment.
id.at.the update concluded that standards were being met as of.average utilization exceeded in only one allotment,north pasture,where it was,still within the permissible limit.furthermore,the only three key areas in pole mountain within the preble mouse critical habitat all had permissible rates of utilization.the update observed that the mitigation measures were accomplished as of,leading to a stable or improving trend in riparian areas.these areas provide the mainstay of preble habitat and are most important to conservation of the species.id.at.in light of this analysis,the forest service determined that t he effects occurring to preble mouse from current grazing practices are the same as those considered in the ba.id.at.
consistent with the december update,on december,the forest service concluded that grazing in pole mountain was n ot l ikely to a dversely a ffect c ritical habitat for the preble mouse.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.it made no determination,however,whether grazing would adversely affect the mouse,an issue that had previously been addressed in the ba.in reaching its conclusion regarding the mouse critical habitat,the forest service summarized the information in the december update,observing in particular that utilization in the horse creek allotment and the north pasture allotment which contain critical habitat was within forest plan standards.id.at.on january,the fws concurred with the forest service conclusion regarding the effects of grazing on critical habitat.it based its concurrence on information from the forest service,including that there was appropriate utilization meeting the forest plan standards within the allotments.id.at.
facts related to claim under the clean water act 
in the pole mountain area began suffering from a drought.consequently,by the forest service was advising grazing permittees of the need to make operational adjustments.the annual operating instructions aois instituted moderate reductions in the amount of authorized grazing.through a combination of the aois reductions and apparently voluntary adjustments by permittees,cattle grazing in pole mountain was reduced by from the maximum allowed under the permits.
in october the wyoming department of environmental quality wdeq found that at one of three tested locations in pole branch north fork crow creek,in the crow creek state standard for fecal coliform was exceeded.see.code weil standard.the level of coliform bacteria is used as an indicator of possible sewage contamination because they are commonly found in human and animal feces and suggest the presence of pathogenic bacteria,viruses,and protozoans.see envtl.prot.agency,what are fecal bacteria and why are they important,available at.html.the forest service was notified of the wdeq finding in november.
for the grazing season,aois for pole mountain allotments further reduced the amount of authorized grazing.in crow creek,where the high fecalcoliform readings had been taken,the aois authorized only animal months of grazing,significantly less than the animal months allowed under the grazing permits and the animal months allowed under the aois.ultimately there were only actual animal months of grazing in crow creek in,a reduction from the amount allowed under the grazing permits.overall,cattle grazing in pole mountain was lower than that allowed under the permits.
the wdeq took more samples in.samples in the spring showed no excessive levels of fecal coliform fall samples,however,revealed excessive levels once again at north branch north fork crow creek in the crow creek allotment and now also at middle crow creek in the green mountain allotment.as a result,in the state of wyoming added these stream areas to its clean water act cwa list of waters not meeting state standards.see d.the cwa requires states to prioritize all waters not meeting state standards,taking into account the severity of the pollution and the uses to be made of such waters.d a.the prioritization identifies those waters for which the state will first calculate the maximum daily load of pollutants that the body of water can accept without violating standards.see id.d c i definition of total maximum daily load id.f water loading capacity is greatest amount of pollutant it can receive without violating standards.this process can take several years.see id.b the priority ranking shall specifically include the identification of waters targeted for total maximum daily load development in the next two years.the stream areas in pole mountain were given a low priority for development of these standards.wdeq justified this low prioritization on the ground that the water quality in these areas was to be addressed by the crow creek watershed steering committee,which was comprised of conservation districts,officials,and various interest groups.
also in the forest service prepared a water quality action plan identifying the measures that it would take to ensure that water quality in the impaired stream segments of the north branch north fork crow creek and middle crow creek will consistently meet wyoming state deq standards.aplees.jt.supp.app.vol.at.it once again reduced stock numbers from the maximums allowed under the permits by limiting authorization for grazing in the aois for the crow creek and green mountain allotments.the aois for crow creek authorized only animal months of grazing compared to the specified in the grazing permits and the authorized in the aois.the aois for green mountain authorized animal months of grazing compared to the specified in the grazing permits and in the aois.ultimately,grazing in the crow creek allotment was lower than that allowed under the permits,and grazing in the green mountain allotment was lower.
at the end of the grazing season,only one location,north branch north fork crow creek,exceeded standards,although the level was less than of that in.the forest service and conservation districts entered into a memorandum of understanding to amend the crow creek watershed plan to address the high bacteria levels in the area.as the memorandum explains,the watershed plan would identify potential pollution sources and identify practices intended to improve water quality.id.vol.at.
proceedings 
on november,cne filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of colorado,naming the forest service and rick cables,regional forester for region,as defendants.on december,the forest service submitted to the fws its update to the ba.in an amended complaint,also filed on december,and a petition for review,cne challenged the forest service actions under two statutes.first,it claimed that the forest service violated a of the endangered species act,a,because its consultation on critical habitat did not consider the effect of grazing on the mouse recovery,but only on its survival and it had not reinitiated consultation regarding grazing effect on the mouse itself even though there had been violations in multiple key areas of the standards in the ba.second,it claimed that the forest service violated a of the cwa,a,because levels in the pole mountain area exceeded wyoming standards.the cattlemen association and the wyoming association of conservation districts intervened as defendants.the forest service and the intervenors moved to dismiss the complaint on multiple grounds,including lack of final agency action.the district court denied the motions on september.
the district court denied cne petition for review of agency action on january.on the claims under the endangered species act,the court ruled that the forest service consultations were reasonable.as to the claim under the cwa,it said that the forest service appears to be complying with state water quality standards to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity and accordingly concluded that a was satisfied.aplts.app.vol.at order on pet.for review,internal quotation marks omitted.final judgment was entered on february.

standard of review 
cne claims in this case are governed by the administrative procedure act apa.see bennett spear,d claim under reviewed under apa.natural res.council forest,cir judicial review of claim under apa is appropriate.although o ur standard of review of the lower court decision in an apa case is de novo,cattle growers ass fish wildlife,cir,the apa narrows the scope of our review of an agency actions,see id.under the apa we set aside the agency action only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
the duty of a court reviewing agency action under the arbitrary and capricious standard is to ascertain whether the agency examined the relevant data and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the decision made.in reviewing the agency explanation,the reviewing court must determine whether the agency considered all relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.

endangered species act claim 
cne challenges the adequacy of the forest service consultation with the fws after the preble mouse critical habitat was designated in.cne first contends that the forest service violated the endangered species act esa because its consultation with the fws considered only how livestock grazing in the mouse critical habitat would affect its survival or preservation and not how the grazing would affect its recovery.cne also contends that the forest service failed to reinitiate consultation on the effects of grazing on the mouse itself,even though the standards identified in the ba had been violated in multiple key areas.we reject both contentions.
cne argues that the forest service consultation after designation of critical habitat violated the esa because it did not consider how livestock grazing in critical habitat would impact the mouse recovery and therefore did not satisfy the basic legal requirement of section of the esa.aplts.br.at.it asserts that agencies must insure that actions not only prevent the extinction of species but also allow for the recovery of the species,that is,allow the species to increase sufficiently in population that it can be removed from the list of endangered or threatened species an action referred to as delisting,see d.
we agree with cne interpretation of the law governing this case.section a of the esa,a,describes a federal agency duty to consult 
each federal agency shall,in consultation with and with the assistance of the secretary of the interior,see,insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the secretary of the interior,after consultation as appropriate with affected states,to be critical 
the forest service is thus obligated to insure,through consultation with the fws on behalf of the secretary of the interior,that its action is not likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of the preble mouse critical habitat.fws regulations explain that it may satisfy this obligation through either formal or informal consultation.as a general matter,formal consultation is required when agency action may affect listed species or critical habitat.a.an agency may forgo formal consultation,however,if it engages in informal consultation with the fws and determines,with the written concurrence of the fws,that even if the proposed action may affect listed species or critical habitat,it is not likely to adversely affect any listed species or critical habitat,id.b.informal consultation includes all discussions,correspondence,between the fws and the federal agency.id.a.
although neither a nor the consultation regulations expressly describe what must be considered by a federal agency during consultation on critical habitat,the esa definitions clarify the matter.in relevant part the definition of critical habitat is the specific areas within the geographical area occupied by the species,at the time it is listed,on which are found those physical or biological features i essential to the conservation of the species and ii which may require special management considerations or protection.a i emphasis added.thus,critical habitat is impaired when features essential to the species conservation are impaired.the definition of conservation is found in,which states that it mean s to use and the use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring any endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this chapter are no longer necessary.under this definition,conservation encompasses recovery.see also.at incorporating information from preble mouse recovery plan,which describes the actions necessary for conservation of the species,into designation of critical habitat.it follows that critical habitat is adverse ly modif ied by actions that adversely affect a species recovery and the ultimate goal of delisting 
accordingly,we agree with cne view of what the forest service was required to do section a requires federal agencies,when considering the effect of their actions on a species critical habitat,to consider the effect of those actions on the species recovery.contrary to cne contention,however,we read the record as showing that the forest service did what was required.as the forest service points out on appeal,after the critical habitat for the preble mouse was designated in june,it did in fact consider recovery when it considered the effect of grazing on the conservation of the preble mouse.
in,shortly after cne notice to file suit was submitted,the forest service met with the fws to review the ba because of several interim developments,including d esignation of preble mouse critical habitat within pole mountain grazing allotments.aplts.app.vol.at.the area of pole mountain identified as the preble mouse critical habitat in had been expressly designated to address two of three small recovery populations called for in the fws conservation strategy.at emphasis added.as the fws official notice of designation explained restoring an endangered or threatened species to the point where it is recovered is a primary goal of our endangered species program.id.at.in light of the purpose of the of the is hard to see how the forest service review in,and the fws ultimate concurrence with the conclusions of that review,could have been directed at anything but recovery.
in any event,the review undeniably considered recovery by considering conservation.on december,the forest service sent to the fws for concurrence the report by its wildlife biologist determining that livestock grazing,as described in the pole mountain amps and implemented annually,is not likely to adversely affect critical habitat for the preble mouse.aplts.app.at.that report relied on prior reports,including the forest service december,update to the ba.the update,which reviewed the previously identified mitigation measures,stated that measures considered in the ba and again in the update were important to the conservation of preble meadow jumping mice and their habitat.aplts.app.vol.at.most importantly,the update conclusions addressed conservation.after a detailed review of the measures,the update concluded that they were satisfied,leading to a stable or improving trend in riparian areas.these areas provide the mainstay of preble habitat and are most important to conservation of the species.id.at emphasis added.and the update plan of action was also directed at conservation.to counteract recent indications of more intense grazing pressure in some areas of preble mouse habitat,said the update,the forest service was taking additional actions,including reduced stocking,increased herding apparently referring to movement of livestock,and pasture rotation adjustments in order to continue to provide the necessary conservation measures for preble mouse.id.at emphasis added.accordingly,it is clear that the forest service had considered the conservation of preble mouse when it forwarded the update to the fws on december,and stated its determination that livestock grazing is not likely to adversely affect critical habitat for the preble mouse,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,and the fws likewise had considered conservation when it concurred in writing on january.
cne nevertheless claims that implicit consideration of recovery violates basic apa judicial review principles.aplts.reply br.at.we assume that cne argument is targeted at the forest service alleged failure to use the word recovery in the update to the ba.but,as noted above,the esa itself speaks only in terms of conservation,not recovery.it states that critical habitat is habitat essential to the conservation of the species,a i emphasis added,and that conservation is the methods and procedures which are necessary to allow the species to recover to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to the esa are no longer necessary,id.we can not fault the forest service for employing the statutory term.criticism would be more justifiable if it did not.for this reason,cne reliance on gifford pinchot,at,is unavailing.in that case the ninth circuit rejected the forest service position because it had failed to consider explicitly either recovery or conservation.see id.at.that is not a problem here.
cne also insists that the forest service could not have considered recovery because its consultation on critical habitat addressed no issues that it had not considered in when it consulted on the species itself.but the questions to be answered on the two occasions are intimately related,so it would not be surprising that the same considerations would control the answers.we find it significant that cne never identifies for us any particular issue or factor relevant to recovery of the mouse that the forest service failed to consider in.in short,the forest service consideration of the effect of grazing on the conservation of the preble mouse complied with a.see a.
cne argues that the forest service did not adequately raise below the ground on which we rely to affirm the district court ruling.in a footnote in its,and without citation to the record,it asserts that the forest service did not argue to the district court that it did address recovery in this process,but rather that it need not consider recovery.aplts.br.at.but even if the assertion is correct,we may affirm a judgment on any ground appearing from the record so long as the litigants had a fair opportunity to develop the record,see garrison gambro,cir,and to address the ground on which we rely,see gomes wood,cir.the purpose of requiring presentation of the issue in the lower court is to ensure that litigants may not be surprised on appeal by final decision there of issues upon which they have had no opportunity to introduce evidence or to present whatever legal arguments they may have.anixter,cir ellipsis,brackets,and internal quotation marks omitted.there is no unfairness here.first,because judicial review is based on the administrative record,see,we doubt that cne could have introduced further evidence on the matter,and it does not suggest otherwise.and second,cne had ample opportunity to present its legal arguments in its briefs and at oral argument to this court.indeed,its appellate opening brief argues that the forest service had not considered recovery.
in sum,we conclude that the forest service analysis of the effect of its actions on the conservation of the mouse,and the fws concurrence with that analysis,satisfied a requirement that recovery be considered.
cne next contends that the forest service has violated the ba standard for pole mountain and that the violations require reinitiation of consultation to consider the effects of the allegedly excessive forage utilization on preble mouse.see defining circumstances in which reinitiation of consultation is required.although in the forest service informally consulted with the fws regarding the effects of grazing on the mouse critical habitat,the fws concurrence at the end of this consultation did not explicitly address the effects of grazing on the mouse itself,a topic that had originally been addressed in the ba.cne claims that the forest service must reinitiate consultation regarding the effects of grazing on the mouse either because new information reveal ed effects of the action that may affect listed species in a manner or to an extent not previously considered,id.b,or because the identified action was subsequently modified in a manner that cause d an effect to the listed species that was not considered in the biological opinion,id.c.
we do not agree.paragraphs b and c of both require reinitiation of consultation only when the effects to species that are revealed or caused are different from those effects previously considered.see,june,c show s that changes to the action that do not cause effects different from or additional to those considered in the biological opinion will not require reinitiation of formal consultation.but here the forest service found just the opposite.in its december,update to the ba,it reviewed the mitigation measures designed to minimize the effect of grazing on preble mouse.in doing so it measured forage utilization in each allotment in pole mountain by averaging the utilization rates for the key areas within the allotment.under this approach it found that the maximum rate of was not exceeded in any allotment,and that,as a result,t he effects occurring to preble mouse from current grazing practices are the same as those considered in the ba.aplts.app.vol.at emphasis added.its decision not to reinitiate consultation,see b,c,thus did not violate the esa.
the ninth circuit decision in forest guardians johanns,cir,is not contrary to our conclusion.in forest guardians the court held that t he material inadequacy of the forest service utilization monitoring and the results of the limited measurements that were taken constituted modifications to the allotment land management plan that affected listed species in a manner and to an extent not previously considered.id.at.it explained its holding as follows 
we do not hold that each isolated instance in which the forest service deviated from the allotment guidance criteria on which the fws concurrence in the not likely to adversely affect finding was premised required the agency to consultation.the forest service arguments to the contrary notwithstanding,the case before us is not comprised of infrequent and insignificant deviations.rather,the undisputed facts are that the guidance criteria expressly stated that the utilization levels specified by the land management plan were necessary to protect the species in a particular grazing allotment,the forest service regularly failed to meet the monitoring requirements on which the not likely to adversely affect determination for those species was premised,and the evidence that the forest service did obtain as a result of its deficient monitoring suggested that maximum permissible utilization levels were being exceeded.in light of these facts,the forest service failure to consultation violated the esa.
id.at.we agree that reinitiation of consultation would be required if the fws concurrence in a not likely to adversely affect finding expressly required utilization levels to be met in order for the concurrence to remain valid,utilization levels were not monitored as specified by the fws,and the monitoring that was conducted showed excess utilization.in that event,the forest service could not properly assert that the effects to species were not different from those previously considered.but that is not the circumstance here.as we shall show,neither the second nor the third condition has been met the forest service has not failed to monitor utilization in pole mountain,and utilization rates have not exceeded the ba standards.we express no opinion on whether compliance with the utilization rates was essential to the fws concurrence.and we need not decide whether reinitiation of consultation would be required if just conditions and or conditions and were satisfied.
we first address utilization rates.cne acknowledges that the forest service determined in that standards were being met so that the effects of grazing on the mouse were the same as those considered in the ba.it claims,however,that this determination was the result of an arbitrary change in the way that the forest service analyzed forage utilization.it contends that after its complaint was filed the forest service shifted from considering utilization in each key area separately to averaging utilization in all key areas in an allotment,and that this change allowed the forest service to avoid finding that forage utilization in pole mountain in exceeded standards.we are not persuaded.
to begin with,the mitigation measures in the ba do not refer specifically to key areas.the ba specified only that the forest service was to l imit utilization of herbaceous species to to percent.aplts.app.vol.at.later that year,to ensure that the mitigation measures were consistent with the forest plan,the forest service,with the fws concurrence,changed the permissible level of forage utilization to.the forest plan had previously specified that utilization on allotments was not to exceed an amount greater than the permissible utilization rate,id.at,thus setting the actual upper limit at.although cne is correct that the forest service uses key areas to measure forage utilization,the ba did not give utilization rates independent significance.rather,data,according to a forest service publication,serves as an indicative sample of range conditions,trend,or degree of use seasonally.a key area guides the general management of the entire area of which it is part id.vol.at internal quotation marks omitted.the forest service recognized that excessive utilization in one key area of several in an allotment was not representative of range conditions across the entire allotment.the december update to the ba explained 
by design,utilization cages were established in the most heavily grazed areas of a pasture with the intention that,if we protect these areas,the rest of the drainage would be in fairly good condition.as a result,higher utilization in a key area does not indicate that utilization was exceeded across the entire riparian area,pasture or allotment.
localized areas of high grass utilization does necessarily mean that there is a loss or decline of riparian condition.this lack of connection is shown by the facts that despite localized areas of high grass utilization,forest service monitoring does not show an overall change in vegetation type or a downward trend in stream stability.the monitoring does show an improving trend in shrub density,vigor,and recruitment.
id.at see id.at in the pole mountain area,other indicators of riparian health heights of shrubs and carex demonstrate a stable or improving trend in habitat.consequently,the forest service measured utilization by averaging rates for all key areas within a particular allotment,on the ground that this would be more accurate.
as for cne contention that such averaging had not been used before,there is evidence to the contrary,and,in any event,the forest service was not bound to continue its practice.the forest plan explained that the focus of monitoring was to determine utilization of forage on allotments,id.vol.at emphasis added,and said nothing about key areas.furthermore,the forest service communication with the fws,in which it sought concurrence with its not likely to adversely affect finding,explained that the standard helped guide how it manage d the allotments on pole mountain,id.at emphasis added.if it is utilization on the allotment that is important,one can infer that the proper measure is the average utilization throughout the allotment,from which it inevitably follows that the utilization on some portions will exceed the average and on some will fall below.such averaging can be found in a environmental assessment of the revisions to the pole mountain allotment management plan,which lists utilization rates in each key area and then states the average in each allotment.thus,the forest service apparently had used such averages for several years.and nothing within the ba suggests that utilization needed to be evaluated separately for each key area.
on the other hand,we recognize that there is some doubt concerning whether averaging was to be used in assessing forage utilization.as noted in a report supplementing a environmental assessment of the revisions to the pole mountain allotment management plan,the amended ba and consultation do not clarify if utilization standards and guidelines are to be met at a pasture level,on average across the allotments,or within each key area measured.id.vol.at.thus,the use of averaging may have constituted a change in methodology.but even if averaging was initiated in,change is not forbidden.an agency is not bound by its prior position.the law does not require an agency to stand by its initial policy decisions in all circumstances.exxon lujan,cir.changes in policy can be upheld when such change is explained with a reasoned analysis.see id.and in evaluating whether the analysis is reasoned,we must defer to the agency expertise.see wyoming united states,cir d eference to agency action is appropriate where that action implicates scientific and technical judgments within the scope of agency expertise.internal quotation marks omitted custer county action ass garvey,cir t he agency,not a reviewing court,is entrusted with the responsibility of considering the various modes of scientific evaluation and theory and choosing the one appropriate for the given circumstances.brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.as the above discussion demonstrates,the forest service has provided a reasoned basis for concluding that a single utilization rate may be misleading and that its averaging methodology is the proper measure of forage utilization in an allotment.
moreover,the fws accepted the validity of the forest service averaging methodology in january when it concurred in the not likely to adversely effect finding for the preble mouse critical habitat.the fws concurrence at that time was expressly based on the forest service finding that there was appropriate utilization meeting the forest plan standards that set a limit of within the allotments.aplts.app.vol.at.the forest service finding,in turn,relied on the averaging of key areas within each allotment.thus,the fws itself relied on the average rate of forage utilization within an allotment key areas to analyze the effects of grazing.the fws acceptance of the validity of this methodology for analyzing effects under the esa supports the conclusion that the methodology is hardly arbitrary.perhaps it is also worth observing that even without averaging,the utilization standard was not exceeded in in any of the three key areas within the critical habitat.
a second premise of forest the forest service monitoring of forage utilization had been deficient,at also not present in this case.cne claims that the forest service collection of data was inadequate because it was based on o cular e stimate s.aplts.app.vol.at.citing only to some annual operating instructions indicating that u tilization will be determined using the clipped plant weight method,id.at,and a report noting that in previous years the forest service had used ocular estimates in low budget years,id.at,cne asserts that q uantitative monitoring data is mandated by the agency own requirements.aplts.br.at.the record is to the contrary.the forest plan explains that t hree methods may be used to determine utilization on allotments.aplts.app.vol.at.one of these three standard procedures is visual estimates of grazing use.id.furthermore,the same report cited by cne explains that ocular estimates were the customary means of monitoring unless they revealed excessive utilization.as the report explains,if ocular estimates indicated that a key area was not exceeding utilization standards,additional data were not collected.id.vol.at.
the forest service conclusion that the effects of grazing were the same as those considered in was not arbitrary or capricious,and hence its determination that it need not reinitiate consultation on the effects of grazing on the preble mouse did not violate the esa.
clean water act 
cne next contends that the forest service issuance of annual operating instructions aois in and for grazing in the crow creek and green mountain allotments was arbitrary and capricious under the apa and violated the cwa because the forest service did not protect water quality in those allotments to the same extent as required of private parties under cwa a,a.section a provides in pertinent part 
each department,agency,or instrumentality of the executive,legislative,and judicial branches of the federal government engaged in any activity resulting,or which may result,in the discharge or runoff of pollutants shall be subject to,and comply with,all federal,state,interstate,and local requirements,administrative authority,and process and sanctions respecting the control and abatement of water pollution in the same manner,and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity 
we hold that issuance of the aois was lawful.before our discussion of the merits,however,we must first address a challenge to the district court jurisdiction to consider cne challenge.
jurisdiction 
the apa,under which cne cwa claim is brought,see.natural res.council forest,cir,limits judicial review not otherwise provided by statute to final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.in the district court cne identified the forest service issuance of aois for crow creek and green mountain as the basis for its cwa claim.the forest service and the wyoming association of conservation districts contend that the crow creek and green mountain aois issued in and for grazing in pole mountain do not constitute final agency action.as the forest service argues,i t is the grazing permits that grant permission to graze livestock on the allotments,aplees.service br.at,whereas aois are merely a tool for implementing the decisions made in the allotment management plan and permits,id.at.we disagree and hold that the aois are final agency action.
the apa defines agency action to include the whole or a part of an agency license.license is defined to include the whole or a part of an agency permit.id.the crow creek and green mountain aois are licenses because,as they expressly state,they are included as part of the previously issued grazing permits,aplts.app.vol.at.likewise,the green mountain and crow creek grazing permits identify the aois as a key source of management practices that are required of permittees and that are incorporated into the permits.as the permits explain,
the specific management practices required of the permittee,such as riding,salting,pasture rotations,herding,bedding,are incorporated into this permit through the approved allotment management plan amp and the annual operating instructions aoi.
the permittee grazing management practices will be in compliance with all applicable forest plan direction and management area standard s and guidelines.this direction and are incorporated into this permit through the approved amp and aoi.
id.vol.at crow creek emphasis added id.at green mountain.hence,the aois are agency action.
the crow creek and green mountain aois also constitute final action.under the supreme court decision in bennett spear,agency action is final if it satisfies two requirements first,the action must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.and second,the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted accord pennaco energy,dep t of interior,cir.the supreme court has interpreted the finality element in a pragmatic way.ftc standard oil of,d internal quotation marks omitted.if an agency has issued a definitive statement of its position,determining the rights and obligations of the parties,the agency action is final notwithstanding t he possibility of further proceedings in the agency on related issues,so long as judicial review at the time would not disrupt the administrative process.bell new jersey,d see also sierra club army corps of eng rs,cir sierra club peterson,cir groups challenge to program is not final agency action even though group identified particular timber sales because complaints filed in case indicated sales were simply examples of a general program of timber management the groups sought to challenge that included past,ongoing,and future timber sales.
as to bennett first prong,the aois are undoubtedly the consummation of the forest service decisionmaking process.they identify when grazing may begin and when it will end,and which pastures may be used at particular times.they serve as the forest service annual determinations regarding how much grazing will be allowed each season,for they explicitly distinguish between grazing that was permitted under the term grazing permit and grazing that is actually authorized for a particular grazing season.see,aplts.app.vol.at.the distinction between permitted grazing and authorized grazing is significant,because,as the facts before us illustrate,the differences between the two amounts may be substantial.and no further agency action is required to make the aoi binding on permittees.see bennett,at.
we recognize that an aoi may be described as a management tool for the forest service,and events during the grazing season such as a fire can require further modifications to what grazing is permitted.but aois are the last word before grazing begins and undoubtedly have clear and definite consequences for permittees,who need to make their plans based on what the aois authorize.in other words,aois ha ve a direct and immediate effect on the business of permittees,and immediate compliance with their terms is expected.standard oil of,at.ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,the issuance of the aois presents a legal issue fit for judicial resolution.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.we note that the forest service does not contend that the reason why the aois lack finality is that there may be revisions during the grazing season.
turning to the second prong of the bennett test,we note that the crow creek and green mountain aois are actions by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the forest service handbook for the rocky mountain region explains that aois should identify the obligations of the permittee and the forest service and clearly articulate annual grazing management requirements and standards.forest,forest service handbook rocky mountain region.among other things,an aoi sets forth t he maximum permissible grazing use authorized on the allotment for the current grazing season.id.if a permittee fails to comply with the maintenance standards and management practices outlined in the aois,its permit may be cancelled or suspended.see,aplts.app.vol.at crow creek grazing permit t his permit may be suspended or cancelled for failure to comply with any of the terms and conditions in parts,and hereof id.at part of grazing permit maintenance standards are identified annually in the aoi.id.at part of grazing permit the specific management practices required of the permittee are incorporated into this permit through the aoi.the aois accordingly satisfy bennett second prong.see also city of dania beach,fed.aviation,faa letter is a final order because,in part,it provides new marching orders about how air traffic will be managed at a particular airport.
