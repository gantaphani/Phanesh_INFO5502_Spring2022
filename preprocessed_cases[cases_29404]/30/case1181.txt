the defenders of wildlife defenders appeal from an order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of the secretary of the interior the secretary.the order upheld a decision by the secretary not to designate the horned lizard for protection as a threatened species under the endangered species act esa.et.we find that,in making that decision,the secretary both relied on an improper standard and failed to consider important factors relevant to the listing process.accordingly,we find her decision arbitrary and capricious and reverse the district court order.
background 
the endangered species act protects species of fish,wildlife and plants which the secretary identifies as either endangered or threatened.a species is endangered if it is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.similarly,a species is threatened if it is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
if the secretary decides that,based on the best scientific and commercial data available,one or more of five statutorily defined factors demonstrates that a species is endangered or threatened she must issue a proposed rule recommending that species for esa protection.b a.a period of public comment follows.within one year,the secretary must either publish a final rule designating the species for protection or,if she finds that available evidence does not justify the action,withdraw the proposed rule.a iii see also b a 
a.the horned lizard 
at issue in this case is the horned lizard phrynosoma mcallii the lizard,a small,cryptically colored iguanid that has adapted to the harsh conditions of the western sonoran desert.it has the typically flattened body shape of horned lizards,a dark stripe,a somewhat flattened tail,relatively long head spines or horns,and two rows of fringed scales on each side of the body.dorsally,the horned lizard is pale gray to light rusty brown the animal ventral surface is white and unmarked.id.
the lizard natural habitat stretches across parts of southern california namely,imperial and eastern san diego counties,southwestern arizona and northwestern mexico.id.at.over the last century,human activity has markedly affected this habitat.the filling of the salton sea,the conversion of arid desert into productive agricultural land,and the development of urban areas around yuma,arizona and el centro,california have resulted in the disappearance of approximately of the lizard historic range.id.as a result,animal conservation groups,including defenders,have expressed concerns about the lizard continued viability,and the united states fish and wildlife service fws had targeted the lizard for esa protection for much of the past two decades,july.
b.the lizard listing history 
the secretary first identified the lizard as a category candidate for listing under the esa in.candidates are any species being considered by the secretary for listing as an endangered or threatened species,but not yet the subject of a proposed rule.b.at that time fws regulations defined candidates designated category as taxa for which information in the possession of the service indicated that proposing to list as endangered or threatened was possibly appropriate,but for which sufficient data on biological vulnerability and threats were not currently available to support proposed rules.
the lizard remained a category candidate until,when the secretary elevated it to category status.category included species for which the service has on file sufficient information on biological vulnerability and threat s to support issuance of a proposed rule.id.it was not until november,however,that the secretary finally published a proposed rule listing the lizard as a threatened species.at.pursuant to the statutory requirements,the secretary should have completed her review of the lizard and issued her final order by november.b a i requiring action within one year of publication of the proposed rule.that day passed,however,without further action by the secretary.
the passage of public law,stat,in april interrupted progress on the lizard and other species awaiting listing decisions.although the statute primary purpose was to replenish funds for various overseas military operations,it included a rider that withdrew million from the amounts available to the fws for making determinations about whether a species is a threatened or endangered species and whether habitat is critical habitat under the endangered species act of.id.furthermore,the rider provided that 
none of the remaining funds appropriated under the endangered species act may be made available for making a final determination that a species is threatened or endangered or that habitat constitutes a critical habitat except a final determination that a species previously determined to be endangered is no longer endangered but continues to be threatened.
to the extent that the endangered species act of has been interpreted or applied in any court order including an order approving a settlement between the parties to a civil action to require the making of a determination respecting any number of species or habitats by a date certain,that act shall not be applied to require that the determination be made by that date if the making of the determination is made impracticable by the recission made by the preceding sentence.
see also environmental defense center babbitt,cir discussing the impact of public law.thus,while the rider did not directly repeal the esa,it imposed a virtual moratorium on all species listings.id.at.
the moratorium remained in effect until april,when president clinton signed an executive waiver allowing the secretary to once again list species for protection another year passed,however,without a final decision on the lizard.finally,on may,in response to a lawsuit brought by defenders to compel action on the lizard,the district court in arizona ordered the secretary to issue a final decision within days.
one month after the court order,a group of federal and state agencies signed a conservation agreement ca implementing a recently completed rangewide management strategy to protect the lizard,developed by representatives of the federal bureau of land management blm,the fws,and state and local agencies.pursuant to the ca,cooperating parties agreed to take voluntary steps aimed at reducing threats to the species,stabilizing the species populations,and maintaining its ecosystem.the underlying management strategy was based on an earlier effort by the blm and the california department of fish and game to provide protections for the lizard after it had been elevated to category candidate status by the fws in.
critical to the implementation of the ca was the designation of five management areas mas subject to protective measures,including the monitoring of lizard populations,limitation of habitat disturbance including vehicle use,and acquisition of private inholdings.some of the measures included in the ca had been in place for years,long before the secretary published the initial proposed rule recommending the lizard for protection.many of the actions and the overall scope of the mas effected by the conservation effort,however,were new.
the secretary issued her final decision on july,the notice withdrawing the proposed rule that had earlier recommended the lizard for listing as a threatened species.the notice was premised on three factors that population trend data did not conclusively demonstrate significant population declines that some of the threats to the lizard habitat had grown less serious since the proposed rule was issued and that the recently devised conservation agreement w ould ensure further reductions in threats.the secretary ultimate conclusion also turned on her determination that,however serious the threats to the lizard on private land,l arge blocks of habitat with few anticipated impacts exist on public lands throughout the range of this species.the secretary did not,however,separately consider whether the lizard is or will become extinct in a significant portion of its range,as that term is used in the statute.
six months after the secretary withdrew the proposed rule,defenders filed the instant suit challenging that decision.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the secretary on june,upholding the secretary decision not to list the lizard.the court accepted the secretary conclusion that none of the five statutory factors were present with respect to the lizard,holding that the secretary reasonably relied on the conservation agreement to support that conclusion.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
defenders claims that the best scientific evidence available on the lizard and its habitat demonstrates the presence of as many as four of the five statutory factors indicating that a species is either threatened or endangered and thus eligible for esa protection.the secretary answer to this claim is twofold first,although the secretary does not dispute that these factors may evidence threats to the lizard on private land,she contends that adequate habitat exists on public land to ensure the species viability.second,the secretary relies on the newly introduced conservation agreement,which she contends will establish added protections for the lizard public land habitat and thus remove the threat of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range in the foreseeable future.both parts of this analysis,we conclude,are faulty.
extinction throughout a significant portion of its range 
the distinction between public and private land explains much of the dispute between the secretary and defenders.defenders arguments in support of its claim that listing is warranted focus primarily on the loss of lizard habitat on private land.the secretary,on the other hand,emphasizes the conservation efforts on public land to support her conclusion that the lizard is not threatened with extinction.at because of the large amount of horned lizard habitat located on public lands within the united states and the reduction of threats on these lands due to changing patterns and conservation efforts of public agencies,threats due to habitat modification and loss do not warrant listing of the species at this time.emphasis added.the distinction also explains,in large part,the shift between the secretary initial findings that accompanied the proposed rule,recommending the lizard for protection based on concern about habitat loss on private land,and her findings that accompanied the withdrawal decision,emphasizing that available public lands are sufficient to support the species.
whether the lizard potential survival in its public land habitat is sufficient to preclude esa protection depends largely on the meaning of the phrase in danger of extinction throughout a significant portion of its range.emphasis added.assuming the lizard population remains viable on public land,it is not in danger of extinction throughout all its range.defenders argue,however,that if the lizard private land habitat constitutes a significant portion of its range and its survival there,as defenders allege,is in jeopardy,the esa requires the secretary to designate the lizard for protection.
standing alone,the phrase in danger of extinction throughout a significant portion of its range is puzzling.according to the oxford english dictionary,extinct means has died out or come to an end of a family,class of persons,a race of species of animals or plants having no living representative.thus,the phrase extinc t throughout a significant portion of its range is something of an oxymoron.similarly,to speak of a species that is in danger of extinction throughout a significant portion of its range may seem internally inconsistent,since extinction suggests total rather than partial disappearance the statute is therefore inherently ambiguous,as it appears to use language in a manner in some tension with ordinary usage.
the secretary explanation 
the secretary explanation of this odd phraseology is of no assistance in puzzling out the meaning of the phrase,since her interpretation simply can not be squared with the statute language and structure.the secretary in her brief interprets the enigmatic phrase to mean that a species is eligible for protection under the esa if it faces threats in enough key portions of its range that the entire species is in danger of extinction,or will be within the foreseeable future.she therefore assumes that a species is in danger of extinction in a significant portion of its range only if it is in danger of extinction everywhere 
if,however,the effect of extinction throughout a significant portion of its range is the threat of extinction everywhere,then the threat of extinction throughout a significant portion of its range is equivalent to the threat of extinction throughout all its range.because the statute already defines endangered species as those that are in danger of extinction throughout all of their range,the secretary interpretation of a significant portion of its range has the effect of rendering the phrase superfluous.
such a redundant reading of a significant statutory phrase is unacceptable.when interpreting a statute,we must follow a natural reading,which would give effect to all of the statute provisions.united food and commercial workers union local brown group,d emphasis added.by reading all and a significant portion of its range as functional equivalents,the secretary construction violates that rule.
the secretary tries to distinguish her definition of a species in danger throughout a significant portion of its range from a species in danger throughout all its range by noting congress expressed commitment to conservation and its hope that the esa would protect species well before they reached the brink of extinction.the extension of esa protections to a species in danger throughout a significant portion of its range,the secretary asserts,offers protection to species not yet faced with imminent extinction and therefore reflects the incremental approach congress intended the esa to provide.but this function too is fulfilled elsewhere in the statute.
as noted,the esa provides protection to both endangered species and threatened species.while an endangered species is a species in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range,threatened species include those which are likely to become endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of their range.the secretary interpretation thus conflates the distinct esa protections for species facing extinction throughout all and throughout a significant portion of their range with the separate protections for threatened and for endangered species.as such,the secretary construction once again views the statute as saying the same thing twice.
this understanding of the statutory language not only clashes with the rule against surplusage we have already discussed,but also runs up against the statute legislative history congress did recognize that,as the secretary stresses,e xtinction is a gradual process,but congress incorporated that recognition not in the significant portion phrase but in the protection for threatened species.during the senate floor debate,senator tunney of california observed that the esa 
provides protection to a broader range of species by affording the secretary the power to list animals which he determines are likely in the foreseeable future to become extinct,as well as those animals which are presently threatened with extinction.this gives the secretary and the states which adopt endangered species management plans,the ability not only to protect the last remaining members of the species but to take steps to insure that species which are likely to be threatened with extinction never reach the state of being presently endangered.
