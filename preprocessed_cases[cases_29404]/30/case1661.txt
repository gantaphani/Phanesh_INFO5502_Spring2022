facts and procedural background 
respondents and real parties in interest redondo auto spa and chris mckenna collectively auto spa propose to build a car wash and small coffee shop on a lot at the northwest corner of torrance boulevard and south irena avenue in redondo beach.the property is located within a commercial c zone.the structure will consist of a foot car wash tunnel and attached coffee shop that together will total square feet.the remainder of the site will include parking spaces for employees and coffee shop patrons,an area for drying cars,landscaping and a water feature.entry to the car wash is from the residential street,just beyond the corner of the major street.
in,the city approved a cup for a car wash and snack bar at the same location.that car wash,which occupied square feet of the parcel,operated until approximately june.the property fell into disrepair.about five years later,appellants homes on the abutting property lines were constructed.in,the property was found to be a blight on the area and the city prosecuted the owner for nuisance and other charges.auto spa responded by demolishing the remaining structure and proposing to rebuild the car wash as an express wash model,in which patrons would vacuum their own cars and drive through the car wash tunnel.the city planning commission commission did not approve the plan.among other things,it determined that the proposed use would have an adverse impact on abutting properties and that the site was not adequate in size and shape to accommodate the express wash project.rather than appeal that decision,auto spa proposed a high end,car wash and coffee shop.
the commission granted a cup for the car wash and found that it was categorically exempt from ceqa under guidelines section,subdivision c.the notice of exemption states that t he project consists of the construction of a new car wash facility and coffee shop of square feet in size on commercially zoned property.as such,it is consistent with the classes of projects described in ceqa guidelines section c that states,in part,that commercial buildings not exceeding square feet in floor area on sites zoned for such use if not involving the use of significant amounts of hazardous substances where all necessary public services and facilities are available and the surrounding area is not environmentally sensitive are considered exempt from further ceqa review.no potentially significant environmental impacts will result from the project.
the commission added certain restrictions to the project,requiring that the equipment not exceed the redondo beach municipal code municipal code noise limit,that no detailing equipment be used that is audible or discernable at the property line from the other equipment,and that operating hours be limited.the commission further required that the number of vehicles washed be limited to vehicles per hour and to no more than vehicles per day referred to as condition.coffee shop hours were set at to seven days a week.walters and kleiman appealed the decision to the city council.
auto spa provided a traffic study,conducted by gibson transportation consulting gibson,which concluded that the proposed car wash would not change the level of service at the intersection from its present a status,even at peak operating times.it also commissioned a noise study by davy associates davy,which determined that the only significant noise source would be the systems inside the car wash tunnel.davy concluded that noise would largely be contained by the design and materials to be used in constructing the facility.
before the hearing on the appeal,auto spa requested removal of condition.it claimed that cars per day would not be profitable for the car wash.the city council approved the project subject to certain conditions,including compliance with the city noise ordinance condition,a vehicle limit of cars per month and limitations on the car wash operating hours condition requires that compliance with the noise standards be tested and documented prior to the final inspection and opening of the car wash.
with these and other conditions in place,the city council determined the building site is adequate in size to accommodate the proposed use the proposed use has adequate street access and will not have a significant impact on traffic the proposed use will have no adverse effect on abutting properties the noise that will be generated by the car wash blowers and vacuum drops does not exceed the permitted interior and exterior limits the project is exempt from ceqa under guidelines section,subdivision c and the project will not have a significant effect on the environment.
appellants filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the ceqa exemption and the city issuance of a cup.after briefing and a hearing,the trial court denied the writ petition,concluding that the project is categorically exempt under guidelines section,subdivision c,and that the cup was properly issued.this appeal followed 
discussion 
ceqa overview 
ceqa and its implementing administrative regulations guidelines establish a process to ensure that public agencies inform their decisions with environmental considerations.citation.the first tier is jurisdictional,requiring that an agency conduct a preliminary review to determine whether an activity is subject to ceqa.muzzy ranch solano county airport land use com.cal th,fn.omitted muzzy ranch.ceqa applies if the activity is a project under the statutory definition,unless the project is exempt.citations.san lorenzo valley community advocates for responsible education san lorenzo valley unified school dist.th.
the second tier concerns exemptions from ceqa review,which include categorical exemptions or classes of projects that the agency has determined to be exempt per se because they do not have a significant effect on the environment.if a public agency properly finds that a project is exempt from ceqa,no further environmental review is necessary.citation.the agency need only prepare and file a notice of exemption citations,citing the relevant statute or section of the ceqa guidelines and including a brief statement of reasons to support the finding of exemption citation.muzzy ranch,supra,cal th at.the third tier applies if the agency determines substantial evidence exists that an aspect of the project may cause a significant effect on the environment.id.at.
here,it is undisputed that the proposed car wash qualifies as a project under ceqa.the issues on appeal concern the second tier of the ceqa analysis,whether the city erred in finding that the car wash project is categorically exempt from ceqa and that there are no unusual circumstances creating a reasonable possibility the activity will have a significant effect on the environment.see guidelines,subd.c,subd.c.
in considering a petition for writ of mandate in a ceqa case,o ur task on appeal is the same as the trial court.citation.thus,we conduct our review independent of the trial court findings.citation.accordingly,we examine the city decision,not the trial court.banker hill,hillcrest,park west community preservation group city of san diego th.
application of categorical exemption 
the city determined that the car wash project fell within class of the ceqa categorical exemptions.appellants argue this determination was incorrect as a matter of law.to the extent this argument turns only on an interpretation of the language of the guidelines or the scope of a particular ceqa exemption,this presents a question of law subject to de novo review by this court.save our carmel river monterey peninsula water management dist.th.but w here the record contains evidence bearing on the question whether the project qualifies for the exemption,such as reports or other information submitted in connection with the project,and the agency makes factual determinations as to whether the project fits within an exemption category,we determine whether the record contains substantial evidence to support the agency decision.id.at.
the relevant class exemption involves construction and location of limited numbers of new,small facilities or structures and installation of small new equipment and facilities in small structures.guidelines.this exemption typically applies when the project consists of a small construction project and the utility and electrical work necessary to service that project.voices for rural living el dorado irrigation dist.th,voices.examples of this exemption include but are not limited to c a store,motel,office,restaurant or similar structure not involving the use of significant amounts of hazardous substances,and not exceeding square feet in floor area.in urbanized areas,the exemption also applies to up to four such commercial buildings not exceeding square feet in floor area on sites zoned for such use if not involving the use of significant amounts of hazardous substances where all public services and facilities are available and the surrounding area is not environmentally sensitive.guidelines,subd.c,italics added.
the parties do not dispute that the proposed car wash project is located in an urbanized area.their dispute centers on whether a car wash generally fits within the definition of commercial buildings in guidelines section,subdivision c,and whether the car wash at issue here,at square feet,is within that section size restrictions.appellants acknowledge this guideline exempts a store,motel,office,restaurant or similar structure,but contend there is nothing in the exemption that would indicate it was intended to cover the installation of industrial equipment.they argue that the types of equipment installed at a car wash,such as blowers,vacuums,air nozzles and waste treatment,are not anticipated by guidelines section,subdivision c.we disagree.
first,the guideline itself says it is not limited to the listed examples of a store,motel,office or restaurant.it also includes similar structure s.guidelines,subd.c.car washes are similar to stores,motels,offices and restaurants in that they are commercial businesses that serve consumers,require the parking of consumers vehicles,contain equipment and often are located in or near residential areas.moreover,the proposed car wash includes a coffee shop,which qualifies as a restaurant.appellants cite no case authority suggesting that a car wash and coffee shop combination can not qualify for the exemption under section,subdivision c.
in addition,we reject appellants contention that the equipment intended to be used at a car wash is substantially different from the types of equipment associated with a store,motel,office or restaurant that is up to square feet in size.as auto spa points out,these types of buildings typically have centralized heating,ventilation and air conditioning plants with chillers,cooling towers,commercial laundry facilities and commercial kitchens with ventilation systems.
nor are we persuaded by appellants argument that guidelines section,subdivision c does not apply to a single commercial building in excess of square feet.this argument was rejected by fairbank city of mill valley th fairbank,which held t he most plausible reading of guidelines section c,as amended in october,is that a commercial project to be built in an urbanized area may be found to be exempt if it involves the construction of one,two,three,or four commercial buildings on a parcel zoned for such use,so long as the total floor area of the building s does not exceed square feet.i t does not make sense to interpret the exemption as applicable to the construction of four square foot buildings on a given parcel,but not to one building of square feet or less on the same parcel.id.at.
there is no dispute that the proposed car wash and coffee shop is a commercial structure of less than square feet that is to be built in an urbanized area zoned for commercial use.there also is no dispute that all necessary public services and facilities are available and that the surrounding area is not considered environmentally sensitive.guidelines,subd.c.the city properly determined,therefore,that the car wash and coffee shop project satisfies the categorical exemption requirements of guidelines section,subdivision c.
appellants argue that even if the exemption could apply to a car wash and coffee shop in some instances,it does not apply here because the proposed project will be utilizing hazardous chemicals.while it is true that the exemption in guidelines section,subdivision c applies only to commercial buildings that do not involv e the use of significant amounts of hazardous substances,appellants have not offered any evidence suggesting that the soaps or detergents to be used at the proposed car wash are hazardous,or that any significant amount of hazardous substances will be used.to the contrary,they offer documents that state that the soaps are biodegradable and are verified nonhazardous per the occupational safety and health administration.appellants speculation that the car wash operation might include hazardous substances is not supported by the administrative record.
unusual circumstances exception to categorical exemption 
appellants contend that even if guidelines section,subdivision c does apply to the proposed car wash and coffee shop,several factors inherent in the project preclude the use of a categorical exemption because there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.guidelines,subd.c.as we shall explain,the record does not support application of this unusual circumstances exception to the exemption.
analytical framework and standards of review 
in assessing whether the unusual circumstances exception applies,we engage in two alternative analyses,as delineated by our supreme court in berkeley hillside preservation city of berkeley cal th,berkeley hillside.in the first alternative,a challenger must prove both unusual circumstances and a significant environmental effect that is due to those circumstances.in this method of proof,the unusual circumstances relate to some feature of the project that distinguishes the project from other features in the exempt class.ibid.once an unusual circumstance is proved under this method,then the party need only show a reasonable possibility of a significant effect due to that unusual circumstance.citizens for environmental responsibility state ex rel.dist.ag.th,citizens.
whether the project presents unusual circumstances under this alternative is a factual inquiry subject to the traditional substantial evidence standard of review.berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at.this standard requires that we resolv e all evidentiary conflicts in the agency favor and indulg e in all legitimate and reasonable inferences to uphold the agency finding.citizens,supra,th at.
if unusual circumstances are found under this first alternative,agencies apply the fair argument standard in determining whether there is a reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at,citing guidelines,subd.c.under this standard,an agency is merely supposed to look to see if the record shows substantial evidence of a fair argument that there may be a significant effect.citations.in other words,the agency is not to weigh the evidence to come to its own conclusion about whether there will be a significant effect.it is merely supposed to inquire,as a matter of law,whether the record reveals a fair argument id.at,italics omitted.
in the second alternative under berkeley hillside,a challenger may establish an unusual circumstance with evidence that the project will have a significant environmental effect.berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at,italics added.when it is shown that a project otherwise covered by a categorical exemption will have a significant environmental effect,it necessarily follows that the project presents unusual circumstances.id.at,italics omitted.but a challenger must establish more than just a fair argument that the project will have a significant environmental effect.citation.a party challenging the exemption,must show that the project will have a significant environmental impact.citizens,supra,th at.in other words,a showing by substantial evidence that a project will have a significant effect on the environment satisfies both prongs of the unusual circumstances exception under the second method of establishing the exception.ibid.
first alternative features of the project as unusual circumstances 
the guidelines do not define unusual circumstances.voices,supra,th at san francisco beautiful city and county of san francisco th.berkeley hillside clarified that a party can show an unusual circumstance by demonstrating that the project has some characteristic or feature that distinguishes it from others in the exempt class,such as its size or location.berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at citizens,supra,th at.but t he presence of comparable facilities in the immediate area adequately supports an implied finding that there were no unusual circumstances precluding a categorical exemption.bloom mcgurk th,bloom see san francisco beautiful,at there is no basis to conclude the addition of additional utility cabinets would be unusual in the context of the city urban environment,which is already replete with facilities mounted on the public city of pasadena state of california th,we conclude that the lease of the walnut street site for use as a parole office does not constitute an unusual circumstance within the meaning of ceqa in light of the presence of the other custodial and criminal justice facilities in the immediate area,disapproved on other grounds as stated in western states petroleum superior court cal th,fn.
as previously discussed,there is nothing particularly unusual about the proposed car wash and coffee shop.the evidence establishes that there are many other car washes in the surrounding area,including a car wash within a minute drive from the project site,five car washes within two miles and car washes within a minute drive.indeed,the site itself was a car wash and snack bar for nearly years,strongly suggesting that the circumstances are not the least bit unusual.
appellants contend that the presence of large air blowers and other outdoor activities that are conducted outside of the structures seven days a week makes the car wash unusual.as auto spa observes,however,the examples in the guidelines are not qualitatively different from a car wash.restaurants and stores generally are open seven days a week indeed,fast food restaurants and convenience stores are often open hours a day.restaurants and stores routinely have outside activities such as sidewalk displays,outdoor seating for customers or windows.motels are necessarily hour operations with parking lots and perhaps pools or other outdoor recreation areas and related equipment.
the general effects of an operating business,such as noise,parking and traffic,can not serve as unusual circumstances in and of themselves.in fairbank,supra,th,the trial court concluded there was nothing unusual about traffic and parking problems relating to a commercial building.the court explained that challengers to the project had to show some feature that distinguishes it from any other small,commercial building or use.otherwise,no project that satisfies the criteria set forth in guidelines section c could ever be found to be exempt.there is nothing about the proposed building that sets it apart from any other small commercial structure to be built in an urbanized area,without the use of hazardous substances and without any showing of environmental sensitivity.id.at see also bloom,supra,th at area zoned for facility precluded finding use was unusual association for protection.values city of ukiah th,objections to a single family home based on height,view,privacy and water runoff are normal and common considerations in the construction of a single family residence and are in no way due to unusual circumstances.
appellants cite lewis seventeenth dist.agricultural d,for the proposition that the proximity to residences is itself an unusual circumstance,arguing that the noise and dust generated by the racing track at issue there is similar to the issues presented by the car wash project here.but the unusual circumstances prong of the exception was neither disputed nor analyzed in lewis.citizens,supra,th at it does not appear that the unusual circumstances prong of the exception was a matter of active dispute in lewis as there was substantive analysis only on the significant effect prong.c ases are not authority for propositions not considered.in re marriage of cornejo cal th.moreover,it is axiomatic that a car race track is far more unusual next to a residential neighborhood than the continuation of a car wash on the corner of a busy intersection near residential properties.see citizens,at.
we conclude appellants have not identified substantial evidence supporting a finding of unusual circumstances based on the features of the car wash and coffee shop project.to the contrary,we conclude the city findings on this issue are supported by substantial evidence berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at.
second alternative significant effect on the environment as an unusual circumstance 
the next question is whether appellants have established unusual circumstances under the alternative method of showing that the project will have a significant environmental effect.as discussed above,the reason for this alternative method is that evidence that the project will have a significant effect does tend to prove that some circumstance of the project is unusual.berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at.thus,a challenger seeking to prove unusual circumstances based on an environmental effect must provide or identify substantial evidence indicating the project will actually have an effect on the environment and that effect will be significant.citizens,supra,th at.a significant effect on the environment is a substantial adverse change in the physical conditions which exist in the area affected by the proposed project.guidelines,subd.g.
as in citizens,appellants focus before the city and the trial court was not on whether the project actually will have a significant effect on the environment,but rather on whether there is a reasonable possibility that the project may have a significant environmental impact.see citizens,supra,th at.appellants claimed there is a fair argument that the car wash and coffee shop may have significant adverse noise and traffic effects in the area.however,the evidence they rely upon and their arguments fall well short of establishing that the project will have a significant environmental effect on the area.ibid.
appellants contend their noise expert,evro wee sit,demonstrated that the operation of the car wash would violate the city interior and exterior noise limits at the abutting property line.this is not possible,however,because approval of the project is conditioned upon auto spa adherence to the city interior and exterior noise limits.condition states the shall be responsible to install and maintain all equipment on the property so as to reduce noise levels to meet the standards stated in the city noise ordinance,specifically that there shall be no noise that exceeds dba as measured at the north property line for a period of thirty minutes or more per hour,and that there shall also be compliance with the interior noise standards as stated in section as measured for minutes,unless the residents of the adjacent residences deny access to their units for the pu
