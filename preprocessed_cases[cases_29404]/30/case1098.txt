this appeal presents the question whether the clean air act program to prevent deterioration of air quality is administered in nevada in large air quality planning units encompassing all or nearly all of the state,or in more than smaller units designated by the state.the importance of the issue arises from the fact that certain pollution controls go into effect for a unit when a major pollution source applies for a permit within that unit.if the unit is very large,then a major source almost certainly has already applied,and new minor sources are subject to the controls in issue.if the unit is but one of hundreds in the state,then many units are not subject to the controls because no major pollution source is located within the unit.minor sources are then free to begin operating there without the special pollution controls.
petitioners indian colony and great basin mine watch collectively contend that a mine that proposes to operate near the colony is subject to the controls in issue because the relevant unit is the entire state or nearly so.the epa issued a rule,however,stating that nevada is divided into more than units and has been so divided since.see designations of areas for air quality planning purposes state of nevada technical correction,nevada rule.now challenges that nevada rule on the grounds that it is arbitrary,capricious and not in accordance with the law,in violation of the administrative procedure act apa,see and it was issued without following the apa notice and comment procedures,see.
the nevada rule purports to clarify that,in the table listing nevada clean air act designations for various airborne pollutants,codified at,the terms rest of state and entire state do not refer to a single baseline area for clean air act purposes but to more than distinct hydrographic areas,each of which constitutes its own separate baseline area.because we conclude that the epa acted reasonably in promulgating the rule,we deny petition for review.
clean air act 
the clean air act,et establishes national ambient air quality standards naaqs for a number of different airborne pollutants,including particulate matter formerly described as total suspended particulate,or tsp,and now regulated as,or particulate matter with a diameter of ten micrometers or less,sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.see.
in,congress amended the act to provide for the achievement,maintenance,and enforcement of these national air quality standards.the amendments created three levels of classification for the different planning areas within a state.areas were classified as nonattainment if they fell below the national air quality standards,and were classified as attainment if they exceeded national standards.areas in which there was not enough data to determine whether they were in attainment or nonattainment were deemed unclassifiable.
for attainment or unclassifiable areas,congress established the prevention of significant deterioration psd program,which seeks to maintain air quality in pristine areas by governing the permissible increments of pollution increases in each planning area beyond that area baseline pollution level.the permissible pollution levels established by the psd program typically are stricter than the naaqs levels.it is this psd program and its enhanced pollution controls that are at issue in this appeal.
the planning areas of each state that are designated as attainment,nonattainment or unclassifiable,are known as baseline areas.see b i.in order to determine the allowable amount of incremental pollution increase permitted in each attainment or unclassifiable area,a baseline concentration must be established.the baseline concentration of pollution is defined as the ambient concentration level existing on the minor source baseline date.see b i.that minor source baseline date for a particular baseline area is established when a major stationary source or major modification located in that baseline area submits an application for a permit under the appropriate regulations.see b ii.
the psd limitations on pollution increases are not triggered for a baseline area until that area baseline date,and therefore the area baseline concentration,has been established.if the baseline concentration for a baseline area has not been triggered,then entities that are not considered major stationary sources of pollution can operate in that area subject only to the naaqs standards rather than the more stringent psd standards.as a result,the smaller,and hence more numerous,the baseline areas are,the less likely it is that a major source has applied for a permit within any one area,thereby establishing a baseline date.consequently,the more baseline areas a state has,the more likely it is that a minor pollution source can find an area in which to operate where it is not subject to the requirements of the psd program.
nevada regulatory history 
the amendments to the clean air act required states to submit proposed boundaries and designations for each baseline area to the epa for approval.see.the epa was free to adopt the state designations,or it could redesignate on its own accord.in,nevada submitted its proposed list of individual baseline areas as well as proposed designations for each area.nevada recommended that the boundaries for baseline areas correspond to individual hydrographic areas on the theory that air flow tends to follow water flow,and that the masses of air over any particular hydrographic area were therefore likely to share similar characteristics.the proposal identified and listed air basins,which were subdivided into that corresponded to the state separate hydrographic areas each of the areas was identified and numbered separately on a map of nevada division of natural resources that was submitted to the epa as part of nevada proposal.
in,the epa issued a rule establishing the official designations and baseline areas for all states,including nevada.see.the epa list contained designations for tsp,sulfur dioxide,photochemical oxidants,and carbon monoxide.the epa created a separate chart for each pollutant,in which it classified the state different baseline areas as attainment,nonattainment,or unclassifiable.in the charts,each nonattainment area was listed separately.in the chart for tsp,each area that could not be classified also was listed separately.at.in the charts for sulfur dioxide and tsp,where the rest of the state was considered to be in attainment,all remaining areas were condensed onto a single line that was labeled rest of state or whole state.id.similarly,in the charts for photochemical oxidants,nitrogen oxide,and carbon monoxide,where all remaining areas were considered unclassifiable,those areas were listed on a single line with the label rest of state.id.the epa initial designations for nevada were listed in the code of federal regulations.see fed reg.at.nothing in the listings stated that nevada proposed unit boundaries were being rejected or amended.
in,the epa replaced the listed particulate pollutant tsp with.in doing so,the epa stated that it was adopting the same baseline areas for that it had used previously for tsp.see,june.
in,congress passed another set of amendments to the clean air act,which led to a new series of rules issued by the epa.as part of that rulemaking,the epa promulgated a new regulation pertaining to its designation charts,upon which heavily relies,stating 
designated areas which are listed below as attainment better than national standards or unclassifiable can not be classified for total suspended particulate tsp,sulfur dioxide,and nitrogen dioxide,represent potential baseline areas or portions of baseline areas which are used in determining compliance with maximum allowable increases increments in concentrations of the respective pollutants for the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality psd.with respect to areas identified as rest of state it should be assumed that such reference comprises a single area designation for psd baseline area purposes.however,for,the use of the term rest of state is an interim measure to designate as unclassifiable all locations not originally designated nonattainment for in accordance with section d b of the act.
codified at b emphasis added.the regulation,which applied generally to all the listed states,did not mention the epa use of the term rest of state in nevada designation listings.
factual background 
on december,the corporation,the world largest manufacturer of kitty litter,proposed to develop two mines on lands in nevada located near the tribal lands of the indian colony.worried that the construction and operation of such mines could detrimentally affect the air quality of surrounding areas,tribal chairman arlen melendez wrote to wayne nastri,the epa administrator for region region that includes request that the epa subject to the psd regulations of the clean air act.chairman melendez based his request on the fact that the lands on which desired to locate its mines were included in the area listed as rest of state or entire state in the epa designation tables.chairman melendez asserted that those terms described single baseline areas within which major sources almost certainly already operated,triggering the psd requirements and their application to proposed mining operations.
chairman melendez letter sparked an internal debate at the epa concerning whether the terms rest of state and entire state referred to a single baseline area or whether it was a shorthand notation for nevada residual baseline areas,encompassing more than discrete baseline areas.at first,some officials within the epa were inclined to agree with the chairman interpretation.on march,however,nastri stated in a letter to chairman melendez that was not subject to psd requirements because the minor source baseline date for the hydrographic area in which planned to place its mines had not yet been triggered.in the letter,nastri also noted that the epa recognized that the terms rest of state and entire state in the nevada section of the clean air act designations were confusing and that the epa was working on remedying the situation.
the result was the promulgation of the nevada rule.this rule contains two parts that are relevant to this dispute.in part i,the epa stated that,from its investigation of nevada psd regulatory history,it concluded that for the pollution tables for tsp,sulfur dioxide,and nitrogen oxide,the terms rest of state or entire state referred to more than distinct baseline areas.see id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the epa noted that,in its original submission to the agency,nevada identified separate hydrographic areas,each of which constituted its own baseline area,and that the epa subsequently adopted those hydrographic area designations in.see id.in part ii of the rule,the epa drew the same conclusions with respect to designations.the epa recognized that the term rest of state or entire state in these tables at could be misinterpreted as designating a single attainment or unclassifiable area and issued the rule in order to clarify that the applicable section tables actually refer to more than individual attainment or unclassifiable areas.id.
asserting that the epa rationale for the nevada rule was mistaken and that the terms rest of state or entire state referred to single baseline areas,filed this petition for review challenging parts i and ii of the nevada rule 
argues that the nevada rule is arbitrary and capricious because it mischaracterizes the agency original boundary designations for nevada the validity of the nevada rule turns on three factors whether nevada initially proposed the creation of baseline areas in its submission to the epa whether the epa adopted nevada recommendation with respect to baseline areas and whether any intervening regulatory action by the epa changed the nature of nevada baseline area designations.we uphold the nevada rule because the administrative record supports the epa interpretation that nevada originally proposed baseline areas,and that the epa in adopted that proposal and never changed it in any relevant respect.thus in the nevada rule,the epa properly interpreted the terms rest of state and entire state as a shorthand reference to more than separate baseline areas based on the state hydrographic areas.
tsp,sulfur dioxide,and nitrogen oxide part i of the rule 
nevada proposal 
in nevada original submission to the epa,it proposed the creation of distinct baseline areas,corresponding with hydrographic areas it previously had identified.nevada submission classifies status according to hydrographic area,and identifies each designation area by number,indicating that it intended to use the as the relevant baseline unit.other state documents that were issued contemporaneously with the state submission to the epa clarified that the was the appropriate baseline area unit.in a june,letter to the epa,the state discussed t he present classification method of using hydrographic subbasins.thus,the record leaves no room for doubt that nevada intended to create separate baseline areas,and made its submission accordingly 
the epa designations 
the record also supports the epa interpretation that it adopted nevada designations without changing their size,notwithstanding the agency use of the terms rest of state and entire state in the nevada tables first,in an internal agency memorandum,the epa stated that it had adopted nevada classifications,and later reaffirmed its statement in a rule.see.
second,there is no indication that the epa changed the baseline area designations after nevada submitted them.in the epa rule listing the initial designation areas and their classifications,the epa noted that,if its final designations differed from a state proposed designations,either with respect to area size or classification,those changes would be noted in the tables with an asterisk.at.in the nevada tables,several listings contain an asterisk to note that the epa changed nevada proposed designation.in each instance,however,the epa changed only the classification status of the baseline area,from attainment to unclassifiable and left the area boundaries unchanged.at.significantly,the listings labeled rest of state or entire state in each table do not contain an asterisk,see,indicating that the use of those terms was never intended to combine nevada proposed designations into a single baseline area.moreover,each area that was separately listed in the nevada tables was designated by its name and number,san emido desert contained in nevada submission,suggesting that each constituted a separate baseline area.see id.thus,the epa reasonably concluded in that it had established separate baseline areas in nevada in rather than single baseline areas denoted by the terms rest of state and entire state.
third,the record supports the epa position that it used the terms rest of state and entire state as proxies for the more than unlisted baseline areas because there was insufficient space in the agency tables to list each area separately.in its rule,the epa stated that in some cases,the descriptions of the designated areas submitted by the states were so lengthy as to prohibit their publication in the limited space available in the tables presented below.exact descriptions of all areas designated are available at the appropriate regional offices or the state in question.at.nevada separate area listings reasonably could constitute a prohibitively lengthy list.
finally,in each table the epa used rest of state or entire state only once,and used it in reference to whichever classification encompassed the majority of baseline areas.for example,nevada tsp table lists separately every nonattainment area,and every unclassifiable area,using the hydrographic baseline areas.it is unlikely that,after so employing the smaller units,the epa would in a single term created an entirely different type of unit for the remaining areas that were in attainment.the more reasonable interpretation is that the epa used the term rest of state or entire state as a collective reference to small units too numerous to identify individually with convenience.
subsequent regulatory history 
argues that regardless of the epa intent in,the nevada rule is arbitrary and capricious because it directly contradicts the agency regulation stating tha
