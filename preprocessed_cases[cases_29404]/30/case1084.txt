appellants challenge the district court grant of summary judgment to appellees,arguing that appellees final environmental impact statement final eis or final statement or final impact statement violates the national environmental policy act nepa or the act,c,and b of the act implementing regulations.appellants claim derives from scientific opposition to appellees conclusion that northern goshawks are habitat generalists,upon which conclusion the final statement management recommendations rest.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.because the final eis fails to disclose responsible scientific opposition to the conclusion upon which it is based,as required by b,we reverse and remand.
background 
in light of rising concern over the impact of logging practices on the viability of the northern goshawk in the southwestern region of the united states on october,the regional forester of the united states forest service the service or forest service created the northern goshawk scientific committee the committee or scientific committee,to review the hawk habitat management needs forest,dep t of,final environmental impact statement for amendment of forest plans,rec.ex.at draft eis,rec.ex.at.
on june,the service published notice of its intent to prepare an environmental impact statement amending forest land and management plans in the southwestern region to incorporate guidelines for habitat management of the northern goshawk.southwestern region,arizona,new mexico,west texas,and oklahoma amendment of national forest management plans in the southwestern region to include guidelines for management of habitat for the mexican spotted owl and northern goshawks,dep t agric.june,notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement 
in august,the committee published its report,which concluded that the northern goshawk was a habitat generalist occupying a mosaic of forest types,forest ages,structural conditions,and successional stages in their daily foraging movements throughout the southwestern region coniferous,deciduous,and mixed forests.richard reynolds et,dep t of,management recommendations for the northern goshawk in the southwestern united states,rec.ex.at,mrng.the report also found that the goshawk seldom used young,dense forests because those forests contain too few large trees in which the goshawk can nest,and insufficient space in and below the canopy to facilitate flight and capture of prey.id.at.on the basis of these conclusions,the report set forth recommendations describing the desired balance of forest age classes,or vegetation structural stages vss for the nest area,family area,and foraging area of the goshawks home range.id.at.the recommendations were derived from the information available on how foraging goshawks use their habitat.id.at.in particular,the report recommended that a mosaic of vegetation stages be interspersed throughout the foraging area in small patches,with a majority,or sixty percent,of the area comprised of vss,and.id.at.
in response to the agency publication of its intent to prepare an impact statement,as well as the issuance some months later of a scoping report and supplemental materials,the service received comments challenging the mrng conclusion that northern goshawks are habitat generalists.draft eis,rec.ex.at,see letter from duane shroufe.game and fish dep t,to larry henson,reg l forester,forest,rec.ex.at,agfd mrng response letter from michael spear,reg l,fish and wildlife,to larry henson,reg l forester,forest,rec.ex.at,spear letter.one agency in particular,the arizona game and fish department agfd,submitted a letter and a paper presenting scientific evidence refuting the service conclusion.agfd mrng response,rec.ex.at see agfd review paper,rec.ex.at.the department of the interior fish and wildlife service fws also submitted similar comments in a letter dated august.spear letter,rec.ex.at,citing eight scientific studies documenting the goshawk preference for foraging in mature,forests.
the service responded directly to the two agencies submissions,citing several scientific studies indicating that although goshawks prefer mature forest,the hawks occupy a wide range of forest types.see letter from richard reynolds,member,scientific comm.et,to duane shroufe,agfd,rec.ex.at may,stating that no scientific evidence finds that goshawks are adapted,or are limited,to forests richard reynolds,member,scientific comm.et,to noreen clough,acting reg l,region,fws,rec.ex.at,see also forest,goshawk opinion paper a response to arizona game and fish department review of forest service strategy for managing northern goshawk habitat in the southwestern united states,rec.ex.at relying on the ecology of each forest type present in the region,the goshawks diet,and two scientific studies to support its conclusion that the goshawk is a habitat generalist.the service also created an team,the goshawk interagency implementation team giit,to discuss implementation of the mrng recommendations,as well as identify concerns raised by and propose revisions to those recommendations.opening br.of appellants ctr.for biological diversity and the sierra club at service br.at charter northern goshawk implementation team,rec.ex.at.
in august,the service issued its draft version of the environmental impact statement,suggesting five alternative approaches to amending the region forest plans.draft eis,rec.ex.at.each alternative contained different ranges of vss and canopy coverage.see id.at.only three alternatives are relevant to this case.alternative c proposed adoption of the mrng recommendations outright.id.at.alternative d was constructed after comments received by the giit on the mrng,and advocated for higher old growth percentages than alternative id.alternative f mirrored alternative c,but recommended the implementation of an ecosystem demonstration project on the apache national forest.id.the draft eis identified alternative f as the service preferred alternative.id.at.
the draft statement described each alternative environmental consequences,draft eis,rec.ex.at,and compared the standards and guidelines associated with each alternative.id.at.the draft eis noted that the committee recommendations set forth in the mrng were a part of all five alternatives.id.at.as such,the alternatives were not expected to have an sic significant adverse effect on goshawk population viability.id.the service further noted that the mrng represented the best science available on the northern goshawk.id.
the draft eis contained summaries of the comments received by the service in response to the agency publication of its intent to prepare an impact statement and issuance of a scoping report and supplemental scoping materials.id.at.the comments section did not specifically mention or discuss the opposition expressed by the fws and the agfd submissions challenging the mrng conclusion that the goshawk is a habitat generalist.supra.the section did state that t he giit suggestions have been incorporated in the environmental impact statement as alternative d in response to the team request that their standards and guidelines be included as a separate alternative,draft eis,rec.ex.at,and included a comment the summary comment stating that a few commenters expressed concern that the proposed standards and guidelines for the northern goshawk are grossly inadequate to protect the birds.id.at.the service responded that t he guidelines have been developed over several years using the best information and scientific review available.this amendment will incorporate the current information in each forest plan.the standards and guidelines in forest plans can easily be updated through future amendments.id.
the service again received and considered comments on the draft impact statement after its issuance.final eis,rec.ex.at.scientist,in his individual capacity,the agfd and the new mexico department of game and fish nmdgf jointly,and appellants submitted comments again challenging the service conclusion that the goshawk is a habitat generalist,a certified wildlife biologist employed by the service and published researcher on the goshawk in arizona,suggested that the service should consider a moratorium on all harvesting within ponderosa pine forests throughout the southwestern region,because the scientific literature strongly intimates that goshawks prefer to forage in mature forests.see letter from to cartwright,reg l forester,forest,rec.ex.at.in support of that argument,referenced his own published research and numerous other scientific studies,several of which were released after the mrng was published.id.at,concluding that the northern goshawk preferred higher canopy stands for flight and prey capture and closed canopies for reducing competition and predation by raptors.
the agfd and the nmdgf comment letter stated that t he proposed old growth standard does not incorporate important habitat attributes or distribution requirements to sustain the habitat needs of the northern goshawk.see letter from duane shroufe,agfd,and jerry maracchini,nmdgf,to charles cartwright,reg l forester,forest,comments on draft environmental impact statement deis for proposed amendments to national forest land and resource management plans plan amendments in the southwestern region,rec.ex.at.the two state agencies also stressed that s ome of the issues previously identified during the scoping process are being emphasized again in these comments because they were not adequately addressed or evaluated in the draft eis.id.at.the agfd review paper arguing that the goshawk is a habitat specialist was attached to these comments.id.at supra.the letter was accompanied by management recommendations calling for forty percent of the landscape in old forest or large old trees a acre management territory for known goshawk breeding areas,of which acres would be devoted to foraging management of mature and old growth forest outside goshawk areas and across the landscape and a canopy cover of at least forty percent of vss through in foraging areas.id.at.
appellants comments on the draft eis advocated for the inclusion of alternatives proposing a higher retention of forest and alternative conservation strategies for the goshawk.letter from kieran suckling,southwest ctr.for biological diversity,et,to charles cartwright,reg l forester,forest,rec.ex.at,to support their argument that the northern goshawk is a foraging specialist,needing a habitat that provides mature,tall trees or stands,appellants referenced numerous goshawk studies that were not discussed in the mrng.id.at.several of the noted studies were released after the publication of the mrng.see id.
in october,the service issued the final version of the environmental impact statement.final eis,rec.ex.at.the final statement,like the draft eis,discussed each proposed alternatives environmental consequences.id.at.the service concluded that little difference s in the effect of the alternatives would result in the short term,while major differences would arise in the long term.id.at.the final eis also compared the standards and guidelines associated with each alternative,rec.ex.at,noting that the proposed standards and guidelines were developed over the years using the best information and scientific evidence available.rec.ex.at.
minor changes were made in the final eis to alternatives c and id.at.alternative c was separated from alternative f for purposes of clarity.id.at.alternative f,accordingly,advocated only for a demonstration project in the apache national forest.id.at.alternative d was revised to reflect verbatim comments submitted by the agfd and the nmdgf,id.at,resulting in a slight variation from the recommendations developed by the giit and from information depicted in the mrng.id.at.the objective was to sustain as much mature and old forest across the landscape as possible,rec.ex.at,with the expectation that forty percent of the entire landscape would be old growth forest throughout time.id.at.to achieve that percentage of old growth forest,the alternative called for maintaining an average of twenty percent of vss and characteristics across the landscape.see id.alternative d further suggested,among other things,a minimum of forty percent canopy cover in foraging habitats.see id.at.
one significant change was presented in the final statement the final eis contained an additional alternative.rec.ex.at.in reaction to comments arguing that the agency needed to respond to the mexican spotted owl recovery plan,the service included an additional alternative for consideration,alternative id.at.the standards and guidelines embodied in alternative g were developed by the mrng,recommendations from the giit,and comments presented by the agfd and the nmdgf in response to the draft eis.rec.ex.at.alternative g proposed that at least twenty percent of the landscape would be old growth,see id.at it also called for a mosaic of vss across the forest landscape.id.at.the forest service recommended alternative g as the preferred alternative.rec.ex.at.
the final eis also contained a comments section,categorizing comments on the draft eis into one of three groups.rec.ex.at.group one contained letters expressing a preference for alternative id.group two contained letters discussing transportation issues.id.group three contained twenty letters suggesting various changes to improve the final version of the environmental impact statement.id.although the service responded to each group of comments,the service did not mention or respond to comments challenging the agency conclusion that goshawks are habitat generalists.
the forest service further included copies of certain comment letters received on the draft eis in appendix f of the final statement.rec.ex.at.the agfd and the nmdgf joint comment letter dated november,id.at supra,was included among other agency and local government submissions.the service redacted a portion of the comment letter containing the agfd review paper from the final eis.id.at.the service noted on the paper that t his document was prepared by the agfd in.the forest service conducted an extensive review of that document in.both documents have been included in the planning record,but because of their extensive size are not reprinted in the f inal eis.id.and appellants comments were omitted from the appendix.
the forest service thereafter permitted interested parties to submit comments on the final eis.forest,dep t of,record of decision for amendment of forest plans arizona and new mexico,rec.ex.at,rod.in june,the regional forester issued the rod,in which the decision to implement alternative g of the final eis was announced.id.at.
in the instant appeal,appellants contend that the final impact statement fails to include a reasoned analysis of the fws and the agfd opinion that northern goshawks are habitat specialists discuss and respond to at least seven scientific studies that cast doubt on the service conclusion that northern goshawks are habitat generalists and respond to comments filed by appellants and,identifying the scientific debate whether northern goshawks are habitat generalists.appellees respond that the final impact statement directly addresses and responds to the concerns identified above by including and analyzing alternative d in the final statement,and by including the agfd review paper in the comments section of the final statement.alternatively,by including the summary comment and the agency response thereto in the comments section of the draft eis,the service argues that it discussed and responded to the concern raised by the fws and the agfd in the draft statement.the agency last contention,argued in the alternative,is that the planning record contains documents prepared by the service which directly respond to the concern presented.
