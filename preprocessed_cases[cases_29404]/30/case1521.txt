this case involves a challenge to a decision by the fish and wildlife service to issue a permit authorizing the otherwise unlawful taking of the endangered delmarva fox squirrel in connection with a proposed residential development.appellants contend that the service violated the endangered species act esa because it did not allow public comment on a key component of the developer permit application,and because it did not make the statutorily required finding that the developer plan reduced the impact of the taking to the maximum extent practicable.because appellants are correct on both counts,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment against appellants and order the case remanded for further consideration by the service.
section of the esa makes it unlawful to take any endangered species.a b.a species is endangered if it is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.id.the statute defines take as to harass,harm,pursue,hunt,shoot,wound,kill,trap,capture,or collect,or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.id.the service regulations further define harm to include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns,including breeding,feeding or sheltering.
section of the esa creates an exception to the general ban on taking.under that section,the service may issue a permit allowing any taking otherwise prohibited by section a b of this title if such taking is incidental to,and not the purpose of,the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity.a b.several conditions must be met prior to the grant of an incidental take permit.the applicant for the permit must submit a conservation plan,known as a habitat conservation plan or hcp,that describes 
i the impact which will likely result from such taking ii what steps the applicant will take to minimize and mitigate such impacts iii what alternative actions to such taking the applicant considered and the reasons why such alternatives are not being utilized and iv such other measures that the secretary may require as being necessary or appropriate for purposes of the plan.
id.a a.the service must publish notice of the permit application in the federal register,and i nformation received by the service as part of the application shall be available to the public as a matter of public record at every stage of the proceeding.id.c.the service also must provide an opportunity for public comment on the application and related conservation plan.id.a b.finally,before issuing the permit the service must make certain specified findings.these include findings that the taking will be incidental,that it will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival and recovery of the species in the wild,and,most relevant here,that the applicant will,to the maximum extent practicable,minimize and mitigate the impacts of such taking.id.
appellants john gerber,iii and defenders of wildlife hereinafter defenders challenge the issuance of an incidental take permit to the winchester creek limited partnership the permit authorizes the incidental taking of delmarva fox squirrels on a residential community development site owned by winchester.the site,known as home port,is located in queen anne county,maryland,on the eastern shore of the chesapeake bay.it is one of the last natural habitats for the delmarva fox squirrel,which has been listed as an endangered species since.gerber babbitt,d,see final environmental assessment ea at at.according to the service,residential developments may harm fox squirrels by fragmenting and degrading their habitat,disrupting their normal behavior patterns,increasing their risk of being struck by vehicles,and exposing them to attacks from pets.see draft hcp at at.
in,winchester asked the service whether its development would result in the taking of fox squirrels and whether it should apply for a permit.the service responded that,as long as speed limits and leash laws were enforced in the area of the project,a taking would probably not occur and hence no permit was necessary.defenders promptly filed a lawsuit alleging that,in determining that winchester did not need a permit,the service had violated the esa,the national environmental policy act nepa,et,and the administrative procedure act apa.the service reconsidered its position and,after conducting an review of the scientific literature,advised winchester that the home port development would likely take fox squirrels,speed limits and leash laws notwithstanding.letter from fish and wildlife service fws to winchester at may,at.in light of the service shift in position,defenders agreed to dismiss their lawsuit.the dismissal was subject to a joint stipulation that the service would publish notice of the availability of a draft habitat conservation plan hcp and application for a n incidental take permit itp for the proposed homeport on winchester creek residential development project,and that it would mail defenders a courtesy copy of the draft hcp,itp application,and nepa documentation.joint stipulation at.
on december,the service issued the required federal register notice announcing the receipt of winchester application for a permit.the notice stated that persons wishing to review the permit application,hcp,ea,and ia implementing agreement may obtain a copy by writing the service chesapeake bay field office.notice of availability and receipt of application.it also stated that d ocuments will be available for public inspection by written request to that office.id.the draft environmental assessment explained that winchester planned to designate another forested parcel in queen anne county for an conservation easement to compensate in part for the take of fox squirrels at home port.draft ea at at.in accordance with the stipulation entered into as a condition of dismissing the earlier lawsuit,the service mailed defenders copies of winchester permit application and accompanying draft hcp.that material,however,did not include a map of,or otherwise specify the location of,the proposed mitigation site.nor was that omission limited to the package sent to defenders the map was absent from all public distributions made by the agency.
prior to publication of the federal register notice,defenders had submitted a freedom of information act foia request to the service for a ny and all documents that relate to or in anyway pertain to the homeport on winchester creek development or to the conservation of the endangered delmarva fox squirrel.foia request at at after the notice was issued and defenders received copies of the application and hcp,the service responded to defender foia request.it advised that,while the public review documents were released to you on december,other documents were subject to withholding.letter from fws to defenders at,at.
thereafter,defenders filed extensive comments on winchester permit application.they maintained,however,that they could not evaluate the suitability of the mitigation site as fox squirrel hence could not evaluate the overall impact of winchester knowing the site location.see defenders comments at at.they requested the location information,as well as a extension of the comment period to address that information.see id.at,at.
the service issued its final decision regarding the permit on april,and issued the permit itself on may.in approving the permit,the service stated that the losses of live squirrels and habitat caused by the home port development need to be mitigated,and that the developer planned to place acres of wooded habitat in a perpetual environmental easement as a conservation measure designed to mitigate those losses.findings and recommendations at at.the service also acknowledged that there was a reduced impact alternative to winchester plan that would reduce the likelihood of take of fox squirrels by relocating the development access road away from the squirrels forested edge habitat.final ea at at.it noted,however,that this alternative had been rejected by the applicant because it would entail additional costs and would delay the process of obtaining approval from the queen anne county zoning department.id.and although the service conceded that the location of the mitigation parcel was not adequately defined in the documentation released to defenders,response to comments at at,and for the first time attached a map of the mitigation area to the hcp,see final hcp,app.c at,the agency denied defenders request for a extension of the comment period,see response to comments at at.
on july,following the service announcement of its approval of the home port permit,defenders sent the agency a formal notification of their contention that the service had violated the esa by issuing the permit.defenders again complained that the agency had precluded the public from meaningfully commenting on the permit application by failing to disclose the location of the area relied on for mitigation of the project adverse effects on delmarva fox squirrels.letter from defenders to fws at july,at.they noted some of the drawbacks to the site chosen that they would have pointed out had they known of the location during the comment period,restated their objection to the rejection of the reduced impact alternative,and requested a reopening of the comment period.id.at at.the service denied defenders request,replying that it can not find a way to offer meaningful resolution of your allegations at this time.letter from fws to defenders,at.
on september,defenders filed suit against the service,alleging inter alia that the agency had violated the esa and the apa by failing to provide the map during the comment period,and by stating winchester view of the practicability of the reduced impact alternative rather than making its own findings.on may,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the service.the court reasoned that,even if the service had erred by not making a map of the mitigation area available for public comment,the error was harmless.the district court also ruled that the service had not failed to find that the reduced impact alternative was impracticable.see gerber.supp d at 
defenders appeal the district court decision regarding both the map and the impracticability finding.we review the issues de novo,as if the agency decision had been appealed to this court directly.ftc.we examine those issues under the provisions of the apa and our task is to determine whether the agency decision was made without observance of procedure required by law,d,or whether it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,id.a.
defenders first contention is that the service violated section of the esa,by failing to make the map of the mitigation area available during the comment period.we agree with defenders that the service did violate section,and further agree that the violation was not harmless.
although the district court suggested that the service was not required to make the map available because there is no authority for the proposition that plaintiffs were entitled to know every detail of the hcp,d at,the service abandons that argument on appeal.and rightly so.section c expressly provides that i nformation received by the service as part of any incidental take permit application shall be available to the public as a matter of public record at every stage of the proceeding.c.while winchester apparently did not physically attach the map to the draft hcp it submitted to the service,appellees br.at,there is no dispute that winchester did submit the map,that the map was received by the service,and that it was received as part of winchester application for an incidental take permit.indeed,the service expressly made the map part of the final hcp that was released after the comment period closed.final hcp,app.c at.accordingly,as the service now concedes,i n the circumstances presented here,the map of the mitigation parcel had to be made available to the public,because it was intended to be part of winchester application.appellees br.at.
the service was also required to make the map available pursuant to section a of the esa,which instructs the agency to provide an opportunity for public comment,with respect to a permit application and the related conservation plan.a b.that opportunity for comment must be a meaningful opportunity.see american med.ass reno,engine mfrs.ass epa,connecticut light power nuclear regulatory comm n.but as defenders quite reasonably complained,they could not meaningfully comment on the mitigation value of the parcel without knowing its location.see defenders comments at at noting inability to assess the suitability of the site without knowing,inter alia,whether it was adjacent to other development areas.and given the service conclusion that the mitigation area was necessary for approval of the permit there could not have been a meaningful opportunity to comment on the application without a meaningful opportunity to comment on the site.see engine mfrs.ass n,at t he administrative procedure act requires the agency to make available to the public,in a form that allows for meaningful comment,the data the agency used to develop the proposed rule.as the agency concedes,since the parcel had been identified by winchester and examined for habitat value by the service,the map should have been included in the draft hcp.appellees br.at.
finally,there is no dispute that disclosure of the map was also mandated by the stipulation that ended the earlier lawsuit between the parties.that stipulation required the service to mail defenders a courtesy copy of the draft hcp,permit application,and nepa documentation.joint stipulation at.since the government concedes that the map should have been included in the draft hcp,appellees br.at nn,the stipulation required the agency to send the map to defenders.
although the service agrees that it had to make the map publicly available during the comment period,and that it did not include a copy with the documents mailed to defenders and other requesters,the agency nonetheless insists that it complied with section.it did so,the service claims,by having the map available for public inspection at its chesapeake bay field office.according to the agency,all defenders had to do was visit the field office a resident official would then gladly have produced the map for their personal inspection.
there is,however,no contemporaneous evidence that the map was available for inspection at the field office.when defenders complained in their comments that the documents they received did not disclose the location of the mitigation site,defenders comments at at,the service did not immediately respond that defenders should visit the field office.instead,the service agree d that the mitigation site is not adequately defined.response to comments at at.the service contends that the initial federal register notice announcing the winchester application indicated that the map was available for examination at the service field office.appellees br.at.there was,however,no such indication in the notice.the notice stated that documents would be mailed to requesters,and that d ocuments will be available for public inspection in the chesapeake bay field office.notice of availability and receipt of application.at.it did not suggest that the documents available at the field office would be different from those available by mail,and certainly not in such an important respect.finally,although the service submitted a affidavit by an assistant regional endangered species coordinator asserting that he would have provided the map had defenders requested the information for the mitigation area in a timely manner,smith decl.at,we will not consider that affidavit.upon the service motion,the district court issued a protective order denying defenders request to conduct discovery to probe the accuracy and veracity of th at assertion by defendants declarant.gerber rule f decl.at see mem.order at at fed.defs.mem.in supp.of mot.for protective order at.it would be extraordinarily unfair to permit the service to rely on such a factual assertion,and at the same time allow the agency to deny its opponents the ability to test the assertion veracity through discovery.
the district court suggested that the service had intentionally refused to make the map public.t he omission of the map from plaintiffs courtesy copy appears to have been deliberate,the court said,because t he mitigation site was apparently the subject of a pending real estate transaction as to which the service had provided winchester creek some assurance of confidentiality.gerber,d at.on june,winchester advised the service that it was ready to fax the agency its mitigation plans.prior to doing so,however,winchester insisted that it must have fish wildlife service agreement that the plans will not be released under foia.fax from winchester to fws,june,at.the developer required this agreement,it explained,because it had not yet purchased the site and public knowledge of the need could result in higher costs to winchester.id.the service responded the same day,assuring winchester that it concurred that the materials you are offering to send qualif y for exemption under the freedom of information act.letter from fws to winchester june,at.winchester promptly faxed the plans,noting the agreement that the location of the proposed site is to be confidential.fax from winchester to fws,june,at.
we need not determine whether the service failure to disclose the map was in fact deliberate in order to decide the validity of defenders challenge.whether or not the agency intentionally kept the map from the public,and whether or not it would have provided the map had defenders made the trip to the field office,we conclude that the map was not publicly available within the meaning of section c of the esa there is no dispute that,per the stipulation,the package of documents sent by the service to defenders should have contained the map as part of the permit application and draft hcp.see also hcp handbook at at stating that the incidental take permit application package must be provided to all affected interests who request the package or have a record of significant interest in the planning program.defenders were thus justified in concluding that,had there been a publicly available map,it would have been included in the package.nothing in the federal register served to disabuse an interested party of that reasonable conclusion.mci telecomms.fcc.to the contrary,in responding to defenders foia request,the service advised the comment while the public review documents were released to you on december,other documents pertaining to the home port development were subject to withholding under one or more of the exceptions to foia,including the exemption for confidential commercial information of the submitter.letter from fws to defenders at,at.
under these circumstances,defenders would not reasonably have thought that they could obtain the critically important location map simply by visiting the service field office.our cases make clear that an agency may not turn the provision of notice into a bureaucratic game of hide and seek.mci telecomms,at see connecticut light power,at to allow an agency to play hunt the peanut with technical information,hiding or disguising the information that it employs,is to condone a practice in which the agency treats what should be a genuine interchange as mere bureaucratic sport.whatever the service intention,it plainly misled defenders and other interested members of the public into believing that a map of the mitigation site was not in the public record.it thus violated the requirement of section c that it make the complete permit application available to the public,as well as the requirement of section a that it provide the public with a meaningful opportunity to comment on the application.
having concluded that the service committed an error,we next consider whether the error was harmless,as the district court held.under the apa,courts must take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.see first am.discount cftc.to show that error was prejudicial,a plaintiff must indicate with reasonable specificity what portions of the documents it objects to and how it might have responded if given the opportunity.mclouth steel prods.thomas,quoting small refiner lead task force epa.defenders have met that requirement to an extent we have rarely seen in apa cases,and have demonstrated as well as any plaintiffs could that they suffered prejudice from the agency failure to provide an opportunity for public comment.
as we have just held,it is clear that the map of the mitigation area was indispensable if defenders were to have a meaningful opportunity to comment on winchester permit application.when they finally did obtain the map,defenders specified at least three serious problems that suggested the site would not provide adequate mitigation for the taking that would occur at home port.in their letter,defenders stated that if they had known of the site location,they would have pointed out,inter alia,that the site is bordered on the west by a road sportsm an neck road that serves approximately homes,thus raising questions about the survivability of any fox squirrels who do manage to occupy the site.letter from defenders to fws at july,at.in their filings,defenders further contended that the site borders another residential subdivision mainbrace that is currently under development,a the would expose the fox squirrels to domestic pets and automobile traffic,thus casting further doubt on the suitability of the mitigation site as a refuge.they also charged that the mitigation site was already protected by an covenant,and hence that its designation by winchester would not add any new protection for the fox squirrels.see gerber aff.at.
although the district court held that plaintiffs have not shown that they would have offered any additional commentary if they had been shown the map,d at,the service does not seriously dispute that defenders have satisfied the specification requirement.instead,the agency contends that,even without benefit of comments from defenders,it knew about the potential for development adjacent to the mitigation site and was aware of the location of sportsman neck road when it decided to grant the permit.appellees br.at.in support of this contention,the service principally relies on two documents a discussion of the adjacent mainbrace subdivision submitted by winchester and a map of the mitigation site.id.citing at.neither is sufficient to overcome defenders showing of prejudice.
first,we are not at all convinced from these citations that the service did know of the three problems that defenders have identified with respect to the mitigation site.having winchester view that significant development on the mainbrace parcel was unlikely was hardly the same as having defenders view,as the developer understandably downplayed the potential for development in the area of the mitigation site.see letter from winchester to fws at july,at.the winchester submission did not even mention sportsman neck road,so the most the service can say about that problem is that it was aware of the location because it had a map on which the road was included.needless to say,however,possessing a map that shows the physical location of a road is not the same thing as knowing the problems that the road may pose.finally,at oral argument the service conceded that there was no document of any kind that could have drawn the service attention to the third problem identified by defenders the fact that an covenant already existed on the mitigation site,thus drawing into question whether placing a conservation easement on the site added anything to existing protections for fox squirrels.
second,knowing is not,in any event,the same as actually considering the problems raised by defenders.the service can not point to any discussion in the agency own decisional documents that addresses any of the three problems plaintiffs highlighted.the best the agency can muster is a memorandum to the file,dated more than four months after defenders filed their complaint,collecting documentation purportedly showing that the mainbrace subdivision and sportsman neck road were considered during the development and review of the mitigation package.mem.to file at,at see also letter from fws to defenders at,at
