this case poses the question whether the word daily,as used in the clean water act,is sufficiently pliant to mean a measure of time other than daily.specifically,the environmental protection agency epa takes the position that congress,in requiring the establishment of total maximum daily loads to cap effluent discharges of suitable pollutants into highly polluted waters,left room for epa to establish seasonal or annual loads for those same pollutants.the district court found epa contextual and policy arguments sufficiently persuasive to disregard the plain meaning of daily,but we do not.daily means daily,nothing else.if epa believes using daily loads for certain types of pollutants has undesirable consequences,then it must either amend its regulation designating all pollutants as suitable for daily loads or take its concerns to congress.we therefore reverse and remand with instructions to vacate the daily loads.
flowing from maryland through the northeast and southeast quadrants of washington,and a stone throw away from the site for the washington nationals new stadium,the anacostia river has the dubious distinction of being one of the ten most polluted rivers in the country.kingman park civic ass epa,d.as such,it falls far short of meeting water quality standards set pursuant to the clean water act cwa and designed to protect designated recreational uses like fishing and swimming.b c mandating the achievement of water quality standards,to be codified at mun,tit,establishing water quality standards based on uses including primary contact recreation and consumption of fish shellfish.
for bodies of water,like the anacostia river,that fail to meet applicable water quality standards,the cwa requires states defined by the act to include the district of columbia,to establish a total maximum daily load,or tmdl,
for those pollutants which the administrator identifies as suitable for such calculation.such load shall be established at a level necessary to implement the applicable water quality standards with seasonal variations and a margin of safety which takes into account any lack of knowledge concerning the relationship between effluent limitations and water quality.
id.d c.in,epa issued a regulation deeming a ll pollutants suitable for the calculation of total maximum daily loads.total maximum daily loads under clean water act,emphasis added.this regulation remains unchanged today.
once approved by epa,tmdls must be incorporated into permits allocating effluent discharges among all pollution sources,including point sources like factories and sources like.see a authorizing epa to issue effluent discharge permits upon condition that such discharge will meet among other requirements all applicable requirements under section id.b c mandating the achievement of any more stringent limitation,including those necessary to meet water quality standards see also d vii b requiring permitting authority to set effluent limits consistent with the assumptions and requirements of any available wasteload allocation for the discharge prepared by the state and approved by epa.if pollution loads stay below the applicable tmdls for a given body of water,then in theory the body of water should achieve its water quality standards.
this case arises from the violation of two of the anacostia key water quality standards.first,because the river contains many biochemical pollutants that consume oxygen,its dissolved oxygen level has sunk below the applicable water quality standard,putting the river aquatic life at risk of suffocation.second,the river is murkier than the applicable turbidity standard allows,stunting the growth of plants that rely on sunlight and impairing recreational use.
to remedy these violations,epa approved one tmdl limiting the annual discharge of pollutants,and a second limiting the seasonal discharge of pollutants contributing to turbidity.see letter from rebecca hanmer,water prot,epa,to james collier,chief,bureau of envtl.quality,substances epa,total suspended solids,total maximum daily loads for the anacostia river,total suspended solids.neither tmdl limited daily discharges.
appellant friends of the earth foe petitioned this court for review of the tmdl approvals,arguing among other things that the cwa requires the establishment of total maximum daily loads,not seasonal or annual loads.concluding that we lacked subject matter jurisdiction,we transferred the case to the district court,friends of the earth epa,which granted epa motion for summary judgment,friends of the earth epa,d.the court held that the text of the cwa does not reveal a clear congressional intent to require epa to calculate only daily tmdls,id.at,found epa resolution of the resulting ambiguity reasonable,and concluded that the tmdl approvals were neither arbitrary nor capricious.this appeal followed.
because congress has charged epa with the cwa implementation,we review the agency interpretation of the phrase total maximum daily load under chevron natural resources defense council,d.see natural res.def.council,epa,applying chevron to epa interpretation of the cwa.critically,if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,that is the end of the matter.chevron,at.so here.
we begin,as always,with the statute language.for waters that fail to achieve water quality standards,see d a,the cwa provides that e ach state shall establish the total maximum daily load,for those pollutants which the administrator identifies as suitable for such calculation,id.d c emphasis added.because epa has found a ll pollutants suitable for the calculation of total maximum daily loads.at,it follows that the cwa requires the district of columbia to establish a total maximum daily load for each pollutant that contributes to the anacostia violation of the dissolved oxygen and turbidity standards.
nothing in this language even hints at the possibility that epa can approve total maximum seasonal or annual loads.the law says daily.we see nothing ambiguous about this command.daily connotes every day.see webster third new international dictionary defining daily to mean occurring or being made,done,or acted upon every day.doctors making daily rounds would be of little use to their patients if they appeared seasonally or annually.and no one thinks of g ive us this day our daily bread as a prayer for sustenance on a seasonal or annual basis.matthew king james.
when asked at oral argument how congress could have spoken more clearly,epa counsel responded that one way it could do that is to say that the total maximum daily load shall be expressed as a quantity per day or average per day or something like that.tr.of oral arg.at.but a load expressed as a quantity per day is no different from a daily load,and we have never held that congress must repeat itself or use extraneous words before we acknowledge its unambiguous intent.see new york epa,refusing to require congress to use superfluous words.if congress wanted seasonal or annual loads,it could easily have authorized them by calling for total maximum daily,seasonal,or annual loads.or by providing for the establishment of total maximum loads,congress could have left a gap for epa to fill.instead,congress specified total maximum daily loads.we can not imagine a clearer expression of intent.
epa urges us to read the phrase in context,emphasizing that tmdls must be established at a level necessary to implement the applicable water quality standards.d c.according to epa,t hat congress took the step of elaborating on what a tmdl should be is a strong indication that it was not using the word daily as the exclusive expression of its intent on the question of how a tmdl should be established.fed.appellees br.this can not be right.as written,the statute requires states to establish daily loads that also meet applicable water quality standards.the existence of two conditions does not authorize epa to disregard one of them.
as additional context appearing nowhere in the tmdl approvals tells us that some pollutants are poorly suited to daily load regulation.discharges of such pollutants,epa explains,might not immediately affect water quality,but could instead in
