petitioners mossville environmental action now and sierra club seek review of an environmental protection agency epa rule styled national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for polyvinyl chloride and copolymers production.july,the part neshap.this rule,adopted pursuant to section of the clean air act caa,set emission standards for pvc and copolymer production facilities that mirrored epa previous rule,articulated at,subpart f the part neshap or the part standard,because the epa determined that the part neshap were the most stringent controls in the industry.
petitioners contend that epa has failed to meet the requirements of the caa in setting various limits for vinyl chloride emission.they further contend that epa erred in failing to set emission limits for all of the other hazardous air pollutants haps emitted during pvc production.two of petitioners arguments regarding vinyl chloride emissions limits have been waived,and we do not find meritorious their remaining challenges to those limits.we do,however,hold that epa has failed properly to set emissions limits on other haps,as required by the caa.the petition is therefore granted in part and denied in part.
background 
statutory background 
this is the latest in a series of challenges to rulemakings establishing emission standards for haps in various industries under the revisions to the caa.see,northeast.waste disposal auth.epa,per curiam municipal waste combustors sierra club epa,copper smelters cement kiln recycling coalition epa,hazardous waste combustors lime ass epa,portland cement manufacturing facilities sierra club epa,medical waste incinerators appalachian power epa,per curiam electric utility boilers.
section of the caa was amended in to include a congressionally established list of haps.b.vinyl chloride is included on that list.id.the caa directs the epa to establish categories and subcategories of major sources that emit one or more of the enumerated haps.id.c.the statute further requires the epa to issue emission standards,known as national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap,for those sources.there are essentially two steps in this process.
the caa establishes a minimum required as the maximum achievable control technology floor mact floor.the mact floor for new sources shall not be less stringent than the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source,as determined by the administrator.id.d.for existing sources 
emission standards may be less stringent than standards for new sources in the same category or subcategory but shall not be less stringent,and may be more stringent than 
b the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing sources for which the administrator has or could reasonably obtain emissions information in the category or subcategory for categories with fewer than sources.
once floor standards are established,the epa determines if standards more stringent than those actually achieved by the best performing sources are possible.these standards must 
require the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of the hazardous air pollutants subject to this section including a prohibition on such emissions,where achievable that the administrator,taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction,and any quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements,determines is achievable for new or existing sources in the category or subcategory to which such emission standard applies.
id.d.these are known as standards.in setting standards,the epa is to require the maximum degree of reduction in emission of the hazardous air pollutant that is achievable 
through application of measures,processes,methods,systems or techniques including,but not limited to,measures which 
a reduce the volume of,or eliminate emissions of,such pollutants through process changes,substitution of materials or other modifications,
b enclose systems or processes to eliminate emissions,
c collect,capture or treat such pollutants when released from a process,stack,storage or fugitive emissions point,
d are design,equipment,work practice,or operational standards including requirements for operator training or certification as provided in subsection h of this section,or 
e are a combination of the above.
id.the epa must balance these considerations with other factors such as cost,health and environmental concerns,and energy implications.id.this regime replaced an earlier regime that required epa to regulate at a level that provided an ample margin of safety to protect the public.
additionally,section d requires the epa to set emission standards for every hap emitted from each category or subcategory of major sources.id.d see also lime ass epa,national lime stating epa has the clear statutory obligation to set emission standards for each listed hap.
regulatory background 
vinyl chloride,a gas that is highly toxic and a known human carcinogen,is the starting point for pvc and copolymer production.it is first pressurized and agitated in a reactor,resulting in polymerization.once polymerized,vinyl chloride can be transformed into many diverse products,from latex paints to pvc piping.vinyl chloride can enter the atmosphere in several ways during pvc production.the gas can escape to the atmosphere when equipment is opened for routine maintenance,either through leaks in the production system,or by being present in such low concentrations that it escapes through recovery systems in exhaust streams.this form of pollution is often referred to as stack emissions or exhaust gasses.there is also some residual vinyl chloride in the pvc itself,know as residual vinyl chloride monomer rvcm.rvcm is removed from the pvc through a process known as stripping.stripping results in vinyl chloride emissions as well.those emissions are often referred to as process equipment emissions or rvcm emissions.
in,prior to the implementation of standards,the epa promulgated emission standards for vinyl chloride under the standard then in effect.fed.reg,subpart f the part neshap.pertinent to this case,under the part standard epa regulated exhaust gasses from the reactors of polyvinyl chloride plants at ten parts per million ppm averaged over a period.see,a.rvcm emissions were regulated at ppm per plant for pvc dispersion resins,excluding latex resins,e i,and ppm per plant for all other pvc resins,averaged daily.id.at e ii.
when congress amended the caa in,it required the epa within ten years to review its emission standards to ensure compliance with the amended caa.q.pursuant to this command,epa addressed the part neshap in two separate rules.the first,known as the hazardous organic neshap hon rule,addresses and supersedes the part neshap as it relates to the production of ethylene dichloride and vinyl chloride.fed.reg.july,see part,subparts f,g,and h.the hon rule,however,explicitly excludes batch operations,such as pvc production,from its scope.j.because batch operations were covered by the part neshap,another rulemaking was required to deal with the part neshap application to batch operations,including pvc production.that rule is the part neshap at issue here.
to set the part standards,the epa first determined that sources in the united states produce pvc and all are subject to the part neshap.fed.reg.at.the epa then considered state emission requirements and determined that the part neshap requirements,not state requirements,had the greatest influence on emission controls.the epa further determined that no better technology was available than the part standard already required.looking specifically at rvcm emission from pvc resins,the epa recognized that while some states had more stringent standards in place,those standards were based on quarterly averages,while the part standard was based on daily limits.id.the epa found that comparing these standards was difficult because of the different measuring periods.in addition,the epa found that the amount of rvcm emission is primarily dependent on what type of pvc resins each plant manufactures.there is thus a wide variation of rvcm emission during normal operation,and epa found that the daily limits ensure that operators keep average rvcm emission low so that the spikes do not cause the average to violate the daily limits.the epa also found that the most stringent state standards had been imposed on plants that produced pvc resins that were the most capable of stripping to low rvcm levels.fed.reg.at.because these state limitations were specific to the products at each plant,epa determined that the state permit limits were not generally applicable.
in sum,the epa concluded that the part neshap satisfied all of the requirements set forth in the amendments,and adopted almost all of the old part neshap standards as the new part neshap standards.thus,the part standards became the floor for existing sources pursuant to section of the caa.the epa then declined to adopt measures,citing,inter alia,the possibility that certain pvc production would be prohibited if more stringent standards were adopted.
additionally,the epa determined that it was unnecessary to set separate individual emission standards for all other haps that result from pvc production,as required by section d,because it could simply use vinyl chloride as a surrogate for those other haps.this,according to the epa,was because the stripping,scrubbing,incineration,or combination thereof,that is required under the part standard limits emission of all haps,not just vinyl chloride.unsatisfied with these standards,petitioners have sought review of the part neshap here.
ii.analysis 
this court sets aside final epa action under the caa if that action is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.d see motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.under this familiar standard,a gency determinations based upon highly complex and technical matters are entitled to great deference.appalachian power epa,per curiam quoting public citizen health research group brock.
we first deal with whether certain of petitioners claims are properly before us.the epa contends that two of petitioners epa erred in setting the floor for exhaust gasses and erred in failing to establish waived as they were not properly raised before the agency below.we turn first to epa establishment of a floor for exhaust gasses.
in its rulemaking,the epa determined that no more stringent limits applied to vinyl chloride exhaust gas streams than the ten ppm limit in the part neshap,and established that limit as the floor.fed.reg.at.petitioners claim that their concerns regarding this issue were sufficiently raised in two letters submitted to the epa by parties not involved in this case.the question is whether these letters were sufficiently specific to raise the issue before the epa.
the first is a february,letter from the state and territorial air pollution programs administrators stappa and the association of local air pollution control officials alapco to the epa stappa letter.that letter addresses different aspects of the rule,but with respect to the setting of mact floors it specifically addresses the ppm standard for residual vinyl chloride in the pvc slurry.indeed,it mentions the ppm standard,which applies to rvcm emissions,four times in the six paragraphs that address the mact floor.it does not,however,ever mention the ten ppm standard that applies to exhaust emissions.nor do those paragraphs ever mention gasses or exhaust.the letter thus did not specifically challenge the ten ppm exhaust gas limit.
in an effort to avoid the lack of a specific challenge,petitioners argue that nothing in the letter directly limits the fact that their objection is a general one to epa floor approach.this will not do.only an objection to a rule or procedure which was raised with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment including any public hearing may be raised during judicial review.d b.we strictly enforce this requirement.motor equip.mfrs.ass nichols,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.reasonable specificity requires something more than a general challenge to epa approach.the language in the letter that petitioners rely upon is a sentence,in the last paragraph addressing mact floors,that states that control device performance and capabilities and process improvements have evolved to a point below the part standards.according to petitioners,because only the ten ppm standard is based on the performance of control devices,it is clear that the comments were not limited to the ppm floor.this fails.in a letter so obviously focused on the ppm standard,such general reference in the closing paragraph does not rise to the reasonable specificity required by the statute 
the second letter that petitioners claim raised the issue is dated february,and is from the state of louisiana to the epa the louisiana letter.this letter also does not mention the ten ppm standard,but again directly addresses rvcm emissions.it does,however,have an attached table,which the letter claims proves that state limits are more stringent than the part standards.one of the eight columns in the table is labeled misc.process vents,and includes data that could be exhaust limits.again,and for the reasons stated above,this does not meet the standard of reasonable specificity.the letter does not directly address the ten ppm standard,and attaching a table that cryptically refers to miscellaneous process vents does not automatically put the epa on notice of a challenge to every piece of information contained in the table.in sum,petitioners challenge to the floor on exhaust gasses is waived because it was not raised with reasonable specificity to the agency below.
we now turn to petitioners claim that epa erred in failing to establish standards pursuant to caa section d.d.epa again claims that this argument is waived.for their part,petitioners again point to the stappa and louisiana letters as bringing the concerns to the attention of the epa.in our view,both the stappa and louisiana letters fail to raise the issue with reasonable specificity.
the louisiana letter consists of four numbered paragraphs.the first paragraph,by its own language,addresses the mact floor.the fourth deals with epa failure to regulate other haps.the second and third paragraph present petitioners best argument that louisiana raised the issue,but they are simply not specific enough.the second paragraph states that louisiana permits are more stringent than the currently proposed mact requirements.the third paragraph describes the part standard as old,and asserts that better technology is available.while these two paragraphs could imply not only a challenge to the setting of the mact floor,but also a challenge to epa failure to set standards,that is all it does potentially imply a challenge.there is no mention of standards.
it is just not clear that the state of louisiana,in a letter that contained specific and clear challenges to the setting of the rvcm mact floor,was also challenging the standards.while petitioners may argue that it is obvious that if one challenges the floor,one is also implicitly challenging the failure to set standards,that is not the way the regulatory system is structured.such a standard would require agencies to review perpetually all of the implied challenges in any challenge they receive.we will not impose such a burden on the agency.all that louisiana had to do was draft one sentence that specifically challenged epa decision.it did not,and that specific challenge is thus not preserved.
the same is true of the stappa letter.it specifically addresses stappa concern that epa proposed standard does not meet the mact floor requirements of section d.in closing the pertinent section,stappa requests that the epa recalculate the mact floor using information about other sources like the louisiana letter,this letter fails to mention standards,nor does it cite the specific provision of the caa which deals with them.in motor equipment manufacturers,we considered petitioners claims waived because they failed to cite the specific provision to the agency below.at holding that a petitioner claim that epa should comply with caa section does not put the agency on sufficient notice for a specific claim re
