since,an association of property owners known as the preservation council association has been engaged in litigation challenging the regulatory program that protects one of the most pristine environmental habitats on the planet.the association has fought vigorously for the interests of owners of property in the lake tahoe basin basin,an aesthetically and ecologically cherished region straddling the border.the extensive litigation between the association and the basin regulatory body,the tahoe regional planning agency agency,has thus far generated ten published opinions,four from this court alone.
the current action is a challenge to provisions of the agency regional plan plan.in,we dismissed similar claims brought by the association pursuant to the applicable statutes of limitations.because the current by the same lead plaintiff,acting on behalf of organizational members with the same from the same transactional nucleus of facts,we find that the instant suit is barred by the doctrine of res judicata.we therefore affirm.
factual background 
lake tahoe,the dominant presence in this litigation,is a remarkable alpine lake located in the northern sierra nevada mountains and spanning the border.council,tahoe reg l planning agency,d,hereinafter tahoe iv trial,aff in part and rev in part,cir hereinafter tahoe iv appeal.in part,lake tahoe is so remarkable because it is so startlingly clear.its clarity is a result of the fact that lake tahoe has been,for most of its history,oligotrophic that is,very low in dissolved nutrients.
since,however,lake tahoe has been undergoing eutrophication,a process by which its nutrient content increases dramatically due to phosphorusrich soil that is washed into the lake.these nutrients encourage the growth of algae,which renders the formerly clear blue water green and increasingly opaque.moreover,the algae depletes oxygen in the water,jeopardizing the survival of fish and other animal life.
the dramatic increase in lake tahoe nutrient levels has been caused by the rapid development of environmentally sensitive land in the basin.the land in the basin drains into the lake,and artificial disturbance of the the destruction of vegetation,the creation of surfaces roads,houses impervious to rain,and other increases the erosion of soil and consequent flow of nutrients into the lake.the degree to which the development of any particular parcel of land contributes to nutrient flow depends on various characteristics of the parcel in general,the development of steeper land leads to more environmental damage,because steeper land is susceptible to more rapid soil erosion.other property characteristics may also cause disproportionate impact for example,certain areas near streams and other wetlands,known as stream environment zones sezs,act as filters for much of the rainfall runoff,and disturbance of these lands can rapidly discharge stored nutrients into the lake as well as prevent the beneficial filtration process from taking place.
in,to regulate development and ensure the preservation of the environmentally precious basin,the agency was formed pursuant to a compact approved by the states of california and nevada and the united states congress.see tahoe iv trial,d at cal.stat.ch,amended by cal.stat.ch.stat.act of,stat.the agency adopted a land taxonomy scheme known as the bailey system,which classified areas of the basin into one of several land capability districts,from district the most environmentally sensitive to district the least sensitive.land capability districts through steepest lands in the denominated high hazard or sensitive lands.due to their unique environmental fragility,the bailey system classified stream environment zones sezs separately,as a special subcategory of sensitive lands.the agency then adopted recommendations for the amount of development that each district would be allowed to sustain 
although the agency regulatory scheme seemed facially sound,it was diluted in its implementation by numerous exceptions permitting development on sensitive lands.over the next decade,i t became evident that the environment was continuing to decline,and that the compact was not strong enough to fix the problem.tahoe iv trial,d at.after california imposed stricter regulations on its own territory,the compact was amended in to increase the level of environmental protection for the basin as a whole.cal.stat.ch,codified as amended at c.gov t code.stat.codified at.stat.act of,stat.this new compact restructured the agency and required it to review all proposed land use projects,impose temporary restrictions on development,and establish a new regional environmental preservation plan.the agency then adopted ordinances regulating development in the basin pending the approval of this new plan 
on april,the agency adopted the new plan.immediately,california challenged the plan in federal court,and on june,the court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting the agency from issuing any development permits in the basin.see people tahoe reg l planning agency,cir upholding the injunction.
a.the plan 
on july,the agency issued a completely revised regional principal subject of this the injunction put in place by the california lawsuit was vacated.the plan implemented a new land classification system named the individual parcel evaluation system ipes.see suitum tahoe reg l planning agency,d describing ipes.the agency describes ipes as an objective system that rates the relative environmental suitability of vacant residential parcels for building and other modifications.a multidisciplinary team of experts is responsible for assigning a given parcel an ipes score from to based on enumerated criteria a parcel with a higher score is environmentally more resilient,and can safely withstand more development.each of the plaintiffs parcels received an ipes score at some time in,or no plaintiff currently challenges the accuracy of his ipes score.
for purposes of this litigation,the ipes score is relevant in its relation to the ipes line ipes line.under the plan,only those property owners with ipes scores above the ipes line are eligible to submit an application for permission to develop their parcels.see trpa code.e.the agency then reviews the eligible applications,and selects applicants per year from the entire basin to receive a building permit.an owner without one of these permits is not permitted to develop his property 
the plan also allows a property owner whose ipes score is within ten percent of the ipes line to complete an water quality mitigation project or to pay a mitigation fee.thereafter,the owner ipes score may be raised above the ipes line,enabling the owner to apply for one of the annual development permits.see trpa code.i app.j.
moving the ipes line 
the ipes line is not permanently fixed.rather,if and when certain objective criteria are met,and the environmental status of the basin as a whole becomes more secure,the ipes line is lowered,permitting more development on individual parcels.
in december,the agency set the initial level of the ipes line at points,effective upon implementation of the ipes system on july.however,the plan provides that the agency must annually conduct a review of each county in the basin and determine if the ipes line shall be according to a specified formula.only if a particular county meets specified criteria does the agency apply the formula to lower the ipes permit more that county.one of the critical threshold criteria that must be satisfied before the agency can lower the ipes line is the vacant lot equation,measuring the countywide proportion of sensitive parcels available for development.see trpa code.c e the vacant lot equation must drop to in california counties and in nevada counties before the ipes line is lowered.this means that before the ipes line can be lowered in a california county,for example,of the parcels designated as sensitive in must have been permanently protected from development.id.
by,the agency had surveyed the land within the basin,and had calculated the vacant lot equation in each county.the result was roughly consistent with early estimates in nevada,but higher than initially predicted in california 
thereafter,on an annual basis,the agency recalculated the vacant lot equation,made the additional findings mandated by the plan,and determined whether it was required to adjust the ipes line.
in nevada,agreements on sensitive parcels caused the vacant lot equation to reach in,which permitted the agency to lower the ipes line,which in turn permitted more development.after a public hearing,on january,the agency governing board board set the ipes line at in washoe county,nevada,and at in douglas county,nevada.on december,after another public hearing,the board again set the ipes line at in washoe county,nevada,but moved the ipes line to in douglas county,nevada.the ipes line remains at these limits today,leaving only a relatively small number of environmentally sensitive lots in nevada below the threshold necessary to apply for development permits.
in california,however,enough sensitive parcels remain available for development that the vacant lot equation has not yet reached its california trigger level the equation has not reached the required by the agency code before the ipes line will move.at its january,meeting,therefore,the board held the ipes line at for both california counties in the basin.on december,the board again confirmed that the ipes line would remain at.the ipes line remains at today in both california counties.
ii.procedural background 
litigation involving the same material set of facts is now on its fifth journey through the federal court system this extensive procedural history need not be repeated in full.instead,we review here only that history which is necessary for our resolution of the present appeal.
a.the prior litigation 
the complaints in the various actions that have been filed encompass four different periods period i,from august,until august,when ordinance banned development in the basin with a few exceptions for nevada buildings period ii,from august,until april,when resolution banned all development in the basin period iii,from april,until june,when the regional plan was in effect and period iv,from july,until the present,since the regional plan became effective.
the initial litigation began on june,when the plaintiff association and various individual members filed a complaint in the district court for the district of nevada on behalf of nevada property owners and a complaint in the district court for the eastern district of california on behalf of california property owners.the complaints alleged that the development moratoria imposed by the agency regulations in periods i,ii,and iii constituted violations of the takings clause,the due process clause,the equal protection clause,and the contracts clause,and demanded declaratory,monetary,and injunctive relief.
over the next seven years,various portions of the claims were dismissed.after this court reviewed the case for the second time in,the only claims remaining were for damages from the agency to compensate for temporary takings in each of periods i,ii,and iii.see tspc trpa.tspc trpa.tahoe i appeal,tahoe ii appeal.
on october,for nevada plaintiffs,and march,for california plaintiffs,the association and its members filed amended complaints under,alleging that the agency development moratoria violated the takings clause.in these amended complaints,the association asserted for the first time takings claims covering period iv,the period in which the plan prohibited development for properties with scores below the ipes line.only these period iv claims are at issue here.
the cases were consolidated in the district court for the district of nevada,which dismissed the period iv claims as barred by the compact statute of limitations.the court first found that the facial takings claims relating to period iv accrued when the plan was adopted on july.tspc trpa.because these claims were not asserted until october,and march,when the complaints were amended the a limitations period from the that the claims were,and dismissed them with prejudice.id.at.
for the next six years,the parties litigated the statute of limitations to be applied to the period iv claims.see tahoe iii appeal,amended by,cert.denied,d tspc trpa.eventually,the district court concluded that the proper limitations period for the plaintiffs action was supplied by the state personal injury year in california and two years in that the agency had not waived its limitations defense.tspc trpa.because both the california and the nevada statute of limitations would have barred complaints filed on october,and march,alleging the unconstitutionality of a july,plan,the court dismissed all period iv claims.
in tahoe iv appeal,we reviewed the district court decision,and affirmed the statute of limitations finding.tahoe iv appeal,reh g en banc denied,cir,aff on other grounds,d.
b.the instant action 
the parties are now back before this court for a fifth round of litigation over the agency regulations.on january,the association as well as individual california plaintiffs and nine individual nevada plaintiffs,all of whom are members of the association hereafter collectively referred to as association,filed new complaints in the eastern district of california and the district of nevada,respectively,alleging violations of the takings clause and the equal protection clause and seeking relief under the plaintiffs assert that the agency implementation of its plan in period iv effected an unconstitutional taking of property.
specifically,the association contends that the takings resulted from the agency alleged misrepresentations regarding the time period within which the ipes line would drop,combined with its annual refusal to lower the ipes line threshold to permit development of each parcel.that is,the association contends that the takings were triggered by the allegedly improper january,and december,agency decisions to maintain the existing level of the ipes line,thus depriving the owners of property that remained below the line of the value of that property.these decisions allegedly made clear that the plaintiffs would not be permitted to develop the property in the reasonably foreseeable future,contrary to the agency initial representations.
the plaintiffs assert that the development moratoria imposed by the agency regulatory scheme constitute categorical takings or,in the alternative,that they are unconstitutional because they do not substantially advance legitimate state interests.those plaintiffs within of the ipes line plaintiffs,for whom development applications may be conditioned on the successful pursuit of a mitigation project or the payment of a mitigation fee,more specifically protest the nexus between their conditional moratoria and the asserted state interests,under the exactions doctrine of takings law.the association further challenges the agency absolute ban on development in sezs as an unconstitutional taking.finally,the association challenges the alleged decision to lower the ipes line more rapidly on the nevada side than on the california side as a denial of equal protection the essence of the complaint is that california property owners may be denied permission to develop their property,while nevada property owners with the same ipes score may be granted development permits.
after the cases were consolidated in the eastern district of california,the district court granted the agency motion to dismiss.it considered the three groups of plaintiffs separately property owners in a sez,property owners below the ipes line,and the plaintiffs challenging the scheme of mitigation conditions.the court found that any takings claim asserted by the sez plaintiffs accrued in,when they were notified that their land was classified as a sez,and therefore not capable of development.similarly,the court found that takings claims asserted by property owners below the ipes line accrued in,when the vacant lot equation preventing ipes line movement was calculated for the first time.the court found that the equation and other criteria for lowering the ipes line were fixed as of,and that the agency decisions regarding the ipes line did not retrigger the statute of limitations.because the complaints were filed in,but complained of injuries that the plaintiffs should have recognized at the latest in,the court found them barred by the statute of limitations.
the district court also determined that the takings claims of the plaintiffs were barred,or,alternatively,unripe.a facial exactions challenge to the plan would have accrued when the plan was enacted,and was therefore barred by the statute of limitations.in contrast,an challenge to the mitigation program required the plaintiffs to attempt to take advantage of the mitigation procedures.as no plaintiff had alleged an effort to do so,the court held that the plaintiffs claims were not ripe for review.
finally,the district court dismissed the equal protection challenge as,because the cause of action accrued when the regulation containing the allegedly unconstitutionally unequal provisions was enacted.because the plaintiffs knew in that the agency would treat plots with identical ipes scores differently depending on the state in which they were located,the district court found that the statute of limitations had run.
the district court dismissed the claims in july of.this timely appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs opportunity to litigate most of the claims at issue here passed long ago.although the association attempts to frame its complaint in terms of new injuries caused by new acts,this action is in reality a prayer for relief from wrongs allegedly done by the agency in connection with actions it took to implement the plan during the period from through.we have addressed many of these allegations before,when we considered the association and amended complaints collectively,the complaints attacking the plan.we acknowledge,however,that one set of claims,asserted by the plaintiffs,alleges harm that has not yet been done we analyze these unripe allegations in section,infra.as for the remaining claims,to the extent that they do not duplicate claims resolved in the tahoe iii and tahoe iv opinions,we find that they could and should have been raised in the earlier amended complaints,and are therefore precluded by the doctrine of res judicata.
although the district court did not reach the issue of claim preclusion,w e may affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record,even if the ground is not relied on by the district court.aetna life ins.bayona,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also dittman california,cir declining to address the district court statute of limitations analysis,and instead affirming on different grounds.because the facts giving rise to res judicata are amply supported by the record on appeal,we hold that the association claims except for the claims asserted by the plaintiffs are barred by the doctrine of res judicata,and affirm the judgment of the district court.as to the plaintiffs claims,we affirm their dismissal as well,but on ripeness grounds.accordingly,we express no view as to the statute of limitations arguments on which the district court based much of its ruling.
res judicata 
after eighteen years of litigation,ten years of which has been devoted to adjudicating harm allegedly done by the plan and its implementation,the final judgments of tahoe iii and tahoe iv should finally rest in peace.we steadfastly protect a litigant right to his day in court.once a sophisticated party has had a full and fair opportunity to be heard,however,we also recognize the merits of finality 
the doctrine of res judicata provides that a final judgment on the merits bars further claims by parties or their privies based on the same cause of action.the application of this doctrine is central to the purpose for which civil courts have been established,the conclusive resolution of disputes within their jurisdiction.moreover,a rule precluding parties from the contestation of matters already fully and fairly litigated conserves judicial resources and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions.
in re schimmels,cir quoting montana united states,d see also bell united states,wl,at the doctrine of res judicata is meant to protect parties against being harassed by repetitive actions.clements airport,cir preclusion doctrine encompasses vindication of both public and private interests.the private values protected include shielding litigants from the burden of identical issues with the same party,and vindicating private parties interest in repose.the public interests served include avoiding inconsistent results and preserving judicial economy.
three elements constitute a successful res judicata defense res judicata is applicable whenever there is an identity of claims,a final judgment on the merits,and privity between parties.stratosphere litig.grand casinos,cir citing owens kaiser found.health plan,cir.
identity of claims 
the fact that res judicata depends on an identity of claims does not mean that an imaginative attorney may avoid preclusion by attaching a different legal label to an issue that has,or could have,been litigated.rather,i dentity of claims exists when two suits arise from the same transactional nucleus of facts.id.quoting owens,at.newly articulated claims based on the same nucleus of facts may still be subject to a res judicata finding if the claims could have been brought in the earlier action.as we stated in united states ex rel.barajas northrop,cir 
res judicata bars relitigation of all grounds of recovery that were asserted,or could have been asserted,in a previous action between the parties,where the previous action was resolved on the merits.it is immaterial whether the claims asserted subsequent to the judgment were actually pursued in the action that led to the judgment rather,the relevant inquiry is whether they could have been brought.
id.at citations omitted.
here,the relevant transactional nucleus of facts governing the claims that could have been brought encompasses the enactment of the plan and its application to the plaintiffs properties.in and,the association amended its complaints collectively,the complaints to challenge the agency application of the plan.in that earlier litigation,the association protested the agency outright prohibitions on use of sez lots,the prohibition on use of other properties below the ipes line,and the failure of the agency to lower the ipes line in a timely pursuant to the plan see first am.compl.at,tspc trpa.no.cvn see generally tahoe iii and tahoe iv.
now,the association has returned to court and filed a new action essentially seeking relief from the same alleged wrongs it unsuccessfully protested before.once again,the plaintiffs ask for damages based on the same nucleus of inability to develop sez lots,their inability to develop lots below the ipes line,and the alleged failure of the agency to lower the ipes line in a timely manner.these development moratoria and the criteria which govern any change in the moratoria were all established by the plan and were unambiguously in force before the association filed its first amended complaint in the former action.any of the claims presently before us could thus have been asserted in the previous lawsuit.
the association attempts to distinguish the claims contained in its new complaint by emphasizing the role of the meetings in which the board refused to lower the ipes line for and,allegedly contrary to the agency initial representations.we first dispose of the association implication that any action taken by the board in was contrary to a material representation.the plaintiffs complaint itself shows that,if ever there were misstatements by the agency regarding the consequences of the plan,they were corrected long before.at most,the association alleges that the agency in misrepresented the time period within which the ipes line would drop,by underestimating the number of parcels that had to be protected from development before the line was eligible for adjustment.see supra note.as the association admits in its present complaint,however,by the basic numerical elements of the vacant lot equation had been recalculated,and the consequence of that recalculation was to make it virtually impossible for the line to move downward on the of the basin for many years.moreover,the results of the recalculations were made fully available to all interested members of the public.even if the declared factual basis for the estimated movement of the ipes line misled the plaintiffs in,that declared basis was the association was informed of the,well before the association amended its complaints in the prior action.therefore,no action by the board in was even colorably inconsistent with the understanding that the association should have had in as to how the system would function.
moreover,any misestimation by the agency regarding the time periods involved or the number of parcels that might meet various criteria of the plan can not serve to change the fact that the plan relevant legal and factual components were fixed in and were not modified after that date.it is those components that govern whether a taking occurred,not any estimates issued by the agency for informational purposes,nor even any predictions as to how long it might take for the objective criteria to be met.
absent the misrepresentation issue,we are left with the allegation that the simple fact of the board refusal to lower the ipes line at the meetings effects an unconstitutional taking.this refusal is alleged to constitute an act distinct from the transactional nucleus of facts at issue in the earlier litigation.the association artful drafting,however,can not disguise the crux of the controversy.the plan firmly established the criteria governing the board ability to lower the ipes line.the board was only permitted to lower the line if certain triggering events occurred,including the attainment of predefined vacant lot equation levels.its relevant actions at the meetings were nondiscretionary.the plaintiffs should have known in that the board would not be free to lower the ipes line until the vacant lot equation reached in california or in nevada.by at the latest,when each plaintiff had received his lot ipes score and the total number of sensitive parcels had been firmly established,each plaintiff should have known that development would be banned on his particular property at least until the vacant lot equation permitted the board to lower the ipes line.the board acted in precisely as it was required to act by the plain terms of the the mere fact that it so acted in does not establish a new set of facts giving rise to a new legal claim 
the association also emphasizes that its current claim is an challenge to the decisions,but the emphasis is meaningless under the circumstances of this case.often,an challenge will not be precluded by an earlier facial challenge because the transactional nucleus of facts surrounding the enactment of a regulation will be different from the nucleus of facts involved when that regulation is applied to a particular property.for example,a regulatory body discretionary decision to grant or refuse a variance might involve facts sufficiently different from those involved in enacting the governing regulations to support a new legal claim.in this case,however,no new facts relevant to any cause of action against the agency arose in the decisions complained of were,and were mandated by external criteria that were established years before and were beyond its control the facts relevant to the claims at issue structure of the plan and the manner in which it would be all evident by 
indeed,in its complaints,the association protested both the enactment of the plan and its implementation.it even described the specific effect of the plan on each of its members involved in the suit.because,under the plan,the agency could not in alter the ipes line without finding that the external criteria satisfied a formula established in the plan,it performed no discretionary function in that year.the association present complaint is actually addressed to the formula established in the agency has taken no new discretionary action pursuant to this formula following the filing of the action.thus,the conduct now alleged to cause harm involves the same nucleus of facts addressed in the complaints,and any claim concerning that conduct could have been brought in the prior action 
in one telling passage of its current complaint,the association admits as much.this lawsuit was filed while tahoe iv was still pending before this court,and the association was concerned about the impact of both lawsuits proceeding concurrently.the current complaint states that if the prior lawsuit were allowed to go forward,it would likely be necessary to amend this complaint so as to avoid having duplicative actions then pending as to the same facts and issues.the fact that tahoe iv was ultimately dismissed makes this action no less duplicative.we find that the claims asserted here arise from the same transactional nucleus of facts as those asserted in tahoe iii and tahoe iv,and therefore find an identity of claims in this lawsuit and the association prior actions.
final judgment on the merits 
res judicata also requires a final judgment on the merits.there was clearly such a final judgment here.the district court in tspc trpa.at,dismissed the association claims relating to the plan as barred by the statute of limitations.this court affirmed.tahoe iv appeal,at.the supreme court has unambiguously stated that a dismissal on statute of limitations grounds is a judgment on the merits.plaut spendthrift farm,d.we therefore find that the association former suit was resolved by a final judgment on the merits.
privity between the parties 
the final element of res judicata is privity between the parties.we first note that several parties in both actions are identical,and therefore quite obviously in privity.of the individual plaintiffs and three of the individual plaintiffs were also named plaintiffs in the earlier tahoe actions.there can be no question that these parties already had a complete opportunity to litigate their claims.similarly,the lead plaintiff in both the prior lawsuit and the current unequivocally bound by its own judgment in the former suit.
even when the parties are not identical,privity may exist if there is substantial identity between parties,that is,when there is sufficient commonality of interest.in re gottheiner,cir citation omitted see also stratosphere litigation,at finding privity when a party is so identified in interest with a party to former litigation that he represents precisely the same right in respect to the subject matter involved citation omitted shaw hahn,cir finding privity when the interests of the party in the subsequent action were shared with and adequately represented by the party in the former action united states itt rayonier,cir a privy may include those whose interests are represented by one with authority to do so.we made clear,in in re schimmels,that privity is a flexible concept dependent on the particular relationship between the parties in each individual set of cases 
federal courts have deemed several relationships sufficiently close to justify a finding of privity and,therefore,preclusion under the doctrine of res judicata first,a who has succeeded to a party interest in property is bound by any prior judgment against the party.second,a who controlled the original suit will be bound by the resulting judgment.third,federal courts will bind a whose interests were represented adequately by a party in the original suit.in addition,privity has been found where there is a substantial identity between the party and nonparty,where the nonparty had a significant interest and participated in the prior action,and where the interests of the nonparty and party are so closely aligned as to be virtually representative.finally,a relationship of privity can be said to exist when there is an express or implied legal relationship by which parties to the first suit are accountable to who file a subsequent suit with identical issues.
schimmels,at citations omitted see also richards jefferson county,d moreover,although there are clearly constitutional limits on the privity exception,the term privity is now used to describe various relationships between litigants that would not have come within the traditional definition of that term.alpert newspaper delivery times,cir the issue is one of substance rather than the names in the caption of the case the inquiry is not limited to a traditional privity analysis.itt rayonier,at courts are no longer bound by rigid definitions of parties or their privies for purposes of applying collateral estoppel or res judicata.
one of the relationships that has been deemed sufficiently close to justify a finding of privity is that of an organization or unincorporated association filing suit on behalf of its members.see,charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure hereinafter wright miller cataloguing cases.of course,the organization must adequately represent the interests of its individual members if its representation is to satisfy the due process concerns articulated in hansberry lee.see,pedrina chun,cir.however,if there is no conflict between the organization and its members,and if the organization provides adequate representation on its members behalf,individual members not named in a lawsuit may be bound by the judgment won or lost by their organization.a finding of privity in such circumstances is particularly appropriate in cases involving interests in real property,for,as the supreme court has recognized,t he policies advanced by the doctrine of res judicata perhaps are at their zenith in cases concerning real property,land and water.nevada united states,d.
in this case,all of the remaining individual plaintiffs are members of the association,and given the history and nature of this litigation,their membership in and close relationship with the association is sufficient to bind them as parties in privity for res judicata purposes.in both the earlier suit and the current action,the individual plaintiffs clearly hitched their fortunes to the association able leadership.the association own description of its role is most telling 
plaintiff preservation council,inc is a membership organization representing approximately members who own private real properties,both improved and unimproved,located in the lake tahoe basin,which real properties are subject to the planning and regulatory jurisdiction of defendant trpa.the principal purpose of the preservation council is to actively represent the interests of its members,individually and collectively,before the trpa and other regulatory agencies in connection with its members use and enjoyment of their private properties located in the lake tahoe basin.all of the preservation council members owning real property in the lake tahoe basin have a direct interest in the planning and regulatory activities of trpa,and particularly in the specific provisions of the trpa regulations complained of herein among the preservation council members are each of the joining in this action 
we conclude that in these circumstances,the association represented the interests of its member property owners sufficiently thoroughly to bind other members alleging similar wrongs arising from the same set of facts in its capacity as guardian and protector of the interests of the property owners of the tahoe basin,the association had the authority to bring claims on behalf of its members,including the named plaintiffs in both actions.moreover,it defended its members interests vigorously,through at least years of litigation on this matter alone.there is no suggestion of any conflict between the association and any of its members concerning the implementation of the plan that might otherwise counsel against a finding of adequate representation,and when res judicata was asserted in the district court,no current plaintiff alleged that he was in a legal position different from either the association or the individual named plaintiffs in the earlier litigation we therefore conclude that the interests of the individual association members were adequately represented in the prior litigation by the association,the same organization that they have chosen as their current lead plaintiff.
allowing the earlier litigation to bind the current plaintiffs is especially appropriate in light of the only available alternative here.the association vigorously litigated the prior action on its members behalf.now that a final judgment has issued,it should not be able to evade preclusion continually by averring that unidentified members are not bound and bringing successive suits by claiming injury to different identified members.wright miller.if the individual members of the association were not bound by the result of the former litigation,the organization would be free to attack the judgment ad infinitum by arranging for successive actions by different sets of individual member plaintiffs,leaving the agency capacity to regulate the tahoe properties perpetually in flux.alpert newspaper delivery,at finding privity even when the association was not itself a party,but provided substantial tactical and financial help to the parties in both actions.the association may not avoid the effect of a final judgment in this fashion.
because we find an identity of claims in the prior action resolved by tahoe iii and tahoe iv and in the current complaint,because the prior action was resolved by a final judgment on the merits,and because there was sufficient privity between parties to bind the current parties to the result of the prior litigation,we hold that the plaintiffs claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata.
plaintiffs 
certain plaintiffs also contest the feature of the plan allowing property owners with ipes scores within of the ipes line to pursue water quality mitigation projects or pay mitigation fees in order to increase their parcel ipes score above the threshold for joining the development permit pool.to the extent that these claims are construed as efforts to challenge the structure of the mitigation program itself,or its allegedly unconstitutional relationship to the development moratorium,they would properly be designated as facial challenges.such facial challenges would have accrued the moment the plaintiffs became affected by the is,the moment the plaintiffs became eligible to take advantage of the program provisions.see suitum trpa,d discussing the accrual of facial challenges to regulatory ordinances levald,city of palm desert,cir same.because the mitigation program was an original feature of the plan,it was fully in force,at the latest,as of.as such,it could have been challenged in the same action as the remainder of the challenges to the plan,described above for the same reasons described at length in section,supra,such facial challenges are now barred by the doctrine of res judicata.
if the claims of the plaintiffs are instead construed to be challenges,they are not,as we explain infra,subject to res judicata because they could not have been brought in the tahoe iii and tahoe iv litigation.however,for the same reason that the claims could not properly have been brought at that time,we affirm the district court conclusion that the claims are not yet ripe.
the plaintiffs devote substantial portions of their brief to the constitutional implications of the plan mitigation provisions.they contend that the provisions constitute unconstitutional exactions of the type rejected by nollan cal.coastal comm n,d,and dolan city of tigard,d.these claims are only saved from preclusion if they are construed to be challenges to the mitigation that the mitigation program is unconstitutional as applied to individual plaintiffs parcels.yet the complaint does not allege that any plaintiff has yet attempted to pursue the terms of the mitigation program,or that the agency has made an individual determination as to the mitigation applicable to that plaintiff particular parcel.without an ability to evaluate what the agency intends to exact,we can not determine if an alleged exaction is unconstitutional as applied.
the association cites suitum trpa,d,another case involving the tahoe basin,as support for the proposition that its claims are now ripe.in fact,suitum compels precisely the opposite conclusion.in a comprehensive survey of the doctrinal line fo
