on september,defendant united states nuclear regulatory commission nrc granted defendant entergy nuclear operations,entergy,an exemption from compliance with certain fire safety regulations at its indian point nuclear power plant operating unit indian point,located in westchester county,new york.in december,plaintiffs richard brodsky,a former member of the new york state assembly the westchester citizens awareness network and the sierra club atlantic chapter,unsuccessfully petitioned the nrc to reopen the exemption proceeding and to hold a public hearing on the merits of entergy request.this court dismissed plaintiffs direct appeal from the nrc denial of that petition for lack of jurisdiction.see brodsky nuclear regulatory comm n,cir.plaintiffs thereafter commenced the instant action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york loretta preska,chief judge,alleging that the nrc award of the exemption to entergy violated the administrative procedure act apa,the atomic energy act aea,and the national environmental policy act nepa.on this appeal,plaintiffs challenge the district court award of summary judgment in favor of entergy on these claims.see brodsky nuclear regulatory comm n,d.
by summary order filed today,we affirm the challenged judgment in all respects but one,which is the subject of this opinion.specifically,insofar as plaintiffs contend that the nrc granted the challenged exemption in violation of nepa regulations,which allow for public involvement where appropriate and practicable,see b,c,we conclude that the agency record does not permit a reviewing court to determine whether a reasoned basis exists for the nrc decision not to afford any such public involvement in the exemption decision.we therefore vacate the judgment of the district court,which implicitly rejected this argument,with respect to plaintiffs nepa challenge only,and we remand this case to the district court with instructions for it in turn to remand to the nrc so that the agency may supplement the administrative record to explain why allowing public input into the exemption request was inappropriate or impracticable,or take such other action as it may deem appropriate to resolve this issue.see florida power light lorion,d i f the reviewing court simply can not evaluate the challenged agency action on the basis of the record before it,the proper course,except in rare circumstances,is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.this panel will retain jurisdiction for the purpose of ruling,if necessary,on any appeal from a further district court judgment addressing the agency action on remand.see united states jacobson,cir.
factual background 
the atomic energy act of establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework for the ongoing review of nuclear power plants located in the united states and vests the atomic energy commission,and its successor agency,the nrc,with broad regulatory power to ensure that the generation and transmission of nuclear power does not unreasonably threaten the public welfare.county of rockland nuclear regulatory comm n,cir accord riverkeeper,collins,cir noting nrc mission to insure adequate protection of public health and safety from risks associated with nuclear plants.pursuant to that authority,in,the nrc upgraded its fire safety rules in response to a catastrophic fire at the browns ferry power plant near decatur,alabama.see fire protection program for operating nuclear power plants,pt,app.regulations authorize the nrc to grant exemptions from specific fire safety protocols,provided the exemption does not present an undue risk to the public health and safety,a,and special circumstances warrant the exemption,id.a.the exemption process has been recognized to afford a critical element of flexibility in potentially cumbersome fire safety compliance by allowing power plants to show that alternative fire protection systems protect the public safety at the same high level as the system chosen by the commission.connecticut light power nuclear regulatory comm n.
in both and,indian point secured exemptions from fire safety regulations not relevant here.the grant of these exemptions was by no means pro forma.as the district court observed,the nrc has had a long history of reviewing the fire safety regulations at indian point and in most cases has denied requests for exemptions.brodsky nuclear regulatory comm n,d at noting that nrc staff recommended granting only eight of exemptions requested after regulations took effect.
existing rules contemplate a approach to fire protection with three objectives t o prevent fires from starting t o detect rapidly,control,and extinguish promptly those fires that do occur and t o provide protection for structures,systems,and components important to safety so that a fire that is not promptly extinguished by the fire suppression activities will not prevent the safe shutdown of the plant.pt,app.r.a plant may satisfy the third objective by enclosing a redundant safety shutdown system in a barrier that will withstand a fire for at least one hour,if accompanied by fire detectors and an automatic fire suppression system.see id.
since at least,indian point has relied on a fire barrier called hemyc,originally rated for one hour of fire protection,to satisfy the third objective of the nrc fire safety regulations.the nrc first began to develop concerns about hemyc effectiveness in,prompting renewed testing of that material.on april,the nrc informed its licensees that hemyc and another fire barrier material,mt,did not perform for one hour as designed because of shrinkage of the material during testing.later that month,nrc staff held a public meeting with licensees and interested members of the public to discuss these concerns.
in may,a number of citizen groups petitioned the nrc pursuant to to modify or suspend the operating licenses of various nuclear power plants,including indian point,that were using hemyc or mt for fire safety,arguing that the plants were operating in violation of nrc fire protection requirements resulting in a degradation of fire protection and safe shut down in the event of a significant fire.all nuclear power plants that use fire barriers,notice of decision under.on january,the nrc granted the citizens groups petition in part,publicly stating that it would review all affected plants in detail in an effort to take appropriate actions to resolve the issues with the use of hemyc material commensurate with the safety significance of the protected systems.see also in re carolina power light shearon harris nuclear power station,unit robinson plant,unit,stating that nrc shared citizens groups concerns and was addressing hemyc performance issues in an expeditious manner.pursuant thereto,on april,the nrc issued a generic letter entitled potentially nonconforming hemyc and mt fire barrier configurations,directing all its power plant licensees to evaluate their facilities to ensure compliance with applicable fire safety regulations and to furnish information confirming such compliance.
in its june,response to this nrc directive,entergy reported that indian point was not in compliance with agency fire safety protocols due to its use of hemyc.entergy stated that it had instituted compensatory measures,such as conducting hourly tours and ensuring the operability of its fire detection systems.on july,entergy applied to the nrc for an expansion of its existing exemptions to require only a minute fire resistance rating in two areas of indian point protected by hemyc.by august,however,entergy had concluded that it could not guarantee satisfaction of a minute resistance rating in one of the areas and sought nrc allowance for a minute rating at that site.
on august,the nrc fire protection branch recommended granting entergy the requested exemption.on september,the nrc issued a related environmental assessment ea,see,and finding of no significant impact fonsi,see id.these were published in the federal register on september,see entergy nuclear operations,indian point nuclear generating unit,ea and fonsi,the same day that the nrc awarded the exemption,which itself was published in the federal register on october,see entergy nuclear operations,indian point nuclear generating unit,revision to existing exemptions 
plaintiffs submit that the september,publication of the ea and fonsi was the first public notice of entergy exemption request.on the day the exemption grant was made public,new york attorney general filed a written request for the nrc to reconsider the exemption and to solicit public comment,which the nrc denied.on december,plaintiffs presented the nrc with a similar request,contending,among other things,that it was implausible that the steps needed to control a fire could be taken in minutes,that such a scenario had not been adequately tested,and that the generic testing relied upon by entergy and the nrc did not adequately consider the conditions or equipment present at indian point plaintiffs offered various supporting documents,including an affidavit from ulrich witte,a mechanical engineer whose years experience included responsibility for fire safety compliance at the rancho seco nuclear power station in sacramento,california.witte labeled entergy minute timeframe entirely unrealistic.witte decl.he also faulted the nrc for offsetting the high risks posed in the event of a fire at indian point against the low risk that a fire would ignite or that the areas at issue would combust.the nrc denied plaintiffs request on january,stating only that entergy application did not trigger hearing rights under the aea.
on march,plaintiffs,with the support of new york state as amicus curiae,petitioned this court for review of the nrc denial pursuant to conferring exclusive jurisdiction on courts of appeals to review all final orders of the nrc made reviewable by.this court dismissed the petition on august,concluding sua sponte that we lacked jurisdiction under the plain text of.brodsky nuclear regulatory comm n,at construing a a reference to granting,suspending,revoking,or amending of any license,over which direct appellate review may be had,not to include issuance of exemption.
plaintiffs commenced the instant action in the district court on december,alleging violations of the apa,aea,and nepa.by opinion and order dated march,the district court awarded summary judgment to defendants on all claims.see brodsky nuclear regulatory comm n,d.while the district court discussed various of plaintiffs challenges,it did not specifically address their argument that the nrc violated their nepa right,as members of the public,to participate in the exemption process.we consider that claim here.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
nepa is,at its core,a procedural statute that mandates a process rather than a particular result.stewart park reserve,sparc slater,cir.thus,judicial review of administrative choices under nepa focuses primarily on the procedural regularity of the decision,rather than on its substance.sierra club army corps of eng rs,cir see coalition on valley nuclear wastes chu,cir reiterating that reviewing court role is limited to insur ing that the agency has taken a hard look at environmental consequences of the action to be taken,rather than evaluating merits of decision internal quotation marks omitted.
because nepa does not itself provide for judicial review,the apa controls.see sierra club army corps of eng rs,at.pursuant to the apa,courts review contested agency action to determine if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.although highly deferential,this standard does not equate to no review.wilson cia,cir describing boundaries of deferential review in another context.notably,the apa contemplates that,in deciding a challenge to agency action,a court will review the administrative record to ensure that the agency examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for its action.moreover,the agency decision must reveal a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.natural res.def.council,epa,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted see also national audubon soc y hoffman,cir confining judicial review to administrative record compiled by agency when it made challenged decision.further,while a court can uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency path may reasonably be discerned,it may not itself supply a reasoned basis for the agency action that the agency itself has not given.natural res.def.council,epa,at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,when an administrative record is insufficient to permit a court to discern an agency reasoning or to conclude that the agency has considered all relevant factors,a court may remand the matter to the agency to allow for supplementation of the record.see florida power light lorion,at national audubon soc y hoffman,at.this is such a case.
public participation in the nepa process 
nepa animating purposes and methods of operation have been discussed at length in prior decisions.see,department of transp.pub.citizen,d describing nepa statutory and regulatory scheme national audubon soc y hoffman,at.for purposes of this appeal,we focus on those parts of the statute and regulations providing for public disclosure and input regarding the environmental impact of contemplated agency action.see pogliani army corps of eng rs,cir recognizing that congress enacted nepa to ensure that federal agencies examine and disclose the potential environmental impacts of projects before allowing them to proceed,which process must involve the public.
nepa directs agencies contemplating major f ederal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment to prepare an environmental impact statement eis demonstrating agency consideration of the reasonably foreseeable environmental effects.c accord city of new york slater,cir.implementing regulations promulgated by the council on environmental quality ceq permit agencies categorically to exclude certain classes of actions from the eis requirement on the ground that such actions do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the environment.see b,see also c establishing categorical exclusions for various nrc actions in the absence of such a categorical exclusion,any doubt as to whether contemplated action requires an eis must be resolved by preparing an ea.see department of transp.pub.citizen,at describing ea as concise public document that briefly provides sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an eis alterations omitted citing a.if,pursuant to the ea,the agency concludes that no eis is required,it must provide its reasons in a fonsi.see id.at e.as discussed in the background section of this opinion,the nrc published an ea and fonsi with respect to the exemption challenged in this case on september,the same date that it granted the exemption.
while nepa itself does not assign the public any particular role in the aforementioned processes,see generally hanly kleindienst,cir recognizing that t here is no statutory requirement for public hearings under nepa,implementing regulations identify public scrutiny as an essential part of the nepa process,b accurate scientific analysis,expert agency comments,and public scrutiny are essential to implementing nepa.thus,the regulations provide that nepa procedures must insure that environmental information is available to public officials and citizens before decisions are made and before actions are taken.id.moreover,a gencies shall both m ake diligent efforts to involve the public in preparing and implementing their nepa procedures and solicit appropriate information from the public.id.a,d.such involvement can include public hearings whenever appropriate,a determination informed by whether there is s ubstantial environmental controversy concerning the proposed action or substantial interest in holding the hearing.id.c.given the discretion afforded agencies by the regulatory text,however,we will not readily second guess an agency decision not to hold a public hearing in a particular case.see friends of ompompanoosuc ferc,cir upholding agency decision to forgo public hearing in connection with licensing of hydroelectric power station de
