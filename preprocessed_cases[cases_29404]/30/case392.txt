facts and proceedings below 
the plaintiffs own land in the devil swamp area in the parish of east baton rouge,louisiana.on july,the plaintiffs filed suit against the defendants in louisiana state court on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated landowners,alleging that the defendants were responsible for contaminating their land with toxic chemicals.the defendants removed the case to the united states district court for the middle district of louisiana.the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand,asserting that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction.after a hearing on the motion to remand,the motion was denied.the defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court granted their motion,holding that the plaintiffs had not produced sufficient evidence to create a disputed issue of material fact relating to an essential element of their claim,and rendered judgment for defendants.
ppi,a louisiana corporation,was the owner and operator of two hazardous waste disposal facilities in the devil swamp region,the brooklawn site and the scenic highway site.with the exception of npc,the other corporate defendants were industrial generators of hazardous waste that made use of the ppi disposal facilities.npc,a louisiana corporation,was formed by the industrial generator defendants in to clean up or remediate the ppi sites in accordance with a federal consent decree.bolger was president of npc.street and rainey were executive officers of npc.
ppi operated its waste disposal facility,just north of devil swamp,during the and.plaintiffs property is located approximately three miles south of the ppi facility.in,the united states department of justice,on behalf of the environmental protection agency,sued ppi and several of the industrial generators in the united states district court for the middle district of louisiana under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,et.the state of louisiana,the city of baton rouge,and the parish of east baton rouge intervened in that suit.on february,a consent decree was entered in that case by the united states district court for the middle district of louisiana under which certain companies,including the industrial generator defendants in the present action,agreed to investigate and clean up contamination from the former ppi facility.the consent decree ordered,inter alia,that these sites be monitored for thirty years after the completion of remediation under the continuing supervision and jurisdiction of the district court.on august,the district court ordered that the consent decree be supplemented with a supplemental remedial action plan prepared by the defendants.in,the industrial generator defendants contracted with npc to perform the remediation work,which has been underway since under the supervision of judge polozola.none of the plaintiffs in this case was ever a party to the consent decree or the case in which it was entered.
the plaintiffs state court complaint alleged that toxic chemicals emanating from the ppi facility had contaminated their land in the southern half of devil swamp.in resisting the plaintiffs motion to remand to state court,the defendants asserted that the district court had original jurisdiction under the all writs act,federal question jurisdiction pursuant to,and diversity jurisdiction pursuant to the district court found that there was federal question jurisdiction because the plaintiffs claims really arose under cercla,or,alternatively,that the all writs act conferred jurisdiction,because of the potential for interference with the court earlier consent decree.
in granting the defendants motion for summary judgment,the district court found that the plaintiffs had not produced sufficient evidence to support a finding that any toxic substances from the ppi site reached plaintiffs land approximately three miles to the south.because we hold that the district court lacked jurisdiction,it is not necessary to discuss that court summary judgment rulings in further detail.
discussion 
this court reviews a question of the district court jurisdiction de novo.united states,cir.
the district court found that there were at least two bases for exercising jurisdiction federal question jurisdiction pursuant to cercla and jurisdiction by means of the all writs act.we hold that there is no basis for federal removal jurisdiction in this case.
federal question jurisdiction 
title states the general principles governing removal jurisdiction in cases any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded on a claim or right arising under the constitution,treaties or laws of the united states shall be removable without regard to the citizenship or residence of the parties.b.the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.cercla contains a particularized jurisdictional statement,which provides that,except as otherwise provided,the united states district courts shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all controversies arising under this chapter,without regard to the citizenship of the parties or the amount in controversy.b.
a federal court only has original or removal jurisdiction if the federal question appears on the face of the plaintiff complaint and there is generally no federal jurisdiction if the plaintiff properly pleads only a state law cause of action,franchise tax bd.construction laborers vacation trust,d.a case may arise under federal law where the vindication of a right under state law necessarily turn s on some construction of federal law.id.at.but this statement must be read with caution.merrell dow pharmaceuticals,thompson,d.a defense that raises a federal question is insufficient.id.even if a plaintiff has a federal cause of action,he may avoid federal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance on state law.caterpillar,williams,d.the artful pleading doctrine is an independent corollary to the complaint rule.rivet regions bank,d.under this principle,removal is not defeated by a plaintiff omission to plead necessary federal questions.id.the artful pleading doctrine allows removal where federal law completely preempts a plaintiff claim.id.
the plaintiffs complaint alleges negligent and strict liability torts under louisiana law.its only reference to federal law is an allegation that the ppi facility was maintained in violation of federal regulations as well as in violation of state and local regulations.that,however,does not suffice to render the action one arising under federal law.willy coastal,cir.the defendants argue that the plaintiffs complaint,though purporting to seek relief under louisiana law,actually seeks relief under cercla.the defendants note that the plaintiffs petition demanded compensatory damages in an amount commensurate with the cost of restoring and remediating the plaintiffs property and that cercla creates a cause of action for such costs.see a.however,louisiana law also provides a cause of action under which these plaintiffs can attempt to prove that these defendants tortiously caused damage to the plaintiffs land and can demand the very relief they seek.see mouton state,so d.cir.a.in enacting cercla,congress expressly disclaimed an intent to preem
