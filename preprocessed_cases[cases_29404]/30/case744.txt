we must decide whether a district court may approve resolution of litigation involving a federal agency through a consent decree,which substantially and permanently amends regulations that the agency could only otherwise amend by complying with statutory rulemaking procedures.conservation northwest and a coalition of other environmental groups plaintiffs sued the bureau of land management blm,forest service,and fish and wildlife service collectively,the agencies,challenging changes to the survey and manage standard survey and manage or the standard of the northwest forest plan nfp.plaintiffs and the agencies together,appellees negotiated a settlement which the district court approved and entered in the form of a consent decree.defendant intervenor johnson lumber company appeals from the district court approval of the consent decree contending that it was an abuse of discretion because the consent decree conflicts with applicable law by amending survey and manage without following applicable procedural requirements,and its application to lands subject to the oregon and california railroad and coos bay wagon road grants land act o c act violates the terms of that act.we have jurisdiction under.we conclude that johnson first argument is meritorious,but that its second argument was waived.accordingly,we reverse the district court.
factual and procedural background 
this is another case in the extensive and growing litigation saga of the nfp.see,conservation nw.rey,d,klamath siskiyou wildlands ctr.boody,cir nw.ecosystem alliance rey,d,nea seattle audubon soc y lyons,aff,cir.the nfp itself was the product of extensive litigation and political controversy in the surrounding the health of the old growth forests of the pacific northwest,it was intended as a truce between conservationists and logging concerns.conservation,d at.it is intended to serve the twin goals of protecting the ecological health of the forests and providing for sustainable timber production,and so requires a balancing act between commercial use and conservation.id.at.
the nfp applies to approximately million acres of federal land between san francisco and the canadian border,and divides that land into reserves,adaptive management areas,and matrix areas.most commercial logging takes place in matrix areas.the agencies management of these lands is also governed by federal statutes including the national environmental policy act nepa,the national forest management act nfma,the endangered species act esa,and the federal land policy management act flpma.approximately ten percent of nfp land is also subject to the o c act.
survey and manage is one part of the nfp.it was adopted to assist the agencies in assessing the impact of logging on approximately but ecologically crucial species the standard requires the agencies to manage known sites where these species are found,conduct surveys for their presence prior to activities,locate high priority sites for species,and conduct general regional surveys to learn more about the species.
based on their experience of the cost and complexity of implementing survey and manage during its first several years,the agencies sought to amend the standard in.this prompted resistance from both commercial logging and conservation interests.see douglas timber operators rey,aa.that litigation ended with a settlement in which the agencies agreed to go back to the drawing board to consider eliminating the standard in its entirety.see id.

in,the agencies issued their final supplemental eis and accompanying rod rod.in these documents,the agencies again opted to eliminate survey and manage.conservation,d at.the present litigation ensued when plaintiffs challenged this action,alleging violations of nepa,nfma,flpma,and the esa.id.at.johnson intervened as a defendant.id.at.plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on their nepa claims,and johnson and the agencies opposed that motion and for summary judgment themselves.id.
after comprehensive analysis of plaintiffs nepa claims,the district court found four nepa violations.id.at.noting the highly complex issues at stake,and the procedural posture after partial summary judgment,the court declined to decide on a remedy at that time.id.at.
after lengthy negotiations,the agencies and plaintiffs filed a proposed settlement agreement detailing how survey and manage would operate going forward.the settlement includes a lengthy description of new exemptions from surveys,and a list of species and category assignment s,including an explanation of new management requirements for certain species.johnson objected that the settlement modified the standard without complying with statutorily mandated procedures,but the district court rejected this contention and entered the settlement as a consent decree.the court cited turtle island restoration network department of commerce,d,explaining that its entry of the consent decree invoke d a judicial act,not an agency act,and that the general rules applicable to agencies were therefore not relevant.d.johnson timely appeals.
ii.discussion 
johnson contends that the district court abused its discretion by entering a consent decree that effectively amended survey and manage without going through procedures required by nepa,flpma,nfma,and their implementing regulations.appellees respond that,because the consent decree was a judicial act,procedural requirements that would otherwise govern agency action are inapplicable johnson further argues that application of the consent decree to lands covered by the o c act would violate that act appellees reply that johnson waived this argument by failing to raise it adequately before the district court.
