factual background 
on march,a federal grand jury returned an indictment against george norris,a resident of texas,and his,manuel arias silva arias,a resident of peru.count i alleged that norris and arias conspired to import unlawful merchandise into the united states,in violation of,to make false statements to federal customs and plant inspectors,in violation of a,and to trade in specimens and possess specimens contrary to the provisions of the cites and the esa,in violation of c.count i sets out the manner and means of the conspiracy as follows arias caused orchids to be shipped to the united states from peru without a valid cites export permit from the country of origin.specifically,arias obtained cites permits for particular species of orchids that were identified on the permit as being artificially propagated.arias,at the instruction of norris,then substituted and exported orchids that were different species than those authorized for export on the permits not artificially propagated arias and norris caused false labels to be placed on the orchids in order to conceal the fact that the plants were not authorized for export by the accompanying permits arias provided a code or key to norris that would provide a means for deciphering the false labels and identifying the true species of the orchids and that norris offered for sale and sold orchids received from arias.
count i also recounts a number of overt acts undertaken by norris and arias in furtherance of the conspiracy.these overt acts included a series of written communications between norris and arias wherein they discussed,at length when,where,and how to import plants into the united states without detection arias shipping of approximately orchids to norris on or about february,containing phragmipediums and at least appendix ii orchids and arias shipping of approximately orchids to norris on or about august,containing an undisclosed number of phragmipediums and several appendix ii orchid species.
counts of the indictment charged norris and arias with smuggling,in violation of,by illegally importing orchids contrary to the cites and the esa in may,february,and august.specifically,count ii alleged that norris illegally imported phragmipedium specimens in may count iii alleged that norris illegally imported at least phragmipedium specimens and at least specimens of various appendix ii orchids in february of and count iv alleged that norris imported approximately orchids that included phragmipedium specimens and several appendix ii orchid species in august of.
counts alleged that norris violated by facilitating the transportation and sale of merchandise that he knew to have been imported contrary to law and with selling orchids from the february and august shipments.count vii accused norris and arias of making false statements,in violation of a,by causing the february shipment to be shipped with an invalid cites permit and false labeling.count viii presented a false statement charge against arias that did not involve norris.
on june,norris pled guilty to the charges in the indictment without a plea agreement.the presentence investigation report psr assessed a base level of pursuant to a of the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines or and recommended,inter alia,an enhancement under b a ii and b e because the market value of the shipments exceeded.
norris objected to the psr contending,inter alia,that the probation officer assessed market value of the orchids was erroneous and that it resulted in an increased sentence in violation of his sixth amendment rights under blakely washington,d.specifically,norris contended that the probation officer assessed market value was erroneous because it was based on the market value of the orchid shipments in their entirety,rather than on the market value of the orchids that had been undocumented in the cites permits accompanying each shipment.norris also filed a motion for downward departure based upon his good works,community support,advanced age,and poor health.
at the sentencing hearing,held on october,norris renewed his objection to the psr calculation of the market value of the orchids under b,contending that the market value of his offense should be based solely on the market value of the undocumented orchids in the cites permits because that was the only actual criminal conduct at issue.the government,on the other hand,argued that each shipment in its entirety should be valued,including the correctly documented plants,because the false and misleading cites permit for each shipment rendered the entire shipment illegal.the parties thereafter filed a joint exhibit wherein they stipulated that the retail value of the shipments under the government valuation theory was corresponding to an increase under b a ii and b e and that the retail value of the shipments under norris theory was corresponding to a increase under b a ii and b e.
after considering the guidelines and each party valuation theory at length,the district court,in agreeing with the government,concluded that the false and misleading cites permits rendered the entire shipments illegal and,therefore,that the appropriate market value to be considered under b a was the market value of each shipment in its entirety.the district court imposed a sentence of seventeen months imprisonment,two years of supervised release,and a special assessment.the district court stated that it would have imposed the same sentence if the guidelines were advisory.norris appealed.
the central issue presented for review in this case is whether the district court misinterpreted of the guidelines in basing the market value of norris offense on the value of the shipments in their entirety and not just on the value of the undocumented orchids within each shipment.this issue is one of first impression in this and other circuits.for reasons set forth below,we conclude that market value under of the guidelines should include the value of the entire shipment
