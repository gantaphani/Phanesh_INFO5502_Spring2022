introduction 
a governmental entity with beachfront property within its borders must adopt a local coastal program.a local coastal program or any amendments thereto are subject to approval by the california coastal commission the commission.public resources code section,subdivision a,which is part of the california environmental quality act,permits the secretary of the resources agency the secretary to certify an administrative agency regulatory program.the secretary certification extends to the preparation of written documentation supporting an environmental decision.public resources code section,subdivisions d b,d d,d f and d,and california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision a of the guidelines for the implementation of the california environmental quality act guidelines specify certain procedural substantive requirements for a certified program environmental documentation with reference to a local coastal program as well as other planning decisions.once the secretary certifies a local coastal program,written documentation supporting the commission approval may be used in lieu of an environmental impact report.the secretary has certified the commission review process for approving a local coastal program amendment.
the only undeveloped beachfront property the subject property in the city of malibu the city on broad beach is owned by malibu bay company the developer.in order to facilitate the subdivision of the subject property,the city,among other things,adopted an amendment to its local coastal program.the commission,relying on a written staff report and testimony,certified the amendment to the city local coastal program albeit only after increasing the view corridors from pacific coast highway to the beach.no environmental impact report was prepared.
in response,plaintiffs,deane earl ross and the ross family trust,filed a mandate petition challenging the commission certification,with the aforementioned view corridor modification,of the city local coastal program amendment.the trial court granted plaintiffs mandate petition,in part,finding noncompliance with the procedural and substantive requirements imposed for environmental impact reports by the california environmental quality act.the commission,the city and the developer appeal from that portion of the judgment partially granting plaintiffs mandate petition.as to that portion of the judgment denying their mandate petition,plaintiffs have appealed.
in the published portion of this opinion,we conclude the commission reasonably resolved conflicting city development standards concerning buffers in environmentally sensitive habitat areas.further,largely applying public resources code section,subdivisions d b,d d,d f and d,and guidelines section,we resolve questions about the adequacy of the commission review,approval and modification of the amendment to the city local coastal program.we conclude the commission complied with public resources code section,subdivisions d b,d d,d f and d,and guidelines section,subdivision a.thus,the mandate petition should have been denied in its entirety.
ii.background 
a.the subject property 
the administrative record reveals that the developer owns a acre beachfront parcel in the city,located at the eastern end of broad beach between the pacific coast highway and the ocean.the subject property is approximately feet wide at its northern boundary along the pacific coast highway and narrows to approximately feet at its southern border along the beach.the property is the last undeveloped parcel on broad beach in a developed residential area.there are beachfront residences on both sides of broad beach road.the subject property is undeveloped except for a narrow access driveway,landscaping,and gated fencing at the northern end of the property.the subject property is zoned for single density unit per acre in the city local coastal program.the local implementation plan,part of the city local coastal program,required that all new lots in the single density zoning district have a minimum size of acre and minimum lot width of feet.we will discuss later the roles of a local implementation plan and local coastal program as part of the planning process under the california coastal act coastal act.
the subject property is part of a larger coastal dune ecosystem at broad beach.the coastal dune community fronting homes along broad beach is part of the southern foredunes,which are considered environmentally sensitive habitat areas in the city local coastal program.we will later clarify the concept of an environmentally sensitive habitat area.dunes range from lightly to heavily impacted with plants between the beach and most of the homes.the subject property has been disturbed over time beginning with the construction of the pacific coast highway its use as a boat storage and launching site and then use as a construction staging ground.
b.the city proceedings 
on july,the developer applied for issuance of a coastal development permit,tentative parcel map,general plan amendment,and zoning text amendment.the developer sought to subdivide the acre,foot wide beachfront property into separate lots.each proposed lot was more than acre with a lot width ranging from to feet.the proposed lots did not meet the local coastal program minimum lot width requirement of feet for the single density zoning district.the developer also requested the local implementation plan portion of the local coastal program be amended so as to create a new zoning district allowing for a lot width of feet.
the city staff reviewed the developer application and prepared a draft mitigated negative declaration to satisfy california environmental quality act requirements.on june,the city published a notice of intent to adopt the draft mitigated negative declaration for the project.plaintiffs,who own a parcel next to the subject property,and other residents objected to the project and the draft mitigated negative declaration.plaintiffs argued that the proposed amendment to the local coastal program would constitute illegal spot zoning.they also argued that the project violated the local coastal program and land use plan regulations relating to the protection of environmentally sensitive habitat areas.
on september,the city planning commission conditionally approved a coastal development permit,proposed tentative parcel map and draft mitigated negative declaration.the planning commission recommended the city council approve the local coastal program,zoning text and map,and general plan map amendments.plaintiffs appealed the city planning commission decision to the city council arguing in part that the amendment constituted illegal spot zoning.in response,the city staff developed an alternative proposal to amend the local implementation plan portion of the local coastal program to reduce the minimum lot width standard from feet to feet for all of the beachfront parcels.the lots were all within the city single density zoning district.
the city staff analyzed the single density zoned beachfront properties to determine if the new lot width standard would allow for an increase in development density.the city staff found of the single density zoned beachfront parcels within its boundaries,the majority were,with an average lot width of feet.at broad beach,the average lot width was only feet.
the city staff found only five parcels meeting both the lot size and width minimum requirement which could be subdivided under the new proposed lot width standard one of which was the subject property.the other four parcels were already developed with homes.two of the four developed parcels were created by lot mergers or ties of three and four lots and could not be further subdivided under the local coastal program.the city staff determined only two developed parcels could potentially use the draft local coastal program amendment to create an additional lot each,if demolition of the existing homes and subdivision were requested.to subdivide,the owners of these two developed parcels would be required to apply for a coastal development permit and the city would need to conduct environmental review under the california environmental quality act on those lots.the city staff determined the draft local coastal program amendment would have negligible direct and cumulative impacts on aesthetics,biological resources and land use and planning.
as part of the draft mitigated negative declaration,the city staff evaluated potential impacts to environmentally sensitive habitat areas.dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas are not designated on the land use plan environmentally sensitive habitat areas overlay map.thus,the city staff is required to conduct a biological study to determine the extent of dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas and their buffers on the property pursuant to local implementation program sections.a and.g.the developer submitted a dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas restoration plan for the subject property by its biologist,edith read.the restoration plan would restore the dune features to within feet of the stringline.the plan recommended a foot seaward buffer from the stringline.the restoration plan specified removal of plants planting of native dune plants monitoring and the designation of one dune access path for each of the proposed four newly created parcels.
in response to plaintiffs contention the least damaging alternative would be to allow the site to be developed under existing zoning regulations that would allow for two rather than four buildable lots,the city staff conducted an alternatives analysis.the city staff compared view corridors and development footprints for one,two,three and four lots on the subject property.the city staff concluded that four lots resulted in the greatest viewing area,the smallest development footprint and the least environmentally damaging option.
on december,plaintiffs submitted additional comments and documents to the city including a report prepared by rincon consultants on the biological constraints to development of the subject property.the rincon consultants report found the property contained environmentally sensitive habitat areas.the rincon consultants report concluded development could adversely affect habitat for certain rare,threatened and endangered species,including the western snowy plover,a bird,and the globose dune beetle.
on january,the city council adopted an ordinance approving the local coastal program amendment conditioned on the commission certification.the city council also adopted a resolution denying plaintiffs appeal adopted a revised mitigated negative declaration and conditionally approved the tentative parcel map and the coastal development permit for the subject property.on march,the city submitted the proposed local coastal program amendment and related documents to the commission for certification of the local coastal program amendment.
c.the commission proceedings 
the commission staff report 
on may,the commission staff issued a report.the report recommended the commission approve the city proposed local coastal program amendment with suggested modifications.the report also recommended that the commission adopt a modified version of the local coastal program amendment which would add a new malibu bay company overlay district to the local implementation plan.the new overlay district would include conditions for view corridors,dune restoration,rear setback and an open space conservation easement.
the commission staff report discussed the city staff review of the single density zoned beachfront lots.the commission staff noted besides the subject property,only two other lots could feasibly be subdivided to create one additional parcel each,if demolition of the existing homes and subdivision were requested.the commission staff report stated that subdivision of the subject property as a result of the local coastal program amendment would not create additional lots significantly smaller than the average size of surrounding parcels.the commission staff report concluded reducing the minimum lot width standard in the single density beachfront zone to facilitate a future residential subdivision on the subject property would not conflict with public resources code section,subdivision a as incorporated into the city land use plan with the following qualification.that qualification is that the anticipated future development would comply with public resources code section,subdivision a so long as it did not have significant individual or cumulative adverse impacts on coastal resources.
the staff report analyzed the impact of the proposed development on the ocean views from the public roadways.the commission staff report noted,the local coastal program view corridor provision requires that buildings occupy a maximum of percent of a site lineal frontage,while the remaining percent of the lineal frontage is maintained as a contiguous view corridor,except on lots feet or less in width,in which case the view corridor may be split into two percent view corridors on either side of the residence.thus,reducing the minimum lot width standard proposed in the city local coastal program amendment would increase the number of parcels which in turn would create smaller view corridors.the commission staff report proposed that n o less than percent of the linear frontage of each created parcel of the subdivision be maintained as one contiguous public view corridor.in addition,the commission staff report proposed mitigation measures including removal of fencing that is not visually permeable vegetation over two feet in height and existing obstructions between pacific coast highway and the access road.
the commission staff report also analyzed impacts to biological resources on the subject property,including dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas.the commission staff report reviewed various biological reports of the dune community submitted by the developer consultants,surveys of special status species on the subject property and a may,memorandum from the commission staff biologist,jonna engel.engel disagreed with the developer two consultants who both stated that a portion of the dunes on the subject property,referred to as the area,was previously disturbed and should not be considered as an environmentally sensitive habitat area.primrose and lupine are wildflower species.engel concluded the area should be included as a dune environmentally sensitive habitat area.she explained dune hummocks and mounds dominated by native vegetation continue to persist in the area despite the intensive disturbance history of the site.engel believed the area should be considered an environmentally sensitive habitat area under the coastal act given the rarity of dune habitats across the state and the ease with which they are degraded by human activity.based on the reports of the developer consultants and engel memorandum,the commission staff report concluded the southern foredune community,including the area on the subject property,met the coastal act definition of an environmentally sensitive habitat area.
the commission staff report also reviewed the biologists opinions on the necessity of a buffer between the environmentally sensitive habitat areas and any development on the subject property.in an april,letter to the commission,the city biologist,dave crawford,concurred with the conclusions of the dune habitat assessment by one of the developer biologists.crawford stated that he and the city environmental review board have established a standard buffer policy for dune habitat on beachfront property.the standard buffer policy requires development go no further seaward than the stringline in conjunction with a dune restoration plan.this was because the remnant dunes in malibu are highly disturbed and have limited function and value.this policy has been in effect for numerous projects along broad beach road.according to crawford,the majority of the dunes remaining in malibu support predominately and invasive ice plant,that not only and often eliminates the native dune vegetation,but the dunes,thus resulting in an unnatural condition that prevents the natural movement of the dunes and reduces their value as native habitat.by allowing development consistent with the stringline standard,crawford explained the city can require projects to incorporate dune restoration plans that over time will improve the remnant dune biological functions and values.
engel disagreed with the opinion of the developer consultants and crawford that no buffer was necessary inland from the stringline.she noted generally,the c ommission protects environmentally sensitive habitat,such as southern foredunes,with buffers or.are necessary to insure that development will not significantly degrade the environmentally sensitive habitat areas.engel recommended a foot minimum buffer between the dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas and development.she stated,this distance is consistent with other c ommission dune buffer determinations and with the united states department of the interior,fish and wildlife service recommendation for this site documented in their april,letter as well as in person.in the same letter,the united states department of the interior,fish and wildlife service staff concurred with the developer that development on the subject property would not result in the take of the federally threatened western snowy plover.
the commission staff report rejected the no buffer recommendation made by the city biologist,crawford,and the developer consultants.but,the commission staff report also did not accept engel foot buffer recommendation.the commission staff report found that a buffer from designated environmentally sensitive habitat areas would be both equitable and protective of the biological integrity of the on site dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas especially after implementation of the dune restoration plan.the commission staff report explained given the proximity of dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas on the property and assuming a foot buffer is applied,it is possible to site future development for four separate parcels without building in environmentally sensitive habitat areas or environmentally sensitive habitat areas buffer.this is consistent with the land division and environmentally sensitive habitat area policies of the malibu land use plan.however,because dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas are situated essentially up to the stringline across about three quarters of the property,a foot buffer would significantly reduce the amount of buildable area for most of the newly created parcels.the c ommission recognizes that the subdivision will accommodate infill development and it is important to consider what would be both equitable and most protective of coastal resources.if environmentally sensitive habitat areas and a foot environmentally sensitive habitat areas buffer were strictly delineated for siting future development of newly created parcels,the result would be much smaller available development area than is allowed by the existing development pattern along this densely developed stretch of broad beach.however,providing no buffer in exchange for restoration as was determined sufficient by the c ity and the applicant biological consultants is inconsistent with land use plan section,which requires buffer areas around environmentally sensitive habitat areas to serve as transitional habitat and provide distance and physical barriers to human intrusion in order to preserve the biological integrity of the environmentally sensitive habitat areas.
the commission staff report also analyzed view corridor and development alternatives with,and foot lot widths.the commission staff report stated future subdivision of the subject property as a result of the local coastal program amendment request will result in four approximately foot wide parcels with only a foot view corridor on either side of each parcel.compared to two foot wide lots with foot view corridors each,or one foot wide lot with a foot view corridor that is currently allowed under the local coastal program,reducing the minimum lot width standard to accommodate the subdivision will adversely impact views of the beach and ocean from pacific coast highway.the developer proposed,and the commission staff report accepted,a contiguous percent foot wide view corridor on each side of the four newly created parcels.each view corridor would be contiguous with one other view corridor.this would result in two foot wide view corridors across the entire foot wide property.this arrangement would replace several foot wide corridors.the commission staff report found the developer proposal would provide maximum protection of visual resources while still accommodating subdivision of the subject property.
the day public notice and comment 
on may,the commission issued a public notice of a june,public hearing in santa rosa to all relevant parties.the public notice stated that commission staff recommended the approval of the city local coastal program amendment with modifications.the staff report and notice were posted on the commission web site the same day.plaintiffs obtained a copy of the staff report from the commission web site on may.on june,plaintiffs submitted written comments on the local coastal program amendment.
the commission staff report addendum 
on june,the commission staff issued an addendum to the prior may,staff report.the addendum made minor changes to the prior commission staff report and responded to public comments including those of plaintiffs.the addendum noted,the proposed foot width will result in lots that are substantially similar to the existing pattern of development along broad beach.although the foot width standard would apply to all beachfront parcels zoned medium density,the subject property was the only vacant site that would be affected by the proposed modification of the lot width standard.two other properties could be affected by the new foot width standard only if the existing development were to be demolished.the june,addendum further stated,the overlay district for the subject property reflects the landowner agreement to incorporate more strict development standards regarding view corridors,habitat restoration and open space easements than required by the malibu local coastal program.the addendum responded to comments relating to the environmentally sensitive habitat areas and the potential environmental impacts of the project.the addendum stated that the review of the environmentally sensitive habitat areas has been conducted to a level of specificity that would normally be carried out at a coastal development permit juncture,rather than a local coastal program approval stage.
the addendum also addressed comments regarding view resources by recommending the revision of the city local implementation plan section.the commission staff recommended amending the city local implementation plan section which is labeled,development standards to include a new provision mandating broader view corridors.the new local implementation plan section e provides new subdivisions of beachfront residential parcels,where structures can not be sited or designed below road grade,shall ensure no less than of the lineal frontage of each newly created parcel shall be maintained as one contiguous public view corridor even if the resultant lots are feet or less in width.the view corridors of the newly created parcels shall be contiguous to the maximum extent feasible in order to minimize impacts to public views of the ocean.this requirement shall be a condition of permit approval for the subdivision of a beachfront property.this proposed revision guaranteed percent of the lineal frontage of each newly created parcel would be maintained as one contiguous public view corridor even if the resultant lots were feet or less in width.
the addendum also attached written disclosures of communications received by certain members of the commission a june,report from one of the developer consultants entitled second botanical evaluation of area and a june,supplemental memorandum from engel.in her supplemental memorandum,engel clarified her dune landscape terminology and the definition of environmentally sensitive habitat areas in the coastal act.she also explained her reasons for including the area as a component of overall dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas.engel again recommended a foot buffer be imposed.engel agreed that the developer had proposed to restore the disturbed southern foredune environmentally sensitive habitat areas and had incorporated a number of best management practices into its design.she agreed these measures would help maintain the ecological functions of the southern foredune community.but engel concluded these measures did not vitiate the need to set back development from the very edge of the environmentally sensitive habitat areas.
the commission hearing and decision 
at the june,meeting,the commission considered the city proposed local coastal program amendment.the commission heard testimony concerning the city local coastal program amendment from several speakers including representatives for plaintiffs the city the developer and the commission staff including executive director peter douglas and engel.engel again recommended a foot buffer for environmentally sensitive habitat areas.
during the commission deliberations,commissioner ben hueso expressed concern that the local coastal program amendment might cause a change in residential density that had not been subject to environmental review.douglas replied that there were only two other properties that might be affected thus,the commission staff did not think the local coastal program amendment would increase density,either individually or cumulatively within the city.as to the buffer for environmentally sensitive habitat areas,commissioner mary schallenberger questioned what fair and equitable meant in the context of the coastal act.commissioner schallenberger stated that in the future when there is a single lot left in any local government jurisdiction,the commission might not be able to utilize the best science as recommended by its biologist.instead,she indicated the commission may have to compromise and impose conditions consistent with existing permits.in response,douglas stated that the issue of fairness and equity is always considered by the commission and is applied from time to time where other properties or areas are similarly situated.douglas explained the commission staff rationale i n this case,when you look at the other approvals in the city of malibu,that there were no buffer setbacks required before,we did appeal those approvals in the past,and therefore this is a case of first impression.so,we felt that treating this party,in as much similarly to others situated in the same way made sense,but the additional factor was that the restoration that we are getting here was of such importance that we felt both the equity issues,in terms of how others had been treated and this is the first time that we are requiring this kind of a buffer and the restoration component warranted the requirement of a foot buffer to avoid a direct impact on the environmentally sensitive habitat areas.
at the conclusion of the june,hearing,the commission adopted the staff report.the commission conditionally certified the local coastal program amendment with the staff recommended modifications.on november,the city approved an ordinance adopting the local coastal program amendment with the commission proposed modifications.on january,the local coastal program amendment became effective when the commission concurred with douglas determination that the city had accepted the modifications proposed on june.
d.the trial court proceedings 
the mandate petition 
on february,plaintiffs filed a verified mandate petition challenging the commission approval of the local coastal program amendment asserting claims based on with the coastal act and the california environmental quality act.plaintiffs alleged three causes of action the commission violated numerous land use plan policies of the city the commission certification of the local coastal program amendment violated the california environmental quality act and the city adoption of the local coastal program amendment was contrary to the land use plan and constituted impermissible spot zoning.
the trial court rulings 
coastal act issues 
on february,the trial court issued a decision granting the mandate petition in part.as to plaintiffs challenge of the appropriate buffer for environmentally sensitive habitat areas,the trial court found the commission could use commonsense and principles of equity to consider the appropriate buffer provided its conclusion was supported by scientific evidence.the trial court found crawford no buffer conclusion supported the commission imposition of a buffer if the city had consulted with the department of fish and game as required under local implementation plan section.because there was no evidence that the department of fish and game was consulted,the commission staff report did not constitute substantial evidence to support the buffer requirement.as will be noted,the trial court,in response to the developer new trial motion,reversed the finding that there was insufficient consultation with the department of fish and game.
the trial court rejected plaintiffs argument that the local coastal program amendment violated the city land use plan policy because the foot lot width of the proposed lots was less than the foot average parcel width for the city single density zoned beachfront lots and the foot average of broad beach properties.the city land use plan policy requires,the minimum lot size in all land use designations shall not allow land divisions,except merger and lot line adjustments,where the created parcels would be smaller than the average size of surrounding parcels.the trial court found the local coastal program amendment would result in lots each greater than acre on the subject property,while the parcels on each side of the property were and acres.thus,according to the trial court,the proposed lots were consistent with the city land use plan policy.
the trial court also rejected plaintiffs contention that the local coastal program amendment violated the city land use plan policy requirement of one contiguous view corridor of at least feet percent of the property lineal frontage.the trial court found the city land use plan policy requires that percent of the lineal frontage for a particular lot be available or a contiguous view corridor not percent of the undivided parcel.thus,once the property is divided into lots,the developer could have provided for three foot corridors between houses with perimeter corridors and still complied with the city land use plan policy.the trial court ruled substantial evidence supported the commission conclusion that two foot view corridors met the requirements of land use plan policies and.
california environmental quality act issues 
the trial court ruled the commission failed to comply with various provisions of the california environmental quality act.the commission argued it was a responsible and not the lead agency under the california environmental quality act.the trial court rejected this contention.the trial court ruled the commission was the lead agency.the trial court found that under public resources code section,the commission must certify the proposed local coastal program amendment.absent commission certification,the local coastal program amendment could not take effect.and according to the trial court,the commission does not share approval authority with the city.hence,in the trial court view,the commission is a lead,not a responsible,agency.
the trial court found the city and the commission were required to,but did not,consider the cumulative impacts of the local coastal program amendment.the trial court agreed the commission was not required to conduct cumulative impact analysis for two developed lots that were previously tied.this was because it was unlikely that the two parcels would be untied and subdivided in the future given the local coastal program policies that restricted potential development of these tied lots.however,the trial court ruled the city and the commission should have performed an environmental impact analysis on the two developed lots that could be feasibly subdivided in the future.the trial court ruled,it may be that the c ity biologist would apply the same environmentally sensitive habitat areas analysis to these two lots that no dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas protection is required beyond the stringline the court can not assume that to be true.engel also may have a different opinion.moreover,the report fails an informational document with respect to that issue.the trial court also found the commission failed to adequately respond to comments concerning the cumulative impacts of the local coastal program amendment on the two affected lots.
further,the trial court ruled the commission staff report failed as an informational document due to inadequate analysis of the alternatives of a wider view corridor and fewer lots in the subdivision of the subject property.the trial court noted the city considered alternatives by comparing view corridors and development envelopes for one,two,three and four lots on the subject property and concluded,f our lots resulted in the smallest development footprint and greatest viewing area and was the least environmentally damaging alternative.but the commission staff report did not expressly state it relied on the city alternatives analysis.the trial court also found t here is no analysis of the view corridors for the other two lots affected by the local coastal program amendment,and whether different development envelopes would mitigate view impacts from those lots.the c ommission did impose local implementation plan s ection e,which would prevent a reduction in view corridor for those two lots,but provides no analysis of the view corridors and development envelopes for those two lots.
the trial court also agreed with plaintiffs argument that the commission did not provide adequate notice and time for public review of the staff report.the commission argued it complied with its regulations by mailing notice of the meeting and posting the staff report on may,days priors to the june,hearing.the day notice of the hearing and circulation of the staff report by the commission exceeded the regulations requirement of a minimum of days for the report and days for the hearing notice.but,the trial court ruled the commission regulations failed to comply with the day public review period required under public resources code section,subdivision a.the trial court also found that the day review period was unreasonable because the issues concerned a zoning amendment that affected more than the subject property,they were biological in nature,and the commission released the staff report addendum just days before the hearing.the trial court further held plaintiffs did not have to show prejudice although lack of adequate notice usually requires prejudice in other contexts,and there is no evidence that plaintiffs or any other member of the public was prejudiced by the actual notice and period for comment on the staff report,full compliance with the letter of the california environmental quality act is essential to its public purpose and a failure to provide the full day period by itself warrants setting aside the commission decision.
on february,the developer filed a new trial motion.on april,the trial court granted the new trial motion with respect to the department of fish and game consultation issue.the trial court found consultation,within the meaning of local implementation plan section.g,had occurred.but the trial court otherwise denied the developer new trial motion.

the city local implementation plan contains specific standards for various types of environmentally sensitive habitat areas.section of the city local implementation requires foot buffers for,wetlands,woodland,coastal bluff,coastal sage scrub,and chaparral environmentally sensitive habitat areas.but the city local implementation plan section.g provides,for other environmentally sensitive habitat area areas not listed above,the buffer recommended by the environmental review board or city biologist,in consultation with the california department of fish and game,as necessary to avoid adverse impacts to the environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall be required.as will be apparent,the commission,the city and the developer rely on the more flexible buffer requirement in the city local implementation plan section.
buffer for dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas 
plaintiffs argue the buffer,as certified by the commission on november,fails to conform to the city land use plan policy.plaintiffs assert the city land use plan policy requirement must be imposed for all environmentally sensitive habitat areas.the commission,the city and the developer argue there is no requirement of a foot buffer for dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas because of the provisions of local implementation plan section.and they argue there is substantial evidence to support the buffer requirement.we agree with the commission,the city and the developer.
the city land use plan policy,with its foot buffer requirement,can not be considered in isolation.rather,as we will explain,the city land use plan policy must be considered in conjunction with its local implementation plan section.g.the city local implementation plan section.g,which applies to dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas,as is present here,does not in all cases require a foot buffer.the commission regulations set forth the applicable method for examining implementing actions,the standard of review of the implementing actions shall be the land use plan as certified by the commission,tit,subd.c.further,public resources code section defines a local coastal program and includes the land use plans and implementing actions,which when construed together,further the purposes of the coastal act at the local level.see yost thomas,supra,cal d at.when certifying the local implementation plan,including amendments,the commission is required to consult the land use plan.this is done to ensure conformity between the land use and the local implementation plans.pub.resources code.
the city land use plan policy and local implementation plan section.g,which were simultaneously certified by the commission on september,should be interpreted together to give effect to all provisions of the local coastal program.san leandro teachers governing board of the san leandro unified school district cal th,provisions are construed in reference to each other so as to give each part effect devita county of napa cal th,same.further,our supreme court has held when two statutes touch upon a common subject,they are to be construed in reference to each other,so as to harmonize the two in such a way that no part of either becomes surplusage.citations.san leandro teachers governing board of san leandro unified school,supra,cal th at devita county of napa,supra,cal th at chaffee san francisco public library com.th.our supreme court has also held,if conflicting statutes can not be reconciled more specific provisions take precedence over general ones citation.collection bureau of san jose rumsey cal th,strother california coastal com.th.in addition,our supreme court has held,i f a specific statute is enacted covering a particular subject,the specific statute controls and takes priority over a general statute encompassing the same subject.estate of kramme cal d,los angeles county dependency attorneys,department of general services th.
the foot buffer specified in the city land use plan policy applies to all environmentally sensitive habitat areas.by contrast,the city local implementation plan section requires a foot buffer for,wetlands,woodland,coastal bluff,coastal sage scrub and chaparral environmentally sensitive habitat areas.for other than the immediately foregoing areas,the buffer is that recommended by the environmental review board or city biologist,in consultation with the california department of fish and game as necessary to avoid adverse impacts to the environmentally sensitive habitat areas.local implementation plan section.g see fn,supra.
plaintiffs argue we should apply the foot buffer in the city land use plan policy to all environmentally sensitive habitat areas.this application,plaintiffs argue,must be made without regard to those specified in the city local implementation plan section.such an interpretation would render the city local implementation plan section superfluous and inoperable.moreover,the city local implementation plan section with its differing treatment of various environmental conditions is more specific than the broad foot requirement in the city land use plan policy.further,in the case of environmentally sensitive habitat areas other than,wetlands,woodland,coastal bluff,coastal sage scrub,and chaparral environments,local implementation plan section.g provides a specified method for determining the appropriate buffer.
finally,the commission has interpreted the city land use plan policy in conjunction with local implementation plan section.the commission interpretation of the city land use plan policy is entitled to deference.as we have previously explained,the commission drafted and simultaneously certified the city land use plan and local implementation plan.as noted,we grant broad deference to the commission interpretation of the local coastal program it prepared.albertstone california coastal com.th,trancas property owners city of malibu th.

impacts to habitat values or sensitive species 
plaintiffs also argue the local coastal program amendment does not conform to the city land use plan policy because the foot buffer does not minimize the impacts to habitat values or sensitive species to the maximum extent feasible.plaintiffs contend the commission was required to find that the foot buffer in the city land use plan policy or the foot buffer recommended by engel were infeasible.plaintiffs are incorrect.
the city land use plan policy provides,development adjacent to environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall minimize impacts to habitat values or sensitive species to the maximum extent feasible.the provision does not require the commission to consider the feasibility of the larger buffers.moreover,the overlay district in the local coastal program amendment eliminated any impacts to dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas by imposing a dune buffer,restoration plan and conservation easement over the subject property.
substantial evidence supports the commission determination that a minimum buffer would provide adequate protection and transitional habitat.the commission considered the biological reports from the developer consultants and letters from the city biologist,crawford.crawford agreed with the dune habitat analysis of the developer consultants and did not include the area as part of dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas.nevertheless,the commission accepted engel expansion of dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas to include the area.
in making this determination,the commission also considered the habitat of sensitive species that might be affected by development of the subject property including the western snowy plover,the globose dune beetle,red sand verbena a succulent sand dune plant and kite a bird.no doubt,the property lies within critical habitat for the federally threatened snowy plover.but the united states department of the interior,fish and wildlife service staff concurred with the developer that the proposed project would not result in the taking of the western snowy plover because they are not known to nest at broad beach or live near the subject property.likewise,red sand verbena,globose dune beetle,and kite do not occur or utilize habitat in the area of the subject property.a study of globose dune beetle habitat by the developer biologist,cristina sandoval,indicated that at its closest,the insect habitat was about feet away from the subject property rear yard stringline.the red sand verbena,a characteristic of foredune,was a minimum of feet away from the setback.although the dune sensitive species warranting buffer protection were to feet away from the stringline,the commission imposed a foot buffer from the stringline to provide for transitional habitat.
plaintiffs also contend the commission decision to impose a foot rather than the recommended foot buffer was not based on biological considerations or scientific analysis but grounded on equitable factors.they argue the commission is not authorized to consider the existing development pattern or equitable factors.plaintiffs rely on the city land use plan policy,which states in part,protection of environmentally sensitive habitat areas,shall take priority over other development standards and where there is any conflict,the standards that are most protective of environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall have precedence.plaintiffs concede that most of the existing development in the area,including ross home,was constructed up to the stringline and does not incorporate the foot buffer.but they suggest that most if not all of the existing development predated the adoption of the current land use plan policies.
the commission did not abuse its discretion by imposing the buffer based on both equitable and environmental considerations.plaintiffs assertion that most,if not all,of the existing development predated the adoption of the current land use plan policies is contrary to the evidence in the record.in an april,letter to the commission,crawford stated that he and the environmental review board had established a standard buffer policy for dune habitat on beachfront property.the policy requires that development go no further seaward than the stringline in conjunction with a dune restoration plan.the restoration plan was established because the remnant dunes in malibu are highly disturbed and have limited function and value.this policy,according to crawford,was in effect for numerous projects along broad beach.crawford explained,the majority of the dunes remaining in malibu support predominately and invasive ice plant,that not only and often eliminates the native dune vegetation,but the dunes,thus resulting in an unnatural condition that prevents the natural movement of the dunes and reduces their value as native habitat.by allowing development consistent with the stringline standard,the city can require projects to incorporate dune restoration plans.over time,this requirement will improve the remnant dune biological functions and values.
in addition,the commission considered evidence that no buffer setbacks have been required in other coastal development permit approvals in the city.executive director douglas stated i n this case,when you look at the other approvals in the city of malibu,that there were no buffer setbacks required before,we did appeal those approvals in the past,and therefore this is a case of first impression.so,we felt that treating this party similarly to others situated in the same way made sense,but the additional factor was that the restoration that we are getting here was of such importance that we felt both the equity issues,in terms of how others had been treated and this is the first time that we are requiring this kind of a buffer and the restoration component warranted the requirement of a foot buffer to avoid a direct impact on the environmentally sensitive habitat areas.besides the equitable considerations,the commission buffer determination was based on numerous biological reports and took into account crawford no buffer recommendation.thus,plaintiffs contention that the commission decision to impose a buffer was not based on biological considerations or scientific analysis is without merit.
native vegetation buffer 
plaintiffs contend the local coastal program amendment setback does not include a native vegetation buffer area around the dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas as required by the city land use plan policy.in addition to the foot buffer we have discussed,the city land use plan policy requires that development adjacent to environmentally sensitive habitat areas minimize impacts to habitat values or sensitive species to the maximum extent feasible.further,the city land use plan policy mandates that native vegetation buffer areas be provided around environmentally sensitive habitat areas the native vegetation buffer areas are to serve as transitional habitat and provide distance and physical barriers to human intrusion and the buffer areas shall be of sufficient size to ensure the biological integrity and preservation of the environmentally sensitive habitat areas they are designed to protect.plaintiffs maintain the setback was intended to accommodate human occupancy for home maintenance purposes.however,the commission found that a buffer from the designated environmentally sensitive habitat areas would be both equitable and protective of the biological integrity of the onsite dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas after implementation of the dune restoration plan.moreover,the overlay district for the subject property allows for dune restoration and two wide walkways through the dunes.the pathways are sited in the area of existing walkways in the buffer.but the overlay district prohibits dwellings,decks,patios,and other structures within the buffer.in addition,the city local implementation plan ensures the buffer only includes native habitat.under local implementation plan section,new development adjacent to environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall provide native vegetation buffer areas to serve as transitional habitat and provide distance and physical barriers to human intrusion.the city local implementation plan section requires native plants that blend with existing natural vegetation and natural habitats on the site and prohibits invasive plant species.
consultation with the department of fish and game 
plaintiffs argue there is no evidence crawford engaged in actual consultation with the department of fish and game.the city local implementation plan section.g requires consultation with the department of fish and game concerning avoidance of adverse impacts to environmentally sensitive habitat areas in developing native vegetation buffer areas.the city staff sent the department of fish and game the mitigated negative declaration that addressed both the local coastal program amendment and development of the subject property.the mitigated negative declaration submitted by the city discussed the recommendation of the city biologist,crawford,of a stringline development standard and a foot buffer for restored dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas.
the city staff also submitted a de minimis impact finding to the department of fish and game along with a filing fee.the department of fish and game accepted payment and provided a receipt.under fish and game code section,subdivision a,the filing fee defrays the costs of consulting with other public agencies the department shall impose and collect a filing fee in the amount prescribed in subdivision d to defray the costs of managing and protecting fish and wildlife trust resources,including,but not limited to,consulting with other public agencies,reviewing environmental documents,recommending mitigation measures,developing monitoring requirements for purposes of the california environmental quality act,consulting pursuant to section of the public resources code,and other activities italics added.no employee of the department of game and fish objected or otherwise responded to the city staff submission.had the department of fish and game staff disagreed with the city staff position,it could have objected to the buffer and rejected the de minimis impact findings.
the fact that the city did not alert the department of fish and game that it was consulting under local implementation plan section.g does not invalidate the consultation.the department of fish and game staff received the city mitigated negative declaration and de minimis impact findings and we presume that it performed its consulting function,it is presumed that official duty has been regularly performed southern cal.underground contractors,city of san diego th,it was presumed the city council members read written briefs before voting to bar a contractor from working within the city limits.there is substantial evidence crawford followed the city local implementation plan section.g by consulting with the department of fish and game on the buffer for dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas.
minimum lot size 
the city land use plan policy states,the minimum lot size in all land use designations shall not allow land divisions,except mergers,and lot line adjustments,where the created parcels would be smaller than the average size of the surrounding parcels.plaintiffs argue the local coastal program amendment does not conform with the city land use plan policy.they reason the foot wide lots permitted under the local coastal program amendment would be smaller than the average size of the surrounding parcels.the surrounding parcels average feet.plaintiffs contend the size of a lot necessarily includes its width thus,it was error to conclude size means only area.plaintiffs arguments are unpersuasive.
the city local implementation plan section requires all new parcels created in the single family district to comply with minimum lot area width and depth specification.the local coastal program amendment alters the lot width minimum under the city local implementation plan section from to feet.but the local coastal program amendment does not change the minimum lot area,which remains unit per acre for the single density zone.the city land use plan policy discusses lot size,not lot width.the commission staff report discussed the separate lot width and size minimum requirements when evaluating the impact of the local coastal program amendment on future subdivision and development.the staff report concluded that of the beachfront single density zoned parcels,only met both the lot size and width minimum requirement.furthermore,the commission deputy director discussed the lot size requirement at the june,hearing the lot size issue,the consistency of the lot sizes on broad beach,we do think that these parcels are consistent.we looked at all of the parcel sizes on broad beach and most of them fall within to feet.there are some larger ones that eschew the average up to,and these lots are a in size.it is not just the lot width,but it is also the lot size of the parcel.we do believe that the lot sizes are consistent with other lots on broad beach.
here,the developers propose to divide the subject property into four parcels.the subject property is slightly more than acre in size with a lot width ranging from to feet.the proposed lots would be larger than the adjacent lot to the west which is acre in size,and that to the east which consists of acre.thus,the commission could properly find that the proposed project was consistent with the city land use plan policy requirement that new subdivisions not be smaller than the average size of surrounding parcels.
the balance of the opinion is to be published.
california environmental quality.overview 
the commission challenges the ruling that it failed to comply with specified provisions of the california environmental quality act.the city and the developers join in the commission arguments.plaintiffs contest the trial court ruling on one of their claims under the california environmental quality act.

as explained previously,once the secretary certifies a regulatory program,as occurred here,an administrative agency is exempted from the requirements of preparing initial studies,negative declarations and environmental impact reports.in that case,the agency must prepare paperwork which acts as a substitute document for the normal environmental review papers,such as an environmental impact report.pub.resources code,subd.a the requirements of a certified regulatory program which permits an agency to use a substitute document in lieu of planning documents such as an environmental impact report are specified in public resources code section,subdivision d

we apply the pertinent provisions of public resources code section,subdivisions d b,d d,d f and d,and guidelines section,subdivision a in evaluating plaintiffs procedural and substantive challenges to the commission approval of the city local coastal program amendment.some of the parties briefing relies on statutory and regulatory requirements for review of an environmental impact report.no doubt,there is an overlap between the requirements of a substitute document prepared for use in a certified regulatory program and those applicable to the preparation of an environmental impact report.we need not describe in detail how the requirements for a negative declaration or an environmental report,on one hand,and a certified program substitute document,on the other,differ or are the same.rather,we apply the statutory and regulatory requirements specified in public resources code section,subdivisions d b,d d,d f and d,and guidelines section,subdivision a.we hold the commission documentation complies with the relevant substantive and procedural requirements applicable to a certified regulatory program substitute document.
public review period 
the trial court refused to apply the review period for notice of public circulation of the commission staff report in california code of regulations,title,section which is part of the certified regulatory program approved by the secretary.california code of regulations,title,section requires a hearing be held on any proposed land use plan unless no substantial issue is raised by the proposal.california code of regulations,title,section requires the commission executive director to prepare a staff recommendation prior to a hearing on a proposed land use plan.the staff recommendation must set forth specific findings,including a statement of facts and legal conclusions,as to whether a proposed land use plan conforms to the requirements of the coastal act and the commission regulations.the proposed findings must include any suggested modifications necessary to bring the land use plan into compliance with the coastal act.if the local government has requested that no modifications be part of the commission action,then the staff report need not discuss any amendments.the proposed findings must also include any additional documentation,governmental actions or other activity necessary to carry out the coastal act requirements,tit.california code of regulations,title,section provides a time frame for circulation of the staff report prior to the hearing,in order to assure adequate notification the final staff recommendation shall be distributed to all commissioners,to the governing authority,to all affected cities and counties,and to all other agencies,individuals and organizations who have so requested or who are known by the executive director to have a particular interest in the local coastal program or long range development plan,within a reasonable time but in no event less than calendar days prior to the scheduled public hearing.as noted,the commission gave days notice in the case.the trial court ruled the commission was obligated to comply with the longer day public review period under public resources code section,subdivision a the time frame applicable to draft environmental impact reports.we hold the commission certified regulatory program is exempted from the notice and comment requirements of public resources code section,subdivision a.

the trial court relied on ultramar,south coast air quality management dist.th,in imposing the day review period for the staff report.ultramar involved a certified regulatory program adopted by the south coast air quality management district.rather than prepare an environmental impact report,the south coast air quality management district regulations permitted the agency to draft an abbreviated environmental assessment.id.at.the south coast air quality management district adopted the california environmental quality act implementation guidelines which thereby included the public resources code section,subdivision a day period for review of a draft abbreviated environmental assessment.id.at.our colleagues in division one of this appellate district held that since the south coast air quality management district own certified program adopted the california environmental quality act implementation guidelines,compliance with the public resources code section,subdivision a day review period was mandatory.id.at.the term implementation guidelines did not refer to the regulatory provisions in the guidelines.rather,the court of appeal explained that the secretary expected the same rules would apply to environmental impact reports and environmental assessments by the south coast air quality management district.id.at.
the trial court also relied on joy road area forest and watershed california department of forestry and fire protection th.in joy road,the department of forestry and fire protection approved a timber harvest plan without complying with the notice and recirculation requirements under public resources code sections and.id.at.the court of appeal held the department of forestry and fire protection certified regulatory program exemption from california environmental quality act requirements did not extend to the agency notice and recirculation provisions.id.at.
neither ultramar nor joy road is controlling.to begin with,public resources code section provides for the primacy of the coastal act over the california environmental quality act statutory provisions no provision of this division is a limitation or restriction on the power or authority of any public agency in the enforcement or administration of any provision of law which it is specifically permitted or required to enforce or administer,including,but not limited to,the powers and authority granted to the california coastal commission pursuant to division commencing with section.to the extent of any inconsistency or conflict between the provisions of the california coastal act of division commencing with section and the provisions of this division,the provisions of division commencing with section shall control.our colleagues in division three of the fourth appellate district,have explained in sierra club california coastal com.cal th,the supreme court applied section,stating,to the extent of any inconsistency or conflict between the provisions of the coastal act and the provisions of the california environmental quality act,the provisions of the coastal act shall control.id.at.strother.california coastal com.th.further,the notice period is part of the commission certified regulatory period and thus has the force of law.here the commission,with its broad powers specified in public resources code section,was acting in compliance with a certified regulatory program which allows for a period in which to act that differs from the public resources code section,subdivision a day review period.neither ultramar nor joy road involves a similar grant of power and a certified regulatory program which expressly deviates from the day notice time frame specified in public resources code section,subdivision a for a draft environmental impact report.
lead agency 
the commission contends the trial court erred in requiring compliance with provisions of the california environmental quality act that apply only to lead agencies.the commission argues it was the responsible,not the lead agency.the commission reasons the city was the first public agency to review the project.the commission asserts the city is the only agency involved in review of the project that has general governmental powers.the commission argues as the responsible agency,it does not have to comply with california environmental quality act provisions regarding public review requirements response to public comments alternatives analysis and cumulative impact analysis.these requirements,the commission notes,only specifically apply to the preparation,review and certification of environmental documentation by lead agencies.
public resource code section defines,lead agency as the public agency with the principal responsibility for approving a project.public resources code section defines a responsible agency as any other public agency that shares responsibility for approving a project.in some cases,two or more public entities may qualify as a lead agency.in that case,the entity that acts first is the lead agency.citizens task force on sohio board of harbor commissioners cal d,guidelines,section,subd.c.
under public resources code section,both the city and the commission are exempted from preparing an environmental impact report prior to approval of a local coastal program amendment.pub.resources code,santa barbara county flower and nursery growers,county of santa barbara th.under guidelines section a the california environmental quality act does not apply to activities and approvals pursuant to the california coastal act by any local government necessary for the preparation and adoption of a local coastal program c this section shifts the burden of california environmental quality act compliance from the local agency to the california coastal commission santa barbara county flower and nursery growers,county of santa barbara,supra,th at.thus,the commission,not the city,has the burden of complying with the california environmental quality act in connection with the local coastal program amendments.but,as noted,the commission is exempted from preparing an environmental impact report because of the secretary approval of its certified regulatory program.thus,the commission must only comply with the environmental documentation requirements in public resources code section,subdivisions d b,d d,d f and d which are synthesized in detail in sierra club state board of forestry,supra,cal th at pages and guidelines section,subdivision a.hence,no environmental impact report had to be prepared in this case.nor are the requirements imposed on a lead agency for preparation of an environmental impact report applicable to the commission environmental decisionmaking.
adequacy of response to public comments 
the trial court ruled the commission failed to respond to plaintiffs comments on cumulative impacts.we disagree.for purposes of public resources code section,subdivisions d b,d d,d f and d,and guidelines section,subdivision a,the commission adequately responded to plaintiffs comments on the cumulative effects of adoption of the local coastal program amendment.plaintiffs commented that the local coastal program amendment would cause view corridor impacts,accelerate erosion,reduce bluewater views,and threaten the integrity of environmentally sensitive habitat areas.plaintiffs generally commented that the local coastal program amendment could result in significant direct,indirect,and cumulative effects on the environment in the areas of land use,environmentally sensitive habitat areas,view corridors and parking.the june,staff report addendum responded that although the foot width standard would apply to all beachfront parcels zoned medium density,the only vacant site that would be affected was the subject property other properties could be affected by the new foot width standard only if the existing structures were demolished and the review of environmentally sensitive habitat areas had been conducted to a level of specificity that would normally be carried out at a coastal development permit juncture,rather than a local coastal program approval stage.
the june,staff report addendum also addressed comments regarding view resources.the staff recommended the addition of section e to the city local implementation plan to require no less than percent of the lineal frontage of each newly created parcel be maintained as one contiguous public view corridor even if the new lots were feet or less in width.thus,the commission responded to plaintiffs general comments about land use and environmentally sensitive habitat areas.further,the commission added local implementation plan section e in response to plaintiffs specific comment about the view corridor impacts.in addition,the commission also considered the city responses to plaintiffs comments.
plaintiffs also generally commented that the mitigated negative declaration failed to adequately discuss potential cumulative impacts to biological resources,view corridors,land use,parking,traffic and hydrology and water quality.plaintiffs argued the local coastal program amendment allowed for great density as lots could be combined and then readjusted to form additional buildable parcels along the entire coastline.the city staff response to these general comments are found in the november,report.authored by an assistant planner,the report explained the city staff methodology for identifying the lots which would be affected by the local coastal program amendment and stated that the development pattern would be consistent with existing patterns and parcel widths.the report further stated cumulative impacts were negligible because mitigation measures would be imposed on the subject property and the local coastal program amendment applied to only two other recently developed lots in the city.the city and the commission adequately responded to plaintiffs comments regarding cumulative impacts during the local coastal program amendment process.no violation of the content requirements imposed by public resources code section,subdivisions d b,d d,d f and d or guidelines section,subdivision a occurred.
project alternatives 
the trial court found the commission staff report failed as an informational document on the alternatives of a wider view corridor and whether fewer lots should result from the subdivision of the subject property.the trial court noted that the city considered alternatives by comparing view corridors and development envelopes for one,two,three and four lots on the subject property.the trial court further stated that the city found that four lots resulted in the smallest development footprint provided the greatest viewing area and was the least environmentally damaging alternative.despite acknowledging the foregoing city analysis,the trial court ruled,the commission staff report does not even say that it is relying on the c ity analysis of alternatives as previously noted,the trial court also found t here is no analysis of the view corridors for the other two lots affected by the local coastal program amendment,and whether different development envelopes would mitigate view impacts from those lots.the c ommission did impose local implementation plan,s ection e,which would prevent a reduction in view corridor for those two lots,but provides no analysis of the view corridors and development envelopes for those two lots.the commission,city and the developer contend the commission adequately considered alternatives to the project.we agree.
the commission staff report considered reasonable alternatives to the local coastal program amendment.the commission staff report considered alternatives to the proposed configuration.the commission staff report discussed a potential layout of the subject property with lots with foot widths lot with a foot width as well as lot configurations with different view corridors.the commission found that under the local coastal program amendment,as initially proffered by the city,smaller view corridors on either side of subdivided parcels could occur which would impact visual resources.to mitigate this problem,the commission considered the alternative of requiring greater view corridors for lots that could be subdivided under the local coastal program.as noted,the commission required amendment to the city local implementation plan section e,which as ultimately certified,mandates larger view corridors for subdivided parcels where the resultant lots are feet or less in width.
in addition,the city submitted its alternatives analysis to the commission.the commission considered the city alternatives analysis as part of the local coastal program amendment process.the city compared view corridors and development footprints for one,two,three and four lots on the subject property.the city found that four lots resulted in the greatest viewing area,the smallest development footprint and the least environmentally damaging alternative.thus,the entire administrative record before the commission demonstrates consideration of alternatives to the city proposed coastal program amendment.
the parties cumulative impact contentions 
plaintiffs arguments 
as noted,plaintiffs appealed from that portion of the judgment which did not favor them.plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in accepting the commission unsupported conclusion that the local coastal program amendment would allow for subdivision of no more than three lots.we evaluate this contention in the context of whether the commission staff report complies with the requirements imposed in public resources code section,subdivisions d b,d d,d f and d,and guidelines section,subdivision a.as noted,in the revised initial study and mitigated negative declaration,the city council found only two developed lots which could potentially,under the local coastal program amendment,be subdivided to create an additional parcel each in the event of the demolition of the existing homes.to subdivide,the owners of these two developed parcels would be required to apply for a coastal development permit and environmental review under the california environmental quality act.the city staff discussion concerning the two currently developed lots in the revised initial study and mitigated negative declaration was part of the analysis as to why the local coastal program amendment would have negligible direct and cumulative impacts on aesthetics,biological resources and land use and planning.
the commission staff report relied on the city staff analysis of the number and location of the lots,other than the subject property,that could be affected by the local coastal program amendment.the commission staff report discussed in depth the city staff findings incorporated into the mitigated negative declaration the commission staff report cited to the following analysis by the city staff the categorization of parcels as either vacant or developed the evaluation of both the lot width and size the finding that only lots,which have lot widths of at least feet,could be potentially subdivided under the local coastal program amendment foot lot width standard of the lots,parcels could not be divided because they do not have the minimum required acreage another lots could not be subdivided under the local implementation plan section.r because they would require a shoreline protection device the conclusion that only developed lots could be potentially subdivided under the local coastal program amendment the finding that of the parcels resulted from prior lot ties or mergers and these lots were created by combining smaller,approximately foot wide parcels.thus,only the aforementioned two developed parcels could potentially be subdivided under the local coastal program amendment.
in the face of this evidence,plaintiffs argue there is no legal or factual basis to conclude that the two previously tied or merged lots could not be subdivided under the local coastal program amendment.and plaintiffs argue,the commission,itself,should be required to conduct environmental review on these two lots.plaintiffs also contend the local coastal program amendment could have additional environmental impacts associated with the creation of new lots because developed adjoining properties could potentially merge and subdivide into more parcels.plaintiffs conclude this part of their analysis by arguing the trial court should have required review of all lots in the city that could be divided.we disagree.
no provision of law required the commission to speculate on the environmental impacts of the two previously tied parcels or on lots that could be created in the future through purchase of developed adjoining properties that could be merged and subdivided.moreover,the two previously tied lots are unlikely to be subdivided because they were tied through a covenant and there is no evidence the city would allow redivision of those lots,a covenant running with the land binds successors citizens for covenant compliance anderson cal th,same.in addition,any future subdivision of already developed lots would require a coastal development permit.the future subdivided lots would need to comply with all the requirements of the local coastal program,including provisions regarding minimum lot size,protection of coastal resources including environmentally sensitive habitat areas,and restrictions on mergers and subdivisions.
the two developed lots the appeals of the commission,the city and the developer 
the commission,city and developer argue it was error for the trial court to require further environmental analyses on the two developed lots that could potentially be subdivided under the local coastal program amendment.they contend the california environmental quality act does not require a environmental analysis for the local coastal program amendment,which sets forth the land use standards for development.we agree.
in response to the developer request for a coastal development permit,the city and commission obtained information on the existing views proposed view corridors and dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas for the subject property.the commission properly considered the secondary effects that could follow from the local coastal program amendment of the lot width standard.the commission staff report found the local coastal program amendment,as initially submitted by the city,would increase the number of lots.this would in turn result in smaller view corridors.because the local coastal program amendment could have a significant adverse effect on visual resources,the commission lessened these view impacts to below a level of significance by requiring the adoption of local implementation plan section e.as noted,this amendment created larger view corridors from pacific coast highway to the ocean.new local implementation plan section e requires a minimum of percent of the lineal frontage of each newly created parcel be maintained as one contiguous public view corridor even if the lots are feet or less in width.
in addition,the commission staff report also discussed the general conditions of dune environmentally sensitive habitat areas in the city.the commission staff report indicated the dunes range from lightly to heavily impacted and were invaded by plants.according to the city biologist,crawford,the remnant dunes in malibu are highly disturbed and have limited function and value.crawford stated,the majority of the dunes remaining in malibu support predominately and invasive ice plant,that not only and often eliminates the native dune vegetation,but the dunes,thus resulting in an unnatural condition that prevents the natural movement of the dunes and reduces their value as native habitat.
in light of the foregoing environmental analysis,the commission was not required to conduct biological reports on the two developed lots that might someday subdivide.it is unreasonable to require the commission,city or developer to conduct a biological assessment on developed private property they do not own and for which there is no reason to expect will be subdivided.should these two developed lots be subdivided in the future,their owners would need to obtain a coastal development permit,which would require a environmental impact analysis,including a review of environmentally sensitive habitat areas on the lots.no further discussion was necessary.
