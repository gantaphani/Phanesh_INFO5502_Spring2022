appellants bnsf railway company and union pacific railroad company the railroads formerly maintained railroad tracks on a parcel of land in stockton,california,that was contaminated by petroleum.the petroleum was spilled at a nearby industrial site and migrated onto the property via an underground french drain the railroads had installed in order to remove water from the roadbed.we consider whether the railroads are liable for the contamination of the property under the law of nuisance or under california polanco redevelopment act polanco act,cal.health safety code et.we hold that they are not.
there is no evidence that the railroads actively or knowingly caused or permitted the contamination as required for nuisance liability and liability under the polanco act water code provision.nor were the railroads owners of the property under the polanco act cercla provision when the contamination occurred.because the record establishes no genuine issue of material fact as to the railroads liability,the railroads are entitled to summary judgment.therefore,we need not reach any of the damages issues on appeal or.
in,in order to make room for the construction of a freeway interchange between interstate and state highway in stockton,california,the state of california entered into a contract the agreement with several railroad companies,to the railroads,to relocate existing railroad track from the proposed interchange site to a nearby parcel the property.under the agreement,the railroads planned and approved grading and drainage improvements to the property made by the state,including the installation of a french drain underneath the new roadbed.the french drain,a buried perforated pipe,was designed to improve soil stability by facilitating drainage.after these improvements were completed,the railroads laid track on the property.the railroads agreed to maintain the track,roadbed and drainage,and the state agreed to convey to the railroads all necessary for track operation.although the railroads began running trains over the track in,the state did not actually transfer the deed to the underlying land to the railroads until.
in,the railroads sold their interest in the property to appellee,the redevelopment agency of the city of stockton the agency,which planned to develop the site.in,the agency sold a portion of the property known as area to a commercial developer while retaining those portions known as area and area and indemnified the developer for costs incurred due to any contamination discovered on the site.when site excavation began in preparation for development,petroleum contamination was found in the soil along the path of the french drain and in the groundwater.testing indicated that the contamination was at least twenty years old,and its likely source was determined to be the nearby l m bulk petroleum facility the l m site where there had been several spills in the early,including a spill of up to gallons of diesel fuel in.it is undisputed that the french drain served as a preferential pathway through which the petroleum contamination migrated underground onto the property.
after the contamination was discovered in july,the developer and the agency began to work with environmental consultants and regulators to develop a remediation workplan for area.the agency sent notices to the railroads requesting that they prepare remedial action plans for areas,and,but the railroads did not respond to any of them.in the fall of,a trench approximately feet long,to feet deep,and to feet wide was excavated on area to remove contaminated soil.the agency incurred costs of over million for this work,plus additional costs of nearly million dollars for investigation and remediation work on areas and between and.
on september,the agency sued the railroads in california superior court,seeking cost recovery and an injunction requiring the railroads to remediate any remaining contamination at the property.the agency alleged that the railroads were liable for the contamination under the polanco redevelopment act as well as the common law of nuisance.the railroads removed the action to the united states district court for the eastern district of california under diversity jurisdiction.the railroads and the agency filed for summary judgment.on june,the district court ruled that the railroads were liable for the contamination under the law of nuisance and under the polanco act water code provision but not under the polanco act cercla provision.see cal.health safety code h.the agency was awarded over eight hundred thousand dollars in damages and an injunction.the parties appeal and as to the findings of liability and the damages award.

california law defines a nuisance,in part,as a nything which is injurious to health or is indecent or offensive to the senses,or an obstruction to the free use of property,so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property cal.to qualify as a nuisance the interference must be both substantial and unreasonable.people ex rel.gallo acuna,cal th,d,emphasis in original see also san diego gas superior court,cal th,d.it is undisputed that the soil and groundwater contamination in this case constitutes a nuisance.see california campbell,cir citing carter chotiner,cal,selma pressure treating osmose wood preserving of,d.the question is whether the railroads are liable for it.
at the outset,we clarify how the concept of unreasonableness plays into nuisance liability.the railroads invoke lussier san lorenzo valley water district,d,for the proposition that nuisance liability requires an unreasonable act.see id.at.noting that nuisance liability can arise only for such interferences as are intentional and unreasonable or result from negligent,reckless or abnormally dangerous conduct internal quotation marks and citation omitted.however,this proposition confuses the concept of an unreasonable interference,which is required for nuisance liability,with an unreasonable or negligent act,which is not.an intentional but not unreasonable act can give rise to nuisance liability if it creates an unreasonable interference.see id.at.shields wondries,d,noting that a private nuisance may result from skillfully directed efforts,such as the construction of improvements on one property,which nonetheless infringe upon a neighbor property rights.
if the railroads created or assisted in the creation of the nuisance on the property by installing and maintaining the french drain,they are liable,regardless of whether the installation and maintenance of the french drain was conducted in a reasonable manner or not.if the railroads did not create or assist in the creation of the nuisance,they can only be held liable if they acted unreasonably as possessors of the property in failing to discover and abate the nuisance.see lussier,d at.noting the general view that proof of negligence may be essential to a claim of nuisance where the alleged nuisance involves a failure to act.we consider first whether the railroads created the nuisance by installing the french drain and second whether they unreasonably failed to discover and abate it.
nuisance liability does not necessarily hinge on whether the defendant owns,possesses or controls the property,nor on whether he is in a position to abate the nuisance the critical question is whether the defendant created or assisted in the creation of the nuisance.cnty.of santa clara atl.richfield,th,d emphasis in original internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the district court concluded that the railroads created or assisted in the creation of the nuisance because they were a cause of the contamination of the property the contamination would not have migrated onto the property but for the existence of the french drain,and the french drain would not have been installed but for the railroads.
we can not agree that such passive causation is sufficient for nuisance liability to attach.under california law,conduct can not be said to create a nuisance unless it more actively or knowingly generates or permits the specific nuisance condition.for example,in selma pressure treating,the california court of appeal held that a company direct involvement in the design and installation of unsafe disposal systems for chemicals used in a wood treatment process,coupled with its claimed knowledge of the dangers involved in such practices,clearly could support liability based upon a finding that it created or assisted in the creation of a public nuisance.d at.
however,in city of modesto redevelopment agency superior court,th,d,the court of appeal declined to extend selma to hold that those who merely placed hazardous substances in the stream of commerce,as opposed to those who took affirmative steps directed toward the improper discharge of hazardous wastes,could be liable for nuisance.id.at,d see also atl.richfield,th at,d holding that lead paint manufacturers could incur nuisance liability for their intentional promotion of the use of lead paint on the interiors of buildings with knowledge of the public health hazard that this would create,but not for their mere manufacture and distribution of lead paint or their failure to warn of its hazards 
federal cases interpreting california nuisance law reflect this same understanding.see campbell,at defendant manufacturers created a nuisance at a property where they disposed of hazardous waste by dumping it on the ground coast home builders,aventis cropscience usa,wl at defendant waste generators not liable for groundwater contamination at a landfill where their waste was disposed because their conduct was too attenuated from the creation of the alleged nuisance,even though it was a cause of the contamination.
in short,we find no precedent suggesting that causation suffices for nuisance liability,and we will not adopt such an expansive interpretation of california law here.because the railroads conduct with regard to the specific nuisance condition the contamination was not active,affirmative,or knowing,the railroads simply did not create or assist in the creation of the nuisance on the property.they did not spill the petroleum or otherwise release it into the environment.they did not affirmatively direct its flow or knowingly permit it to migrate into the french drain and onto the property.while the railroads may have acted affirmatively with regard to the installation of the french drain,that conduct was wholly unrelated to the contamination.the railroads did not,for example,install the french drain as part of a system designed to move or dispose of hazardous waste,like the defendants did in selma.see d at.the drainage improvements on the site were designed to move water,not contaminants.
we decline to hold that an otherwise innocent party who builds or installs a conduit or structure for an unrelated purpose which happens to affect the distribution of contamination released by someone else is nonetheless liable for creating or assisting in the creation of a nuisance.such a result defies semantics,the law,and common sense.while liability for nuisance is broad,it is not unlimited.modesto,th at,d.we decline to extend it here.the railroads are not liable for creating a nuisance by virtue of their installation of the french drain.
we must also examine whether the railroads are liable for nuisance as the possessors of the property when the contamination occurred.possessors of land can be liable for a nuisance on that land even when they did not create the nuisance.see leslie salt san francisco bay conservation and dev.comm n,d.noting that,under principles of nuisance,an occupier of land could be liable for fill dumped into a wetland by someone else without the occupier knowledge.in such a situation,liability flows not from the possessor active responsibility for a condition of his land that causes widespread harm but rather,and quite simply,from his very possession and control of the land in question.id.at.see also restatement second of torts cmt.d.california nuisance law conforms to the restatement,see city of los angeles san pedro boat works,cir,and under the restatement,
a possessor of land is subject to liability for a nuisance caused while he is in possession by an abatable artificial condition on the land,if the nuisance is otherwise actionable,and 
a the possessor knows or should know of the condition and the nuisance or unreasonable risk of nuisance involved,and 
b he knows or should know that it exists without the consent of those affected by it,and 
c he has failed after a reasonable opportunity to take reasonable steps to abate the condition or to protect the affected persons against it.
restatement second of torts.
we assume,without deciding,that the soil and groundwater contamination on the property is considered abatable under california law.see capogeannis superior court,th,d holding that soil and groundwater contamination can be considered abatable but see mangini aerojet,cal th,d,noting that abatable means reasonably abatable given considerations of cost and practicality restatement second of torts cmt.f.we focus instead on whether the railroads knew or should have known of the contamination.
no evidence has been adduced that the railroads had actual knowledge of the contamination while they were in possession of the property.whether the railroads should have known about the contamination depends on whether they had a duty to inspect for it and whether it was discoverable by a reasonable inspection.see leslie salt,d at.restatement second of torts cmt.i.the agency does not allege that the contamination should have been apparent to the railroads based on their periodic visual inspections of the property.this is not a case in which,for example,the nuisance was in any way manifest on the surface of the land.leslie salt,d at.holding that landowner certainly should have known of the existence of several hundred tons of detritus and other fill materials on its land.indeed,the contamination was not discovered by any subsequent owner or possessor of the land,including the agency itself,until excavation began at the property some sixteen years after the railroads sold it.
the agency nonetheless implies that the railroads had a duty to inspect the subsurface for contamination,because the property was near the l m site,a potential source of hazardous waste and the railroads were obligated by the agreement to maintain the railroad tracks and drainage.neither of these conditions is sufficient to establish such a duty.as to the first,it is untenable that a possessor of land,simply because his neighbor is a potential polluter,thereby becomes responsible for investigating the subsurface in order to discover and control his neighbor pollution.such a holding shifts too much of the cost of pollution control away from the parties who actually have the ability to affect whether a hazardous substance is released into the environment in the first place,and onto the innocent parties who have the misfortune of being downstream.
the law reasonably imposes a duty on a possessor of land to ensure that activities on that land where the possessor has control do not produce a nuisance.see leslie salt,d at.restatement second of torts.this is not the same as a duty to ensure that activities on adjacent land where the possessor has no control do not produce a nuisance.it is this latter duty that the agency essentially asks us to impose on the railroads,and we decline to do so.the law of nuisance evolved to protect a person from his neighbor activities,not to render him liable for them.see lussier,d at.the basic concept underlying the law of nuisances is articulated in the ancient maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas,that is,so use your own as not to injure another property.
