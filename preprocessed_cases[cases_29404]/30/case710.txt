wildearth guardians wildearth,a environmental organization,petitions for review of the environmental protection agency epa approval of the state of nevada state implementation plan sip for regional haze under the clean air act,caa.according to wildearth,nevada sip is inadequate,and the epa decision to approve it was arbitrary and capricious.wildearth thus contends that the epa should have instead developed its own federal implementation plan fip under the caa.
we conclude that wildearth lacks article iii standing to challenge the epa approval of the sip formulation of reasonable progress goals for improving visibility conditions in the jarbridge wilderness area in northeastern nevada.while wildearth has standing to challenge the epa decision to approve nevada sulfur dioxide best available retrofit technology bart determination for the reid gardner generating station reid gardner in southern nevada,we hold that the epa decision was not arbitrary and capricious.we further conclude that the epa approval of nevada sip did not violate any requirements imposed by l.accordingly,we dismiss the petition for review in part and deny the petition in part.
legal,factual,and procedural background 
this petition for review concerns states duty under the caa to develop plans aimed at improving visibility in mandatory class i federal areas,such as national wilderness areas and certain national parks,and the epa concomitant duty to ensure that such plans are legally adequate.
statutory and regulatory framework 
in,congress enacted section of the caa,which established as a national goal the prevention of any future,and the remedying of any existing,impairment of visibility in mandatory c lass i federal areas which impairment results from manmade air pollution.a.
implementation plans 
under the caa,the epa must establish national ambient air quality standards naaqs for certain air pollutants.the epa must also promulgate regulations designed to prevent the impairment of visibility in mandatory c lass i federal areas,including national wilderness areas and certain national parks.a b,e.to ensure that these standards are met,the caa requires each state to submit a sip to the epa,which must contain such emission limits,schedules of compliance,and other measures as may be necessary to carry out the epa applicable regulations.id.e.
once a state has submitted its sip to the epa,the epa reviews it for compliance with the caa.id.k.if a state fails to submit a sip,or if the epa concludes that a sip is inadequate,then the epa must promulgate a fip within two years.id.c.
regional haze provisions 
as noted above,congress amended the caa in and declare d as a national goal the prevention of any future,and the remedying of any existing,impairment of visibility in mandatory c lass i federal areas which impairment results from manmade air pollution.id.a.to this end,congress required the epa to issue regulations assuring reasonable progress toward meeting the national goal.id.a.
acting under this statutory authority,the epa promulgated the regional haze rule in.regional haze regulations.july.this rule required states to submit regional haze sips to the epa by december.it also requires states to submit sip revisions to the epa by july,and every ten years thereafter.f.
reasonable progress goals 
the regional haze rule directs states to establish reasonable progress goals aimed at achieving natural visibility conditions in class i federal areas.d.these goals must provide for an improvement in visibility for the days in which visibility is most impaired over the period ending on july,worst days,and must also ensure no worsening of visibility during the least impaired days over the course of that period best days.id.
in addition to requiring states to establish reasonable progress goals for improving visibility in class i federal areas,the regional haze rule requires sips to contain emission limitations representing bart for each source that may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility in any mandatory class i federal area.e.as defined in the regulations,bart is an emission limitation based on the degree of reduction achievable through the application of the best system of continuous emission reduction for each pollutant which is emitted by an existing stationary facility.id.
under the regulations,a pollution source is only if it has the potential to emit tons per year or more of any air pollutant.id.states must formulate emission limitations for such sources on a basis,weighing the following five factors the costs of compliance the energy and non air quality environmental impacts of compliance any existing pollution control technology in use at the source the remaining useful life of the source and the degree of improvement in visibility which may reasonably be anticipated to result from the use of such technology.g regional haze regulations and guidelines for bart determinations,july,codified at pt,app.y.
to assist states in evaluating which pollution sources are subject to bart,and what emission limitation to set for such sources,the epa issued the bart guidelines guidelines in.at.the guidelines provide states with a process for making their bart determinations.these five steps subsume the five statutory factors listed above.id.at.first,states identify all available retrofit control technologies.second,states eliminate technically infeasible options.third,states evaluate the effectiveness of the remaining control technologies.fourth,states evaluate the impacts,including the cost of compliance,the energy impacts,any quality impacts,and the remaining useful life of the facility.finally,states evaluate the visibility impacts.id.at.
states must use the guidelines when making bart determinations for fossil power plants with a total generating capacity greater than megawatts,but the guidelines are merely advisory for smaller plants.b b e ii b.the power plant at issue here reid gardner has a generating capacity below megawatts,and so is not subject to the mandatory guidelines.approval and promulgation of air quality implementation plans,june.nonetheless,nevada relied on the guidelines in making its bart determination for reid gardner.
ii.factual and procedural background 
nevada submitted its regional haze sip to the epa in october,nearly two years after the deadline for doing so.in its sip,nevada provides what it considers to be reasonable progress goals for attaining natural visibility conditions at the jarbridge wilderness area in remote northeastern nevada,the state only class i federal area.the sip further requires limitations on emissions of sulfur dioxide,nitrogen oxides nox,and particulate matter for several pollution sources,including reid gardner,a coalfired power plant in southern nevada.
in june,the epa proposed to approve nevada regional haze sip.at.wildearth then submitted public comments to the epa,asserting,inter alia,that nevada bart determination for reid gardner is inadequate nevada ignored certain mandatory factors in setting reasonable progress goals for improving visibility at the jarbridge wilderness area and the epa failed to ensure that approving the sip would not interfere with the attainment or maintenance of the naaqs.
notwithstanding wildearth concerns,the epa approved the majority of nevada regional haze sip on march,approval and promulgation of air quality implementation plans.wildearth then timely filed this petition for review,challenging the epa approval of nevada sip and the agency failure to develop a fip.nevada power company and sierra pacific power company together,nevada power and the nevada division of environmental protection ndep subsequently intervened.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under b.w e may set aside the challenged agency action only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.nrdc epa,cir quoting a.an agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its d
