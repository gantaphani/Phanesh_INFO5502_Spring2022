respondent agricultural commissioner of sonoma county commissioner issued a permit,which we will refer to as an permit,under the county grading,drainage,and vineyard and orchard site development ordinance the ordinance to real parties in interest ronald ohlson and his brother,ernest.the permit allowed them to establish a vineyard on land they own that was being used for grazing.the commissioner determined that issuing the permit was a ministerial act and therefore exempt from the california environmental quality act,public resources code section et sequitur ceqa appellants sierra club and center for biological diversity petitioners challenged the commissioner determination by petitioning for a writ of mandate in the trial court.the trial court agreed with the commissioner and ruled in favor of the ohlsons.
we affirm.although the ordinance may allow the commissioner to exercise discretion when issuing permits in some circumstances,petitioners fail to show that the commissioner improperly determined that issuing the ohlsons permit was ministerial.most of the ordinance provisions that potentially confer discretion did not apply to the ohlsons project,and petitioners fail to show that the few that might apply conferred the ability to mitigate potential environmental impacts to any meaningful degree.
background 
until,grape growers in sonoma county could plant or replant a vineyard as a matter of right without any governmental review or permission.sonoma county ord,iv,subd.b.in,the county enacted the ordinance,which governs grading,drainage improvement,and vineyard and orchard site development within the unincorporated area of the county.ordinance.the ordinance has been amended over the years,most recently in october.sonoma county ord.we will consider and apply the ordinance as amended in,since this was the version in effect when the ohlsons permit was issued.
article of the ordinance requires growers,other than hobbyists,to obtain an permit from the commissioner before establishing or replanting a vineyard.ordinance,subd.a,table.an applicant must submit plans and specifications demonstrating compliance with certain directives and must accept certain ongoing agricultural practices.the ordinance allows growers to prepare and submit plans for sites with a low erosion risk level i sites,but it requires a civil engineer to prepare plans for sites having steeper slopes or a higher erosion risk level ii sites.ordinance,subd.b and table,subds.b,
article of the ordinance sets out the substantive standards for the proper conduct of grading,drainage improvement,and vineyard and orchard site development.ordinance.some of its directives require the grower to comply with a publication of the commissioner,best management practices for agricultural erosion and sediment control,which is not part of the ordinance itself.a typical example of such a directive is section,subdivision a,entitled management of storm water,which states,grading and vineyard and orchard site development shall include the drainage improvements or other methods necessary to manage storm water in compliance with the permit authority best management practices guide.
the ohlsons application was filed in october for a level ii permit.the application sought to convert into a vineyard of acres of rangeland filed with the application were site maps,a drainage report prepared by a certified engineer,and a report.the application indicated that the property included wetland areas and seasonal swales,but no trees or streams.the wetland areas were to be protected by minimum setbacks,as set forth in the report,and circular pipe and vee ditch drains were to be installed to drain acres of the property.erosion was to be controlled through various means,including by using grass avenues rather than roads,straw mulch,filter strips,and cover crops.according to the drainage report,water runoff was not expected to increase and would be directed to the seasonal swales.
inspectors for the commissioner visited the ohlsons property in december.the primary review of the ohlsons application appears to have been by means of a form checklist containing separate items,some with subparts.these items address whether an applicant submitted the required components of the application,as well as substantive matters such as p rotection fencing for waterways sensitive areas,t emporary and permanent erosion control measures,l ocation of storm water management and sediment control measures,and bmp best management practice details specifications.for each item,the reviewer indicated whether the project me t standards or alternatively indicated that the item did not apply to the project.in no instance did the commissioner find the ohlsons application to be out of compliance,although some items were not marked either way.in a subsequent list of comments on the application,the commissioner sought corrections or clarifications to the writings and maps,but it appears no substantive changes were sought a letter from the ohlsons civil engineer confirmed that the requested corrections and clarifications had been made.
the commissioner approved the permit on december,several months later,the commissioner issued a notice declaring that the permit issuance was ministerial and exempt from ceqa review.the notice stated that t he applicant does not seek changes in the ministerial standards set in the ordinance and the best management practices it further stated that the issuance of permits under the ordinance is a ministerial action,except in one situation not applicable here.
the parties agree that ceqa does not require an environmental review for ministerial acts by local agencies,subds.a,b.their dispute centers on whether the commissioner issuance of the ohlsons permit was such a ministerial act.friends of the gualala river and the center for biological diversity challenged the permit by filing a petition for a writ of mandate in the trial court.the sierra club was added as a petitioner in an amended petition following briefing on the merits,the trial court denied the petition in a lengthy written decision.it rejected various procedural arguments raised by the respondents and real parties,but it affirmed the commissioner determination that issuing the permit was ministerial and therefore exempt from ceqa review 
discussion 
in their appeal,petitioners continue to maintain that the ohlsons permit application was subject to an environmental review under ceqa.their primary argument is that issuing the permit must have been a discretionary act because many provisions of the ordinance are broad and vague and therefore allow the commissioner to exercise discretion.we are unpersuaded by this argument because most of the provisions that potentially confer discretion did not apply to the ohlsons project,and petitioners fail to show that the few that did apply conferred on the commissioner the ability to mitigate potential environmental impacts to any meaningful degree.as a result,we must defer to the commissioner determination that issuing the ohlsons permit was a ministerial act.
a.the initial determination of ceqa applicability.
ceqa was enacted to advance four related purposes to inform the government and public about a proposed activity potential environmental impacts identify ways to reduce,or avoid,environmental damage prevent environmental damage by requiring project changes via alternatives or mitigation measures when feasible and disclose to the public the rationale for governmental approval of a project that may significantly impact the environment.california building industry bay area air quality management dist.cal th.
to ensure that environmental considerations inform public agencies decisions,ceqa establishes a process.here,we are concerned with the initial step of the process,which requires the agency to conduct a preliminary review in order to determine whether ceqa applies to a proposed activity.parker shattuck neighbors berkeley city council th,parker shattuck.as part of this review,the agency is to determine whether the activity is a project for purposes of ceqa and,if it is,whether it falls under an exemption.sunset sky ranch pilots county of sacramento cal th.there are two types of exemptions statutory,which are enacted by the legislature and are not subject to exceptions,and categorical,which are adopted in the regulations developed to guide ceqa implementation ceqa guidelines and are subject to exceptions.north coast rivers alliance westlands water dist.th.if the project is in an exempt category for which there is no exception,no further environmental review is necessary.parker shattuck,at.if the project is not exempt,the agency proceeds to the other tiers of the ceqa process,which involve the preparation of an initial study and,if appropriate,an environmental impact report eir.ibid.
b.the ministerial exemption.
ceqa applies only to discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or approved by public agencies,subd.a.the statute correspondingly exempts m inisterial projects,subd.b,a term that has been assumed to refer to projects that are not discretionary ceqa itself does not define either term,but both are defined in the guidelines.under guidelines section,a discretionary act is one that requires the exercise of judgment or deliberation when the public agency or body decides to approve or disapprove a particular activity,as distinguished from situations where the public agency or body merely has to determine whether there has been conformity with applicable statutes,ordinances,or regulations.under guidelines section,a ministerial decision is one involving little or no personal judgment by the public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project.the public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but uses no special discretion or judgment in reaching a decision.a ministerial decision involves only the use of fixed standards or objective measurements,and the public official can not use personal,subjective judgment in deciding whether or how the project should be carried out.if a project approval features both ministerial and discretionary elements,the project is deemed discretionary and subject to ceqa review.guidelines,subd.d.
our state supreme court has explained the legislative rationale behind ceqa exclusion of ministerial actions the statutory distinction between discretionary and purely ministerial projects implicitly recognizes that unless a public agency can shape the project in a way that would respond to concerns raised in an eir,or its functional equivalent,environmental review would be a meaningless exercise.mountain lion foundation fish game com.cal th.as further explained in leach city of san diego d,to properly draw the line between discretionary and ministerial decisions,we must ask why it makes sense to exempt the ministerial ones from the eir requirement.the answer is that for truly ministerial permits an eir is irrelevant.no matter what the eir might reveal about the terrible environmental consequences of going ahead with a given project the government agency would lack the power that is,the discretion to stop or modify it in any relevant way.the agency could not lawfully deny the permit nor condition it in any way which would mitigate the environmental damage in any significant way.id.at see also central basin municipal water dist.water replenishment dist.of southern california th,ceqa does not apply to ministerial actions actions in which the agency is not permitted to shape the process to address environmental concerns.consistent with this understanding,the guidelines recognize that w hether an agency has discretionary or ministerial controls over a project depends on the authority granted by the law providing the controls over the activity.similar projects may be subject to discretionary controls in one city or county and only ministerial controls in another.guidelines,subd.i see friends of davis city of davis th.
the first appellate case to discuss the ministerial exemption was people department of housing community dev.d department of housing,in which the court considered whether a construction permit to develop a mobilehome park,required by the state department of housing and community development under the mobilehome parks act mpa,was ministerial or discretionary id.at.rejecting the department determination that the permit issuance was ministerial,the court held that the approval was neither wholly ministerial nor entirely discretionary and therefore required ceqa review.id.at.the court based its conclusion that the approval was partially discretionary on the mpa building standards,which used imprecise adjectives to define compliance,and on a provision in the act that permitted a conditional permit a third class of standards is relatively broad,relatively general.the applicant for a mobilehome construction permit must submit a description of the water supply,ground drainage and method of sewage disposal.citation.there must be a sufficient supply of artificial lighting.citation.the water supply must be adequate and potable.citation.the site must be and graded.citation.instead of an unqualified construction permit,the enforcement agency may issue a conditional permit which prescribes ongoing conditions on use or occupancy.id.at.as the court explained,w hether the water supply is adequate and potable whether sewage disposal is satisfactory whether the site is and graded whether lighting is sufficient whether features call for use and occupancy restrictions these are relatively personal decisions addressed to the sound judgment and enlightened choice of the administrator.these decisions may have great environmental significance relative to one physical site,negligible significance in another.inevitably they evoke a strong admixture of discretion.ibid.
courts continue to recognize that actions by a local agency are discretionary when they require the exercise of the administrator subjective judgment and are ministerial when they are taken under regulations that allow for little or no exercise of such judgment.as division four of this court summarized,a permit is ministerial if t he fixed approval standards delineate objective criteria or measures which merely require the agency official to apply the local law to the facts as presented in a given application.citation.the approval process is one of determining conformity with applicable ordinances and regulations,and the official has no ability to exercise discretion to mitigate environmental impacts.sierra club napa county board of supervisors th,sierra club.
the commissioner characterizes the holdings in department of housing and similar early cases as outdated and superseded by sierra club and friends of the juana briones house city of palo alto th,juana briones house.according to the commissioner,a regulation is now viewed as granting discretion only if it does not establish an objective rule for decision by the local agency.we are not persuaded.the applicable guidelines have not changed in decades,and we find nothing in sierra club or juana briones house to support the notion that the analysis has been altered for evaluating whether an action was ministerial.in juana briones house,the court cited the traditional standard from guidelines section requiring fixed standards or objective measurements and quoted the observation in department of housing that a permit is ministerial only if the official decision of conformity or nonconformity leaves scant room for the play of personal judgment.juana briones house,at.similarly,sierra club determined a permit issuance is ministerial if t he fixed approval standards delineate objective criteria or measures which merely require the agency official to apply the local law to the facts as presented in a given application.sierra club,supra,th at.this is essentially a restatement of the standard in guidelines section.thus,in our view,department of housing holding remains good law.
an important elaboration of the analysis for evaluating whether an action was ministerial was announced in friends of westwood,city of los angeles d friends of westwood,and it is known as the functional test.juana briones house,supra,th at.in friends of westwood,the court ruled that a city issuance of a building permit to construct a office tower was discretionary.friends of westwood,at.in reaching its ruling,the court adopted a functional distinction between discretionary and ministerial acts,explaining,t he question here is whether the city had the power to deny or condition this building permit or otherwise modify this project in ways which would have mitigated environmental problems an eir might conceivably have identified.if not,the building permit process indeed is ministerial within the meaning of ceqa.if it could,the process is discretionary.it is enough the city possesses discretion to require changes which would mitigate in whole or in part one or more of the environmental consequences an eir might conceivably uncover.id.at,italics omitted.
following friends of westwood,courts recognize that ceqa does not apply to an agency decision simply because the agency may exercise some discretion in approving the project or undertaking.instead,to trigger ceqa compliance,the discretion must be of a certain kind it must provide the agency with the ability and authority to mitigate environmental damage to some degree.san diego navy broadway complex coalition city of san diego th,italics omitted see also juana briones house,supra,th at permit is discretionary if agency has the authority to condition the permit in environmentally significant ways.
standard of review.
our review is de novo in the sense that our review of the administrative record for error is the same as the trial court we review the agency action,not the trial court decision.muzzy ranch solano county airport land use com.cal th,muzzy ranch parker shattuck,supra,th at.
the standard of review applicable to an agency decision under ceqa depends on the nature of the action being reviewed and when in the process it occurred.here,we are reviewing the commissioner determination,made in the initial step of the process,that issuing the ohlsons permit was exempt from ceqa review because the action was ministerial.we generally review an agency determination that an activity falls under the ministerial exemption for a prejudicial abuse of discretion.muzzy ranch,supra,cal th at,quoting save our carmel river monterey peninsula water management dist.th.abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.guidelines section,subdivision a makes clear that t he determination of what is ministerial can most appropriately be made by the particular public agency involved based upon its analysis of its own laws,and each public agency should make such determination either as a part of its implementing regulations or on a basis.see friends of davis city of davis,supra,th at see also sierra club,supra,th at.
to the extent an agency determination that an activity is exempt involves factual determinations,we review those determinations for substantial evidence.see,save our carmel river monterey peninsula water management,supra,th at.and to the extent the agency determination that an activity is exempt involves pure questions of law,we review those questions de novo.juana briones house,supra,th at prentiss city of south pasadena th.
d.the commissioner determination that issuing the permit was ministerial involved no prejudicial abuse of discretion.
with this standard of review in mind,we turn to consider the commissioner determination that issuing the ohlsons permit was a ministerial act.we begin by pointing out that the ordinance itself categorically declares that issuing permits is ministerial,except when an application seeks exceptions from the established standards.ordinance,subd.e.because,as we discuss below,a determination whether issuing a permit is ministerial or discretionary generally must be made on the basis of the project particular circumstances,we are skeptical of such a categorical declaration.but we need not decide here whether the declaration is always binding,whether the issuance of every permit is necessarily ministerial unless an exception is sought because petitioners have not shown that any provisions that arguably grant discretion actually apply to the ohlsons application so as to refute the commissioner determination that issuing the permit was ministerial.
petitioners argue that issuing an permit is always a discretionary act because provisions in the ordinance establish vague,subjective standards that require county personnel to use deliberation and personal judgment to determine whether and how vineyard developments should be carried out.petitioners argue,for example,that a provision governing c uts and fills states that cuts and fills shall be limited to the amount necessary for the intended use,be graded to achieve a consistent grade and natural appearance,and have slope tops rounded to blend with the natural terrain.ordinance,subds.other provisions require storm water to be diverted to the nearest practicable disposal location,a method of soil storage that shall not cause damage to root systems of trees intended to be preserved,and suitable stabilization measures to protect against a loss of topsoil during grading activities.ordinance,subd.d,subds.a,according to petitioners,these and a number of other provisions demand the exercise of discretion because they contain insufficiently precise standards for compliance 
most of the ordinance provisions that potentially confer discretion on the commissioner did not apply to the ohlsons permit.
we need not decide whether most of the provisions cited by petitioners confer discretion on the commissioner because they did not apply to the ohlsons application.the relevant question in evaluating whether the approval of a particular project was discretionary is not whether the regulations granted the local agency some discretion in the abstract,but whether the regulations granted the agency discretion regarding the particular project.in other words,a regulation cited as conferring discretion must have been relevant to the project.
this point was made in prentiss city of south pasadena,supra,th,in which the petitioners challenged a city conclusion that issuing a building permit to alter a historic building was ministerial.id.at.under state law governing historical structures,the building owner could have sought a permit to alter the building in various ways that did not comply with local building codes.the owner made no attempt to take advantage of this provision,however,and submitted plans in full compliance with local ordinances.the petitioners argued that issuing the permit was discretionary because the city could have exercised discretion under state law to permit a departure from those ordinances.prentiss rejected that argument because the city had not exercised any discretion that may have been available to it.as the court explained,t he fact that discretion could conceivably be exercised in projects arising under the state historical building code does not mean that respondents project was discretionary.id.at.
the principle that a provision must have been relevant to the project grows directly out of ceqa focus on individual projects,subd.a ceqa applies to projects.our review is directed not to the regulations themselves but to the agency action in approving the project under those regulations.thus,any regulation cited as granting discretion to the agency must actually have applied to the project under review.if it did not,the agency could not have exercised discretion under that regulation in approving the project.
some of the provisions cited by petitioners were facially inapplicable to the ohlsons application.for example,ordinance section,subdivision regulates the use of fill in a urban area.this provision was obviously inapplicable since the ohlsons property is in a remote agricultural area.similarly,the many regulations cited by petitioners concerning the treatment of watercourses,lakes,and trees were inapplicable because the ohlsons property has no such features 
other provisions cited by petitioners,while facially applicable,involved activities the commissioner expressly excluded in considering the ohlsons application.many of these provisions concerned cuts,fills,and other aspects of grading total volume of cuts,total volume of fills,and acres to be graded were all marked as not applicable in the application,which was approved without material modification in the same vein,best management practice governs roads,but the ohlsons property will have no roads and will instead have avenues.and ordinance section,subdivision b requires an applicant to submit any reports and studies necessary to verify compliance with the standards in article,hydrology study,hydraulic analysis,compaction report,geotechnical or soils report,liquefaction study,wetlands assessment,wetlands delineation,but contrary to petitioners suggestion otherwise,this provision did not give the commissioner discretion either to require reports for conditions that were not present or to excuse reports for conditions that were present.nor have petitioners cited anything in the record that points to any condition on the ohlsons property that triggered an unmet need for some other report.
finally,many of the best management practices petitioners cite applied to ongoing vineyard operations,and there is no evidence in the record to suggest that they played any role in issuing the ohlsons permit.these included directives for growers to avoid planting in areas,to avoid tilling early in the spring or late in the fall,to minimize tillage on erodible slopes,to leave downed trees in the riparian corridor,and to minimize tilling on erodible slopes.none of these topics was included on the commissioner approval checklist 
in short,most of the provisions cited by petitioners as conferring discretion on the commissioner were inapplicable to the ohlsons project and do not refute the commissioner determination that issuing the ohlsons permit was ministerial.we decline petitioners invitation to hold that the issuance of permits is always discretionary,even in cases in which no provision applies,simply because provisions conferring discretion are present in the ordinance.
nothing in the language of the three potentially applicable provisions that arguably confer discretion or in the record indicates that the commissioner was able to mitigate potential environmental impacts to any meaningful degree.
after eliminating inapplicable provisions,only three provisions remain that were potentially material to the ohlsons permit one requiring a setback from wetlands unless a wetlands biologist recommends a different setback ordinance,table,another requiring storm water to be diverted to the nearest practicable disposal location ordinance,subd.d,and a third requiring the applicant to i ncorporate natural drainage features whenever possible best management practice.
petitioners argue that the language of these provisions is general enough to confer discretion.but even assuming we could interpret these provisions to grant some discretion to the commissioner,we reject petitioners argument that this alone requires us to hold that the commissioner issuance of the ohlsons permit was a discretionary act.the argument ignores the principle,arising out of the functional test,that ceqa does not apply to an agency decision simply because the agency may exercise some discretion in approving the project or undertaking.instead,to trigger ceqa compliance,the discretion must be of a certain kind it must provide the agency with the ability and authority to mitigate environmental damage to some degree.san diego navy broadway complex coalition city of san diego,supra,th at,italics omitted.for the reasons discussed above,the existence of discretion is irrelevant if it does not confer the ability to mitigate any potential environmental impacts in a meaningful way.see also johnson state of california cal d,i t would be difficult to conceive of any official act,no matter how directly ministerial,that did not admit of some discretion in the manner of its performance,even if it involved only the driving of a nail.
we recognize that some older decisions treated the mere existence of discretion as conclusive,without expressly discussing its meaningfulness in the context of the particular project approval.in those decisions,however,such a discussion was unnecessary because the scope of the discretion granted was obviously meaningful.in department of housing,for example,the agency had broad discretion with respect to the water supply,drainage,and method of sewage disposal at the site,and it could issue a conditional permit imposing a variety of conditions on use and occupancy.department of housing,supra,d at.there was no question that such broad authority conferred on the agency the power to influence the project environmental impact.similarly,friends of westwood involved the discretionary approval of a building in a crowded urban area friends of westwood,supra,d at,and day city of glendale d day considered the approval of a grading permit to fill canyons with cubic yards of material and movement of cubic yards of material to be cut from a ridge to form a huge notch as part of a highway construction project.id.at.again,there was no question that the discretion involved in approving both of these large projects allowed for environmentally meaningful mitigation.
the contrast between those circumstances and the ohlsons project is dramatic.first,and most importantly,in contrast to the significant discretion granted to the agencies in those cases,the commissioner consideration of the ohlsons application was confined by a series of finely detailed and very specific regulations.the substantive provisions in article of the ordinance run to pages in the administrative record and the best management practices add a further pages,covering a wide range of circumstances and prescribing specific measures to address them.while these provisions may grant some discretion,the scope of any such discretion is drastically narrower than that which was conferred by the broad language of the regulations in department of housing,day,and friends of westwood.in addition,the provisions here are technical.a provision that appears to a lay person to grant discretion to an agency might,as understood by a person with technical knowledge,grant little or none in the context of a particular proposed project.
turning to examine the three specific provisions that potentially conferred discretion on the commissioner,we are mindful of the applicable standard of review,which requires us,as we have mentioned,to review the commissioner determination that issuing the ohlsons permit was a ministerial act for a prejudicial abuse of discretion.muzzy ranch,supra,cal th at,quoting.such an abuse is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.in applying this standard,we must be attentive to the directive of guidelines section,subdivision a,that t he determination of what is ministerial can most appropriately be made by the particular public agency involved based on its analysis of its own laws.sierra club rejected the argument that a county finding that its action was ministerial was not entitled to judicial deference,stating,s urely that is not the law.otherwise,why would the governing regulations acknowledge that the local public agency is the most appropriate entity to determine what is ministerial,based on analysis of its own laws and regulations,and urge that the agency make that determination in its implementing regulations sierra club,supra,th at.
the first provision that potentially conferred discretion requires a setback for wetlands unless a wetlands biologist recommends a different setback.ordinance.petitioners point out that the commissioner relied on this provision in accepting a setback for the ohlsons permit.in a report submitted with the ohlsons application,a wetlands biologist stated that a setback was sufficient because the slopes would be covered with vegetation and because cattle grazing,which had damaged the wetlands,would be eliminated.the provision required the commissioner to allow the setback in the absence of some reason to reject the biologist report.as the trial court put it,a lthough the
