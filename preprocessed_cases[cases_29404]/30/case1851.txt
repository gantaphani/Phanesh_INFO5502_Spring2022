plaintiff michael dipirro dipirro filed a complaint against defendant bondo corporation bondo seeking enforcement of the provisions of the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of the act health,the action was bifurcated,and respondent defense of a statutory exemption from the warning and enforcement provisions of the act,subd.c was first adjudicated before the court,sitting without a jury the court found that bondo product is exempt from the warning requirements of the act,and entered judgment in favor of bondo.bondo subsequent request for attorney fees was denied.
dipirro claims in his appeal that he was denied the right to a jury trial,and the trial court erred by finding that respondent established the warning exemption.bondo appeals seeking reversal of the trial court denial of its motion for attorney fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section.we conclude that dipirro was not entitled to a jury trial on bondo affirmative defense that warnings under the act were not required,and the trial court finding that bondo established the warning exemption is supported by substantial evidence.as to the bondo appeal,we conclude that the denial of its motion for attorney fees was properly based upon a finding that it did not vindicate an important public right or confer a significant benefit on the general public within the meaning of section.we therefore affirm the judgment.
statement of facts and procedural history 
bondo manufactures and sells exclusively to auto makers a product in fluid ounce bottles that is used for painting of motor vehicles the paint contains the industrial solvent toluene,which in was listed in the act as a reproductive developmental toxin,subds.b,c,tit.the designation of toluene as a chemical known to cause reproductive toxicity triggered the mandate of proposition that no person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to the chemical without first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual,except as provided in section.bondo has always been aware that its paint contained the listed chemical toluene.since at least,bondo placed proposition warnings on its material safety data sheets included with wholesale shipments of the paint to automobile manufacturers,but no warnings were placed on the individual paint bottles.
on november,dipirro filed a complaint for injunctive relief and civil penalties against bondo that alleged violation of the act through the manufacture and distribution of paints containing toluene without the required clear and reasonable warnings of reproductive toxicity dipirro requested relief in the nature of an injunction to prohibit bondo from selling or distributing the paints without the required warnings,civil penalties,and restitution,along with attorney fees.
bondo answered the complaint with a general denial and numerous affirmative defenses,including the seventh affirmative defense which alleged that any exposure to toluene that occurs as a result of reasonably anticipated use of its paint products poses no significant risk of causing cancer or reproductive toxicity to users of those products,within the meaning of health and safety code c.subdivision c of section grants a warning exemption for products with listed chemicals if the defendant proves an exposure level times less than the maximum specified dose level at which a chemical has no observable reproductive effect,tit,subd.c 
the parties stipulated to bifurcation of the proceedings,with the trial of issues relating to bondo seventh affirmative may be be tried first.thereafter,upon motion by bondo the trial court struck dipirro demand for a jury trial.
the trial then proceeded before the court primarily on the basis of the declarations and testimony of experts the undisputed evidence established that for inhaled toluene the exposure level of the warning exemption of section,subdivision c,is set at micrograms per day.the focus of the trial was upon studies,tests and surveys concerning the nature and level of exposure to toluene by persons using bondo paints.
evidence was presented on the essential nature and effects of toluene.toluene is an aromatic hydrocarbon often used as a solvent that is found in gasoline,paint products,cosmetics,adhesives,and inks.toluene promotes the flow and coating of pigments onto a surface,then evaporates and dries quickly,even at cold temperatures and high humidity.exposure occurs as the result of airborne inhalation of the chemical through the blood stream.the primary toxic effect of toluene is neurotoxicity.at very high concentration levels toluene may have a narcotic impact upon the central nervous system to produce giddy behavior.at lower doses,toluene has an effect on reproductive developmental processes in the body.according to studies on animals,gestational exposure to the chemical at particular stages of development of a fetus may cause identified anomalies intrauterine growth retardation,premature delivery,low birth weight,retarded skeletal development,kidney abnormalities,congenital gastrointestinal,urogenital,central nervous system,and cardiac malformations,along with postnatal interruptions in neurobehavioral development the evidence of developmental toxicity of toluene in humans is limited,but strongly indicates adverse effects upon fetus development resulting from toluene abuse by pregnant women.the evidence does not indicate maternal toxicity of toluene in humans.
by,the california department of health services decided to list toluene as a reproductive developmental toxicant under proposition.in toluene was placed on the safe harbor list of chemicals known to cause reproductive developmental toxicity.a safe harbor or maximum allowable dose level,the madl,of micrograms per which the warning requirements of proposition are not established for toluene by multiplying the figure of micrograms per day of ingested toluene by nearly twice,to account for the percent rate of absorption of an inhaled chemical,subd.c,tit,subds.a,b,c.the madl is the level at which no observable reproductive developmental effects will occur upon exposure to the chemical at a level times higher,tit,subds.b,c.
the remaining evidence offered at trial dealt with the tested levels of exposure to toluene that result from use of bondo paint.the formula for calculating or quantifying exposure is rather simple and straightforward.as the experts agreed,the implementating regulations specify that for purposes of section,subdivision c,the level of exposure to a listed chemical that causes reproductive developmental toxicity must be determined by multiplying the measured concentration level of the chemical in the this case,the amount of toluene in a unit of the inhalation rate,times the duration of exposure,tit,subd.b.the regulations specify that for toluene the inhalation rate is cubic meters per day,or cubic meters per hour,for a woman with conceptus.
the calculation becomes more complex,however,when measuring the inhalation of a chemical like toluene during use of a consumer product like bondo paint.the level of toluene in the breathing zone around the head must be measured,along with the amount that is then exhaled.the rate of breathing and level of intake per unit of time must be taken into account.both the immediate,more acute exposure and the cumulative exposure over time must be measured.the rate of dilution and dispersal of the chemical into the air must be instance,toluene evaporates into the air very rapidly,within minutes.any testing must also consider the manner in which the product is used,including the directions for use that accompany the product.all the potential sources of toluene from the paint must be measured the gas diffusing out of the bottle the amount emanating from the area on which the paint is being applied the exposure from any other areas that have been just painted and the paint on the wand or brush.thus,a very detailed protocol must be established in testing to account for these factors.
only scientifically approved methods and procedures may be followed to quantify an exposure under the act.a hierarchy of accepted methodologies has been established by the california department of health services cdhs.the parties agreed that the appropriate sampling protocol for assessing toluene concentration in the air is niosh,the method established by the cdhs for toluene exposure testing.the parties experts both reviewed existing studies and performed numerous tests under various conditions to measure exposure to toluene from use of bondo paints in accordance with the niosh protocol.the results of the surveys and testing present evidence that is conflicting,but fall within certain defined parameters.
bondo expert in the field of toxicology,human health risk and exposure assessment,michael lakin,compiled and reviewed surveys of the reasonably anticipated use of automotive paints to determine exposure conditions.lakin concluded,based upon his review of the studies and expert depositions provided to him,that the great majority of consumers use paint sparingly for only a few small nicks or scratches,outside or in an open garage,complete the painting process within a minute,then immediately reseal the container and move away from the vehicle once painting is completed.
tom shellworth,the owner of an automobile dealership in vacaville for the past years who had often personally used paint and observed countless applications of paint by dealership personnel and outside vendors,in addition to inspecting thousands of repairs performed upon vehicles by consumers,essentially agreed with lakin characterization of the customary nature of the use of paint.shellworth offered his opinion that the vast majority of consumers do not ever use paint,or if they do,make limited use the paint for one or two chips for about seconds.shellworth also stated that due to the variation in use of paint,description of the average or typical extent of repair was difficult.in his testimony shellworth did not refer to the conditions under which paint is applied,other than to very generally assert that it was used both inside and outside.
in an attempt to describe the use of paint by consumers bondo presented the results of a survey distributed by its counsel to car dealerships in to as the nossaman survey.the survey enlisted assistance from car dealerships in the form of responses to inquiries about the average or typical use of paint.a cover letter that accompanied the survey advised the dealerships of bondo defense of a proposition lawsuit filed by a bounty hunter,dipirro,and the intended meritless lawsuits against dealerships and others in the industry.the letter also mentioned the specific need to prove that paint does not expose the average consumer to levels of toluene and other chemicals that exceed micrograms per day.a summary of the responses,more than in number,indicate that the paint is typically applied in one or two coats of paint to a few small chips or scratches of less than an inch in length by a service person at the dealership,usually outside or less often in the service bay,for between five seconds and a minute.most consumers who purchase paint never use it,and if they do the quality of the work is poor.the dealerships also noted in their responses that a small number of consumers used the paint inappropriately for larger scratches or chips.
dipirro expert criticized the partiality of the nossaman survey,suggesting that it was obviously conducted and structured as a response to an adversarial situation.he asserted that the results of the nossaman survey were skewed by the improper target population of car dealerships rather than the average consumer,and the nature of the questions 
dipirro also conducted an consumer survey of paint use,referred to as the survey.three hundred responses to questions were received,which were compiled into a summary of the nature of use of paint by average consumers about percent used the paint once a year or less percent used the paint only on one vehicle only percent of the use occurs in a covered carport or in a garage less than half of the people used the paint on scratches nearly half of the people who painted a scratch on their car from a key had a scratch one foot long or more percent applied the paint to three or fewer scratches percent painted three or fewer nicks percent used less than of the bottle typically the paint was applied by dipping the wand into the bottle one to two times per application percent expressed no health concerns associated with use of the paint 
bondo offered evidence of practical field tests of toluene exposure from james embree,the principal toxicologist for the environmental sciences and engineering consulting firm geomatrix consultants,and an expert in the field of proposition methods for determining exposures to listed chemicals.in,embree designed,supervised and reviewed a series of three paint application tests,referred to collectively as the geomatrix paint application study geomatrix study,to measure the exposure to toluene of an average consumer of bondo touch up paint under conservative and varied real world conditions.the tests followed some accepted assumptions,protocols and methodologies related to toluene exposure from paint,including the niosh method of analysis,and were implemented with a series of measurements based on conservative factors of application.the paint used was one with approximately percent toluene,which is toward the upper limit of toluene routinely used in bondo paint.
three tests in the geomatrix study measured exposure in varying environments under different conditions.the first test in a open garage,with four painted surfaces attached to the sides of a car,each about inch square,and each painted for three and minutes,followed by the painter remaining within several feet of the car for another minutes,for a total of minutes of exposure.the second test comparable to the first,but conducted in a garage,and with the addition of two more scenarios with the garage door closed one with painting of a ding approximately to inch in diameter and scratches,and the other to a square inch area.the third test conducted in a open garage,with the application of paint to one scratch and three dings as indicated in the results of dipirro survey of the reasonably anticipated rate of exposure for the average users of the product,with the added assumptions of application of two coats over an period,seven minutes for each coat of the paint to dry while the painter remained in the area of the car,for a total period of exposure.in each of the three of the studies,one collection tube was placed in the painter breathing zone as the niosh method requires,and a second or back tube collected samples from ambient air that may have gone through the first tube.due to the greater area painted and the longer duration of painting,embree opined that measured concentrations were far higher than any reasonably anticipated use by the average consumer,so the conditions of testing assured results in excess of any likely consumer exposure.however,the air flow rates were twice that specified in the niosh manual.
all the samples collected during the three tests were sent to an approved laboratory for detection of the concentration of toluene in accordance with the niosh method.no evidence of or breakthrough of chemicals from the first breathing tubes was found in the second sampling tubes.exposure levels were then calculated from the measured concentration results of the tests according to the proposition specified formula for toluene multiplication of the concentrations,times the specified inhalation rate,times the conservative period of exposure.even without adjustment for averaging over a gestation period,all three of the tests conducted for the geomatrix study indicated exposure levels substantially to percent madl for toluene of micrograms per day averaging the exposure over a gestation period resulted in calculated levels between and percent of the madl,or to times less than the madl.
the geomatrix study was repeated in,with slight variations in the conditions of application of paint to account for objections to the study.three additional tests were done one with the vehicle in a garage with the door closed,another with the garage door open,and a third with the vehicle in the driveway just outside an open garage.the painted test panels were confined to one side the car,and ranged in size from to dings to a by scratch.two coats of paint were applied,with a interval between coats and a waiting time following the conclusion of painting,for a total exposure duration of minutes.the air temperature was lower than the test,which resulted in theoretically slower evaporation,but the humidity was slightly higher.a new paint container was used for each test,and the weight of the paint used during each test was calculated,unlike the prior study.air flow rates were half that used in the geomatrix study,liters per minute as approved in the niosh manual.again,the tested exposure levels of toluene in all three tests were far below the madl,and even slightly lower than in the geomatrix study.
lakin performed his own ensight study for bondo to quantify exposure to toluene from paint.in doing so,he consulted the measured data and analytical methods from the nail polish study conducted by clayton engineering for the attorney general office using protocols developed by the cdhs.he considered the nail polish study acceptable for this purpose due to the great similarity in use and composition of nail polish and paint.a distinction in the nail polish study is that the method protocol was used,which is similar to the niosh protocol,with the only modification being the use of a badge with charcoal on it to absorb the air rather than drawing the air through a tube.lakin testified that the two methods are equally efficient at detecting exposure,and dipirro expert agreed that the two methods are equivalent.
in the nail polish study the exposure to toluene by both the manicurist and customer were measured from over samples collected under varied conditions,with the customer monitored only for the duration of the one the manicurist was monitored for the entire workday.the average concentration of toluene in the samples was then multiplied by the amount of air breathed by the person during the time present in the salon.even upon application of a more conservative inhalation rate that is,a higher rate than the actual without adjusting for exposure over the gestation period,the exposure results of the nail polish study were below the madl figure micrograms per visit for the customer,and micrograms per work day for the technician.
lakin asserted that the nail polish studies were conducted in compliance with testing methods and protocols that have the requisite wide acceptance of reliability within the scientific community.he also found that the data from the nail polish study provided a representative and conservative basis for the evaluation of the reasonably anticipated consumer exposure to toluene in the present case.he noted that some environmental factors associated with the application of nail,use of the product indoors,with fewer air exchanges,and at lower temperatures and humidity in more conservative,higher exposure levels than the conditions which accompany use of paint 
lakin also gathered information from other studies on the range of exposures to paint.finally,he reviewed the geomatrix study of embree,which he found to be consistent with standard guidance,procedures and methodologies recognized and accepted by experts in the field,and in compliance with b.according to lakin the results of the geomatrix study,which he reiterated are entirely consistent with the findings of the nail polish study,provide a sound technical basis for evaluation of exposure to toluene.
using the extremely conservative values from the nail polish study that are more health protective,along with the geomatrix study results and other data from scientifically accepted practices,some of it provided by dipirro,lakin calculated an exposure concentration of toluene in the ensight study that encompassed all but a very small proportion of the users of paint.his calculation of exposure included consumers of paint who used the paint indoors,in an area with a very high background level of toluene,applied two or three coats of paint to the equivalent of nicks and scratches,for a total of about minutes.he used the inhalation rate established in the proposition regulations,and the concentration level measured in the nail polish study that he believed was overly conservative when compared to the application of paint.the result was an exposure concentration level higher than any reasonably foreseeable circumstances for the average consumer.
lakin thereby arrived at a bounding estimate or bounding study,which is an approach of risk assessment used to determine the exaggerated upper end or extreme estimate of the population that is above what most of the population would actually receive,and constitutes a very rare event.he found that the reasonably anticipated exposure to toluene of the average user of paint is no more than micrograms per day,unadjusted for exposure over the gestation period,and only micrograms per day when divided by the gestation period.both figures are well below the madl.he added that even dipirro own testing results obtained during a exposure test show exposure of micrograms per day,or less than percent of the madl,without adjustment for the gestation period.
dipirro relied heavily on declarations and testimony from david brown,a public health toxicologist who is a qualified expert on human exposures to toxic chemicals from a variety of sources.brown offered the opinion that it is inappropriate to use the nine months of gestation as the basis for averaging to derive a pregnant woman reasonably anticipated rate of exposure.he stated that according to current studies toluene produces teratogenesis,but not as a frank teratogen,rather as a neurodevelopmental toxin.toluene produces impacts upon the sensitive developmental processes of the fetus during exposures that may not be repaired or overcome during subsequent stages of development.thus,he maintained that there is sufficient human and animal evidence in the literature to support that birth defects occur with exposures,and even in one hour worth of exposure it is possible that damage could be elicited from which the organism can not recover.
brown expressed concern with the methodologies used in the geomatrix studies.his primary criticisms were the lack of control or knowledge of the air exchange rates during exposure,and the failure to explain protocols in detail.he particularly disapproved of the use of the air flow rate in the geomatrix study,twice that required by the niosh methodology.brown did not find any information in the scientific literature to suggest that a flow rate of liters per minute is an appropriate or acceptable method to assess inhalation of toluene.he testified that the higher flow rate causes the sample to become overloaded and blow by,thereby reducing the amount of chemical absorbed in the sampling tube,and resulting in underestimation of the exposure in the breathing zone.he added that the geomatrix study did not account for the greater air flow rate by properly placing a second tube at the end of the first tube to measure with sensitivity any amounts of toluene that bypassed the first chamber.brown acknowledged that a second sampling tube was used in the geomatrix study,but he could not easily figure out exactly from his review of the study how the tests were configured to report the amount collected in the second tube.
brown further expressed dissatisfaction with some aspects of embree methodology the use of the same person to do all the painting throughout the process,the location of the painted devices attached all around the car,the insufficient sampling number,the brief departure of one of the technicians during sampling,the dilution of peak values of exposure by sampling over a set time period,the failure to take into account the elevated breathing quarter to a half higher than the default pregnant women,the use of a figure of percent volume of toluene rather than percent,and the failure of the geomatrix investigators to chemically measure the amount of toluene in the paint bottles or the amount of paint used for each test.he opined that the geomatrix study did not comply with accepted scientific methodology,and therefore failed to accurately characterize a consumer exposure to toluene when using paint under reasonably foreseeable conditions.
brown also disapproved of any reliance by lakin upon the results of the nail polish study for assessing a consumer exposure to toluene using automotive paint.he stated that the nail polish study did not follow the niosh protocol in its entirety,specifically in the use of a passive badge to collect the chemical rather than an active sampling method such as a pump to draw air into the sampling tube.he noted several other factors that he believed undermined the credibility and appropriateness of using the nail polish study to infer exposures similar to those experienced by a consumer applying paint in a garage the absence of testing for potentially interfering compounds likely to be in the air in a nail salon the lack of equivalent air exchange rates in a nail salon and a garage the differences in environmental factors between a nail salon and a garage or driveway and potential hydrocarbon interferences in a salon that differ from those encountered in a residential garage.
brown devised his own exposure study that was conducted by air quality sciences,an independent testing laboratory.brown evaluation used two environmental test chambers that he claimed met the requirements of section of the regulations a large chamber study and a small chamber study.
the large chamber study was designed by brown to measure exposure based upon realistic parameters of application three coats of paint used in a small than the size of a a plexiglas test fixture divided into a square and further divided into four equal quarters painting of the equivalent of several small scratches,with allotted time of five minutes to wait for the paint to dry between coats at a distance of to inches while the bottle was closed a total exposure time of minutes.the environmental test chamber controlled the variables of exchange rates,background contaminants,humidity and temperature.the chemical content of each bottle of paint was determined,and the weight of the bottle was measured and tested for toluene content before and after each application.the air flow rate was liters per minute,as approved in the niosh method.samples of toluene exposure were collected from multiple charcoal sampling tubes draped around the mouth,nose,and chest of the painter.brown asserted the results provided a lower bound estimate of real exposure,of approximately micrograms per day,or about of the madl.
the small chamber study collected air in essentially the same manner,but in a chamber the size of a breadbox at the application site around the painter head to fully assess and quantify the magnitude of concentration of toluene during spikes of peak exposure while painting.the small chamber study was designed to simulate exposure immediately around the painter head while working in very close proximity to the brush or wand,without dissipation of the chemical into the air,at discrete time intervals while using the product.a key scratch was painted,which was an average size based upon the results of the survey performed for dipirro.brown agreed that the small chamber study was realistic,but instead was a method of getting another piece of information on the values in the breathing zone during sporadic or episodic exposures.from the results of the small chamber study,he concluded that exposure levels of toluene would exceed the madl.
the results brown obtained in the small chamber study,along with his extrapolations from the geomatrix study,indicated to brown that within the range of measurable exposures is the possibility a person could be exposed to levels that exceed the california madl at various levels of use.he submitted two conclusions as to the exposure to toluene from paint first,that toluene may produce neurological damage from episodic exposures rather than chronic dosing over time and second,that a consumer,at various levels of use,will be exposed to levels of toluene that exceed the madl.
lakin testified for bondo that many of brown extrapolations and assumptions were flawed.primarily,lakin challenged the assumption that peak exposure at some point in time is an appropriate measure for an assessment of the madl of toluene.he testified that under proposition the total exposure per day over the amount of time the exposure may occur is the correct measurement,not parsing it out.lakin explained that the noel and madl figures for toluene are set according to animal studies of effects from ingestion that are related to daily intake,not momentary peak exposure.further,he asserted that the sampling by brown at discrete,isolated distances from the source that have changing concentrations at different points in time is not a reliable test of real exposure.
the trial court accepted the testimony and test results of bondo experts.in determining the exposure of an average consumer,the court accepted a model that included to percent of the users of paint.no single test presented by the parties experts was found determinative,but the court relied upon the tests to determine bounding estimates to find an exposure level below which average consumers will not be at risk.based primarily on the results of the and geomatrix studies,the court found that bondo met its burden of proof establishing that the exposure to average users of automotive paint as used in a reasonably foreseeable manner poses no significant risk as the exposure level falls below the madl of micrograms per day.these appeals followed.
discussion 
i.the denial of dipirro request for a jury trial.
dipirro challenges the trial court order that granted bondo motion to strike the demand for a jury trial.after bondo seventh affirmative defense was ordered to be tried first,bondo moved to strike dipirro request for a jury trial of the phase issues.dipirro opposed the motion,based upon the argument that the phase narrow factual question of whether plaintiff can show a detectable exposure to toluene and,if so,whether the exposure is low enough to exempt bondo from providing a warning,was not equitable in nature,and therefore must be considered by a jury.the court found that the gist of dipirro action is equitable,and therefore no right to a jury trial existed.dipirro complains that the phase issue of the section,subdivision c,warning exemption was never available in courts of equity,did not turn on the exercise of equitable principles,and was not committed to the trial court discretion.he therefore argues that he was entitled to a jury trial to resolve this purely legal issue.
a.the waiver of the right to a jury trial.
we first confront bondo contention that dipirro waived his right to a jury trial of the phase issues related to the warning exemption.bondo maintains that a jury trial waiver is found in dipirro opposition to the motion to strike the request for a jury trial,in which he concedes that any penalty that may be imposed and any injunctive relief ordered shall be determined by a court,not a jury.bondo position is that dipirro thereby acknowledged he was entitled to a jury trial of phase issues,and waived any right to appeal the trial court determination.bondo also contends that dipirro waived his right to assert error on appeal by failing to appear at the hearing to contest the court tentative ruling on bondo motion to strike.
the california constitution guarantees the right to a jury trial in a civil action at law.salisbury county of orange th,d.pursuant to article i,section of the california constitution,trial by jury is an inviolate right,a basic and fundamental part of our system of jurisprudence as such,it should be zealously guarded by the courts in case of doubt therefore,the issue should be resolved in favor of preserving a litigant right to trial by jury.citations.cohill nationwide auto service th,d see also superior court th,d.in light of the importance of the jury trial in our system of jurisprudence,any waiver thereof should appear in clear and unmistakable form.where it is doubtful whether a party has waived his or her constitutionally protected right to a jury trial,the question should be resolved in favor of preserving that right.badie bank of america th,d see also conservatorship of kevin th,d.
our california constitution,article i,section mandates in part that trial by jury is an inviolate right and shall be secured to all in a civil cause a jury may be waived by the consent of the parties expressed as prescribed by statute.code of civil procedure section,subdivisions a and d provide in part in civil cases,a jury may only be waived pursuant to subdivision d.d a party waives trial by jury in any of the following ways by failing to appear at the trial.by written consent filed with the clerk or judge.by oral consent,in open court,entered in the minutes.by failing to announce that a jury is required,at the time the cause is first set for trial,if it is set upon notice or stipulation,or within five days after notice of setting if it is set without notice or stipulation.by failing to deposit with the clerk,or judge,advance jury fees as provided in subdivision b.by failing to deposit with the clerk or judge,at the beginning of the second and each succeeding day session,the sum provided in subdivision c.
thus,as a matter of constitutional right dipirro was entitled to a jury unless he waived such right in the manner prescribed by law citation the manner prescribed by law specifically refers to the provisions for jury waiver in civil cases.they constitute the exclusive modes of waiver in civil cases.it has long been held in this state that a jury trial may not be waived by implication it may only be waived affirmatively and in the manner designated by the provisions of section,code of civil procedure.city of redondo beach kumnick d.and n o waiver results from going to trial after the erroneous denial of a jury,if the party makes a proper objection.citation.cohill nationwide auto service,supra,th,d.
we would be hard pressed under any circumstances to find an express waiver of a jury trial right in dipirro opposition to a request to strike his demand for jury trial.as we read dipirro concession,it related only to the contingent issues of any penalty that may be imposed or any injunctive relief ordered by the trial court following the phase trial.dipirro acknowledged that penalty and injunctive relief matters were equitable in nature,but argued that the trial of bondo liability under the act must be considered by a jury.we do not find that dipirro limited concession was a waiver of a jury trial of the phase part of the proceeding.the acknowledgement of the equitable nature of the penalty and injunctive relief issues expressed by dipirro in his opposition to bondo request to strike a jury trial was not a written consent filed with the clerk or judge of a jury trial waiver within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,subdivision d.no waiver of dipirro right to a jury trial occurred.
nor do we find that dipirro forfeited the right to challenge the ruling on the jury trial issue by failing to appear at the hearing on the motion to contest the trial court tentative decision a reviewing court ordinarily will not consider a challenge to a ruling if an objection could have been but was not made in the trial court.citation.the purpose of this rule is to encourage parties to bring errors to the attention of the trial court,so that they may be corrected.citation.the critical point for preservation of claims on appeal is that the asserted error must have been brought to the attention of the trial court.boyle certainteed th,d see also in re,supra,cal th,d.it is unfair to the trial judge and to the adverse party to take advantage of an alleged error on appeal where it could easily have been corrected at trial.citations.citation.cabrini villas homeowners haghverdian th,d.in a written opposition to bondo motion dipirro presented his objections to any denial of his right to a jury trial.based upon dipirro opposition,both bondo and the trial court were aware of the precise grounds for his challenge to the proposed ruling.after the tentative decision was issued,a repetition of the same opposition at the hearing on the motion was not required to preserve the issue on appeal.no forfeiture of the issue resulted.dipirro neither waived the right to a jury trial nor forfeited the right to assert error in this appeal.
dipirro right to a jury trial of the exposure exemption issues.
we turn to dipirro claim of entitlement to a jury trial of bondo warning exemption defense found in section,subdivision c.the act does not grant any statutory right to a jury trial in enforcement actions,so dipirro must rely on the right to jury trial provided by article i,section of the california constitution.code of civil procedure section also specifically provides that in actions for the recovery of specific,real,or personal property,with or without damages,or for money claimed as due upon contract,or as damages for breach of contract,or for injuries,an issue of fact must be tried by a jury,unless a jury trial is waived

we begin our analysis with the obvious point that a statutory enforcement action under the act is not one that existed under common law in.that,of course,is not the end of the inquiry.t he right to a jury trial does not entirely depend upon the existence of a particular right of action in.citation.rather,it exists when a current case is of the same class or nature as one which existed in.jefferson county of kern th,d see also asare hartford fire ins.th,d.t he fact that the particular statute or offense was not in existence when the constitution was adopted is not determinative if the same type or class of action called for a jury trial,the right is carried over to the new statute.people anderson d.a statute that was enacted since the adoption of the constitution is not for that reason outside the scope of the guaranty of trial by jury.the constitutional right of trial by jury is not to be narrowly construed.it is not limited strictly to those cases in which it existed before the adoption of the constitution but is extended to cases of like nature as may afterwards arise.it embraces cases of the same class thereafter arising the introduction of a new subject into a class renders it amenable to its general rules,not to its exceptions.citation.jefferson county of kern,supra,at,d,italics omitted.the right to trial by jury is not inapplicable to causes of action based on statutes,but applies to actions enforcing statutory rights if the statute creates legal rights and remedies,enforceable in an action for damages in the ordinary courts of law.curtis loether,d.where,as here,we are deciding if a jury trial is required and have been presented with a statutory scheme that was not known at common law in,as with any other action we look to essence of the rights conferred and the relief sought the gist of the action.if the gist is legal,as opposed to equitable,we have recognized a right to jury trial.citations.citation.asare hartford fire ins,supra,at,d.we thus first compare the statutory action to actions brought in the courts of england prior to the merger of the courts of law and equity,and then examine the remedy sought and determine whether it is legal or equitable in nature.granfinanciera,nordberg,d,quoting tull united states,d.
we thus proceed to examine the statutory scheme to determine the gist of the action pursued by dipirro.while an action under the act does not directly implicate specific,recognized equitable doctrines,the statutory scheme embodied in the act is itself thoroughly infused with equitable principles that must be considered and adjudicated in an enforcement action.the essential character and purpose of the act is equitable.proposition is a remedial statute intended to protect the public,which seeks to prevent contamination of sources of drinking water and requires businesses to warn individuals about carcinogens and reproductive toxins to which they are exposed through consumer transactions,employment,and the environment.consumer cause,smilecare th,d.
the foremost consideration before us is that the remedies sought through an enforcement action under the act are equitable in nature.determining whether the gist of a claim is in law or equity depends in large measure upon the mode of relief to be afforded.citation.asare hartford fire ins,supra,th,d see also martin county of los angeles th,d.an action that seeks to enforce the consequences of the listing of a chemical fundamentally seeks a form of declaratory the product requires a warning under the is equitable in nature and does not carry with it the guarantees of a jury trial.see andal city of stockton th,d caira offner,supra,th,d nwosu uba th,d baxter healthcare denton,supra,th,d.
as the act specifically authorizes in section,dipirro requested in his complaint both injunctive relief to prevent the sale of bondo product and civil penalties against bondo injunctive relief is invariably an equitable remedy,and a demand for civil penalties does not in itself require a jury trial.see kwan of north america,th,d.the fact that damages is one of a full range of possible remedies does not guarantee the right to a jury citation.caira offner,supra,th,d see also baugh garl,supra,th,d.we recognize the general rule that monetary relief is a legal remedy,and an award of statutory damages may serve purposes traditionally associated with legal relief,such as compensation and punishment.feltner columbia pictures television,d.however,a n action is one in equity where the only manner in which the legal remedy of damages is available is by application of equitable principles.citation.interactive multimedia artists,superior court th,d see also asare hartford fire ins,supra,th,d van de kamp bank of america,supra,d.damages sought in the nature of civil penalties for violations of the act are assessed upon consideration of articulated factors that do not primarily take into account any harm suffered by the plaintiff,subd.b.where,as here,the statute has delegated the assessment of civil penalties in accordance with a highly discretionary calculation that takes into account multiple factors,this is the kind of calculation traditionally performed by judges rather than a jury,and does not require a jury trial for that purpose in a civil action.see tull united states,supra,d.
the act is informational and preventative rather than compensatory in its nature and function.the statutory damages available under the act in the nature of civil penalties do not grow out of a claim for moneys due and owing or for personal harm or property damages that have resulted from discharge of pollutants or other toxic chemicals,which are actions triable by a jury at common law,tull united states,supra,d tull wisden superior court,supra,th,d grossblatt wright d.rather,proposition is distinguishable in its fundamentally equitable purpose and remedy to facilitate the notification of the public of potentially harmful substances,so informed decisions may be made by consumers on the basis of disclosure.citizens bringing proposition suits need not plead a private injury and instead are deemed to sue in the public interest.citation.national paint coatings state of california th,d.an award of civil penalties under the act is a statutory punitive exaction determined on the basis of equitable principles,designed to deter misconduct and harm,not to compensate the plaintiff for actual damages sustained see korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d,shamsian atlantic richfield th,d day v.a t t th,d kwan of north america,supra,th,d troensegaard silvercrest industries,d.the primary right to bring an action for civil penalties pursuant to the act is also given to the state rather than individuals seeking compensation,subd.c.moreover,the act does not have a standing requirement a plaintiff need not allege or prove damages to maintain an action under proposition.as such,the statutory remedies afforded by the act,including civil penalties,are not damages at law,but instead constitute equitable relief appropriate and incidental to enforcement of the act,which do not entitle the plaintiff to a jury trial.see mchugh santa monica rent control bd.cal d,beasley wells fargo bank d,d.the incidental award of monetary damages by a court in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction does not convert the proceeding into a legal action.snelson ondulando highlands d.
finally,even without consideration of the specific remedies provided in section,we conclude that the gist of dipirro statutory enforcement action given recognition and implementation in the act is to enjoin or prevent the knowing distribution,sale and use of products with listed dangerous chemicals,unless the requisite warnings are provided.see dowhal smithkline beecham consumer healthcare cal th,d,baxter healthcare denton,supra,th,d.although dipirro could not have pursued this particular statutory action under the act in,the bulk of the relief sought here was cognizable at common law as an equitable action to abate a public nuisance.see arciero ranches meza th,d wolford thomas d.the essence of an action to abate a public nuisance and for injunctive relief is equitable and there is no right to a jury trial.people englebrecht th,d see also people ex rel.gallo acuna cal th,d,county of santa clara atlantic richfield th,d people pacific landmark,llc th,d.dipirro is not entitled to a jury trial on his enforcement action in equity under section.stell jay hales development th,d see van de kamp bank of america,supra,d.wolford thomas,supra,at.

ii.the trial court finding of a warning exemption under section.
we proceed to dipirro challenge to the trial court finding that bondo established the warning exemption of section,subdivision c.dipirro argues that the trial court did not follow the proper standards in undertaking the assessment of the warning exemption evidence.he has two essential complaints with the trial court evaluation of the warning exemption evidence.first,he insists that a defendant seeking to prove the warning exemption under the act must show that no consumer using the product in a reasonably foreseeable manner will be exposed to levels of toxins above the madl.italics added.the issue was in dispute at trial,and the court settled upon a model that captures the to percentile of the population rather than the level.second,dipirro maintains that the madl must be calculated on a per day basis,not averaged over a gestational period.he recognizes that the trial court did not reach this issue,but asks us to resolve it as well to apprise the trial court on remand of the rule that the madl is just what it says a daily limit.
as a necessary prelude to our review of the trial court finding on the warning exemption defense,we provide a recitation of some of the pertinent provisions of proposition.section,subdivision a,requires the governor of the state of california to cause to be published a list of those chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity within the meaning of this chapter,and he shall cause such list to be revised and republished in light of additional knowledge at least once per year thereafter.the list of known carcinogens and teratogens must be published and updated annually.mateel environmental justice foundation edmund gray th,d.section,subdivision b,states that a chemical is known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity within the meaning of this chapter if in the opinion of the state qualified experts it has been clearly shown through scientifically valid testing according to generally accepted principles to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity,or if a body considered to be authoritative by such experts has formally identified it as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity,or if an agency of the state or federal government has formally required it to be labeled or identified as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity.the list of chemicals known to the state to cause reproductive developmental toxicity is found at section in title of the california code of regulations,and as the parties agree,it contains toluene.
once a chemical such as toluene is listed as a reproductive toxin,section prohibits the knowing and intentional exposure of any person to a chemical without first providing a warning,except as provided in section.consumer cause,weider nutrition,supra,th,d see also dipirro american isuzu motors,th,d.s ection places the duty to give a clear and reasonable warning upon any person who in the course of doing business knowingly and intentionally exposes another person to a chemical determined by the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.environmental law foundation wykle research,th,d.
however,the act warning requirement is subject to statutory exemptions,one of which applies to a n exposure for which the person responsible can show that the exposure will have no observable effect assuming exposure at one thousand times the level in question for substances known to the state to cause reproductive toxicity,subd.c,hereafter exposure exemption.consumer cause,smilecare,supra,th,d,italics omitted.the defendant has the burden to establish that the exposure meets the criteria of this exemption.consumer defense group rental housing industry members th,d see also consumer cause,smilecare,supra,at,d.
according to regulations promulgated by the office of environmental health hazard assessment a defendant may establish the warning exemption by providing specified data about the effect of a reproductive toxin.in particular,a defendant must establish the no observable effect level,or noel,which is the maximum dose level at which a chemical has no observable reproductive effect,tit,subd.c and the level of exposure in question.consumer cause,smilecare,supra,th,d.the standard of proof required of the defendant to establish the warning exemption is the preponderance of the evidence standard.baxter healthcare denton,supra,th,d.the level in question must be one thousand times less than the level which would produce no observable effect.oehha,final statement of reasons article june see,tit,level of exposure to chemicals causing reproductive toxicity.a defendant is exempt from warning others about a reproductive toxin if the level of exposure in question is times below the noel.consumer cause,smilecare,supra,at,d.thus,bondo burden was to first prove the noel level for exposure to toluene,then ultimately prove that the level of exposure of its paint is times below the noel,subd.c,tit,subds.a,b,c,at,d.this threshold warning exemption level of times below the noel is referred as the maximum allowable dose level,or madl,tit,subds.b,c.to state the distinction another way,the madl is set as one of the noel.

our review of the trial court findings of fact on the warning exemption defense is constrained by the substantial evidence rule.a trial court findings of fact are reviewed to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence.as you sow conbraco industries th,d.in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence,we must consider all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,accept as true all the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom that tend to establish the correctness of the trial court findings and decision,and resolve every conflict in favor of the judgment.citation.it is not our task to weigh conflicts and disputes in the evidence that is the province of the trier of fact.our authority begins and ends with a determination as to whether,on the entire record,there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,in support of the judgment.citation.we emphasize that the test is not the presence or absence of a substantial conflict in the evidence.rather,it is simply whether there is substantial evidence in favor of the respondent.if this substantial evidence is present,no matter how slight it may appear in comparison with the contradictory evidence,the judgment must be upheld.citations.baxter healthcare denton,supra,th,d see also grassilli barr th,d.
a.the standards for calculating the madl of exposure under section.
we first resolve dipirro claim that in determining the level of exposure within the meaning of section,subdivision c,the court erroneously settled upon a percentage of the population this case between and may use bondo paint product without exposure in excess of the madl.dipirro maintains that the statutory scheme must be interpreted to mean that if evidence shows any portion of the population that is,essentially any be exposed to levels of toluene above the madl with use of the product in a reasonably foreseeable manner,the warning exemption has not been established.he claims that the trial court use of a percentile of the population as a standard for assessing exposure pursuant to section,subdivision c,is reversible error,as the evidence failed to prove that no consumer who uses bondo paint in a reasonably foreseeable manner was exposed to levels of toluene above the madl.
the act itself fails to delineate any precise standard for determining the extent of the population that must incur exposure below the madl to establish warning exemption of section,subdivision c.we are therefore called upon to interpret the statutory provisions of proposition using the ordinary rules and canons of statutory construction.citation.thus,our primary purpose is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the voters who passed the initiative measure.citations.citation.we look first to the language of the statute,giving the words their ordinary meaning,and construing the statutory language in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme.yeroushalmi miramar sheraton th,d.absent ambiguity,we presume that the voters intend the meaning apparent on the face of an initiative measure citation and the court may not add to the statute or rewrite it to conform to an assumed intent that is not apparent in its language.citation.people ex rel.lungren superior court cal th,d,see also consumer advocacy group,exxon mobil th,d.we give the language its usual and ordinary meaning,and i f there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.if,however,the statutory language is ambiguous,we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.ultimately we choose the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the lawmakers,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute any interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences is to be avoided.citations california state employees board of administration th,d.the interpretation of statutes,as well as administrative regulations,presents questions of law subject to independent review on appeal.gregory state bd.of control th,d.
the any consumer standard proposed by dipirro is an extreme one,particularly considering the already rigorous standard of proof required of a defendant to reach the safe harbor of the warning exemption defense.the noel for toluene is already the maximum dose level at which the chemical has no observable reproductive effect,tit,subd.c.to establish the warning exemption defense,a defendant must additionally prove that the level of exposure caused by its product is times below the noel,subd.c,tit,subds.a,b,c,consumer cause,smilecare,supra,th,d.the burden imposed on a defendant by the act to defend a warning action is thus quite onerous proof of a negligible,even microscopic exposure through a scientific study to establish the amount of the carcinogen is so low that there is no need for a warning under health and safety code section.consumer defense group rental housing industry members,supra,th,d.although we are bound to broadly construe proposition to effectuate its remedial purpose people ex rel.lungren superior court,supra,cal th,d,given the already exceptional degree to which the warning exemption has gone to protect consumers,we are not persuaded to expand the definition of exposure to encompass a level times below an observable effect upon any person that may result from an anomalous event or aberrant circumstance,at least not where statutes have failed to expressly do so 
when we consult the governing regulations,we are provided with some guidance in this matter that fails to support dipirro proposed standard.the administrative construction of the governing laws through the promulgation of regulations by the office of environmental health hazard assessment is entitled to great weight in determining what the legislature intended when it enacted the statutory scheme in controversy.snow woodford th,d.however,whatever the force of administrative construction final responsibility for the interpretation of the law rests with the courts.citation.citation.see also coronado yacht club california coastal com.th,d.according to the regulations,the level of exposure to a reproductive toxin for purposes of the warning exemption is determined by multiplying the level in question stated in terms of a concentration of a chemical in a given medium times the reasonably anticipated rate of exposure for an individual to a given medium.the reasonably anticipated rate of exposure shall be based on the pattern and duration of exposure that is relevant to the reproductive effect which provided the basis for the determination that a chemical is known to the state to cause reproductive toxicity,tit,subd.b,italics added.a reasonably anticipated rate of exposure is not one that includes every conceivable consumer or use,but instead will vary from case to case and person to person.oehha,final statement of reasons article june see,tit,level of exposure to chemicals causing reproductive toxicity.
further,subdivision c of california code of regulations,title,section provides that for exposures to consumer products described in section,subdivision b,the level of exposure shall be calculated using the reasonably anticipated rate of intake or exposure for average users of the consumer product,and not on a per capita basis for the general population.italics added.while the reference to average users in section may indicate an intent to focus upon the reasonably anticipated rate of consumption by the product user rather than per capita consumption of the general population many of whom will not use the product at think the language of the regulation reasonably supports an interpretation that excludes at least some nonconforming or unusually high intake consumers of a product when assessing exposure to consumer goods.oehha,final statement of reasons article june see,tit.subdivision c of section takes into account the factor that d ifferent individuals take in different amounts of a given medium of exposure,and by limiting the exposure assessment to reasonably anticipated use by average consumers seeks to deal with the variability and fluctuation of the rate of exposure to resolve and avoid the concern with unreasonably requiring a warning to all users of a product on the basis of occasional high consumption.oehha,final statement of reasons article june see,tit.
the flexibility necessary to arrive at an appropriate exposure assessment is not provided by adhering to a standard that invariably requires the defendant to prove a level of exposure caused by its product that is times below the noel for every user.instead,we conclude that the statute envisions a approach which takes into account the totality of the quantitative risk assessment evidence presented.for some products and some probably very of precise and uniform exposure may indicate that if any consumer is exposed to levels of toxins above the madl with a reasonably anticipated use of the product,the warning exemption must be denied.in most other cases,the average user may incur exposure at a level appreciably below the most extreme level of exposure incurred by an atypical user.
in the present case,the evidence of the surveys and test results supports the trial court finding that for purposes of the warning exemption the average users of the consumer product comprise less than the class of every consumer of bondo paint.if the survey data demonstrated anything,it is that the use of paint and the associated exposure to toluene is subject to significant the total duration of use,the number and size of scratches or nicks painted,the number of coats applied,the amount of paint used,the nature of the area in which the paint is applied and the air flow in it.use of paint by an appreciable fraction of consumers may fall well outside the average.given the extreme variation in manner of use and extent of exposure,inclusion of all conceivable consumers in the determination of the allowable level of exposure to toluene from paint does not meet the governing standard of the average users of the product.we therefore find that in resolving the warning exemption defense the trial court did not err by failing to require proof from bondo that no consumer who uses paint will suffer exposure to toluene above the madl.
we further conclude that the to percentile risk assessment test adopted by the trial court was appropriate and supported by the evidence.as the trial court recognized,the evidence presented by the parties of the results of their experts surveys and studies does not lend itself to any precise,definitive statistical analysis or computation of toluene exposure for purposes of the warning exemption defense.nevertheless,based upon evidence adduced in the case before us,bondo burden to prove that at least to percent of the consumers of paint do not receive a toluene exposure above the madl complies with the mandate of section,subdivision c,and subdivision c of section of the regulations,to calculate the level of exposure using the reasonably anticipated rate of intake or exposure for average users of the consumer product.lakin testified that the reference in proposition to the reasonably anticipated exposure to an average person means a real person,not someone outside the actual population of users.he added that the epa guidance documents used in proposition assessments,called the exposure assessment guidance,address high exposures of the theoretical bounding estimate,but nothing above the percentile as being a reasonably anticipated or a typical or an exposure.italics added.lakin testimony was corroborated by the evidence of valid bounding studies or estimates that followed excessively conservative assumptions,variables and protocols designed to assess exposure at a much higher level than the actual population to safely calculate the no risk level even at the upper end or extreme estimate of the population.in this case,the to percent standard corresponded to the evidence of appropriate bounding estimates and was properly protective of average consumers of paint 
b.the evidence to support the trial court finding that bondo established the warning exemption.
we find support in the evidence offered by bondo experts for the trial court determination of exposure that does not reach the madl.the results of the geomatrix study by embree established that toluene exposure from use of paint by average consumers was between and micrograms per day,or only to percent of the madl of micrograms.dipirro presented evidence from brown to contest the legitimacy of the protocols used in the geomatrix study,particularly the air flow rate that was double the niosh approved methodology.brown also disapproved of the placement of the painted devices on the car,the breathing rate calculation,the sampling number,the lack of measurement of the volume of toluene or the amount of the paint,and other variables used in the geomatrix study.
bondo offered expert testimony to rebut brown complaints,however,which was accepted by the trial court.for instance,lakin explained that the deviation from the niosh air flow rate in the study did not compromise the results of the geomatrix study,given the use of second sampling tubes to account for any that resulted from the increased air flow.he also testified that failure to weigh the paint bottles before an application did not impair the validity of the study as long as the remaining methodology was acceptable.further,many of the criticisms leveled at the geomatrix study were alleviated by the study,which modified the air flow the niosh other variables to more conservative levels,yet still achieved essentially the same results far below the madl of micrograms per day.
lakin not only provided testimonial support for the geomatrix studies of embree,but also performed his own ensight study,which found that the reasonably anticipated exposure to toluene of the daily average use of paint is no more than micrograms per day,unadjusted for exposure over the gestation period.while lakin reliance on the nail polish study and the nossaman survey for his extrapolations may have been problematic,we still consider his ultimate findings to be valid bounding estimates,as did the trial court.
the trial court accepted the evidence offered by bondo experts and found that the and geomatrix studies were valid quantitative risk assessments based upon evidence and standards of comparable scientific validity to the evidence and standards which form the scientific basis for the listing of toluene,tit,subd.a.while dipirro presented evidence to the contrary,on appeal we can not reweigh the evidence,and do not consider any of the testimony of bondo expert witnesses so inherently lacking in credibility as to be unworthy of consideration.the testimony of witnesses who were apparently believed by the trier of fact may be rejected on appeal only if that testimony was physically impossible of belief or inherently improbable without resort to inferences or deductions.people jackson th,d in re andrew d.people breault d.at most the record before us reveals the presentation of contrary evidence by dipirro,which does not subject the testimony of bondo witnesses to repudiation or doubt.people cantrell th,d.
even brown large chamber study,which was accepted by the court as a high end of what might reasonably be anticipated in a bounding study,resulted in daily exposure results below the madl micrograms per day,or less than percent of the madl,without adjustment for the gestation period.only his small chamber study of isolated,peak level exposure while painting produced the possibility of results above the madl at various levels of paint use,and even brown acknowledged that this study departed from realistic exposure parameters in many respects.in his testimony,lakin effectively challenged the peak exposure assumption of brown as inconsistent with proposition,and the trial court rejected the small chamber study results as a bounding study.the only evidence that remotely contradicts the judgment was rejected by the trial court.evidence rejected by the trier of fact can not be credited on appeal unless,in view of the whole record,it is clear,positive,and of such a nature that it can not rationally be disbelieved.beck development southern pacific transportation th,d.
we have been presented in this appeal with a classic case of conflicting evidence.we find in the record substantial evidence to support the finding that the daily exposure to toluene by average users of paint is below the madl,and can not disturb the judgment merely because conflicting evidence was also presented by dipirro.consequently,we need not resolve the issue addressed by the parties and the attorney general concerning the propriety of averaging the exposure over the gestational period in determining the allowable exposure limit for toluene.the trial court did not reach this question and it is not our function to render an advisory opinion on this issue.see coleman department of personnel administration cal d,kuykendall state bd.of equalization th,d.
iii.the denial of bondo motion for attorney fees.
bondo has appealed from the trial court denial of its request for attorney fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section.the trial court found that bondo failed to establish that its defense of the lawsuit against it resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest.bondo maintains that its successful defense of dipirro proposition action benefited not only bondo itself,but also all users of automobile paint who will no longer be frightened or misled by utterly unnecessary warnings,the general public by discouraging false and misleading warnings that dilute the effectiveness of proposition warnings,and automobile manufacturers and dealerships who will not be forced to endure similar suits.bondo requests that we reverse the denial of the attorney fees award and remand the case to the trial court with directions to determine the amount of attorneys fees bondo is entitled to recover.

the trial court found that bondo failed to establish the first of the three section criteria that the defense of the action resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest the decision as to whether an award of attorney fees is warranted rests initially with the trial court where,as here,a trial court has discretionary power to decide an issue,its decision will be reversed only if there has been a prejudicial abuse of discretion.citations.abouab city and county of san francisco,supra,th,d.a n appellate court will decline to disturb the trial court exercise of discretion,absent a showing that the court abused example,where the record establishes there is no reasonable basis for the determination.citation.in reviewing the trial court decision,we must pay particular attention to the trial court stated reasons in denying or awarding fees and see whether it applied the proper standards of law in reaching its decision.citation.the pertinent question is whether the grounds given by the court for its denial of an award are consistent with the substantive law of section and,if so,whether their application to the facts of th e case is within the range of discretion conferred upon the trial courts under section,read in light of the purposes and policy of the statute.citation.citation.punsly ho,supra,th,d.
in our constrained review of the trial court decision on the public interest element of code of civil procedure section,we have no disagreement with bondo hypothesis that unfounded warnings may be counterproductive or actually detrimental to consumers.the problems of overwarning are exacerbated if warnings must be given even as to very remote risks citation.against the benefits that may be gained by a warning must be balanced the dangers of overwarning and of less meaningful warnings crowding out necessary warnings,the problems of remote risks,and the seriousness of the possible harm to the consumer.citation.dowhal smithkline beecham consumer healthcare,supra,cal th,d.nor do we disagree with the assertion that as a result of the judgment in its favor some consumers may now more freely use bondo paint unconcerned with fears of exposure to excessive amounts of a chemical that causes reproductive toxicity.automobile dealerships also received a benefit by avoiding possible litigation over toluene exposure through the use of paint.
and,we agree with bondo position that under the proper circumstances attorney fees may be awarded to parties who successfully defend a public interest lawsuit.generally speaking,the opposing party liable for attorney fees under section has been the defendant person or agency sued,which is responsible for initiating and maintaining actions or policies that are deemed harmful to the public interest and that gave rise to the litigation.connerly state personnel bd.cal th,d.however,to effectuate the policy of providing substantial attorney fees to successful litigants in suits enforcing important public policies,the courts have taken a broad,pragmatic view of what constitutes a successful party.graham daimlerchrysler cal th,d.an opposing party against whom attorney fees may be awarded pursuant to code of civil procedure section is defined broadly as a party whose position in the litigation was adverse to that of the prevailing party.simply put,an opposing party within the meaning of section is a losing party.nestande watson th,d.thus,prevailing defendants are entitled to attorney fees upon a proper showing.see hammond agran th,d hall butte home health,th,d.s ection draws no distinctions between plaintiffs and defendants as a successful party.hull rossi th,d.an award of attorney fees pursuant to section is available if a party defends an action primarily to advance a public interest rather than personal interests.citation.jobe city of orange th,d.
the flaw in bondo claim to attorney fees under code of civil procedure section is that the essence and fundamental outcome of its defense was the advancement of its own economic interests.although the ultimate decision in the present case may have resulted in a determination at least potential consumers that paint does not contain sufficient quantities of toluene to require warnings,we are not persuaded that any greater benefit to the virtues of proposition was conferred by bondo in the present case.the judgment that proposition warnings are not required on its paint tubes is a result that affects a limited class of consumers of that product.bondo only prevented the placement of unnecessary warnings on its paint any additional impact on other products or the overall statutory scheme is nebulous and speculative.further,the benefit conferred upon automobile manufacturers or dealerships was certainly not significant to the general public or a large class of persons.
the primary focus of defendant interest in the case was pecuniary to avert the cost of placing warnings on its product and perhaps the consequential loss of potential customers,as well as to avoid the imposition of civil penalties.i t has been repeatedly held that an award of attorney fees is not justified under section if the public benefit gained from the law suit assuming arguendo there is such a benefit here and the important public right enforced by the suit assuming arguendo such a right was vindicated here are coincidental to the monetary or other personal gain realized by the party seeking fees.pacific mutual life ins.state bd.of equalization th,d.because the public always has a significant interest in seeing that laws are enforced,it always derives some benefit when illegal private or public conduct is rectified.nevertheless,the legislature did not intend to authorize an award of fees under section in every lawsuit enforcing a constitutional or statutory right.citations.the statute specifically provides for an award only when the lawsuit has conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons.the trial court must determine the significance of the benefit and the size of the class receiving that benefit by realistically assessing the gains that have resulted in a particular case.flannery california highway patrol th,d.
our review of the record indicates to us that both the principal objective and consequence of the defense of the proposition lawsuit was to advance or vindicate bondo economic interests.where the enforcement or advancement of any public interest with the defense of the action was secondary and incidental to achieving personal business goals,an award of fees under code of civil procedure section is not warranted.see pacific legal foundation california coastal com.cal d,bell vista unified school,supra,th,d williams san francisco bd.of permit appeals th,d flannery california highway patrol,supra,th,d california common cause duffy d.terminal plaza city and county of san francisco d.if we were to grant attorney fees to bondo,prevailing defendants in nearly all cases brought under proposition,despite the primary pursuit of their own interests,might be entitled to an award under section,a result the statute does not countenance.flannery california highway patrol,supra,at,d.we agree with the assertion in the amicus curiae brief of the attorney general office that while an award of attorney fees to a successful defendant in a proposition case may be appropriate in limited circumstances where the public benefit is more obvious and substantial,those circumstances do not exist in the present case code of civil procedure s ection was not designed as a method for rewarding litigants motivated by their own pecuniary interests who only coincidentally protect the public interest.citation.flannery,supra,at,d.we therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying an award of attorney fees based upon a finding that bondo did not confer the requisite significant benefit upon the public.jobe city of orange,supra,th,d bell vista unified school,supra,at,d pacific mutual life ins.state bd.of equalization,supra,th,d.
