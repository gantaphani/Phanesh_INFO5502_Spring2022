defendants john white and carolyn taylor,employees of the ohio county kentucky water district,were convicted of making materially false statements regarding a matter within the jurisdiction of the federal government,in violation of,by submitting reports containing falsified turbidity measurements to the kentucky division of water.the district court sentenced white to two years probation and a fine,and sentenced taylor to two years probation and a fine.the government now appeals the court interpretation of the united states sentencing guidelines in determining white and taylor sentences.taylor,challenging both her sentence and various aspects of her prosecution.for the reasons set out below,we find no reversible error in connection with taylor conviction and sentence,and thus affirm that portion of the district court judgment.we further hold,however,that the case must be remanded for as to white.
procedural and factual background 
john white was the general superintendent at the ohio county water district drinking water treatment plant at cromwell,kentucky carolyn taylor was a water district employee assisting white in managing plant operations.both were licensed by the state of kentucky as class water treatment plant operators,which required multiple examinations and continuing education.as part of their job responsibilities,white and taylor prepared monthly operations reports required by federal and state law to be submitted to the kentucky department for environmental protection division of water.the division of water compiles this data from all the state water districts as part of its enforcement responsibilities pursuant to the federal safe drinking water act.the federal environmental protection agency epa funds the division data collection activities,and the division sometimes works with epa employees when investigating violations of the act.
during a surprise inspection of the plant in january,an agent from the division noted that daily log books recording the measure of turbidity the amount of suspended particulate matter in water had been left blank for each of four shifts between january and january the plant employee responsible for recording these measurements told the division agent that she had purposefully left the log sheets blank because the turbidity measurements were all above nephelometric turbidity units ntus,which might put the plant at risk of noncompliance with the act in february,however,white submitted a monthly report to the division which contained entries below the ntu threshold for each of the shifts in question.the division then seized the cromwell plant daily log book and data sheets recorded by the plant turbidimeters containing turbidity measurements for december and january.review of this evidence and subsequent interviews with plant staff,including white and taylor,by division and epa agents revealed several instances of similar falsifications of turbidity measurements and submissions of inaccurate monthly reports,which suggested that the water plant had been out of compliance with the federal and state turbidity regulations during most of the months in question.
epa employees investigating possible wrongdoing at the cromwell plant shared this evidence with assistant united states attorneys for the western district of kentucky,who informed taylor that she could be charged with violating but also said that she might qualify for pretrial diversion as an alternative to prosecution.although taylor volunteered to testify before the grand jury in hopes of gaining pretrial diversion,in october the grand jury indicted white,taylor,and plant operator brenda glenn on four counts,alleging violations of,conspiring to violate,and obstruction of justice.
prior to trial,taylor and glenn moved to suppress statements made in interviews with epa and division agents.the district court denied these motions.at trial,taylor moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure,arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction over her case because sanction of her conduct was a matter within the jurisdiction of the division of water and not within that of the epa,and also that the government could not prove that any statements made by taylor were materially false.the court denied these motions,holding that taylor conduct involved a matter within federal jurisdiction and reserving the issue of whether the statements were materially false for the jury to decide.
the jury found glenn not guilty on all counts,but found white and taylor guilty on the second count of the indictment,which charged that the defendants 
each aided and abetted by the other,made and caused to be made a false material entry in that the defendants falsely entered turbidity readings onto the january monthly operating report for the ohio county water district plant reflecting turbidity readings of less than ntus when in fact,as the defendants then and there knew,the true and correct turbidity readings were in excess of ntus.
taylor moved for a judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the guilty verdict,renewing her jurisdictional argument and also urging the court to require the government to honor its agreement for diversion.the court denied this motion.
in his reports for white and taylor,the federal probation officer handling their cases noted that the sentencing guideline ordinarily applicable to convictions pursuant to was,entitled fraud and deceit.the officer stated his belief,however,that sentencing the defendants under,entitled mishandling of other environmental pollutants record keeping,tampering,and falsification,was more appropriate,as was increasing both white and taylor base offense level by four levels pursuant to b b because their offense involved a discharge,release,or emission of a pollutant,and further increasing white sentence by two levels pursuant to because white had abused a position of public trust in committing his crime.the district court held that deciding whether to sentence white and taylor pursuant to or was unnecessary,on the grounds that both sections provided for a base offense level of six,and that the enhancement under b b did not apply because turbidity in treated water was not a pollutant that was released into the environment.the court also increased both white and taylor sentence by two levels pursuant to,not because either defendant abused a position of public trust,but because both defendants used a special skill,as indicated by their qualifications for licensed employment at the plant,in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.the court use of the special skill enhancement precluded the government suggested use of c to increase white sentence by two more levels as the alleged organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor in criminal activity,because under the guidelines,such an enhancement could not be used in addition to a special skill enhancement.following its determination of the appropriate guidelines,the court sentenced white to two years probation,including six months home detention,and a fine,and sentenced taylor to two years probation,including three months home detention,and a fine.
the government now appeals from the court sentencing order,arguing that the district court should have used guideline as a basis for white and taylor sentences,and then applied a release of pollutant enhancement pursuant to b.the government also argues that the court should have used both the abuse of trust and c criminal supervisor enhancements to increase white sentence.taylor from the final judgment against her,challenging the court determination that her case involved a matter within the jurisdiction of the federal government.she also challenges the court denials of her motion to suppress,her motion claiming that,as a matter of law,her statements were not materially false,and her motion seeking enforcement of the government offer of pretrial diversion.finally,she also appeals the court use of the special skill enhancement in determining her sentence.
discussion 
taylor conviction issuesa.jurisdiction 
taylor first argues that the district court erred in determining that her alleged false statements,the inaccurate turbidity readings in the january monthly operating report,pertained to a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency.whether the district court correctly decided this jurisdictional matter is a question of law that this court reviews de novo.see united states shafer,cir.
criminalizes the willful making of materially false statements in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive,legislative,or judicial branch of the government of the united states.the primary purpose of this jurisdictional requirement is to identify the factor that makes the false statement an appropriate subject for federal concern.united states yermian,d.the supreme court has stated that the term jurisdiction here should not be given a narrow or technical meaning for purposes of.see bryson united states,d.instead,courts should apply 
t he most natural,nontechnical reading of the statutory language that it covers all matters confided to the authority of an agency or department a department or agency has jurisdiction,in this sense,when it has the power to exercise authority in a particular situation.understood in this way,the phrase within the jurisdiction merely differentiates the official,authorized functions of an agency or department from matters peripheral to the business of that body.
united states rodgers,d citation omitted.
in distinguishing whether allegedly false statements made,as in this case,to state or municipal agencies or private entities related to official or authorized federal agency functions,rather than peripheral matters,we have in the past looked to whether the entity to which the statements were made received federal support was subject to federal regulation.see shafer,at discussing united states gibson,cir,and united states lewis,cir.in this case,the division of water,the recipient of taylor statement,reviews the turbidity data sent to it by all public water systems in the state that treat drinking water for human consumption pursuant to federal and state regulations.the division applies each year for federal funding in order to administer their review and compliance programs in fiscal year,the division received over from the epa.the epa then audits the division programs to determine whether the division is accurately monitoring compliance with federal regulations.the funding itself underscores the epa interest in monitoring these systems.furthermore,although the division has primary enforcement authority pursuant to the safe drinking water act over noncompliant local water systems,the division enforces state regulations which are required to be no less stringent than those regulations promulgated by the federal government.see.should the division fail to monitor local water systems properly and enforce compliance with the regulations,the epa also has statutory enforcement authority.see a,b,g west granting epa administrator authority to issue civil compliance order or commence civil action should the state with primary enforcement authority fail to commence appropriate enforcement action a,b granting administrator authority to issue orders or commence civil actions where imminent and substantial endangerment to public health exists b authorizing administrator or her representatives to enter drinking water treatment plants to ascertain compliance with national drinking water regulations.the government presented uncontroverted testimony at trial that the epa exercised its enforcement authority,at the behest of division of water officials,with regard to several noncompliant local water systems in kentucky.these federal enforcement actions,although perhaps secondary to those by states,like kentucky,with primary enforcement authority,evince a federal interest in what reasonably must be considered an official function of the epa,ensuring safe drinking water for all persons residing in the united states.we therefore hold that the false statements made to the division regarding drinking water turbidity levels came within the jurisdiction of the epa for purposes of prosecution under.
we are not the only court to so hold.in united states wright,cir,the tenth circuit reached a similar conclusion.as superintendent of a drinking water treatment plant in sequoyah county,oklahoma,wright filed false turbidity reports with the county health department.see wright,at.he moved unsuccessfully in district court to dismiss the indictment against him that alleged a violation of.see id.in affirming the district court denial of the motion to dismiss,the court stated 
t he false turbidity data filed by wright fell within the jurisdiction of the epa.a grant of primary authority is not a grant of public authority the act requires the administrator to promulgate maximum contaminant level goals and national primary drinking water regulations.the regulations relating to the collection and reporting of turbidity data,described above,were promulgated pursuant to that charge and authority.the epa retains the authority,in the discharge of its duties under the act,to enforce its regulations and,turbidity data clearly concern an authorized function of the epa.
furthermore,in this situation,the epa is actively involved in assuring state compliance with national safe water standards.it audits,reviews,and evaluates the state of oklahoma program,including an inspection of the monthly reports of the type involved in this case.such reports,therefore,directly implicate the ongoing function and mission of the agency.in addition,the act expressly authorizes the epa to take enforcement actions in states having primary enforcement authority.
finally,epa funding of the oklahoma public water program is conditioned,in part,on the results of its annual evaluations of that program.this court is in accord with other circuits which have found that a state agency use of federal funds,standing alone,is generally sufficient to establish jurisdiction under section.
id.at citations omitted.although our case law appears to require more than the mere expenditure of funds to establish jurisdiction pursuant to,see united states holmes,cir,the combination of reasons given by the wright court for its holding persuades us that federal jurisdiction is appropriate in this case as well.taylor attempts to distinguish her case from wright,by contending that kentucky has exclusive enforcement authority over local water systems and that the epa was not funding the division recordkeeping programs,are factually inaccurate and thus do not provide a basis for finding a lack of jurisdiction here.
materiality 
perhaps because t here can be no valid conviction under unless both jurisdiction and materiality are shown,united states rutgard,cir quoting united states facchini,cir en banc,taylor next questions whether the evidence presented at trial sufficiently proved that her allegedly false statements were material for purposes of.as with other questions,we determine whether evidence sufficiently supported a conviction by deciding whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states gatewood,cir citing jackson virginia,d.
a showing of materiality is a fairly low bar for the government to meet a statement is material in this context if it has the natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing a federal agency.see united states lutz,cir.a showing of actual influence,or actual agency reliance,is unnecessary,see united states keefer,cir indeed,t here is no implicit requirement that the false statements be made directly to,or even received by,the federal department or agency.lutz,at quoting gibson,at.if the false statements are received by an agency,they may be material even if the receiving agent or agency knows that they are false.see united states rogers,cir.
still,the fact that materiality is a low hurdle does not mean that it is no hurdle the government must present at least some evidence showing how the false statement in question was capable of influencing federal functioning.in this case,we conclude,the government presented enough circumstantial evidence of how the false statements could have affected epa from taylor prosecution under support her conviction.both epa agent libby haines and fbi agent wayne mcallister testified that they investigated the ohio county plant at the behest of the division.vicki ray,the manager of the drinking water branch of the division of water,testified that the division had turned over several local drinking water systems with reporting violations to the epa for federal enforcement.ray also described what enforcement of the regulations means noncompliant local water systems receive notification of a violation and then are required to correct the problem,and are told to notify their customers regarding violations by newspaper announcement and,if necessary,by direct mail or through radio and television advertisements.ray description dovetails with the procedures stated in and mandated by federal drinking water regulations,see,which,as discussed above,the epa regularly carries out,with or without state cooperation.through the testimony of haines,mcallister,and ray,the jury could have found that the false statements in the ohio county plant monthly report,if discovered,had the capacity to affect the epa administrative enforcement of the drinking water regulations.
taylor argues that because the regulations allow up to nine record entries,or of the total entries for the month,to be above ntus before a water system monthly report would be flagged for noncompliance possible enforcement action,the four false entries in the january report should not have been found to be material.this argument ignores the fact that the false entries,even if not violations in and of themselves,when discovered could and did lead to the seizure of other plant records which demonstrated more severe instances of noncompliance over a longer period of time,all of which was documented at trial.because taylor statements influenced the course of an investigation,which,apparently,still could result in an agency enforcement action,they were materially false for purposes of her prosecution.
suppression of taylor statements 
taylor next appeals the district court denial of her motion to suppress,arguing that inculpatory statements she made in a may,interview with agents haines and mcallister in her home should be suppressed as violative of her fifth amendment right against we review a district court findings of fact regarding a suppression motion for clear error,and its related conclusions of law de novo.see united states bencs,cir.
in its order denying taylor suppression motion,the district court made the following factual findings 
the court finds that special agent haines and special agent mcallister traveled to defendant residence in ohio county on may.the agents introduced themselves to taylor,showed their identification,and told her they were conducting an investigation into false statements on turbidity reports submitted by the plant for whom she worked taylor consented to be interviewed in her house.the interview lasted approximately thirty minutes.taylor had complete freedom of movement she was not handcuffed or physically restrained.the agents made no suggestion that she was not free to leave.
a review of the undisputed testimony of agents haines and mcallister from a pretrial suppression hearing indicates that the court did not clearly err in stating this factual scenario.we conclude that because taylor was therefore objectively not in custody at the time of the interview,there is no basis for her claim that she should have been advised of her rights pursuant to miranda arizona,d.
pretrial diversion 
taylor also argues that the district court erred in denying her various requests that an alleged pretrial diversion agreement with the government be enforced and her indictment therefore dismissed.in pressing this issue,taylor alleges that she agreed to the government offer of pretrial diversion,but that the government subsequently revoked its offer.unfortunately for taylor,the record here contains no evidence that she and the government reached an enforceable pretrial diversion agreement.taylor alleged in the district court that agents haines and mcallister first promised her pretrial diversion after their may interview.there is no evidence,however,that the agents were authorized to make promises or representations to induce taylor cooperation,authority usually reserved to united states attorneys.as we have previously noted,a promise made by a government employee other than the united states attorney that a defendant will not be indicted can not bind the united states attorney unless breach of such an agreement resulted in a fundamentally unfair prosecution,a circumstance not present here.see united states streebing,cir.
taylor also claims that assistant united states attorney randy ream similarly promised her pretrial diversion in a letter dated june.the letter from ream to taylor,however,states only that the case against you is under consideration for pretrial diversion and that it has been referred to the united states probation office for a recommendation as to whether you can be placed on pretrial diversion.emphasis added.regardless of taylor subjective belief as to what ream stated,the language in the june letter supports the government contention that,judged objectively,ream made no offer of pretrial diversion to taylor and,therefore,that the district court could not have enforced the agreement taylor now alleges existed.nor does taylor point to evidence that she reasonably relied to her detriment on any promise she believed the government may have made.we thus conclude that the district court did not err in refusing to dismiss taylor indictment or order her participation in pretrial diversion.
ii.sentencing issues 
base offense level and release of pollutant enhancement 
the government challenges the district court decision to set both white and taylor base offense levels at six without choosing between,the guideline generally applicable to violations of,and,a guideline pertaining to the reporting of false environmental data to government authorities the government also argues that the district court erred in holding that enhancement pursuant to b was inappropriate because the offense for which white and taylor were convicted did not result in or otherwise involve a discharge,release or emission of a pollutant into the environment.in reviewing a district court sentencing decision pursuant to the guidelines,we review all determinations of fact for clear error,and we review the court application of the guidelines to the facts de novo.see united states waldon,cir,cert.denied,d.the government must prove all facts used in sentencing determinations by a preponderance of the evidence.see united states crowell,cir.
in setting white and taylor base offense level at six,the district court held that choosing between and was unnecessary because the sentence enhancements available at b,potentially increasing the defendants sentences by four or six levels,did not apply.the court stated 
the court finds that in the present case turbid water can not be considered a pollutant.turbidity has been defined simply as a measure of water clarity or a measure of particles in the water.the government cites no case law,statute,or regulation in support of its argument that turbidity is a pollutant under b a.instead,the only argument the government makes is that when the turbidity readings are above ntus,the risk of there being harmful bacteria in the drinking water increases.this alone is insufficient.the water leaving the plant was cleaner than the water coming into the plant.it just was clean enough.however,there is no evidence in the record that a pollutant was discharged into the environment.therefore,the court finds that no increase is warranted 
in response to the court challenge regarding legal support for its enhancement claim,the government on appeal cites to the safe drinking water act and its enforcing regulations defining turbidity,not as a pollutant,but rather as a contaminant,and then claims that for sentencing purposes the two concepts should be seen as substantive equivalents.the government argument may be summarized as follows the act defines the term contaminant as any physical,chemical,biological,or radiological substance or matter in water.regulations enforcing the act set maximum drinking water contaminant levels for turbidity separate from those for any other regulated contaminant,see,distinguish turbidity from other contaminants in a number of other respects,see a ch.i,subpt.o,app.c d v,and thus appear to indicate the epa intent that turbidity be considered a contaminant for regulatory purposes.
the government also notes that the plain meaning of the terms contaminate and pollute are,for the most part,synonymous,and therefore argues that turbidity reasonably may be called a pollutant.webster dictionary defines contaminate as to soil,stain,or infect by contact or association,and lists as a sometimes interchangeable synonym the term pollute.webster new collegiate dictionary.pollute is defined as to make physically impure or unclean to contaminate an environment.id.at.as the government points out,nothing in guideline suggests construing the term pollutant more narrowly for federal sentencing purposes in fact,the commentary to the guideline indicates just the opposite,stating that a wide range of conduct,involving the handling of different quantities of materials with widely differing propensities,potentially is covered by b.sentencing guidelines manual cmt.finally,the government cites language from the clean water act,another federal statute targeting the safety of the national water supply.that act defines the term pollutant as dredged spoil,solid waste,incinerator residue,sewage,garbage,sewage sludge,munitions,chemical wastes,biological materials,radioactive materials,heat,wrecked or discarded equipment,rock,sand,cellar dirt and industrial,municipal,and agricultural waste discharged into water,emphasis added,a description that appears to include turbidity.
we appreciate the logic in the government position.furthermore,we note that other courts have,implicitly if not explicitly,recognized as at least a regulatory proxy for pollutants in various legal contexts.see,florida rock,united states,referring to turbidity as water pollution stoddard western carolina regional sewer,cir recognizing that measures of suspended solids in water,although not pollutants,indicated presence of pollutants and that violations of permits regulating such measurements issued pursuant to clean water act caused significant longterm environmental harm louisiana lee,cir recognizing turbidity as among environmentally disruptive effects of dredging izaak walton league of am.marsh,increased river turbidity can interfere with fish habitats and upset the ecology of backwater areas.
but even were we to join our sister circuits in holding that is a pollutant for purposes of,such a holding would not mean that the enhancements stated in b should apply to white and taylor sentences.we believe that ultimately the regulatory character of the safe drinking water act and the language and structure of the sentencing guidelines as a whole preclude the use of the enhancements the government seeks.the background to the commentary to,which applies to conduct involving the mishandling of nonhazardous substances related offenses,states that the section parallels,involving the mishandling of pesticides and other toxic or hazardous substances.see sentencing guidelines manual cmt.background.section b contains six subsections detailing specific offense characteristics enhancing a defendant base offense level the first of these is the parallel to b,the release of pollutant enhancement at issue here.the background to the commentary to states that t he first four specific offense characteristics provide enhancements when the offense involve s a substantive violation.the last two specific offense characteristics apply to recordkeeping offenses.sentencing guidelines manual cmt.background.section b,one of the last two enhancements referred to in the commentary and precisely paralleled by b,states that i f a recordkeeping offense reflect s an effort to conceal a substantive environmental offense,use the offense level for the substantive offense.although the commentary to does not include a limiting rule similar to that in,we infer that b is the only enhancement in the guideline that applies to recordkeeping offenses.
in seeking enhancements under b for white and taylor convictions pursuant to,the government apparently asks us to accept as a recordkeeping offense.regardless of whether the defendants convictions should be considered recordkeeping offenses,however,neither the safe drinking water act nor any other federal statute contains a substantive environmental offense criminalizing the defendants conduct,even if that conduct is thought to include allowing the release of contaminated water into the environment.the defendants purported recordkeeping offenses thus do,an effort to conceal a substantive environmental offense,because no federal statute criminalizes the regulatory violations underlying the defendants fraudulent conduct we also see no way in which the offenses themselves could be considered substantive environmental offenses.we therefore conclude that the language in the separate provisions of and commentaries to and,which appear to limit use of release of pollutant enhancements to convictions pursuant to substantive criminal environmental offenses or the recordkeeping offenses concealing them,prevents the use of the b enhancements the government argues are appropriate here.
in sum,even if turbidity is considered a pollutant for purposes of b,the district court did not err in refusing to enhance white and taylor sentences pursuant to this guideline provision because their recordkeeping offense can not be said to reflect an effort to conceal a substantive environmental offense under the safe drinking water act or any other federal statute.the only substantive offense involved in this case was the violation of under either or,if applied,the defendants base offense level for this criminal conduct would be six.we therefore hold that the district court did not err in finding that the sentencing calculation under either guideline would be the same.
abuse of trust enhancement 
the district court enhanced both white and taylor sentences pursuant to guideline,because it found that both defendants used a special skill in committing their fraud offenses.section states 
if the defendant abused a position of public or private trust,or used a special skill,in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense,increase by levels.this adjustment may not be employed if an abuse of trust or skill is included in the base offense level or specific offense characteristic.if this adjustment is based on an abuse of a position of trust,it may be employed in addition to an adjustment under aggravating role if this adjustment is based solely on the use of a special skill,it may not be employed in addition to an adjustment under aggravating role.
the government challenges the court rationale for its enhancement of white sentence,claiming,as it did at trial,that white sentence should have been adjusted because he abused a position of public or private trust in committing his offense a reversal on this point would allow the government to seek an additional upward adjustment pursuant to for white alleged aggravating role as an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor of criminal activity at the plant.we review a district court abuse of trust determination de novo.see united states tribble,cir.
in analyzing claims that an enhancement should apply to a criminal defendant sentence,this court has necessarily identified whether the defendant held a position of trust,and whether the position of trust facilitated the commission of the crime.see,united states talley,cir,cert.denied,d.the heart of the dispute between the parties here involves what is arguably a threshold question,however the identity of white victims.the enhancement may only be applied where the defendant abused a position of trust with the victim of his charged conduct.
