richard edgcomb,the president and general manager of canyon club,owns a parcel of land adjacent to the snake river in wyoming known as the river bend ranch ranch.edgcomb sold a portion of the ranch to the canyon club for the purpose of building a golf course and residential development.according to edgcomb and the canyon club,the purpose of building the golf course was to provide additional income so that the remainder of the ranch could remain viable as a ranching operation edgcomb continues to own as ranch property acres adjacent to the canyon club property to the north and acres some distance from the canyon club parcel to the south the canyon club parcel is bounded on the west by the snake river and on the east and south by national forest land.
three bald eagle nesting territories are in the vicinity of the canyon club parcel the martin creek nest,the dog creek nest,and the cabin creek nest the martin creek nest,which has been inactive in recent years,lies to the west of the property,feet from one of the proposed golf greens.the dog creek nest is located near the river to the northwest of the canyon club development,approximately feet from the tee box of one of the proposed golf holes.this nest has been very productive,having produced at least one fledgling per year since.the cabin creek nest is situated to the south of the project area,feet from one of the proposed tee boxes,with an alternate nesting site very close to the development.cabin creek is the most productive nest in the greater yellowstone ecosystem,having produced eleven fledglings between and.
in march,canyon club applied to the corps for a permit to build an golf course and home residential development on a acre parcel of land originally part of the ranch the march proposal.congress requires developers to obtain a section permit from the corps for the discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters,a.this project required the dredging and filling of waters under the corps jurisdiction,including the construction of bendway weirs stabilizing structures to protect the golf course holes along the banks of the snake river.two of the proposed golf holes were to be built on a gravel peninsula extending into the river.when the project met with criticism from various state and federal agencies and environmental groups,and was determined not to be in compliance with teton county land development regulations ldrs,the corps recommended that canyon club withdraw and revise its proposal,and canyon club did so.
canyon club submitted a revised section application in october the october proposal.like the march proposal,the october proposal envisioned an golf course and residential development,but the number of homes was increased to and the overall size of the parcel that would be the subject of development was increased to acres.changes were also made to bring the project into compliance with teton county ldrs,such as moving two of the proposed golf holes off the peninsula extending into the river.proposed impacts to wetlands were reduced,and proposed conservation easements were redesigned.a section permit was necessary because the october proposal,like the march proposal,required dredging and filling of wetlands and waters of the united states under the corps jurisdiction,including the possible construction of bendway weirs to protect the river banks.
at the corps request,canyon club prepared a biological assessment ba of the proposed development,retaining pioneer environmental services,pioneer for this purpose.this ba considered the impact of the proposed project on a number of species,including bald eagles,concluding that t he proposed project may affect and is likely to adversely affect bald eagles but would not adversely affect various other species.appellant app.at.in january,pioneer prepared a section b analysis for the corps,listing several alternatives to the proposal.id.at.this section b analysis compared the october proposal to five alternatives the march proposal,a golf course,a design that would relocate holes three and four of the proposed golf course,no issuance of a section permit,and a no action alternative.id.at.finally,in march,pioneer prepared an environmental assessment ea that compared the proposal to each of these alternatives with the exception of.
in its ea,the most comprehensive document prepared for the corps,pioneer articulated the purposes and goals of the project 
supplement the ranching operations on the river bend ranch with income from the canyon club golf development in order to protect the working ranch operations horse cattle.
preserve the adjacent working ranch and the rustic,natural character of the ranch throughout the project area.
develop a,hole,championship golf course of such quality that it will maximize real estate values and minimize the number of lot sales.
create a golf course with exceptional visual experiences and variety of play in length and direction of holes.
minimize development sprawl and conceal human structures and the infrastructure of the golf course in order to preserve the scenic quality of the environment.
minimize tree removal,wetland impacts,and ground disturbance while optimizing conservation of open space.
id.at.having thus defined the purposes of the project,pioneer concluded that the no action alternative and the golf course alternative failed to satisfy the project purposes.id.at.according to pioneer,if the corps did not issue a section permit,the entirety of the ranch would be sold to the canyon club,and a larger housing development without a golf course would be built on the parcel.the golf course was rejected for lack of demand and failure to satisfy any of the enumerated project purposes.finally,pioneer explained that the original acre proposal and the possible relocation of holes three and four would not be in compliance with teton county ldrs.under this analysis,the october proposal was the only alternative that both satisfied the purported purposes of the project and complied with local land development regulations.
on april,the fish and wildlife service fws prepared a biological opinion bo analyzing the likely effects of the october proposal on species listed as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act esa,et.fws concurred with pioneer ba that the proposed project would not adversely affect other species,but would likely affect bald eagles.specifically,fws determined that the project would result in increased human disturbance to the bald eagles and render their foraging habitat less suitable.although it conceded that some bald eagles could become moderately habituated to human presence or tolerant of certain activities along the snake river,the bo stated that t he service anticipates the loss of bald eagle nesting territories,cabin creek,martin creek,and dog creek as a result of the proposed action.appellant app.at.fws predicted that bald eagles displaced by the project would be forced to move into territory occupied by other bald eagles,and the reproductive output of adult bald eagles would be lost.nonetheless,fws concluded that the development is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the bald eagle,and recommended mitigation measures to minimize the impact of incidental take that might otherwise result from the proposed action.id.at.
the corps prepared its own ea reviewing the october proposal.accepting the definition of the project purposes set forth by pioneer,the corps considered the alternatives suggested by pioneer,and rejected them either because they did not satisfy the purposes of the project or because they violated teton county ldrs.the corps also considered two alternatives on ranchland not owned by edgcomb or canyon club,but rejected these sites as too expensive to purchase and likely to have a similar impact on wetlands.based on this analysis,the corps concluded that the october proposal was the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative available.id.at.the corps further concluded that the permit action will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment and accordingly issued a finding of no significant impact,declining to issue an environmental impact statement under nepa.id.at.
on june,the corps granted a section permit to canyon club,thus allowing the october proposal to go forward.three days later,the plaintiffs filed a petition in the wyoming district court for review of the corps decision to issue a section permit.plaintiffs argued that the permit violated nepa and the cwa,and that the issuance of the permit was arbitrary,capricious,and an abuse of discretion.plaintiffs also moved for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to halt the proposed development.
a temporary restraining order against the project was issued by the district court,but it subsequently amended the order to allow limited construction pending its ruling on the preliminary injunction.on june,and july,the district court held a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction.at the hearing,the district court heard testimony from edgcomb,various state and federal environmental officials,and the president of pioneer.on august,the district court lifted the temporary restraining order,and three days later denied plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.plaintiffs appeal this interlocutory order.

a party seeking a preliminary injunction bears the burden of showing a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits irreparable harm unless the injunction is issued that the threatened injury outweighs the harm that the preliminary injunction may cause the opposing party and that the injunction,if issued,will not adversely affect the public interest.fed.lands legal consortium ex rel.robart estate united states,cir.if the plaintiff can establish that the latter three requirements tip strongly in his favor,the test is modified,and the plaintiff may meet the requirement for showing success on the merits by showing that questions going to the merits are so serious,substantial,difficult,and doubtful as to make the issue ripe for litigation and deserving of more deliberate investigation.davis,at quotation omitted.because a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy,the right to relief must be clear and unequivocal.health care ass n.dep t of social rehab,cir.
in the instant case,the district court found that the plaintiffs failed to satisfy the first two conditions a likelihood of prevailing on the merits and irreparable harm unless the injunction is issued.the district court did not address the other two factors,the balance of harms and the effect on the public interest.because the appropriate standard for evaluating likelihood of success on the merits depends on whether the other three factors are satisfied,we begin by reviewing the district court determination that plaintiffs had failed to show irreparable harm.
two bases were articulated by the district court for its conclusion that the plaintiffs had not shown irreparable harm.first,the district court noted,p laintiffs have made no showing that the of the bald eagle species may be jeopardized by the challenged action,and certainly not before this court has an opportunity to fully consider the merits of this case.greater yellowstone coalition flowers,civ d,slip op.at,order denying preliminary injunction.second,the district court found the plaintiffs alleged injuries to be speculative.id.we address these two findings.
although the district court acknowledged that fws anticipated the loss of three bald eagle nests and twelve juvenile bald eagles during the construction period,it nonetheless concluded that alleging harm to individual bald eagles was insufficient to justify a preliminary injunction.citing fund for animals frizzell,and bays legal fund browner,it held that a proponent of a preliminary injunction must show that the challenged action will irretrievably damage the entire species and that plaintiffs did not meet this burden 
in frizzell,the first case cited by the district court in support of its view,the circuit concluded that a proponent of a preliminary injunction must raise a substantial possibility that the harvest of excessive numbers of waterfowl will irretrievably damage the species.frizzell,at.in frizzell,however,the species of waterfowl in question was not threatened or endangered,and the petitioners were arguing that the destruction of only one bird is sufficient injury to warrant a preliminary injunction.id.frizzell concludes that equating the death of a small percentage of a reasonably abundant game species with irreparable injury without any attempt to show that the of that species may be jeopardized is to ignore the plain meaning of the word.id.emphasis added.
in the instant case,the animals likely to be harmed by the proposed golf course development belong to a threatened species,not a reasonably abundant game species.while harvesting a small percentage of an abundant game species will not result in a permanent decrease in the population,id.at,threatening or eliminating the primary breeding area for bald eagles in the greater yellowstone area would have a significant impact on that species in the area.accordingly,frizzell is not persuasive authority,and we consider it inapplicable given the distinguishing circumstances.
in bays legal fund,a district court case from massachusetts cited below,the court determined that evidence of irreparable harm for purposes of a preliminary injunction could be used to support a substantive claim of a violation under the esa,which requires a showing that a challenged federal action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species under the esa.at quotation omitted.the trial court in bays legal fund,however,was not faced with the question of what constitutes irreparable harm rather,the court had to decide whether evidence of such harm could support a claim under the esa standard thus,the question presented in the instant case was not even before the court in bays legal fund,and its conclusions are not relevant to the case before us.in any event,we are not bound by rulings of the district courts,whether in or out of our circuit.
plaintiffs contend that a proponent of a preliminary injunction under these circumstances,seeking to prevent harm to members of a threatened or endangered species,need not show harm to the species as a whole we agree.contrary to the assumption of both the court in bays legal fund and the district court in the instant case,there is no reason why the esa language should govern the issue of irreparable harm.plaintiffs have not brought an esa challenge,and it would be preferable to base the determination of irreparable harm on the statutes that actually form the basis of plaintiffs claims.for example,plaintiffs challenge the issuance of the section permit under the cwa regulations under that statute prevent discharge of dredged or fill material if there is a practicable alternative which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem.a.this language does not differentiate between harm to individual animals and harm to the species as a whole rather,it looks to the impact on the aquatic ecosystem.according to the plaintiffs,eliminating bald eagles from the snake river area would certainly have an adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem,as bald eagles are an important part of that ecosystem and one bald eagle nest in particular,the cabin creek nest,is the most productive breeding territory in the greater yellowstone area.
we can find no compelling reason why the esa language should serve as a benchmark for deciding whether plaintiffs have shown irreparable harm.by adopting the esa standard,requiring that a plaintiff show damage to an entire species,as the standard for evaluating irreparable harm in a cwa or nepa challenge,the district court based its decision on an erroneous conclusion of law.we conclude that,to the extent that the district court based its denial of a preliminary injunction on the plaintiffs failure to establish harm to the species as a whole,this was an abuse of discretion.
in addition to holding that plaintiffs failed to show harm to the species,the district court also found that,in any event,the injuries alleged by the plaintiffs were speculative.consequently,we must also consider the district court alternative ground for decision that the possibility of harm to the bald eagles was too speculative to justify granting a preliminary injunction.
both the district court and the defendants rely on cases from other circuits for the proposition that purely speculative harm does not amount to irreparable injury,see forest city daly housing town of hempstead,cir.gas ferc,a proposition with which this court agrees.other cases,however,elaborate on the level of risk that is required for a showing of irreparable harm.these latter cases hold that an injury is not speculative simply because it is not certain to occur.an irreparable harm requirement is met if a plaintiff demonstrates a significant risk that he or she will experience harm that can not be compensated after the fact by monetary damages.adams freedom forge,cir emphasis added see also lanier prof l,ricci,cir stating that a plaintiff must show a significant risk of irreparable harm in order to obtain a preliminary injunction emphasis added associated contractors of,coalition for econ.equity,cir same.while not an easy burden to fulfill,adams,at,we nonetheless agree with those circuits that consider a significant risk of harm sufficient,and hold that a plaintiff who can show a significant risk of irreparable harm has demonstrated that the harm is not speculative.
in reaching the conclusion that the alleged harm to the bald eagles was merely speculative,the district court did not apply the significant risk standard.thus,we proceed to examine the evidence to determine whether the plaintiffs have shown a significant risk of irreparable harm.
as discussed above,the bo prepared by fws anticipated the loss of three bald eagles nests the corps relied on the conclusions of fws in determining that the proposed development may affect and is likely to adversely affect bald eagles.appellant app.at.other documents that the corps relied on in issuing the permit support fws determination that the canyon club project may harm bald eagles.for example,while the ba prepared by pioneer ultimately concluded that negative effects on bald eagles could be minimized by the implementation of mitigation measures and monitoring efforts appellee app.at,it also acknowledged that the project could harm the bald eagles in a variety of ways.pioneer ba admitted that t here would be direct effects to bald eagles and their habitats in association with construction of the canyon club golf course and housing development.disturbances associated with construction would be in the form of noise,human activities,ground disturbance,and tree removal.appellant app.at.the ba further stated that,while removal of trees would be minimized during construction,potential perch,roost,and future nest trees could still be removed,and predicted that f oraging habitat for the dog,martin,and cabin creek eagle pairs in the vicinity of the project area could be impacted indirectly by the proposed development.id.at.as to cumulative effects of the project,the ba stated that c umulative impact to eagles within and adjacent to the canyon club project area could be realized over time because of the projected increase in recreational use of the project area and adjacent land by club members,families,and guests.id.at.
at the hearing on the preliminary injunction,robert oakleaf,a wildlife biologist with the wyoming game and fish department,testified as to the impact that the canyon club project would have on the bald eagles.oakleaf testified that,if the proposed development went forward,out of the four pairs,four bald eagle nests that were there,we be lucky if one remained.appellant app.at.oakleaf based this prediction on the increase in human activity and the distribution of where it is,as well as the fact that the development would remove a significant amount of foraging habitat.id.at.oakleaf predicted that the greatest threat was to the martin creek nest,and then it going to be a between the dog creek and cabin creek,but we think that three of the four pairs of bald eagles will disappear.id.at.
oakleaf qualified this prediction by stating that i t may take two years it may take years for the bald eagles to leave the nests id.at,and explained that the department had not quantified the projected loss of bald eagles because they do like to be put hanging their hat on something that may or may not happen,id.at.oakleaf also acknowledged that,in some instances,bald eagles had been tolerant of human activity.nevertheless,the thrust of oakleaf testimony was a prediction that the bald eagles would likely be harmed by the proposed canyon club development.
patricia ann deibert,a fish and wildlife biologist for the wyoming field office of fws,testified that maintaining a meter buffer zone around the nest will protect the nest itself but will not protect the foraging areas which are critical to the success of those nests during the breeding season.id.at.later,however,the court asked deibert whether,if these buffer zones protect the nest sites,those nest sites could remain viable places for reproduction of the species,and deibert responded,they could.id.at.deibert also confirmed that fws prediction of a loss of three bald eagle nests was a scenario.id.at.even so,when asked about the mitigation measures proposed to protect the bald eagles,deibert responded that i t is still possible that three bald eagle nesting territories will be lost.id.at.while deibert left open the possibility that mitigation measures might save the bald eagles,she stood by fws position that the project would likely result in the loss of three bald eagle nests.
roy hugie,a wildlife biologist and president of pioneer,was called by canyon club to address the potential impact of the proposed golf course on the bald eagles.hugie was optimistic about the possibility that the bald eagles could adapt to the construction of the golf course and resulting increase in human activity.while hugie conceded that the project could adversely affect the bald eagles,he considered it equally likely that this project has the potential to either maintain the status quo or perhaps develop a stronger food source than currently exists.id.at.
hugie further asserted that the human intrusion could be controlled by the design of the course and various mitigation measures.id.hugie pointed to the example of the elbow nest although the nest is near a campground,the bald eagles have habituated to the human presence.id.at.nevertheless,despite these rosy predictions,hugie conceded under that he wholly agree d with the proposition that implementation of the
