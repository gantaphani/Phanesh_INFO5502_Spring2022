statutory and regulatory background 
a.the clean air act visibility protections 
in enacting section congress declare d as a national goal the prevention of any future,and the remedying of any existing,impairment of visibility in mandatory class i federal areas which impairment results from manmade air pollution.a.class i federal areas include certain national wilderness areas and national parks.arizona contains twelve class i areas,the largest of which is grand canyon national park.
section seeks to reduce regional haze,that is,visibility impairment caused by geographically dispersed sources emitting fine particles and their precursors into the air.am.corn growers,at internal quotation marks omitted.in service of this goal,section requires that certain sources contributing to visibility impairment install bart which,again,is an acronym for best available retrofit technology.states must review all major stationary emissions sources built between and to determine whether the source emits any air pollutant which may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility in any class i area.b a.the states are then responsible for determining the appropriate bart controls for each source.see b a,g.
epa reviews the states sip submissions,if any,for consistency with the statute and regulations.see c a oklahoma epa,cir.if epa determines that a sip does not meet the act requirements,the federal agency may itself determine bart and impose a fip.see b a.more specifically,if epa finds that a state has not submitted a required sip,determines that a submitted sip is incomplete,or disapproves a sip in whole or in part,it shall promulgate a fip at any time within years.c.epa must promulgate a fip unless the state corrects the deficiency,and epa approves the plan or plan revision,before epa promulgates the fip.id.
when determining bart,states or epa must consider five factors the costs of compliance,the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of compliance,any existing pollution control technology in use at the source,the remaining useful life of the source,and the degree of improvement in visibility which may reasonably be anticipated to result from the use of such technology.g.each source subject to the bart requirement must install and operate bart as expeditiously as practicable but in no event later than five years after the date of approval of a sip or the date of promulgation of a fip.g.
epa regional haze regulations 
section directed epa to issue regulations requiring states with class i areas within their borders to submit sips containing emission limits,schedules of compliance and other measures as may be necessary to make reasonable progress toward meeting the national goal.b.epa was also required to develop guidelines for the states on appropriate techniques and methods for implementing section.id.b.in,congress added section to expand the caa focus to include regional haze,see that is,visibility impairment that is caused by the emission of air pollutants from numerous sources located over a wide geographic area.section requires,among other things,that epa undertake research to identify sources and source regions of visibility impairment in class i areas,consider designating transport commissions to study the interstate movement of pollutants,and establish a transport commission for the grand canyon national park.am.corn growers,at.
pursuant to sections and,epa in promulgated regional haze regulations.july,codified at.the circuit partially vacated those regulations in american corn growers ass epa,at thereafter,the agency in promulgated new regulations,the regional haze regulations and guidelines for best available retrofit technology bart determinations.july,haze regulations.at the same time,epa issued guidelines to help states identify sources and determine the appropriate bart for each source.id.at codified at pt,app.y guidelines see also b.
the haze regulations set a goal of achieving natural visibility at all class i areas by.toward that end,the regulations direct states to submit sips to epa containing goals expressed in deciviews that provide for reasonable progress towards achieving natural visibility conditions.d.a deciview is a measurement of visibility impairment.more specifically,it is a haze index derived from calculated light extinction,such that uniform changes in haziness correspond to uniform incremental changes in perception across the entire range of conditions,from pristine to highly impaired.c.one deciview is the minimum visibility impairment humans can perceive.see guidelines at.
the sip must also include,among other matters,emission limitations representing bart and schedules for compliance with bart for each source that may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility in any mandatory class i federal area.e.the bart requirements apply unless the state opts to implement an alternative emission control measure that provides greater progress than would be achieved through the installation of bart commonly referred to as bart.see id.e.
bart is defined as an emission limitation based on the degree of reduction achievable through the application of the best system of continuous emission reduction for each pollutant which is emitted by an existing stationary facility.id.three of the major pollutants that states must evaluate when determining whether a source causes or contributes to visibility impairment are sulfur dioxide,nitrogen oxides nox,and particulate matter.see guidelines at.states must establish bart for each pollutant.id.at.
bart determinations for power plants with a total generating capacity greater than megawatts must comply with the guidelines.b.the guidelines set forth the following process identify all available retrofit control technologies eliminate technically infeasible options evaluate the control effectiveness of remaining control technologies evaluate impacts and document the results and evaluate the visibility impacts.guidelines at.the guidelines also provide more detailed instructions for performing each of these steps.id.at.for sources other than mw power plants states retain the discretion to adopt approaches that differ from the g uidelines.guidelines at.
section of the haze regulations,allows certain western states to develop alternative visibility improvement programs,based on the recommendations of the grand canyon visibility transport commission the commission.the commission was created to address visibility impairment for the region affecting the visibility of the grand canyon national park.see f.this region includes sixteen class i areas on the colorado plateau located in arizona,colorado,new mexico,and utah.b.states within the relevant transport region arizona,california,colorado,idaho,nevada,new mexico,oregon,utah,and wyoming that submit a sip compliant with all of the commission recommendations are deemed to comply with the requirements for reasonable progress with respect to the class i areas.id.a.any covered state that elects not to submit a section plan is subject to the requirements of section in the same manner and to the same extent as any state not included within the transport region.id.further,even if a state submits a section sip,it must submit a section sip or otherwise establish reasonable progress goals including bart determinations for any class i areas in the state not covered under section.id.g.
ii.procedural history 
a.the state sip submissions 
the haze regulations set a december,deadline for sip submittals.b.epa issued a finding on january,that states,including arizona,had not submitted sips satisfying the act visibility requirements.finding of failure to submit state implementation plans required by the regional haze rule.noting that arizona had opted to develop its sip based on the recommendations of the grand canyon visibility transport commission pursuant to section,id.at,epa found that the state had failed to submit the plan elements required by two provisions of the section regulations,d and g id.epa further explained that t his finding starts the two year clock for the promulgation by epa of a fip.id.
although epa determined that its january finding triggered the act window,see c,it did not take any further action by january.several environmental groups sued epa in early to compel the agency to promulgate fips for the states covered by the january finding.see parks conservation ass epa,cv.epa and the plaintiff groups entered into a consent decree setting deadlines for epa action for each state covered by the lawsuit.for arizona,the consent decree required epa by november,either to approve the state sip with respect to its bart determinations or to propose a fip.
to avoid a fip,arizona elected to develop a section sip it was submitted to epa on february.the sip proposed progress goals and long term strategies to achieve those goals,including bart determinations.specifically,the sip included bart determinations for emission units at three fossil fuel power plants that arizona concluded were and subject to bart apache generating station units,cholla power plant units,and coronado generating station units.only the sip determinations as to coronado are at issue in this case 
overall,the state bart determinations for nox,the pollutant with which we are concerned here,consisted of combustion controls,either in the form of burners lnb with flue gas recirculation fgr,or lnb with overfire air ofa or separated overfire air sofa,july.for coronado,arizona determined that the proper control technology was burners with overfire air.translating the chosen technology into the resulting emission improvement,the sip established enforceable nox emissions limits of for both units of the coronado facility 
epa actions 
in july,epa proposed partially to approve and partially to disapprove the state bart determinations with respect to the three power plants in its section sip and to promulgate a fip for the disapproved elements.at.epa deferred taking action on the state other bart determinations or any other parts of the sip regarding the remaining requirements of the haze regulations.id.at.in a later rulemaking,epa approved in part and disapproved in part the remaining portions of arizona section sip.see.july,phase rule after a period,epa promulgated the final rule challenged here,in december.at.
the final rule approved the state emission limits for and particulate matter at all the units but disapproved the state emissions limits for nox at the seven generating units at apache,cholla,and coronado id.at.epa explained that arizona overall approach to the bart analysis was generally reasonable and consistent with the haze regulations and the bart guidelines.at.but it determined that arizona bart analysis suffered from several flaws,particularly with respect to costs and visibility improvement,that resulted in nox control determinations inconsistent with the haze regulations.at see also.at.epa found that the state analyses with respect to and particulate matter suffered from similar deficiencies.at,but nonetheless approved arizona determinations for these pollutants because the analytical flaws had no substantive impact on the state selection of controls.at.
explaining that the consent decree required epa promptly to issue a fip for any portion of the arizona sip it disapproved,the final rule simultaneously issued a fip addressing the disapproved elements.at.epa conducted a new bart analysis of the three power plants to evaluate arizona sip and to document the technical basis for proposing bart determinations in epa fip,focusing in particular on analyzing the cost controls and visibility impacts associated with the different bart options.at see generally.at.at.
based on these analyses,epa concluded that selective catalytic reduction scr with burners and overfire air the most stringent available retrofit control option was the proper bart control for coronado.see.at.epa proposed nox emission limits much lower than those contained in arizona sip calculated on a rolling boiler operating day average for coronado unit,and for coronado unit id.at,tbl.epa also proposed compliance deadlines,as well as recordkeeping and reporting requirements,to enforce the fip bart determinations id.finally,epa sought public comment on several aspects of the proposed fip.id.at.
in the final rule,epa revised certain elements of the proposed fip in response to public comments and additional information.at.notably,epa weakened the final nox emissions limits to provide an extra margin of compliance and changed its methodology to require averaging.id.at.as relevant here,epa changed its proposed nox emission limits from for coronado unit and for coronado unit to an averaged limit of across both units of the coronado facility.id.at,tbl.the final rule also extended the compliance deadlines for installation and operation of the controls at the facilities.see id.
arizona and srp filed timely petitions for review of the final rule.after the cases were consolidated,we permitted national parks conservation association and sierra club the respondent intervenors to intervene in the consolidated action.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
under the administrative procedure act apa,we uphold a final agency action unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.to meet its regulatory obligations,an agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto.ins,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.an agency action is arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of apa if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.id.when we review an agency action involv ing primarily issues of fact,and where analysis of the relevant documents requires a high level of technical expertise,we must defer to the informed discretion of the responsible federal agencies.npca,at quoting marsh or.nat.res.council,d.
the parties vigorously dispute how we should apply the apa arbitrary and capricious standard here.epa maintains that in this case,as in most administrative law cases,the standard calls for judicial deference to the federal agency as to the decisions within its authority.arizona with the support of srp contends,to the contrary,that section allocation of initial bart authority to the states requires that we defer to the state expert judgments,not to epa.as this brief summary indicates,the parties disagreement concerning judicial review is grounded in competing visions of the act division of responsibility between the states and epa.we therefore begin our analysis at the agency level,progressing thereafter to the question of our review standard.
the states possess broad authority over bart determinations congress intended the states to decide which sources impair visibility and what bart controls should apply to those sources.am.corn growers,at.in this connection,section of the act gives states the initial responsibilities of determining which sources are subject to bart and of deciding,based on consideration of the five statutory factors,what bart controls must be installed and what the resulting emission limitations should be.see b a,g.
but,as the tenth circuit has noted,the bart determination process does not differ from other parts of the act states have the ability to create sips,but they are subject to epa review.oklahoma,at see also dakota epa,cir.epa may only approve sips,or portions of sips,that meet all the applicable requirements of the act.k.thus,while the act gives states discretion in balancing the five bart factors,it also mandates that the state adhere to certain requirements when conducting a bart analysis.oklahoma,at.consequently,when reviewing regional haze sips,epa may not approve a bart determination that is based upon an analysis that is neither reasoned nor moored to the act provisions.dakota,at.in short,epa is not limited to the ministerial role of verifying whether a determination was made it must review the substantive content of the bart determination.id.
alaska department of environmental conservation epa,d adec,does not support the opposite conclusion,arizona contention to the contrary notwithstanding.adec involved a challenge to epa authority to review states determinations of best available control technology bact under the prevention of significant deterioration program psd,et,a different part of the act from the one mandating bart.see adec,at.the psd program is applicable to new construction of pollution emitting facilities.see.as with the bart process at issue here,for the psd program the state exercises primary or initial responsibility for identifying bact in line with the act.adec,at.
adec rejected an argument made by the petitioners in that case similar to arizona contention here in that instance,that epa enforcement role was limited to ensuring that the psd permit contain a bact requirement.instead,adec accepted epa interpretation of its authority that epa is authorized to review state bact determinations to ensure they are reasonably moored to the act provisions.id.at.
to be sure,adec explained,alaska had considerable leeway in its bact determinations,and epa was required to accord appropriate deference to such determinations.id.at.but epa has the authority to verify substantive compliance with the act bact provisions to guard against unreasonable designations.id.at.adec is thus fully consistent with our conclusion that epa has substantive authority to assure that a state proposals comply with the act,not simply the ministerial authority to assure that the state has made some determination of bart.
arizona also invokes american corn growers,in which petitioners challenged aspects of epa initial regional haze rule.that case does not support arizona position regarding epa sip role either.the circuit in american corn growers disapproved epa initial rule in part because its requirements were inconsistent with the act provisions giving the states broad authority over bart determinations.am.corn growers,at.but american corn growers in no way suggested that once a state has exercised its bart role by proposing a sip,epa lacks authority substantively to review the sip for consistency with the act.
from our determination that epa has a substantive role in deciding whether state sips are compliant with the act and its implementing regulations follows the conclusion that the ordinary apa arbitrary and capricious judicial review standard applies,with the requisite deference,to epa determinations.again,neither american corn growers nor adec supports a contrary conclusion.in particular,neither adec nor american corn growers bolsters arizona contention that,upon judicial review,epa bears the burden of proving that the state bart determinations are unreasonable.
adec did state that,for the purposes of deciding whether the state agency bact determination in that case was reasonable,the production and persuasion burdens remain with epa.at.but adec was at that juncture addressing a concern wholly absent here.in adec,the supreme court held that the act prevented epa from gain ing a tactical advantage by imposing a order rather than filing a civil action in state court.at.in that connection,adec noted that congress nowhere suggested that the allocation of proof burdens would differ depending upon which enforcement route epa selected.id.at emphasis added.petitioners in this case,however,challenge not an epa enforcement action but the final rule disapproving in part arizona sip submission.such prospective administrative agency rulemaking is ordinarily reviewed under the apa arbitrary and capricious standard there is no basis for applying a different standard here.
in sum,section gives states substantial responsibility in determining appropriate bart controls.epa may not disapprove reasonable state determinations that comply with the relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.see am.corn growers,at.that is,as adec put it,epa may not second guess reasoned,legally compliant state decisions.at.but congress intended that epa,not the states alone,ultimately ensure that state determinations as to regional haze comply with the act,and so authorized epa to disapprove state analysis that is neither reasoned nor moored to the act provisions.dakota,at.once the federal agency has done so,our role as the reviewing court remains what it always is when substantively reviewing agency action under the apa deciding,with appropriate deference to the federal agency,whether the agency action was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.
partial disapproval of the sip bart determinations 
we now turn to petitioners challenges to epa partial disapproval of arizona sip as it applies to the coronado bart determinations.
arizona procedural claim 
before addressing petitioners substantive arguments,we address arizona procedural argument.arizona maintains that,in acting only on the bart determinations when it promulgated the final rule,deferring action on the rest of the sip,epa misconstrued its statutory authority and acted in an arbitrary fashion.specifically,arizona contends that epa can not properly evaluate bart determinations separately from the broader reasonable progress analysis,because bart determinations are just one aspect of achieving section overall reasonable progress to the natural visibility goal.b.
that is not so.there is no requirement that epa approve or disapprove a sip submittal in a single action.to the contrary,the act expressly permits epa to approve or disapprove a sip in part.c,k see also ass of irritated residents epa,cir.
the epa rule partially disapproving a regional haze sip which was recently upheld by oklahoma,at,for example,t ook no action on whether oklahoma has satisfied the reasonable progress requirements.under the haze regulations,sips must contain reasonable progress goals,d,as well as bart determinations,id.e of course,the implementation of the bart determinations will ultimately contribute toward meeting the reasonable progress goals.but the act sets out standards for bart that are freestanding,and not dependent on the long term visibility goals identified.epa did not act arbitrarily by considering arizona bart determinations separately from the state reasonable progress analysis.
arizona substantive claims 
turning to the substance of the final rule epa found that the sip overall approach was generally reasonable and consistent with the haze regulations and the guidelines.at.but it concluded that the state bart determinations were deficient in three particular respects.first,arizona control cost calculations were not performed in accordance with the guidelines and were otherwise unreasonable.see id.at.at.second,arizona did not properly evaluate the visibility improvements to all class i areas.see.at.at.and third,arizona inadequately explained its consideration of the bart factors.see.at.at.because of these deficiencies,epa partially disapproved arizona bart determinations,including those pertaining to coronado nox emission controls.
arizona and srp contend that each of epa conclusions is legally flawed and unsupported by the record.consequently,they contend,the agency partial disapproval of the sip was arbitrary and capricious.we disagree.epa conclusions concerning the state bart analysis and determinations were well explicated,carefully grounded in the administrative record,and analytically reasonable,and so properly support its disapproval of arizona nox bart determinations for coronado.
i the sip cost analysis 
as one of the bart factors,states must consider the costs of compliance.g e ii a.states have flexibility in how they calculate costs.haze regulations.at.a state cost calculations are critical to determining a bart control cost effectiveness,where effectiveness is measured in terms of tons of pollutant emissions removed,and cost is measured in terms of annualized control costs.id.at.
after identifying control alternatives and achievable emissions performance levels,states are directed to develop estimates of capital and annual costs.id.at.the basis for equipment cost estimates also should be documented,either with data supplied by an equipment vendor or by a referenced source such as the office of air quality planning and standards control cost manual.id.
the guidelines instruct that the cost manual addresses most control technologies in sufficient detail for a bart analysis,and that cost estimates should be based on the cost manual where possible to maintain and improve consistency.id.states are allowed by the guidelines to include additional information such as any information supplied by vendors that affects your assumptions regarding purchased equipment costs,equipment life,or replacement of major components in their cost calculations,but require them to provide documentation for any element of the calculation that differs from the cost manual.id.finally,the guidelines indicate that t he cost analysis should also take into account any design or other conditions that affect the cost of a particular bart option.guidelines at.
in its proposed rule,epa found certain aspects of arizona cost calculations inconsistent with the guidelines and cost manual and disagree d with the manner in which arizona interpreted the information included in its sip.at.with regard to coronado,specifically,epa noted in its proposed rule that srp provided summaries of total control costs,such as total detail that included line item costs.id.at.this omission meant that srp did not provide arizona with control cost calculations at a level of detail that allowed for a comprehensive review.id.at.as a result,epa explained,it did not believe that arizona was able to evaluate whether srp control costs were reasonable.id.arizona bart analysis was therefore inadequate because it did not properly consider the costs of compliance for each control option.id.
we conclude that epa disapproval of the cost analysis underlying arizona bart determination for coronado on that basis was not arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.a.arizona simply relied on the cost data provided by srp,despite the fact that the data failed to include sufficient detail for the state meaningfully to analyze the reasonableness of the costs of various control alternatives.states are required by statute to consider costs of compliance in making bart determinations.g.when they are not presented with enough data to do so,epa may reasonably conclude that their analysis is inadequate epa decision to do so was not arbitrary or capricious.
ii the sip visibility analysis 
as part of its bart analysis,a state must analyze the degree of improvement in visibility which may reasonably be anticipated to result from the use of alternative control technologies.e ii a.epa found no problems with the technical adequacy of arizona visibility modeling.at.rather,epa found arizona interpretation of the visibility modeling for all three plants problematic.id.the problems,epa contends,resulted in arizona understating the visibility benefits associated with installing scr at coronado.we conclude that epa assessment of arizona visibility analysis considered the appropriate factors rationally,and so defer to its conclusions.see motor vehicle,at.
for coronado,arizona used a visibility index averaging the visibility benefits at the closest nine class i areas,but did not evaluate such benefits separately at the most impacted class i area,the gila wilderness area.at see also.at.epa regulations do not prescribe a particular approach to calculating or considering visibility benefits across multiple class i areas.at states have the flexibility to assess visibility improvements due to bart controls by one or more methods,guidelines at.the indexing approach therefore could be acceptable in itself as part of assessing multiple area impacts and improvements.but,epa concluded,without any consideration of particular area improvements,the averaging process causes especially large benefits at some individual areas to be diluted or lost,effectively discounting some of the more important effects of the controls.id.emphasis added.
moreover,regardless of the methodology used,epa maintains,arizona visibility analysis in its sip was unreasonable because it used two contrasting,yet equally incomplete,approaches to assessing visibility improvements.arizona used a visibility index average to analyze visibility benefits at coronado,but its analyses for apache and cholla considered visibility improvements only at the single class i area with the greatest modeled impact from a facility,rather than at all impacted class i areas.at.that is,the cumulative averaging approach taken by arizona in its analysis for coronado is counter to arizona emphasis elsewhere in the sip on the importance of considering the visibility improvement at the single area having the largest impact from a given facility.id.the upshot is the appearance that the state selectively chose for each plant a methodology that minimized the visibility improvement achieved by the more stringent emission controls at each location.
arizona made no attempt in its sip,nor in its briefing in this appeal,to counter this appearance by explaining why it chose differing approaches to visibility analysis for different facilities.srp may be correct that t he guidelines allow states to use either or both approaches.but,as described above,a state must include in its sip an explanation of the caa factors that led the state to choose that option over other control levels.guidelines at emphasis added.adopting inconsistent indeed,contradictory approaches without providing any explanation for that decision frustrated epa ability to review the substantive content of the bart determination.dakota,at.
arizona also contends that the outcome of its bart determinations would not have changed even if it had adopted the approach to visibility analysis epa prescribed.the visibility improvements resulting from installing scr,the state maintains,would in any event be imperceptible to the human eye.
epa expressly,and reasonably,rejected this argument when it promulgated the haze regulations and guidelines in 
even though the visibility improvement from an individual source may not be perceptible,it should still be considered in setting bart because the contribution to haze may be significant relative to other source contributions in the class i area.thus,we disagree that the degree of improvement should be contingent upon perceptibility.failing to consider contributions to visibility impairment would ignore the caa intent to have bart requirements apply to sources that contribute to,as well as cause,such impairment.
in sum,epa rationally determined that arizona bart visibility analysis for coronado was unsupported by explanation and inconsistent with the caa and its regulations.we defer to its conclusions.
iii the sip choice of bart 
epa guidelines require states to support their bart determinations with documentation for all required analyses,including explanations of their bart analysis.e.further,the guidelines indicate that states should provide a justification for adopting the technology select ed as the best level of control,including an explanation of the act factors that led the state to choose that option over other control levels.guidelines at emphasis added.a state need not perform this analysis if a source already has,or has committed to installing,the most stringent controls available.id.at.otherwise,as epa explained in proposing the rule here at issue,s tates are free to determine the weight and significance assigned to each factor,but must consider all five factors and provide a reasoned explanation for adopting bart.at emphasis added.
in the final rule,epa concluded that,although arizona presented information relevant to each of the bart factors and expressly stated that it had considered those factors,it did not provide an explanation regarding how this information was used to develop its bart determinations.at see also id.at arizona has not demonstrated that it actually took into consideration the bart factors in making its determinations.i t gave no explanation or rationale for how it reached a determination based on that information.more specifically,epa found that arizona did not discuss how the results of the visibility index were weighed against the other bart factors for coronado.id.at.at.further,epa noted that while the sip includes cost data,it provides no explanation regarding how,or even if,th e cost information was used in arriving at its nox bart determinations.at.indeed,i n the case of coronado,the sip does not analyze th e cost information in even a qualitative manner.id.
a review of arizona bart technical support document supports epa analyses with regard to coronado.arizona ultimate determination was that,a fter reviewing the bart analysis provided by the company,and based upon the information above bart control at coronado for nox is low nox burners with ofa with an emission rate of.before announcing that decision,arizona provided several charts of data concerning the various controls and visibility impacts.but,having done so,it provided no reasoning or rationale to justify its ultimate bart selection.there was simply no attempt made to explain why the state chose one control technology over another,or how it evaluated the various bart factors,visibility improvement,energy and quality environmental impacts,existing pollution control technology in use,and the remaining useful life of the source,either individually or in combination.
indeed,arizona does not meaningfully contest epa adverse characterization of its bart analysis.rather,it contends that no great explanation is required to understand the state decision not to spend hundreds of millions of dollars of its citizens money for an imperceptible improvement in visibility.yet,under the act and its implementing regulations,states are required in sips to explain the choice of bart,taking into account not only cost and visibility improvement,but also the three other bart factors.see e ii a guidelines at.
we recently invalidated a fip in part because epa conclusory analysis fail ed to reveal to a reader how epa determined that the cost of controls were not justified.npca,at.the same failure here,albeit by a state in its sip,fares no better.although the act affords states significant discretion in determining the appropriate levels of bart controls,epa must review whether a state determinations comply with the statute and its rules.see dakota,at oklahoma,at.just as we could not in npca review epa analysis absent any coherent agency analysis,epa reasonably determined that it could not meaningfully review arizona parallel determination,because the state did not provide an adequate explanation of its underlying analysis,if any.e ii a guidelines at.
in sum,epa conclusion that arizona did not adequately explain its nox bart determinations provides reasonable support for its partial disapproval of arizona sip.we therefore defer to epa determination.
iv conclusion 
epa reasonably concluded that arizona cost and visibility impact analyses for coronado suffered from significant analytical defects and that the sip did not provide a reasoned explanation of the bases for the ultimate bart determination for coronado.although section affords the states substantial authority to determine bart controls,the combination of these defects provided epa reasonable grounds upon which to disapprove the arizona bart determinations as to nox emissions limits at coronado.its partial disapproval of the sip in this respect was not arbitrary or capricious.
epa promulgation of the fip 
to remedy the deficiencies it identified in its partial disapproval of arizona sip,epa in the same final rule promulgated a fip.as relevant here,epa concluded that selective catalytic reduction with burners and overfire air,the most stringent available control option for nox emissions,was bart for coronado.at.it thus proposed nox emission limits of,based on a rolling boiler operating day average for coronado.id.at.after receiving comments on its proposed rule,epa final rule imposed a fip containing revised nox emission limits of,measured as an average of the two coronado generating units.see.at.this final emission limit is,of course,very significantly more stringent than the nox limit proposed by arizona in its sip.as required by the guidelines,epa explained its general analytical approach and bart determinations at substantial length in the final rule.see id.at.
srp presses a number of substantive challenges to the fip emission limit,as well as to epa analysis underlying that determination.arizona,on the other hand,challenges epa decision to promulgate a fip in the same rule in which it disapproved in part arizona sip.we address these challenges in turn.
the fip bart determinations 
under section and the haze regulations,epa must perform the same bart analysis when promulgating a regional haze fip as that performed by states in developing sips.see b a,g see also e ii a b.challenges to the fip are reviewed under the same arbitrary and capricious standard used to evaluate the epa rejection of the sip.oklahoma,at.but this review requires a slightly different perspective,as we evaluat e the epa own choices under the guidelines,as opposed to evaluating its choice to reject arizona sip under the guidelines.id.emphasis added.
srp contends that epa cost and visibility analyses contained in its fip were arbitrary and capricious.it also maintains that,for a number of reasons,the fip nox emission limits are neither achievable nor reasonable.consequently,it argues,the fip bart determinations for coronado were,on the whole,arbitrary and capricious.for the reasons set forth below,we in the main do not agree,but we leave one issue open because epa is reconsidering it.
epa visibility analysis 
srp first disputes epa cumulative approach.epa estimated the visibility improvements that would occur at each of the class i areas potentially impacted by coronado emissions and then aggregated those improvements.srp contends this analysis resulted in a large deciview number that does not represent the actual perception of visibility conditions at any particular class i area.srp challenge to epa visibility improvement analysis suffers from two substantial defects.
first,epa considered the cumulative visibility improvement resulting from various control technologies a s a supplement to considering deciview improvements at individual class i areas.for coronado,specifically,epa explained that modeling showed that scr control technology would result in visibility benefits at each of eleven class i the gila wilderness area,which epa faulted arizona for failing to consider as well as on a cumulative basis.see.at tbl.in response to petitioners comments critiquing epa cumulative approach,epa explained in the final rule that t he approach is simply one way of assessing improvements at multiple areas,for consideration along with other visibility metrics.at.srp claim that epa focused on this cumulative methodology almost exclusively is simply not supported by the record.
second,srp insistence on human perception as the determinative cornerstone for the bart determinations for each individual source is overstated.as discussed above,when promulgating the bart guidelines,epa explicitly disagreed that the degree of improvement should be contingent upon perceptibility when determining bart for an individual source.at.
epa final rule provided a fully adequate explanation of its application of the deciview concept in the fip.again,one deciview is the minimum visibility difference people can perceive.see guidelines at.the guidelines suggest that states use a minimum threshold of deciviews to determine whether a source is subject to bart controls.epa explained in its final rule,however,that s maller improvements from controls should be considered in bart determinations,since they can be beneficial in considering effects from controls on multiple sources.at emphasis added.
in conclusion,epa visibility improvement assessment was consistent with the statute and regulatory requirements,and supported by the record.
epa cost analysis 
srp also challenges epa cost analysis,arguing that it diverged from the guidelines and was inadequate to support its bart determinations for nox emissions.additionally,srp argues that epa cost assessment was flawed because epa insisted on rigid adherence to the cost manual irrespective of costs.
epa explains that it used the air pollution control cost development component of the integrated planning model ipm to develop its cost estimates.see.at.ipm,a model of the united states electric power sector,relies upon a very large number of data inputs and provides forecasts of costs and other variables relevant to decisionmaking in that sector.id.srp maintains that by using ipm cost estimates,epa ignored the coronado facility characteristics,and so understated the actual costs of compliance for installing controls at coronado.
in the final rule,however,epa explained that it did not rely on ipm as a whole,but rather on one component of ipm,specifically,the component that develops the costs of air pollution control technologies.id.as epa explained,that cost development methodology was not generic or generalized.id.rather,it was grounded in databases of actual scr projects from,and.id.at the same time,epa recognized that a costly engineering evaluation that included site visits would potentially produce a more refined cost estimate that could be considered more than our own.id.
in addition,in response to petitioners public comments contending that epa failed to consider information,epa conducted supplemental cost analyses that relied upon cost estimates provided by srp.see id.at.based on this supplemental cost analysis,epa concluded that the values of scr are not for coronado.id.at.
not satisfied,srp contends that in its supplemental analysis,epa excluded costs it deemed inconsistent with the cost manual such as allowance for funds utilized during construction afudc this argument restates petitioners objections to epa reliance on the overnight costing methodology when it partially disapproved arizona sip.see supra note.epa use of such a methodology in its own fip cost analysis is,without doubt,reasonable.see.at.
in rejecting arizona sip,epa explained that the use of the overnight method was crucial to its ability to assess the reasonableness of the costs of compliance.id.the agency went on 
a proper evaluation of allows for a reasoned comparison not only of different control options for a given facility,but also of the relative costs of controls for similar facilities.if the of a control technology for a particular facility is outside the range for other similar facilities,the control technology may be rejected as not without an comparison of costs,it is impossible to draw rational conclusions about the reasonableness of the costs of compliance for particular control options.use of the cost manual methodology is intended to allow a fair comparison of pollution control costs between similar applications for regulatory purposes.
id.epa concluded that it is reasonable for us to insist that the cost manual methodology be observed in the cost estimate process.id.accordingly,it rejected comments that items like afudc should have been incorporated into its cost analysis,as they were inconsistent with the cost manual methodology.id.at.
epa analysis is reasonable.the purpose of the cost analysis required as part of a bart determination is to foster comparison of the cost of the visibility improvements enabled by various control technologies.as epa comments indicate,comparisons of similar sources with regard to the of a given control option aid in determining at a specific source.control options are likely to impact similar sources similarly comparisons assure that the cost and benefit figures used for a particular site are realistic,rather than inflated in one direction or another.consideration of afudc would not further this inquiry,as afudc is ultimately reflective of the implementing entity financial and logistical situations,grounded in past decisions and in the company financial policies and attitudes,not of the hard costs of the equipment and construction,which should be consistent across sites.while afudc and similar concepts are relevant for sales and ratemaking,including them would undermine the sort of comparison that epa asserts is necessary as part but only part of assessing the control options.
this approach is consonant with the guidelines,which specifically advise that reasonable range s for cost effectiveness are those that are consistent with the range of cost effectiveness values used in other similar permit decisions over a period of time.guidelines at see also oklahoma,at the guidelines say that states should follow the manual methodology so that projects can be more easily compared.moreover,adopting a costing methodology which focuses on achieving consistency and facilitating comparisons aligns with the caa itself,which empowers epa to promulgate national regulations concerning bart determinations.see a,b.
accordingly,we reject srp argument that the fip underlying cost analysis was arbitrary and capricious.
achievability of the fip nox emission limits for coronado 
the haze regulations provide that the bart determination must be based on an analysis of the best system of continuous emission control technology available and associated emission reductions achievable for each source that is subject to bart.e ii a emphasis added.the reviewing authority should take into account the most stringent emission control level that the technology is capable of achieving,by considering recent regulatory decisions and performance data,manufacturer data,engineering estimates and the experience of other sources.guidelines at.
srp argues that the fip nox emission limit for coronado averaged across the facility is not achievable.more specifically,it argues that the emission limits are technically infeasible and epa did not take into account the consent decree binding coronado unit when formulating the emission limits.
both of these arguments will be rendered moot if epa recent action proposing to revise the fip nox emission limit for coronado results in a final
