ies industries,appeals from the order of the district court granting the united states summary judgment on ies claim for tax refunds to which ies contends it is entitled as a result of securities trades that the court held to be sham transactions.the united states cross appeals,challenging the district court decision granting summary judgment to ies on its second claim for a tax refund,that ies is entitled to deduct fifteen years worth of environmental cleanup cost assessments in the tax year in which the amount of the liability was determined.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
ies appeal 
we review de novo a district court decision to grant summary judgment,and will affirm if the record shows no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.land washington county,cir.the material facts are undisputed the question of law before us is t he general characterization of a transaction for tax purposes.frank lyon united states,d.before we discuss the legal question,we first set out in some detail the facts leading to ies claim for a tax refund,drawing heavily on the parties very helpful stipulation of facts.
the transactions at issue involved american depository receipts,or adrs.adrs are publicly traded securities,or receipts,fully negotiable in dollars,that represent shares of a foreign corporation held in trust by a bank.the owner of an adr is entitled to all dividends and capital gains associated with the adr,with those moneys taxable in the home country of the foreign corporation.
before a dividend is paid on an adr,the corporation issuing the stock will declare the amount to be paid,the record date,and the payment date.the owner of the adr as of the close of business on the record date will be paid the dividend.the payment date for the dividend ordinarily is several weeks or more after the record date.when a dividend is paid,tax is withheld,usually by the foreign corporation,before the funds are transferred to the united states.in this case,the adr dividends were paid by corporations in the united kingdom,the netherlands,and norway.under the terms of tax treaties between those countries and the united states,the withholding rate on adr dividends paid to citizens is.thus the record owner of the adr would receive of the dividend in cash,but the gross of the be fully taxable in the united states.in these circumstances,the record owner is entitled to a foreign tax credit,a credit against taxes owed.
in,securities corporation,a securities broker in new york,proposed adr trading opportunities to ies,an electric utility company in iowa.after some initial investigation,ies decided to sign on.the trades worked as follows.
was responsible for identifying and locating adrs whose companies had announced dividends.ies purchased adrs with a settlement date,or effective trade date,before the record date for the dividend,so that ies was the owner on the record date and therefore entitled to be paid the dividend.ies then promptly sold the adrs,with a settlement date after the record date.the purchase and sale generally took place within hours of each other,and sometimes in amsterdam when the and european markets were closed.
the sellers of the adrs were entities,such as pension funds.but such entities were exempt only from taxes they still were required to pay the foreign tax on any adr dividends collected.because they owed no tax,they could not benefit from the foreign tax credit.before the dividend record date,the holders of the adrs loaned them to a counterparty selected by.the counterparty then sold the adrs short that is,sold borrowed property to ies,which then became the actual owner of the adrs with full right,title,and interest in the adrs.the counterparty bought back the adrs after the dividend accrued to ies.
the purchase price of the securities was equal to market price plus of the adrs expected gross dividends,that is,the same amount the adr lender would have received after foreign tax was withheld had it been the record owner entitled to payment of the dividends.in addition,the lender received a deposit of cash or equivalent collateral,generally of the market value of the adrs on loan.the lender would have that collateral available to invest during the term of the loan of the adrs,thus earning a profit on its loan.ies paid commissions to on the purchases and sales in turn paid the counterparty a fee,generally per trade day.ies sold the adrs back to the lenders at market price.
so,ies purchased adrs with dividend rights attached,or,for more than it sold them,thus incurring capital losses.ies sought to carry back the losses to offset capital gains received when it sold stock in tax years and,and thus to receive a refund of capital gains taxes paid in those years.capital losses could not be used to offset ordinary income,but they could be carried back three years or carried forward five years to offset capital gains.
while generating capital losses on each adr combination,ies nevertheless made a profit because it was entitled to the dividends,which actually exceeded the capital losses.ies retained the dividends,which were ordinary income to the company,paid the foreign tax,and therefore claimed a foreign tax credit in the united states.ies claimed deductions for the commissions it paid.further,ies purchased the adrs on margin and incurred interest expense that it also claimed as a deduction.after,ies did not engage in any additional adr trades.by then,it had offset all of its and capital gains with the capital losses incurred as a result of the adr trades.
thus,for its and taxes,ies 
reported gross dividend income on the adr dividends of nearly million.
claimed a foreign tax credit on the adr dividends for the amount of foreign tax withheld and paid to foreign governments,over million.
recognized capital losses from the adr purchases and sales and sought to carry back more than million to offset capital gains earned in and.an additional in capital losses offset capital gains earned in.
i ncluded the commissions it paid to purchase adrs in its basis,and deducted the commissions paid to sell adrs from the amount realized.brief of appellant ies at.
deducted over million in interest expense incurred in purchasing the adrs on margin.
the internal revenue service irs audited ies tax returns for and and disallowed the claimed capital losses and the concomitant and capital loss carrybacks.the irs further disallowed the foreign tax credit and eliminated the reported dividend income.deductions for interest expenses,commissions,and of the foreign income tax paid on the adr transactions were allowed 
ies sought a refund of over million,plus interest.the government rejected the claim and ies filed suit in the district court.the court granted the government motion for summary judgment,concluding that the transactions were shaped solely by tax avoidance considerations,had no other practical economic effect,and are properly disregarded for tax purposes.order of,at.ies appeals and we reverse.
the district court viewed t he question presented as whether these transactions are a sham and therefore to be disregarded for tax purposes.id.at.in determining whether a transaction is a sham for tax purposes,the eighth circuit has applied a test set forth in rice toyota world,commissioner,cir,which the fourth circuit ostensibly found in the supreme court opinion in frank lyon.see shriver comm r,cir.applying that test,a transaction will be characterized as a sham if it is not motivated by any economic purpose outside of tax considerations the business purpose test,and if it is without economic substance because no real potential for profit exists the economic substance test.id.at.the shriver court analyzed the transaction at issue in that case under both parts of the test,but then said in dictum,w e do not read frank lyon to say anything that mandates a analysis.id.at.the court suggested that a failure to demonstrate either economic substance or business not result in the conclusion that the transaction in question was a sham for tax purposes.as in shriver,we do not decide whether the rice toyota world test requires a analysis because we conclude that the adr trades here had both economic substance and business purpose.
the district court dealt with the sham transaction issue summarily and did not apply,or even mention,the rice toyota world test iterated in shriver.after a cursory review of the facts and the law,the court simply concluded that the only change in ies economic position as a result of the adr transactions was the transfer of the claim to the foreign tax credit to ies,and therefore that the transactions were shams order of,at.assuming this was an application of the objective economic substance test,we will first consider whether there was a reasonable possibility of profit apart from tax benefits,that is,whether the transactions had economic substance.shriver,at quoting rice toyota world,at.
the government insists that,absent the tax benefits that were the sole reason for the transactions,each series of adr trade pairs resulted,as,in an economic loss.brief of appellee united states at.according to the government view of the transaction,ies purchased only the right to the net the gross dividend.id.at.under that view,economic benefit accrues to ies only if it receives the foreign tax credit.in other words,the government would have us regard only of the dividends as income to ies,notwithstanding that the irs treats as income for tax purposes.
we reject the government argument and agree with ies that the law supports our contrary conclusion the economic benefit to ies was the amount of the gross dividend,before the foreign taxes were paid.ies was the legal owner of the adrs on the record date.as such,it was legally entitled to retain the benefits of ownership,that is,the dividends due on the record date.while it received only in cash,of the amount of the dividends was income to ies.i ncome may be realized by a variety of indirect means.diedrich comm r,d analyzing,and ultimately agreeing with,irs position that payment of gift tax by donee,which was obligation of donor,constituted income to donor.in this case,income was realized by the payment of ies foreign tax obligation by a third party.the fact that the taxes were withheld,and then paid,by the foreign corporation that issued the stock represented by the adrs,so that ies received only of the dividend in cash,is of no consequence to ies liability for the tax.the discharge by a third person of an obligation to him is equivalent to receipt by the person taxed.id.quoting old colony trust comm r.the foreign corporation withholding and payment of the tax on ies behalf is no different from an employer withholding and paying to the government income taxes for an employee the full amount before taxes are paid is considered income to the employee.see id.because the entire amount of the adr dividends was income to ies,the adr transactions resulted in a profit,an economic benefit to ies.
as for the business purpose test,the shriver court explained that the proper inquiry is whether the taxpayer was induced to commit capital for reasons only relating to tax considerations or whether a motive,or legitimate profit motive,was involved.shriver,at.in other words,the business purpose test is a subjective economic substance test.the shriver court considered the district court subjective analysis of the taxpayer intent and the court review of such factors as the depth and accuracy of the taxpayer investigation into the investment.id.to the extent the taxpayer subjective intent is material,we too will consider factors that are arguably relevant to the inquiry.we do so,however,mindful of the fact that t he legal right of a taxpayer to decrease the amount of what otherwise would be his taxes,or altogether avoid them,by means which the law permits,can not be doubted.gregory helvering.a taxpayer subjective intent to avoid taxes thus will not by itself determine whether there was a business purpose to a transaction.
in their briefs,both parties discuss the risk of loss inherent in the trades,evidently presuming that the degree of risk goes to ies subjective intent in engaging in the transactions.the government argues that the transactions must be characterized as shams because there was no risk of loss.we disagree.the risk may have been minimal,but that was in part because ies did its homework before engaging in the transactions.company officials met twice with representatives and studied the materials provided.after that,ies consulted its outside accountants and its securities counsel for reassurances about the legality of the transactions and their tax consequences.compaq computer comm r,wl concluding no business purpose existed where taxpayer evaluation of the proposed transaction was less than businesslike with taxpayer assistant treasurer committing taxpayer to this transaction based on one meeting with and on his call to a reference.as the entity legally entitled to receive the adr dividends,being the legal owner on the record date,ies likewise bore the risk that the dividend would not be paid.in consideration of that risk and after doing its own investigation,ies rejected some of the adr trades that proposed.id.at noting that taxpayer did no investigation or analysis of risks of adr trades.ies did make some of the trades when the markets were closed,in order to avoid the risk of fluctuations in market price of the adrs between the purchase and sale and to prevent a third party from attempting to break up the trades,again demonstrating the exercise of good business judgment.we are not prepared to say that a transaction should be tagged a sham for tax purposes merely because it does not involve excessive risk.ies disinclination to accept any more risk than necessary in these circumstances strikes us as an exercise of good business judgment consistent with a subjective intent to treat the adr trades as transactions.
it also is important to note that these were not transactions conducted by of ies or straw entities created by ies simply for the purpose of conducting adr trades.see frank lyon,at.all of the parties foreign corporations,the trusts issuing the adrs,the adr owners,other brokers involved,the entities separate and apart from ies,doing legitimate business before ies started trading adrs and as far as we know continuing such legitimate business after that time.see united states consumer life ins,d goldstein comm r,cir,cert.denied,d.t he transaction s must be viewed as a whole,and each step,from the commencement of negotiations to the consummation of the sale,is relevant.comm r court holding.each trade was an arm length transaction what was actually done is what the parties to the transaction purported to do.gran irs in re gran,cir citations to quoted cases omitted.the fact that ies took advantage of duly enacted tax laws in conducting the adr trades does not convert the transactions into shams for tax purposes 
we hold,considering all the facts and circumstances of this case,that the adr trades in which ies engaged did not,as a matter of law,lack business purpose or economic substance.accordingly,ies is entitled to summary judgment on its claim for a tax refund.the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court for further action consistent with this opinion.
ii.the government cross appeal 
at all times relevant to the government cross appeal,ies was a owner of a nuclear power plant in iowa.during this period,the government was the exclusive provider of services required to fuel such plants.the services were purchased either directly from the united states department of energy doe or on a secondary market where utilities that had purchased the services from the doe resold them to others.between and,ies purchased most of the required services from the doe but did buy some from secondary sources.
in,congress enacted the energy policy act of,stat.epact.among other things,epact establishes a fund for the decontamination and decommissioning of plants.the million in annual deposits to the fund are to come largely from congressional appropriations,but up to million annually adjusted for inflation is to be collected for fifteen years through,or until billion,adjusted for inflation,is deposited
