the valley community preservation commission and three individual plaintiffs plaintiffs appeal the district court denial of their motion for preliminary injunction and injunction pending appeal challenging the federal highway administration fhwa approval of plans to reconstruct a mile segment of highway in southeast new mexico.the plaintiffs argue that the fhwa violated section f of the department of transportation act,c,by failing to conduct the necessary reviews and investigations to determine whether the project will entail a use of historic properties protected under section f prior to approving the project for construction.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to a and affirm.
as plaintiffs seek an injunction,we review the district court denial of relief for abuse of discretion,considering the standard for injunctive relief.we begin by summarizing the rather distended factual situation in this case.next,we provide some background on the relevant statutes and regulations and the standard of review.finally,we address the four preliminary injunction factors,giving particular emphasis to the likelihood of success on the merits.
factual background 
highway runs though new mexico from the southern portion of the mexico state line to the near new state line.the mile segment of at the center of this litigation connects ruidoso downs and riverside in the hondo river valley.this stretch of highway has been designated the billy the kid national scenic byway by the fhwa and is known for its rich historic associations and its exceptionally striking scenery,including historic homesteads,rural landscapes,roadside fruit stands,and a network of acequias historic irrigation ditches that are an integral part of the area history and culture.aplts br.at.unfortunately,this stretch of is also known for its alarmingly high accident rate prior to the current expansion project,the new mexico state highway and transportation department nmshtd reported that this portion of highway had an accident rate twice the state average for rural undivided highways and a fatality rate more than double the national average.aples.vol.ii,at final environmental impact statement.
in,the nmshtd prepared a report entitled initial corridor study report,which considered a number of alternatives to alleviate traffic problems and improve highway safety on.the nmshtd recommendations included a proposal to expand the mile segment of between ruidoso downs and riverside,known as the hondo valley project.
the fhwa first addressed the potential impact of the hondo valley project on historic and cultural resources in a draft environmental impact statement eis,published on may.the draft eis considered three alternatives to improve highway safety on a alternative an enhanced alternative with the addition of passing lanes,the addition of acceleration and deceleration lanes at major driveways,the addition of center turn lanes,and the addition of continuous,shoulders,aples.vol.i,at and a alternative in which the existing highway would be reconstructed as a continuous highway.proposals to through the creation of alternative routes were eliminated from further consideration after the fhwa determined that the development of alternative routes would not substantially reduce the safety problems with the existing alignment of.id.at.
initial investigations established that the project would impact portions of eighteen acequias,seventeen archeological sites,and fifteen buildings.the draft eis recommended additional investigations for six of the archeological sites,but did not recommend further investigations of any of the buildings or acequias,concluding that the identified buildings are either not sufficiently old to be considered eligible for the national register of historic places,or they do not maintain sufficient integrity to convey their historic significance and are therefore not eligible.id.at.the draft eis also concluded that individual functioning acequias are not eligible for inclusion on the national register as historic properties,id.at,and that the project will retain the integrity of the rio hondo system,id.at,thus alleviating any section f concerns related to the acequias.
following the publication of the draft eis,the parsons brinckerhoff archeology group prepared a cultural resources survey of the corridor between ruidoso downs and riverside at the request of the fhwa.the survey included an account of the properties in the corridor,whether each was potentially eligible for the national register,and whether each would be affected by the hondo valley project.the survey did not uncover any potentially eligible properties that would be affected by the project.the fhwa sought comments from the new mexico state historic preservation office shpo regarding the determinations in the cultural resources survey.based on the survey and consultations with the shpo,the fhwa issued a supplemental draft eis on november.the supplemental draft eis evaluated seventeen buildings,structures,and landscapes that either are or may be eligible for the national register and concluded that none would be affected by the project.the fhwa solicited additional comments from the shpo and other agencies following the publication of the supplemental draft eis,and parsons brinckerhoff prepared a supplemental cultural resources survey.the findings of that survey were included in the final eis,issued by the fhwa on january.
the final eis concluded that the hondo valley project would not affect any section f protected properties or resources.the fhwa published this final determination in a record of decision rod on march,and the shpo concurred in the fhwa finding that no f protected properties would be used by the construction project.the rod approved alternative,the alternative,for construction,despite acknowledging that the enhanced alternative was the option,b ecause of the greater safety benefits of alternative and consistency with adopted state policy to provide four lanes on.aplts app.vol.ii,at rod.
the fhwa also voluntarily committed in the rod to develop ing a programmatic agreement with shpo,the national trust,and other groups interested in being a consulting party with respect to implementation of the project.id.at.the fhwa,the nmshtd,the advisory council on historic preservation and the new mexico shpo signed a programmatic agreement on july,concurring parties included the national trust for historic preservation,the new mexico heritage preservation alliance,the mescalero apache tribe,and anne episcopal church.the valley community preservation commission and gerald ford,both plaintiffs in this case,were given the opportunity to participate in the programmatic agreement as concurring parties,but declined to do so.
on september,plaintiffs applied for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in the united states district court for the district of columbia to halt construction on the hondo valley project.they argued that the widening of the highway will require massive cuts into the slopes and huge fill slopes supported by retaining walls and that a s a result,the project will have unavoidable adverse impacts on historic properties.aplts br.at.furthermore,plaintiffs alleged that the fhwa violated section f of the department of transportation act,by failing to undertake investigations necessary to identify the project foreseeable impacts to historic properties prior to the issuance of the record of decision approving the project for construction.id.at.the district court for the district of columbia refused to enter a tro and granted the fhwa motion to transfer the case to the district of new mexico.see valley cmty.comm mineta,d valley cmty.i.the district court for the district of new mexico denied the plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction and injunction pending appeal,adopting and supplementing the opinion of the district court and finding that plaintiffs did not have a likelihood of success on the merits.see valley cmty.comm mineta,d valley cmty.ii.construction on the hondo valley project has been ongoing since september.
ii.legal background 
standard of.preliminary injunction 
the standard of review in this case is somewhat bifurcated.first,we review district court denial of a motion for preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.davis mineta,cir.a district court abuses its discretion where it commits a legal error or relies on clearly erroneous factual findings,or where there is no rational basis in the evidence for its ruling.id.at internal citations omitted.
in order to receive a preliminary injunction,a plaintiff must establish the following four factors 
a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the case irreparable injury to the movant if the preliminary injunction is denied the threatened injury to the movant outweighs the injury to the other party under the preliminary injunction and the injunction is not adverse to the public interest.
kikumura hurley,cir.if a plaintiff establishes that the latter three factors tip strongly in his or her favor,the likelihood of success inquiry is modified somewhat,and the plaintiff may establish likelihood of success by showing that questions going to the merits are so serious,substantial,difficult,and doubtful as to make the issue ripe for litigation and deserving of more deliberate investigation.greater yellowstone coalition flowers,cir.because a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy,the right to relief must be clear and unequivocal.id.
administrative procedure act 
in analyzing the plaintiffs likelihood of success on the merits,we must examine the fhwa compliance with section f.at this point,a second layer of review comes into play,because defendants agency actions are themselves examined under a highly deferential,arbitrary and capricious standard.davis,at.
as section f does not provide an independent cause of action,judicial review is available only through administrative procedure act,which provides that agency action must be set aside if the action was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law or if the action failed to meet statutory,procedural,or constitutional requirements.citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d citing a,b,c,d,supp.v.as we have noted,overton park instructed reviewing courts to conduct a inquiry of the secretary of transportation decision to fund a highway across land covered by f.comm.to boomer lake park dep t of,cir.this inquiry involves determining whether the secretary acted within the scope of his authority under f whether the secretary ultimate decision was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law,and whether the secretary action followed the necessary procedural requirements.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
section f and section 
all federally funded highway projects must comply with a number of federal environmental protection and historic preservation laws,including section of the national historic preservation act,section f of the department of transportation act of,c and the national environmental policy act,c.although plaintiffs originally alleged violations of both the national environmental policy act and section f of the department of transportation act,this appeal challenges only the fhwa compliance with section f.section f provides,in relevant part,that 
t he secretary may approve a transportation program or project other than any project for a park road or parkway under section of title requiring the use of publicly owned land of a public park,recreation area,or wildlife and waterfowl refuge of national,state,or local significance,or land of an historic site of national,state,or local significance as determined by the federal,state,or local officials having jurisdiction over the park,area,refuge,or site only if 
there is no prudent and feasible alternative to using that land and 
the program or project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the park,recreation area,wildlife and waterfowl refuge,or historic site resulting from the use.
section f restrictions apply anytime a proposed highway construction project entails a use of a section f protected property.a use of a protected property may be direct w hen land is permanently incorporated into a transportation facility or constructive when the transportation project does not incorporate land from a section f resource,but the project proximity impacts are so severe that the protected activities,features,or attributes that qualify a resource for protection under section f are substantially impaired.p i,p.
the procedure for determining what sites merit protection under section f is set forth in fhwa regulations at.pursuant to these regulations,a structure qualifies for section f protection if it is either on or eligible for the national register of historic places.id.e.the section f evaluation must be conducted during the planning process,and in any event,the final section f determination must be presented in the final eis or the rod.see id.b any use of lands from a section f property shall be evaluated early in the development of the action when alternatives to the proposed action are under study.l for actions processed with eiss,the administration will make the section f approval either in its approval of the final eis or in the rod.
in order to determine what sites merit protection under section f,the fhwa relies in large part on reviews conducted pursuant to section of the national historic preservation act.section provides a process through which affected historic sites are identified,while section f limits the circumstances in which the sites identified through the section review process can be used.therefore,although plaintiffs expressly challenge only the fhwa compliance with section f,section is also relevant to this litigation.see city of alexandria slater,w e have observed that compliance with section f is predicated upon completion of the section process.
section of the national historic preservation act provides that before a federal agency may authorize the expenditure of funds for a federal or federally assisted undertaking,it must first consider the effects of such an undertaking on any district,site,building,structure,or object that is included or eligible for inclusion in the national register of historic places.
corridor h alternatives,slater,quoting.this consideration involves identifying all historic properties within a designated area of potential effects for the project in consultation with the shpo.the area of potential effects is the geographic area or areas within which an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause alterations in the character or use of historic properties,if any such properties exist.d.unlike section f,section is essentially a procedural statute and does not impose a substantive mandate on the fhwa.see city of alexandria,at.
iii.discussion 
we now turn to the four preliminary injunction factors.because the appropriate standard for evaluating the plaintiffs likelihood of success on the merits depends on whether the other three factors are satisfied,we look first to the three equitable or harm factors the harm that the plaintiffs will suffer if the injunction is denied the balancing of the harm that the fhwa will suffer if the injunction is granted and the harm to the public interest.we then address the plaintiffs likelihood of success on the merits.
harm to plaintiffs,balancing of harm to defendants,and public interest 
plaintiffs contend that the district court never addressed the remaining equitable factors bearing on the issuance of injunctive relief.aplts br.at.however,while the district court did address the plaintiffs likelihood of success on the merits in greater detail than the other three factors,it nevertheless concluded that plaintiffs have met none of the requirements for a preliminary injunction.valley cmty.ii,d at.we now examine the equitable factors and hold that while the plaintiffs may suffer some harm as a result of the denial of the injunction,the district court correctly concluded that the balance of harms and the public interest weigh in favor of the fhwa.
harm to plaintiffs 
the substantive harm contemplated by f is the actual harm to parkland or historic sites that will occur if the secretary of transportation does not consider every prudent and feasible alternative to using the land,and make all possible plans to minimize the harm,if use is required.davis,at.environmental harm is,by its nature,generally irreparable.id.an individual plaintiff can establish that he or she will suffer harm from a construction project by demonstrating adequate proximity to and use of the land in question.id.the plaintiffs have certainly established adequate proximity in this case.plaintiffs live in the area and use the land in question in fact,many of the historic acequias at issue in this case are actually located on land owned by the plaintiffs.any damage to the land or structures along as a result of the project is likely to cause the plaintiffs irreparable harm.moreover,even assuming that the fhwa determination that the project will not use any protected properties is correct,the plaintiffs enjoyment of their land will undoubtedly suffer somewhat as a result of the greater proximity of a major highway.
balancing of harm to defendants 
the fhwa has already invested a substantial amount of money in this construction project.over million was invested between august,and february.according to a declaration by the nmshtd design compliance engineer for the hondo valley project,a suspension of construction would cost per day,or per month.a permanent termination of the project would cost,including demobilization and costs.given these figures,it is clear that the fhwa will suffer significant financial harm if the injunction is granted.
while these costs can not be ignored,financial concerns alone generally do not outweigh environmental harm.see citizens to preserve overton park,at.congress clearly did not intend that cost and disruption of the community were to be ignored by the secretary.but the very existence of the statutes,section f indicates that protection of parkland was to be given paramount importance.we have previously accorded less weight to financial harms relative to environmental harms when the financial harms are.see davis,at noting that it appears that many of these costs of delay may be because the state entities involved in this case have jumped the gun on the environmental issues by entering into contractual obligations that anticipated a pro forma result.
whether the financial harm the fhwa will suffer if the injunction is granted outweighs the harm the plaintiffs will suffer if it is not seems to turn on the merits of the case.if the fhwa did not comply with section f,but rather jumped the gun and began construction before completing the necessary environmental reviews,then the environmental harm faced by the plaintiffs may outweigh the fhwa financial harm.if the fhwa complied with all relevant environmental laws and correctly determined that the project will not use a section f protected property,then the balancing of harms weighs in favor of the defendants.the plaintiffs have not,therefore,established that the balancing of the harms tips strongly in their favor.
public interest 
there are conflicting public interest values at play in this case.on the one hand,the public interest is served by safer highways and increased economic development.on the other hand,the public interest is served by strict compliance with environmental laws and the preservation of historic and cultural resources.in davis mineta,we held that the public interest associated with completion of the project must yield to the obligation to construct the project in compliance with the relevant environmental laws.at.however,in that case,the proposed highway construction ha d not yet begun,and so we we re not confronted with equities in favor of completion of a project.id.in this case,we are dealing with a project,and as such,the public interest in favor of continuing the project is much stronger.this litigation also involves a stretch of road with an exceedingly high accident rate.the important public interest in safety on the roads and highways,dixon love,d,therefore weighs in favor of completing the construction project.
likelihood of success on the merits 
as the plaintiffs have failed to show that each of the three equitable requirements for a preliminary injunction tips strongly in their favor,we now proceed to review the likelihood of success on the merits.turning to the merits of the case,we must consider plaintiffs argument that the fhwa acted arbitrarily and capriciously in reaching the determination that the hondo valley project would not use any section f protected properties.specifically,they contend that the fhwa failed to undertake the requisite studies needed to identify and evaluate all protected properties prior to issuing the rod and the fhwa employed an inadequate area of potential effects when conducting its studies.these two inquiries are closely related,as the plaintiffs argument concerning the unlawful deferral of the section f determination rests on the proposition that the section reviews conducted prior to the publication of the rod failed to comply with section f because the area of potential effects was too narrowly drawn.
failure to undertake the requisite studies needed to identify and evaluate f protected properties prior to issuing the rod 
section f regulations clearly require the fhwa to make the requisite section f evaluations prior to issuing an rod approving a proposed construction project and to present these determinations in the final eis or the rod.see b,l.the threshold question in this case is,therefore,whether the fhwa conducted adequate reviews of the cultural resources and historic properties along the corridor prior to determining in the rod that the hondo valley project would not use any f protected properties.
the plaintiffs argue that much of the required evaluation was unlawfully deferred until after the rod.in making this argument,they rely on the fact that the consultations surrounding the programmatic agreement produced a list of properties potentially eligible for the national register that were not fully evaluated prior to the issuance of the rod.these properties were apparently not evaluated during the earlier stages of the project because they were outside the area of potential effects used during the section review process.as further support,the plaintiffs reference a letter sent to the fhwa by the advisory council on historic preservation suggesting that the fhwa no effect determination was in error.
city of alexandria and corridor h 
in considering the plaintiffs argument that the fhwa unlawfully deferred the required evaluations of f protected properties,the parties and both the and new mexico district courts place a significant amount of emphasis on two cases from the district of columbia circuit addressing the timing of section f h alternatives,slater,and city of alexandria slater.corridor h concerned a plan to build a new segment of highway in west virginia.the fhwa issued an rod prior to conducting the requisite section reviews to identify historic sites potentially impacted by the project.the court held that the fhwa had failed to comply with section f by deferring these reviews until after the issuance of the rod,despite the fact that the rod stated that approval of the project was contingent upon successful completion of the section review process.id.at.
city of alexandria,decided after corridor h,addressed a challenge to the fhwa approval of plans to replace the woodrow wilson memorial bridge.in contrast of corridor h,city of alexandria held that the fhwa had complied with section f because it identified historic properties along the corridor and documented its findings prior to approval in both a memorandum of agreement and a section f evaluation.at.the fact that the fhwa deferred the identification of sites that might be impacted by a small number of ancillary activities was not sufficient to establish a section f violation.id.
we agree with the holding of both district courts that this case is analogous to city of alexandria and factually distinguishable from corridor see valley cmty.ii,d at valley cmty.i,d at noting that t he agency actions in this case are more akin to city of alexandria than co
