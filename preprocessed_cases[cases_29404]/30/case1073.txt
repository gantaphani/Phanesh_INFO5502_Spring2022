this appeal involves another aspect of the many disputes over rights to water from the newlands reclamation project the project in western nevada.appellants united states and pyramid lake paiute tribe of indians the tribe appeal the district court order affirming a ruling by the water master to reclassify farm land located in the project from bottom land to bench land for water allocation purposes.although the appellants raise several procedural issues,the heart of their challenge to the district court order centers on the legal standard adopted by the court in when it authorized the water master to reclassify project farm land from bottom to bench on the basis of a reduction in crop yield.we reject the procedural challenges to the water master ruling,but conclude that the district court adopted an incorrect legal standard for evaluating a petition to reclassify project land.as we explain,the water master may approve a reclassification petition only when there has been a reasonably significant loss in crop yield.to apply the standard adopted by the district court would disregard the principles of beneficial use that must apply to the use of water from the project.accordingly,we reverse the district court order and remand for further proceedings.
background 
the pyramid lake paiute tribe of indians and the united states collectively appellants appeal the district court order that affirmed the water master reclassification of a farm near fallon,nevada from bottom land to bench land.this reclassification entitled the farm owners,the clifford matley family trust and the david matley and christine matley family trust the matleys,to an additional per acre of water each year from the water supply.appellants contend that the district court judgment must be reversed because the water master conducted the proceedings on the matleys reclassification petition without following the procedures contemplated by the federal rules of civil procedure or the federal rules of evidence,and applied an incorrect legal standard in ruling on the petition.in order to provide some context for the parties claims,we briefly review the history and development of the classification scheme.
in,congress passed the reclamation act,pub,stat,which directed the secretary of the interior to withdraw from public entry arid lands in specified western states,reclaim the lands through irrigation projects,and then to restore the lands to entry pursuant to the homestead laws and certain conditions imposed by the act itself.nevada united states,d.the department of the interior the doi ultimately withdrew approximately acres in western nevada from the public domain to create the newlands reclamation project,and relied on water from both the truckee and carson rivers to irrigate this land.id.
because of competing demands for water from the truckee and carson rivers and disputes over who owned the rights to project water,years of litigation ensued,ultimately resulting in the and orr ditch decrees these judicial decrees adopted basic guidelines for allocating water rights in the river system,classifying project land as either bench or bottom.united states alpine land reservoir,cir.bench lands have soils than bottom lands,and are thus entitled to a maximum water of acre feet per afa,while bottom lands receive a maximum of afa.id.the decrees did not,however,specify or describe any method for applying these classification schemes to project lands.
in,the doi formulated and eventually adopted a classification scheme,based primarily on soil characteristics such as the available water holding capacity of the first feet of soil and the seasonal high water table shwt,which it mapped from soil surveys.the doi stated goal in promulgating this scheme and classifying each parcel was to allocate the river system water more efficiently,thereby enhancing the region agricultural productivity,while simultaneously providing more water for other uses.
the irrigation district the tcid,representing owners of land within the project,including the matleys,challenged that scheme in district court,offering a competing classification scheme based in large part on past allocations.historically,and under the tcid proposed scheme,the matleys received afa for their alfalfa farm.under the doi plan,the matleys land was classified as bottom land,entitling them to only afa.the district court ruled in favor of tcid,in what amounted to a de novo review of doi classifications,at.we reversed that ruling,holding that the reclamation act authorized the doi to promulgate regulations establishing initial classifications,provided that the state law beneficial use standards mandated by section of the reclamation act were followed.id.at.accordingly,we concluded that the district court review was limited to determining whether the doi had acted arbitrarily or capriciously in adopting its proposed classification scheme.id.
on remand,the district court upheld the doi criteria and classification maps.the court also ordered the water master to administer the allocation of water under that scheme and to immediately and carefully consider data collected by the water users in cooperation with agencies of the united states to determine if reclassification is necessary to maintain the integrity of current crop yields.united states alpine land reservoir,no,the order.significantly,the district court concluded that t o the extent there may be a reduction in crop yield which can be attributed to the reclassification from bench to bottom land,then the federal water master is authorized to take such action as is appropriate to reclassify the lands from bottom land to bench land.id.the district court,however,did not specify what procedures the water master was to follow or the standards to apply when considering reclassification petitions.
in response to the order,the water master developed procedures and policy for the resolution of disputes regarding the designation of lands within the newlands project protocol,which created three methods by which a landowner could seek reclassification of his land.first,a landowner could demonstrate that,on the basis of doi own criteria,the new classification was incorrect.alternatively,a landowner could demonstrate that the doi measurements of the available capacity in the top five feet of soil and the seasonal high water table shwt were inaccurate,and that correct measurements supported reclassification.finally,a landowner could demonstrate that the doi classification and resulting decrease in water allocation had caused a decrease in crop yield.in late august,the matleys sought reclassification under this third method,alleging that the doi classification of their farm as bottom land had caused a reduction in their crop yield.
upon receipt of the matleys petition,the water master provided the united states bureau of reclamation and the natural resources conservation service with copies of the petition.however,neither the water master nor the matleys notified the tribe or counsel for the united states that the matleys had filed a reclassification petition.after obtaining a response from the federal agencies and additional information from the matleys,the water master,without conducting a hearing,issued a report approving the matleys petition.the tribe and counsel for the united states learned of the matleys reclassification petition only after the water master had issued his initial report.both the tribe and the united states objected to the water master recommendations,and requested an evidentiary hearing in district court.the district court remanded the matleys petition to the water master with instructions to consider the tribe evidence,but authorized the water master to determine whether an evidentiary hearing was necessary.
on remand,the water master received the tribe evidence,but declined to hold an evidentiary hearing.after considering the tribe evidence,the water master issued an amended report restating his original findings and recommending that the matleys reclassification petition be granted.the district court adopted the water master report and approved the reclassification of the matleys farm from bottom to bench land.the united states and the tribe timely appealed the district court ruling.
procedural issues 
appellants first argue that prior to issuing his report,federal rule of civil procedure required the water master to permit discovery and to hold an evidentiary hearing federal rule of civil procedure a provides that t he court in which any action is pending may appoint a special master therein.rule c further states,in pertinent part 
subject to the specifications and limitations stated in the order referring the proceedings to the master,the master has and shall exercise the power to regulate all proceedings in every hearing before the master and to do all acts and take all measures necessary or proper for the efficient performance of the master duties under the order.
c.an order referring a case to a special master is therefore the source and the limit of the master duties and powers.see turner orr,cir.accordingly,we initially consider the district court reference orders in this case to determine whether the water master was bound by the federal rules of civil procedure.
the first orr ditch that a water master shall be appointed by this court to carry out and enforce the provisions of this decree and the instructions and orders of the court,and that a ny person feeling aggrieved by any action or order of the water master may in writing and under oath complain to the court.see orr water ditch,equity no.the orr ditch decree provides no further detail regarding the manner in which the water master is to carry out his duties or whether he is to follow the federal rules of evidence or civil procedure in so doing.the second alpine identical text but further provides that a ll disputes on the carson river system involving the existence or ownership of water rights,the distribution of water or the transportation or measurement of water shall first be submitted to the water master for determination as a jurisdictional prerequisite to any complaint to the court for relief.the alpine decree is silent,however,on whether the water master must adhere to the federal rules of evidence or civil procedure.the third the water master to consider petitions for reclassification,but similarly makes no mention of the procedures the water master must follow.thus,although rule c authorizes the water master to conduct evidentiary hearings,rule upon the admissibility of evidence,and to examine witnesses under oath,the reference orders in this case do not mandate that he do so.
as the text of the rule indicates,rule grants special masters broad authority to regulate all proceedings in every hearing and to do all acts and take all measures necessary or proper for the efficient performance of their duties.c.indeed,the only procedural requirement that rule appears to place on a special master is that,when the master determines that a hearing is necessary,the master shall make a record of the evidence offered and excluded in the same manner and subject to the same limitations as provided in the federal rules of evidence for a court sitting without a jury.id.
the history of rule supports a broad interpretation of a special master authority to determine the appropriate procedures for completing his assigned duties.rule was derived from former equity rules and.see.advisory committee notes.equity rule established the powers of master,providing that t he master shall regulate all the proceedings in every hearing before him.rules of practice in equity,rule further empowered a special master to direct the mode in which the matters requiring evidence shall be proved before him and generally to do all other acts,and direct all other inquiries and proceedings in the matters before him.id.thus,equity rule grant of authority to direct the mode in which the special master could receive evidence afforded the master full discretion over whether to require production of books and papers or to require witnesses to appear for direct and.the clear import of former equity rule was that the special master had discretion to determine not only the kind of proof he required,but also the manner in which it would be presented.
similarly,under former equity rule,entitled claimants before master examinable by him,the master was at liberty to examine any creditor or other person coming in to claim before him,either upon written interrogatories or viva voce,or in both modes,as the nature of the case appear ed to him to require.id.at.like equity rule,equity rule use of the term mode referred to the manner in which the master could receive evidence,describing examinations upon written interrogatories or viva voce as different modes of examination.thus,under former equity rules and,a special master was exempt from the procedural requirements that the equity rules imposed on the district courts and a master had substantial discretion to determine the procedures that he would follow on a basis.beckwith malleable iron range,it has been suggested that,intermediate the commencement and termination of the proceedings before the master,the court ought not to give directions respecting the course of the procedure.ordinarily this is true cold metal process united eng g foundry,following the practice under equity rule,the master is given the power to regulate the proceedings before him and take all measures necessary for the proper performance of his duties under the order t he court is generally loath to dictate to the master how to conduct proceedings before him,since such interference would tend to defeat the very purpose of reference.quoting moore federal practice,vol,at.
as the advisory committee notes explain,rule grants special masters the same autonomy and discretionary authority that special masters enjoyed under the equity rules.see.c advisory committee notes describing rule c as encompassing equity rules and with slight modifications.because rule like former equity rule empowers the master to regulate all the proceedings in every hearing before him,the advisory committee notes confirm that rule also grants substantial discretion to a special master to determine the kind of evidence the parties must submit and the manner in which it may be presented.thus,it is within a special master discretion whether to permit discovery or hold an evidentiary hearing in a particular case.
in light of a special master broad discretion to regulate the manner in which he will complete his duties,we reject appellants assertion that when a master is performing an adjudicatory function he must adhere to the federal rules of civil procedure and the federal rules of evidence.appellants cite no case that supports this proposition,and our independent research reveals none.in sum,simply because a court may call upon a master to aid the judge in the performance of specific judicial duties,does not mean that a special master is required to follow the federal rules of evidence or civil procedure,absent a reference order that so requires.we reject appellants argument to the contrary.
irrespective of the water master supposed duty to follow the federal rules of civil procedure and the federal rules of evidence,the tribe contends that the water master violated its due process rights in failing to give the tribe notice of the matleys petition for reclassification or to hold a hearing prior to issuing his report although we agree that the united states constitution may require the water master to conduct an evidentiary hearing prior to issuing a ruling under certain circumstances,this is not such a case.
indeed,the supreme court consistently has held that some form of hearing is required before an individual is finally deprived of a property interest,as t he fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.mathews eldridge,d internal quotation marks omitted.however,a careful assessment of the private and governmental interests at stake here and the nature of the existing procedures demonstrates that they were not constitutionally inadequate.see id.at.noting that the identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors.
it is true that the tribe has a legitimate property interest in the additional water that the matleys seek for their farm,see,at,and that by approving an allocation of additional water from the carson river to the matleys farm in the newlands project,the water master permanently deprived the tribe of any interest it had in that water.see mathews,at.the due process issue,however,is the fairness and reliability of the existing procedures,and the probable value,if any,of additional procedural safeguards.id.at.thus,to address this issue,we review the basic procedure that the water master has established for consideration of a reclassification petition.see id.at.
under the water master protocol the tribe must be notified that a reclassification petition has been filed and the tribe may submit written objections to the petition the tribe may also file objections to the water master proposed findings and recommendations.the protocol does not require the water master to allow the parties to conduct discovery or to hold an evidentiary hearing.
the tribe contends that the protocol procedure denies it the opportunity to obtain meaningful review of its property interests because it does not afford the tribe an evidentiary hearing at which it may witnesses.what the tribe overlooks is that,although due process guarantees some kind of hearing at some time before a person is finally deprived of his property interests,memphis light,gas water div.craft,d,a full evidentiary hearing is not required in every case,see mathews,at.goldberg kelly,d.rather,the type of hearing required depends on the circumstances.mathews,at.weighing the administrative burden and other societal costs that would be associated with requiring,as a matter of constitutional right,an evidentiary hearing upon demand in all cases,mathews,at,we conclude that the water master is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing replete with witnesses and prior to ruling on a reclassification petition.
here,the tribe ultimately received notice that the matleys had filed a reclassification petition,and it was able to submit extensive,detailed objections to the matleys petition,albeit after remand by the district court.although the tribe was not permitted to conduct discovery,it obtained analyses from two experts who critiqued the findings of the matleys expert,donald grimes.on the basis of their analyses,the tribe submitted sophisticated and detailed written objections to both the water master and the district court,attacking the water master findings and the methodology he used to reach those findings.these objections demonstrate that the tribe was given a meaningful opportunity to protect its property interests in this case.accordingly,we hold that in rendering his final report the procedure followed by the water master was constitutionally adequate and did not deprive the tribe of its property interest in project water without due process of law.
ii.reclassification standard 
procedural issues aside,appellants also contend that the water master applied the wrong legal standard in evaluating the matleys reclassification petition,and that the district court compounded that error when it adopted the water master report we agree 
the reclamation act provides that beneficial use shall be the basis,the measure,and the limit of the right to use water acquired under its provisions.by the terms of the statute,therefore,beneficial use is the basis and measure as well as the limit of water rights it sets the maximum water duty,but,under the statute,it is also the necessary rationale and source of the right.united states alpine land reservoir,cir alpine i.the standard for reclassification therefore must comply with the principles of beneficial use,as the reclamation act constitutes a congressional directive mandating a beneficial use inquiry in place of any contrary dictate of state law,at see also california united states,d noting the binding congressional directive that the water right must be governed by beneficial use.
in describing the principles of beneficial use,we explained that t he major conceptual tool for implementing beneficial use is the water duty,which is the amount of water an appropriator is entitled to use,including a margin for conveyance loss.alpine i,at.the water duty 
is that measure of water,which by careful management and use,without wastage,is reasonably required to be applied to any given tract of land for such period of time as may be adequate to produce therefrom a maximum amount of crops as ordinarily are grown thereon.it is not a hard and fast unit of measurement,but is variable according to conditions.
id.internal quotation marks omitted.although this definition explicitly contemplates a measure adequate to produce therefrom a maximum amount of such crops as ordinarily are grown thereon,we must read this definition in a manner consistent with the principles of beneficial use.
indeed,in defining beneficial use as the general rule that water is beneficially used in an accepted use such as irrigation when it is usefully employed by the appropriator,we adopted two qualifications the use can not include any element of waste which,among other things,precludes unreasonable transmission loss and use of methods,and the use can not be unreasonable considering alternative uses of the water.alpine i,at.thus,even where the application of additional water over the water duty awarded would provide some benefit to the appropriator,we have upheld the original water duty when the gain was so small compared to the amount of water necessary to bring it forth that the additional increment of water would not be economically applied.id.internal quotation marks omitted.these qualifications are consistent with the alpine decree provisions for an individual farm to divert up to its designated duty,subject to the obligation to divert and use water only at such times as needed and only in such amounts as may be required for actual,reasonably economical beneficial use.
here,the matleys rely on a provision in the district court order to argue that the water master properly determined that beneficial use entitles them to the maximum crop yield.specifically,they note the district court reliance on the doi report supporting the classification scheme which contemplated 
that there must be an appropriate water allowance for future changes to the bench and bottom land classifications based upon the collection of factual data by the water user.to the extent there may be a reduction in crop yield which can be attributed to the reclassification from bench to bottom land,then the federal water master is authorized to take such action as is appropriate to reclassify the lands from bottom land to bench land.
indeed,the district court further stated that 
t herefore a critical component of the secretary findings is that any water user has the right to apply for and secure changes in bench and bottom land classifications.the data collected by the water users in cooperation with agencies of the united states should be given immediate and careful consideration should reclassification be necessary to maintain the integrity of current crop yields.
however,although the district court accounted for a reduction in crop yield and the integrity of current crop yields,the matleys narrow reading of the order does not comport with the principle of beneficial use.the district court order can not be read to allow reclassification in every case where a landowner,such as the matleys,can show a reduction in crop yield,however de minimis.instead,reclassification is appropriate only in cases where a yield reduction is reasonably significant in light of the applicable beneficial use standard.
under this standard,a project landowner is not guaranteed an appropriation of water that would ensure the maximum crop yield.although we have defined the water duty as the amount of water that is reasonably required,without wastage,to produce a maximum crop,see alpine i,at,beneficial use does not permit a project landowner to use water in a manner that is unreasonable in light of alternative uses.id.alpine i made clea
