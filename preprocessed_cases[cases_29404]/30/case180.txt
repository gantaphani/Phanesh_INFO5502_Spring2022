in this consolidated petition,we review various challenges to a regulation promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency under the clean water act in order to abate and control the emission of water pollutants from concentrated animal feeding operations.while we deny many of the challenges here brought,we find that several aspects of the regulation violate the express terms of the clean water act or are otherwise arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act.accordingly,we grant the petitions in part and deny the petitions in part.
background 
statutory background 
the clean water act the act is a cornerstone of the federal effort to protect the environment.d esigned to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters,no spray coalition,city of new york,cir quoting a,the act is the principal legislative source of the epa abate and control water pollution.see a.
by way of very brief overview,the act formally prohibits the discharge of a pollutant by any person from any point source to navigable waters except when authorized by a permit issued under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes.see a.this means,as a practical matter,that the epa primarily advances the act the ambitious goal that water pollution be not only reduced,but eliminated,see a through the use of npdes permits that,while authorizing some water pollution,place important restrictions on the quality and character of that licit pollution.
npdes permits are issued either by the epa,itself,or by the states in a federally approved permitting system.see.regardless of the issuer,every npdes permit is statutorily required to set forth,at the very least,effluent limitations,that is,certain restriction s on the quantities,rates,and concentrations of chemical,physical,biological,and other constituents which are discharged from point sources into navigable waters.florida water mgmt.dist.miccosukee tribe of indians,d generally speaking,the npdes requires dischargers to obtain permits that place limits on the type and quantity of pollutants that can be released into the nation waters.
the specific effluent limitations contained in each individual npdes permit are dictated by the terms of more general effluent limitation guidelines elgs,which are separately promulgated by the epa.epa california,ex rel.state water res.control,d an npdes permit serves to transform generally applicable effluent limitations and other standards including those based on water quality into the obligations of the individual discharger.elgs,and the effluent limitations established in accordance with them,are restrictions on water pollution.they are,because they are established in accordance with various technological standards that the act statutorily provides and that,pursuant to the act,vary depending upon the type of pollutant involved,the type of discharge involved,and whether the point source in question is new or already existing.we will discuss these with greater detail below.for now,we note simply that the technology standards for already existing point sources include the best available technology economically achievable,see b a the best conventional pollutant control technology,see b a and the best practicable control technology currently available,see b a.the technology standard for new point sources,which is commonly referred to as a new source performance standard,is based on the best available demonstrated control technology,see.
we also note that where effluent limitations prove insufficient to attain or maintain certain water quality standards,the act requires npdes permits to include additional water quality based effluent limitations.see b,a.overall,we hope to make clear that the npdes permit is critical to the successful implementation of the act setting forth effluent limitations and,in certain cases,additional water quality based effluent npdes permit defines,and facilitates compliance with,and enforcement of,a preponderance of a discharger obligations under the act.california,ex rel.state water res.control,at.
regulatory background 
in the consolidated petition before us,we are asked to review,inter alia,the permitting requirements and effluent limitation guidelines promulgated by the epa in its attempt to regulate the emission of water pollutants from concentrated animal feeding operations cafos.before reviewing these challenges,however,a few introductory words about cafos themselves are in order.
cafos are the largest of the nation or so animal feeding operations agriculture enterprises where animals are kept and raised in confinement.national pollutant discharge elimination system permit regulation and effluent limitation guidelines and standards for concentrated animal feeding operations,codified at parts,and hereinafter preamble to the final rule such agriculture enterprises are not,however,of a kind the founding fathers likely would have envisioned populating america yeoman republic.see generally,stanley elkins and eric mckitrick,jefferson and the yeoman republic,the age of federalism.on the contrary,cafos are industrial operations that raise extraordinary numbers of livestock for example,a medium cafo raises as many as sheep,turkeys,or chickens other than laying hens large cafos raise even more staggering numbers of,raising literally millions of animals in one location.
economically,these cafos generate billions of dollars of revenue every year the epa has focused on the industry because cafos also generate millions of tons of manure every year and when improperly managed,this manure can pose substantial risks to the environment and public health.preamble to the final rule at.
animal waste includes a number of potentially harmful pollutants.according to the epa,the pollutants associated with cafo waste principally include nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus organic matter solids,including the manure itself and other elements mixed with it such as spilled feed,bedding and litter materials,hair,feathers and animal corpses pathogens organisms such as bacteria and viruses salts trace elements such as arsenic compounds such as carbon dioxide,methane,hydrogen sulfide,and ammonia antibiotics and pesticides and hormones.see national pollutant discharge elimination system permit regulation and effluent limitations guidelines and standards for concentrated animal feeding operations,proposed,hereinafter proposed rule see also preamble to the final rule at.
these pollutants can infiltrate the surface waters in a variety of ways including spills and other discharges,overflows from storage lagoons,and discharge to the air coupled with subsequent redeposition on the landscape.see preamble to the final rule at.perhaps the most common way by which pollutants reach the surface waters is through improper land application.land application,the predominant means by which cafos dispose of animal waste is a process by which manure,litter,and other process wastewaters are spread onto fields controlled by cafos.as all parties here agree,when properly,manure,litter,and other process wastewaters can act as a fertilizer,because land application of cafo waste fosters the reuse of the nitrogen,phosphorus,and potassium in these wastes for crop growth.epa,state compendium programs and regulatory activities related to animal feeding operations may.however,when waste is excessively or improperly,the nutrients contained in the waste become pollutants that can and often do run off into adjacent waterways or leach into soil and ground water.see preamble to the final rule at.
in light of these environmental threats,the epa first promulgated regulations for cafos in and that,very generally speaking,defined the types of animal feeding operations that qualify as cafos,set forth various npdes permit requirements,and established effluent limitation guidelines for cafos.see.after having been sued,in,for failing to publish a plan to revise existing effluent limitations for the industry pursuant to m the epa,on january,proposed to revise and update the first set of cafo regulations.see proposed rule at.the epa explained,in proposing its revisions,that the new rule aimed to address not only inadequate compliance with existing policy,but also the changes that have occurred in the animal production industries.proposed rule at.specifically,the epa pointed to the continued trend toward fewer but larger operations,coupled with greater emphasis on more intensive production methods and specialization,a trend with increased reports of discharges from these facilities and continued runoff had contributed to the significant increase in nutrients and resulting impairment of many waterways.id.
the epa received approximately public comments on the proposed rule,see preamble to the final rule at,as well as an additional or so comments following the publication,in november and july,of notices of data availability documents that summarized new data and information presented to the epa.see id.at.ultimately,on february,the epa promulgated its final cafo rule cafo rule or rule.see,see also preamble to the final rule at.
the aspects of the rule most relevant to the petitions before us are as follows 
the duty to apply for an npdes permit 
the rule requires that all cafo owners or operators must apply for an individual npdes permit or submit a notice of intent for coverage under an npdes general permit.see d.there is,however,an exception section d provides,in effect,that an owner or operator of a large cafo need not seek coverage under an npdes permit if the owner or operator secures a determination from the director of the relevant permitting authority that the large cafo has no potential to discharge manure,litter or process wastewater.see d see also id.at f describing the process by which a large cafo may secure a determination that it has no potential to discharge.
npdes permit requirements 
the rule includes the requirement that each cafo develop and implement a nutrient management plan.such a nutrient management plan must,under the rule 
i ensure adequate storage of manure,litter,and process wastewater,including procedures to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the storage facilities 
ii ensure proper management of mortalities dead animals to ensure that they are not disposed of in a liquid manure,storm water,or process wastewater storage or treatment system that is not specifically designed to treat animal mortalities 
iii ensure that clean water is diverted,as appropriate,from the production area 
iv prevent direct contact of confined animals with waters of the united states 
v ensure that chemicals and other contaminants handled are not disposed of in any manure,litter,process wastewater,or storm water storage or treatment system unless specifically designed to treat such chemicals and other contaminants 
vi identify appropriate site specific conservation practices to be implemented,including as appropriate buffers or equivalent practices,to control runoff of pollutants to waters of the united states 
vii identify protocols for appropriate testing of manure,litter,process wastewater,and soil 
viii establish protocols to land apply manure,litter or process wastewater in accordance with site specific nutrient management practices that ensure appropriate agricultural utilization of the nutrients in the manure,litter or process wastewater and 
ix identify specific records that will be maintained to document the implementation and management of the minimum elements described above.
e i ix.additionally,the effluent limitation guidelines for cafos which we will describe in a moment further require that each large cafo develop and implement a nutrient management plan that,inter alia,includes a waste application rate that minimize s phosphorus and nitrogen transport from the field to surface waters.c.
the discharges subject to npdes requirements 
the rule provides,in e,that all land application discharges from a cafo are subject to npdes requirements,any discharge of manure,litter,or process wastewater that results from the land application of these materials by a cafo is a discharge that is regulable and subject to npdes permit requirements.e.where,however,cafos waste in accordance with nutrient management practices that ensure appropriate agricultural utilization of the nutrients in that waste,any subsequent discharge is considered to be an agricultural stormwater discharge that is,under the act,exempt from regulation.see.
effluent limitation guidelines 
the rule establishes effluent limitation guidelines elgs that apply to land application discharges by large cafos and to the production areas of large cafos two general comments about these elgs are in order.first,although the epa usually establishes quantitative or numerical elgs,the epa here promulgated best management practices,which are qualitative or elgs for large cafos,but which,we note,are still because they are based on the technology standards prescribed by the act.see see also k describing the circumstances in which the epa may promulgate best management practices in the place of numerical elgs.second,because the epa here decided to organize large cafos into four subcategories depending upon the types of animals present,the elgs are also organized into four subcategories.see preamble to the final rule at.additionally,we note that,with respect to land application,best management practices include,most importantly,the requirement that large cafos develop and implement a nutrient management plan that,inter alia,sets an application rate that minimizes the transport of phosphorus and nitrogen from the land application field to surface waters.c.the land application best management practices also provide for manure and soil sampling,inspection of land application equipment and various setback requirements.see c.with respect to the elgs for production areas,best management practices include various requirements designed to minimize the possibility of overflows,such as mandatory inspections of relevant equipment and the installation of depth markers in surface and liquid impoundments,lagoons,ponds,and tanks.see preamble to the final rule at.
discussion 
two sets of petitioners bring challenges to the cafo rule the environmental petitioners waterkeeper alliance,sierra club,natural resources defense council,and the american littoral society and the farm petitioners american farm bureau federation,national chicken council,and the national pork producers council amici curiae,who represent various environmental and public health interests,join the environmental petitioners in some of their challenges.
all the challenges we here of which are brought by the environmental be divided into three general categories challenges to the permitting scheme established by the cafo rule challenges to the types of discharges subject to regulation under the cafo rule and challenges to the effluent limitation guidelines established by the cafo rule we will address each category in turn.
to the extent we are asked to review whether some aspect of the cafo rule violates the clean water act,our inquiry is governed by the standards set forth in chevron natural resources defense council,inc,d.see also public citizen,mineta,cir.if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue and the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.footnote omitted.if,however,we determine that the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific question at issue,then we consider whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
to the extent we are asked to review whether some aspect of the cafo rule violates the administrative procedure act because it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a,our inquiry is governed by the standard set forth in motor vehicle manufacturers association of the united states,state farm mutual automobile insurance company.see,d.see also public citizen,at.to determine whether an agency has acted in an arbitrary and capricious fashion,we ask whether the agency has examine d the relevant data and articulate d a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.state farm,at.then,i n reviewing that explanation,we must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.id.normally,we must deem arbitrary and capricious an agency rule where the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.id.at.internal quotations and citations omitted.
with this background in mind,we turn now to the various challenges.
challenges to the cafo rule permitting scheme 
failure to regulate 
the environmental petitioners broadly indict the cafo rule as countenancing the creation of an impermissible permitting regime.more precisely,the environmental petitioners argue that the cafo rule is unlawful because it empowers npdes authorities to issue permits to large cafos in the absence of any meaningful review of the nutrient management plans those cafos have developed and it fails to require that the terms of the nutrient management plans be included in the npdes permits.we agree with the environmental petitioners on both counts.
failure to require permitting authority review 
the clean water act demands regulation in fact,not only in principle.under the act,permits authorizing the discharge of pollutants may issue only where such permits ensure that every discharge of pollutants will comply with all applicable effluent limitations and standards.section a of title provides,for example,that when the epa is,itself,issuing npdes permits,the epa may issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant or combination of pollutants upon condition that such discharge will meet all applicable requirements including the effluent limitations statutorily required by.the act further provides that the epa shall prescribe conditions for such permits to assure compliance with all applicable requirements,including effluent limitations.a emphasis added.similarly,b allows states to distribute npdes permits only where,inter alia,the state permitting programs apply,and insure compliance with,any applicable effluent limitations and standards.b emphasis added 
by failing to provide for permitting authority review of the nutrient management plans,the cafo rule plainly violates these statutory commandments and is otherwise arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act.the requirement to develop and implement a nutrient management plan is,after all,one of the best management practices that constitute the effluent limitation guidelines for land application by large cafos.see c.but not just any nutrient management plan suffices under the rule.on the contrary,the effluent limitation guidelines expressly require that large cafos develop and implement a nutrient management plan that 
incorporates the requirements of paragraphs c through c of this section based on a assessment of the potential for nitrogen and phosphorus transport from the field and that addresses the form,source,amount,timing,and method of application of nutrients on each field to achieve realistic production goals,while minimizing nitrogen and phosphorus movement to surface waters.
id.accordingly,in order to comply with the effluent limitations for land application of manure,litter,and process wastewater,large cafos must,inter alia,develop and implement nutrient management plans that,pursuant to paragraph c,include application rates that minimize phosphorus and nitrogen transport from the field to surface waters in compliance with the technical standards for nutrient management established by the director.see c.
as presently constituted,the cafo rule does nothing to ensure that each large cafo has,in fact,developed a nutrient management plan that satisfies the above requirements.the cafo rule does nothing to ensure,in other words,that each large cafo will comply with all applicable effluent limitations and standards.this is because,most glaringly,the cafo rule fails to require that permitting authorities review the nutrient management plans developed by large cafos before issuing a permit that authorizes land application discharges.
a recent decision of the ninth circuit supports the conclusion we here reach.in environmental defense center,epa edc,the ninth circuit considered a challenge to a phase ii epa rule for municipal storm sewer systems.see cir,cert.denied,texas cities coalition on stormwater epa,d.among other things,the phase ii rule allowed small municipal storm sewer systems to seek permission to discharge pollutants by submitting an individualized set of best management practices designed by each municipal storm sewer system stormwater management plans,either in the form of an individual permit application or in the form of a notice of intent to comply with a general permit.see edc,at.so long as a notice of intent included a stormwater management plan,the epa deemed a municipal storm sewer system to be in compliance with the relevant standards of the clean water act,including the standard that municipal stormwater pollution be reduced to the maximum extent practicable.see id.at p b iii.the phase ii rule did not require npdes authorities to review the stormwater management plans themselves.
the ninth circuit held,however,that the failure to require permitting authority review of the stormwater management plans violated the clean water act while the ninth circuit was quick to laud i nvolving regulated parties in the development of individual stormwater pollution control programs,it emphasized that programs that are designed by regulated parties must,in every instance,be subject to meaningful review by an appropriate regulating entity to ensure that each such program reduces the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable,the relevant statutory standard.edc,at.the phase ii rule,by contrast,failed to require that the relevant permitting authorities review the stormwater management plans to ensure that the measures that any given operator of a small municipal storm sewer system has decided to undertake will in fact reduce discharges to the maximum extent practicable.id.at emphasis in original.accordingly,the phase ii rule provided no safeguard against a municipal storm sewer system misunderstanding or misrepresenting its own stormwater situation and proposing a set of minimum measures for itself that would reduce discharges by far less than the maximum extent practicable.id.
like the phase ii rule,the cafo rule does not require that npdes permitting authorities review the nutrient management plans to ensure that the nutrient management plans designed by the large cafos will in fact reduce land application discharges in a way that achieve s realistic production goals,while minimizing nitrogen and phosphorus movement to surface waters.c.like the phase ii rule,the cafo rule does not adequately prevent large cafos from misunderstanding or misrepresenting their specific situation and adopting improper or inappropriate nutrient management plans,with improper or inappropriate waste application rates 
the epa offers two principal arguments in defense of the permitting scheme,neither of which we find to be persuasive.first,the epa argues that the nutrient management plan does not,itself,constitute an effluent limitation guideline but is,instead,simply a planning tool to help cafos comply with the effluent limitations.accordingly,epa contends that it is not statutorily compelled to require permitting authority review of the plans.we reject this argument.for one thing,we believe that the terms of the nutrient management plans are themselves effluent limitations,for reasons we state in section.b,infra.by failing to require permitting authority review of nutrient management plans,the cafo rule thus allows permits to issue that do not assure compliance with all applicable effluent limitations.even assuming,arguendo,that epa is correct and the nutrient management plan is not,itself,an effluent limitation,epa argument still fails on its own terms.for while epa denies that the nutrient management plan is itself an effluent limitation,even the epa concedes,as it must,that the requirement to develop and implement a nutrient management plan is an effluent limitation this requirement is,after all,one of the best management practices required by the cafo rule.see c.the cafo failing to provide for permitting authority does not ensure that each large cafo has,in fact,developed and implemented a nutrient management plan that satisfies the requirements of c.
second,the epa argues that there is no need for permitting authority review because the rule provides large cafos with little room for thus little room for setting their waste application rates.this is true,the epa argues,because the rule requires states to develop technical standards based on certain assessment s and further requires large cafos to adopt application rates that comply with those technical standards.see c c.however,while state technical standards will reduce discretion on the part of the large cafos,they will not eliminate it.state technical standards are based on assessments.but large cafos ultimately set application rates based on assessments of the relevant field conditions,as the epa concedes in the preamble to the rule.see preamble to the final rule at today rule requires large cafos to determine and implement nutrient application rates that are consistent with the technical standards for nutrient management established by the permitting authority.emphasis added see also id.at the nutrient management plan is the tool cafos must use to assess soil and other field conditions at their operation to determine the nitrogen or rate at which manure,litter,and other process wastewaters are to be applied.emphasis added by not providing for permitting authority review of these application rates,the cafo rule fails to adequately prevent large cafos from misunderstanding or misrepresenting the application rates they must adopt in order to comply with state technical standards.the cafo rule does not ensure that the large cafos will,in fact,develop nutrient management waste application comply with all applicable effluent limitations and standards.
failure to require that the terms of the nutrient management plans be included in the npdes permits 
the clean water act unquestionably provides that all applicable effluent limitations must be included in each npdes permit.see a,b,a see also am.paper,epa,noting that the clean water act mandates that every permit contain inter alia effluent limitations that reflect the pollution reduction achievable by using technologically practicable controls.what the parties here dispute is whether the terms of the nutrient management plans,themselves,constitute effluent limitations that must be included in the npdes permits.
as we have already stated,rather than setting forth numerical effluent limitations for land application of manure,the cafo rule establishes effluent limitations in the form of best management practices.see.among these best management practices is the requirement that cafos develop and implement a nutrient management plan that,inter alia,sets application rates that minimize phosphorus and nitrogen transport.see c.the epa readily acknowledges that the requirement to develop and implement a nutrient management plan is a effluent limitation,but argues the wording of this terms of the nutrient management plans themselves do not constitute the effluent limitations.accordingly,epa argues that the terms of the nutrient management plans need not be included in the npdes permits.
we believe that the epa argument is foreclosed by the statutory definition of effluent limitation.the clean water act defines effluent limitation to mean any restriction established by a state or the administrator on quantities,rates,and concentrations of chemical,physical,biological,and other constituents which are discharged from point sources emphasis added.there is no doubt that under the cafo rule,the only restrictions actually imposed on land application discharges are those restrictions imposed by the various terms of the nutrient management plan,including the waste application rates developed by the large cafos pursuant to their nutrient management plans.indeed,the requirement to develop a nutrient management plan constitutes a restriction on land application discharges only to the extent that the nutrient management plan actually imposes restrictions on land application discharges.to accept the epa contrary requiring a nutrient management plan is itself a restriction on land application to allow semantics to torture logic.
because we believe that the terms of the nutrient management plans constitute effluent limitations,we hold that the cafo failing to require that the terms of the nutrient management plans be included in npdes the clean water act and is otherwise arbitrary and capricious in violation of the administrative procedure act.
lack of public participation 
the environmental petitioners also argue,and we here find,that the permitting scheme established by the cafo rule violates the clean water act public participation requirements and is otherwise arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act.
congress clearly intended to guarantee the public a meaningful role in the implementation of the clean water act.the act unequivocally and broadly declares,for example,that p ublic participation in the development,revision,and enforcement of any regulation,standard,effluent limitation,plan,or program established by the administrator or any state under this act shall be provided for,encouraged,and assisted by the administrator and the states.e.consistent with this demand,the act further provides that there be an opportunity for public hearing before any npdes permit issues,see a,b that a copy of each permit application and each permit issued under this section shall be available to the public,see j and that any citizen may bring a civil suit for violations of the act,see a.
the cafo rule deprives the public of the opportunity for the sort of regulatory participation that the act guarantees because the rule effectively shields the nutrient management plans from public scrutiny and comment.admittedly,the preamble to the rule indicates that the epa expects that the permitting authority will make this information available to the public upon request,see preamble to the final rule at emphasis added however,the rule provides no assurance that epa expectations will be satisfied.not only does the cafo rule fail to require that the terms of the nutrient management plans be included in the npdes permits,it also fails to provide the public with any other means of access to them.after all,the rule provides only that a copy of the cafo nutrient management plan must be maintained on site and made available to the director of the state permitting authority upon request.e ii.the rule does not similarly require that copies of the nutrient management plans be made available to the public by the cafos.
this scheme violates the act public participation requirements in a number of respects.first and foremost,in light of our holding that the terms of the nutrient management plans constitute effluent limitations that should have been included in npdes permits,the cafo rule deprives the public of its right to assist in the development,revision,and enforcement of an effluent limitation.e emphasis added.more specifically,the cafo rule prevents the public from calling for a hearing then meaningfully commenting permits before they issue.see a,b.the cafo rule also impermissibly compromises the public ability to bring,a proven enforcement tool that congress intended to be used to both spur and supplement government enforcement actions.clean water act amendments of,senate environment and public works,sess.under the cafo rule,as written,citizens would be limited to enforcing the mere requirement to develop a nutrient management plan,but would be without means to enforce the terms of the nutrient management plans because they lack access to those terms.this is unacceptable.
and even assuming,arguendo,that the nutrient management plans did not themselves constitute effluent limitations,we would still hold that the cafo rule violates the act public participation requirements.nutrient management plans are,even under the epa own theory of the cafo rule,a critical indispensable feature of the plan,or program established by the administrator or any state in order to regulate large cafo land application discharges.e.the epa itself has stated in the preamble to the rule that the only way to ensure that point source discharges of manure,litter,or process wastewaters from cafos do not occur is to require land application in accordance with site specific nutrient management practices.preamble to the final rule at.since nutrient management plans embody all the relevant site specific nutrient management practices,it is clear that,even according to the epa,nutrient management plans are a sine qua non of the regulation,standard,plan,or program it established to regulate land application discharges.e.
given that the cafo rule than provid es for,encourag es,and assist s public participation in the development and enforcement of nutrient management plans,and given that nutrient management plans are an important regulation,standard,effluent limitation,plan or program established by the epa to regulate land application discharges,the cafo rule violates the plain dictates of e.
the duty to apply 
the farm petitioners also challenge the permitting scheme established by the cafo rule.they contend that the epa has exceeded its statutory jurisdiction by requiring all cafos to either apply for npdes permits or otherwise demonstrate that they have no potential to discharge.we agree and grant their petition in this regard.
the clean water act authorizes the epa to regulate,through the npdes permitting system,only the discharge of pollutants.the act generally provides,for example,that except as in compliance with all applicable effluent limitations and permit restrictions,the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful.a emphasis added.consistent with this prohibition,the act authorizes the epa to promulgate effluent limitations issue permits incorporating those effluent limitations discharge of pollutants.section of title provides that e ffluent limitations shall be applied to all point sources of discharge of pollutants,see e.section of the same title then gives npdes authorities the power to issue permits authorizing the discharge of any pollutant or combination of pollutants.see a the administrator may,after opportunity for public hearing,issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant,or combination of pollutants emphasis added see also b authorizing states to administer permit programs for discharges into navigable waters.in other words,unless there is a discharge of any pollutant,there is no violation of the act,and point sources are,accordingly,neither statutorily obligated to comply with epa regulations for point source discharges,nor are they statutorily obligated to seek or obtain an npdes permit.
congress left little room for doubt about the meaning of the term discharge of any pollutant.the act expressly defines the term to mean a any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source,or b any addition of any pollutant to the waters of the contiguous zone or the ocean from any point source other than a vessel or other floating craft.thus,in the absence of an actual addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point,there is no point source discharge,no statutory violation,no statutory obligation of point sources to comply with epa regulations for point source discharges,and no statutory obligation of point sources to seek or obtain an npdes permit in the first instance.
the cafo rule violates this statutory scheme.it imposes obligations on all cafos regardless of whether or not they have,in fact,added any pollutants to the navigable waters,discharged any pollutants.after all,the rule demands that every cafo owner or operator either apply for a comply with the effluent limitations contained in the affirmatively demonstrate that no permit is needed because there is no potential to discharge.see d and f.in the epa view,such demands are appropriate because all cafos have the potential to discharge pollutants.see preamble to the final rule at the duty to apply provision is based on the presumption that every cafo has a potential to discharge.while we appreciate the policy considerations underlying the epa approach in the cafo rule,however,we are without authority to permit it because it contravenes the regulatory scheme enacted by congress the clean water act gives the epa jurisdiction to regulate and control only actual potential discharges,and certainly not point sources themselves.see natural resources defense council epa,noting that the act does not empower the agency to regulate point sources themselves rather,epa jurisdiction under the operative statute is limited to regulating the discharge of pollutants.to the extent that policy considerations do warrant changing the statutory scheme,such considerations address themselves to congress,not to the courts.mci telecommunications v.at t,d citation omitted.
epa other arguments are also unavailing.the epa principally attempts to derive support for its duty to apply provision from the statutory definition of point source.epa argues that point source is defined to mean not only any discernible,confined and discrete conveyance from which pollutants are discharged,but also any discernible,confined and discrete conveyance from which pollutants may be discharged.the epa can not,however,point to any provision of the statute that gives operational effect to the may be language in the manner in which the epa seeks to do so here.the epa points,for example,to e.yet that section provides not that effluent limitations shall be applied to all point sources,end of story,but that effluent limitations shall be applied to all point sources of discharge of pollutants in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.e emphasis added.thus,while point sources are statutorily defined to include potential dischargers,effluent limitations can,pursuant to e,be applied only to point sources of discharge of pollutants,those point sources that are actually discharging id.
the epa also argues that the duty to apply provision is consistent with the act goal of not just reducing,but eliminating water pollution.it is true that the duty to apply provision is consistent with the broad goal of eliminating water pollution.however,the duty to apply flatly contravenes the statute text,which more specifically powers that congress conferred upon the epa in order to effectuate the clean water act goals.principles of statutory construction forbid us from sanctioning epa conduct that is plainly inconsistent with a statute specific text.see caminetti united states.it is elementary that the meaning of a statute must,in the first instance,be sought in the language in which the act is framed,and if that is plain the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.
for all these reasons,we believe that the clean water act,on its face,prevents the epa from imposing,upon cafos,the obligation to seek an npdes permit or otherwise demonstrate that they have no potential to discharge.see chevron natural resources defense council,d where congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue and the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.footnote omitted 
challenges to the types of discharges regulated 
regulatory exemption for agricultural stormwater discharges 
as stated in the background section,supra,the cafo rule generally provides that discharges from a land application area under the control of a cafo are subject to npdes requirements.see e.however,the rule,like the clean water act itself,carves out an exception where the discharge in question is an agricultural storm water discharge,category of discharges that the act exempts from regulation via the statutory definition of point source.see.more specifically,the rule classifies,as agricultural stormwater,any discharge of manure,litter,or process wastewater from land areas under the control of a cafo where the manure,litter or process wastewater has otherwise been applied in accordance with site specific nutrient management practices that ensure appropriate agricultural utilization.e.
the environmental petitioners contend that this approach violates the clean water act and is otherwise arbitrary and capricious in violation of the administrative procedure act because the clean water act definition of point source requires regulation of all cafo discharges,notwithstanding the fact that agricultural stormwater discharges are otherwise deemed exempt from regulation.we disagree.
the act defines the term point source as follows 
p oint source means any discernible,confined,and discrete conveyance,including but not limited to any pipe,ditch,channel,tunnel,conduit,well,discrete fissure,container,rolling stock,concentrated animal feeding operation,or vessel or other floating craft,from which pollutants are or may be discharged.this term does not include agricultural stormwater discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture.
emphasis added.contrary to the views of the environmental petitioners,we find that this provision is ambiguous as to whether cafo discharges can ever constitute agricultural stormwater.here,the act expressly defines the term point source to include concentrated animal feeding operations the act expressly defines point source to exclude agricultural stormwater and the act makes absolutely no attempt to reconcile the two.congress has not addressed the precise issue the environmental petitioners put before us,and,as a result,the operative question we must consider becomes,pursuant to chevron,whether the cafo rule exemption for land application discharges is grounded in a permissible construction of the clean water act.chevron natural resources defense council,d.
the epa reads the act definition of point source as generally authorizing the regulation of cafo discharges,but exempting such discharges from regulation to the extent that they constitute agricultural stormwater.we think this is a reasonable construction in light of the legislative purpose of the agricultural stormwater exemption and given precedent from this circuit.with respect to legislative purpose,we believe it reasonable to conclude that when congress added the agricultural stormwater exemption to the clean water act,it was affirming the impropriety of imposing,on any person,liability for discharges triggered not by negligence or malfeasance,but by the when those discharges came from what would otherwise be point sources.there is no authoritative legislative history to the contrary.the environmental petitioners,for example,cite legislative history from in support of their position however,the agricultural stormwater exemption was not added to the clean water act until a full fifteen years later,when congress passed the water quality act of.see water quality act of,stat.it would be improper for us to rely on statements from in order to resolve an ambiguity that was not created until.in our view,prior legislative history is a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of a subsequent congress,in the same way that subsequent legislative history is a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier congress.pension benefit guaranty ltv,d emphasis added citation omitted.and,in any event,none of the legislative history from comes close to casting doubt on the construction we permit here 
precedent from this circuit also supports the construction that the epa advances and we here permit.in concerned area residents for the environment southview farm,this court considered the agricultural stormwater exemption and its statutory relationship to point source discharges,specifically cafo discharges.cir.the essence of the court holding was not,as environmental petitioners contend,that discharges from an area under the control of a cafo can never qualify for the agricultural stormwater exemption.rather,the court held that a discharge from an area under the control of a cafo can be considered either a cafo discharge that is subject to regulation or an agricultural stormwater discharge that is not subject to regulation.whether or not a discharge is regulable turned,in the court view,on the primary cause of the discharge.that is why the court wrote that a discharge could be regulated,and liability imposed,where the was primarily caused by the of the fields rather than the rain and that sufficient quantities of manure were present so that the could not be classified as stormwater.id.at.
we believe that the cafo rule comports both with congress intent in enacting the agricultural stormwater exemption and with our holding in southview farm.so far as congress intent is concerned,while the rule holds cafos liable for most land application discharges,it prevents cafos from being held liable for discharge s where manure,litter or process wastewater has otherwise been applied in accordance with site specific nutrient management practices that ensure appropriate agricultural utilization.e.in other words,like the clean water act itself,the cafo rule seeks to remove liability for discharges primarily caused by nature,while maintaining liability for other discharges.so far as our holding in southview farm is concerned,discharges from land areas under the control of a cafo can and should generally be regulated,but where a cafo has taken steps to ensure appropriate agricultural utilization of the nutrients in manure,litter,and process wastewater,it should not be held accountable for any discharge that is primarily the result of precipitation.
we also find unpersuasive the only other significant complaint the environmental petitioners lodge against the cafo rule agricultural stormwater that it is unreasonable,and hence improper,for the epa to construe the term agricultural as encompassing any stormwater discharge from a land area under the control of a cafo.the environmental petitioners contend that cafos must be viewed as industrial,not agricultural.we disagree.dictionaries from the period in which the agricultural stormwater exemption was adopted define agriculture or agricultural in a way that can permissibly be construed to encompass cafos.for example,webster new world dictionary defined the term agriculture to include,inter alia,work of cultivating the soil,producing crops,and raising livestock.webster new world dictionary of american english college ed.the oxford english dictionary similarly defined agriculture to include,inter alia,cultivating the soil,including the allied pursuits of gathering in the crops and rearing live stock.i the oxford english dictionary ed.here,there is no question that cafos rais e or rear livestock and,because manure is used as fertilizer,cultivat e the soil as well.preamble to the final rule at when manure or process wastewater is applied in accordance with practices designed to ensure appropriate agricultural utilization of nutrients,it fulfills an important agricultural purpose,namely the fertilization of crops.as a result,we can not say that the epa has impermissibly treated cafos as agricultural in character.
additionally,we note again that the cafo rule classifies discharges as agricultural stormwater only where cafos have otherwise applied manure,litter or process wastewater in accordance with site specific nutrient management practices that ensure appropriate agricultural utilization.e emphasis added.thus,even the cafo rule application of the agricultural stormwater exemption is expressly tethered to agricultural endeavors 
accordingly,for all these reasons,we reject the environmental petitioners challenge to the cafo rule exemption for agricultural stormwater discharges because we believe that the exemption is premised on a permissible construction of the act.
regulation of uncollected discharges 
the farm petitioners contend that the cafo rule violates the clean water act because it regulates uncollected discharges from land areas under the control of a cafo in effect,the farm petitioners claim that runoff from land application areas,unless collected or channelized at the land application area itself,does not constitute a point source discharge.we reject this claim because,in our view,regardless of whether or not runoff is collected at the land application area,itself,any discharge from a land area under the control of a cafo is a point source discharge subject to regulation because it is a discharge from a cafo.
to evaluate the farm petitioners claim we turn,once again,to the statutory definition of point source.the term point source is defined to mean,in relevant part,any discernible,confined and discrete conveyance,including but not limited to any pipe,ditch,channel,tunnel,conduit,well,discrete fissure,container,rolling stock,concentrated animal feeding operation,or vessel or other floating craft,from which pollutants are or may be discharged.emphasis added.given that the act expressly defines point source to include concentrated animal feeding operations,the farm petitioners can prevail on their challenge only if we find that the act prohibits classifying a land application discharge as a discharge from a cafo.we believe,however,that the act not only permits,but demands,that land application discharges be construed as discharges from a cafo to the extent that they are not otherwise agricultural stormwater.
as this court previously held in catskill mountains chapter of trout unlimited,city of new york,the term point source refers to the proximate source from which the pollutant is directly introduced to a destination water body.see,cir here,cafos are unquestionably the proximate source of any discharge of pollutants from land application areas under their control to the surface waters again,except where those discharges are agricultural stormwater.but for the application of manure by the cafo to the land,there could never be a discharge of pollutants from the land to the surface waters.thus,any land application discharge that is not agricultural stormwater is,definitionally,a discharge from a cafo that can be regulated as a point source discharge.
contrary to the contentions of the farm petitioners,whether the land application has been collected or channelized at the land application area is irrelevant to the determination regarding whether such constitutes a cafo discharge.to be sure,the act does generally contemplate that discharges be channelized in order to fall within the epa regulatory jurisdiction that is why the term point source is defined as discrete,discernible,conveyances.however,a cafo is,itself,a channel under the is,of course,expressly included in the list of examples of the types of point sources the epa may regulate.thus,any discharge from a cafo is already a point source discharge.requiring that manure,litter,or process wastewater be separately channelized at the land application site before any runoff could be considered a point source discharge would be,in effect,to impose a requirement not contemplated by the act that pollutants be channelized not once but twice before the epa can regulate them.
even assuming that the act did not plainly require that land application discharges generally be regulated as point source discharges,we would find that the epa has permissibly construed the statute in defining,as a discharge from a cafo,the discharge of manure,litter or process wastewater to waters of the united states from a cafo as a result of the application of that manure,litter or process wastewater by the cafo to land areas under its control.e.land application areas are,after all,an integral and indeed indispensable part of cafo operations.cafos depend on them to receive the volumes of manure their animals generate as we noted in the background section above,s everal estimates indicate that of waste is land applied.epa,state compendium programs and regulatory activities related to animal feeding operations may.given this fact and given that,under the rule,only discharges from land application areas under the control of a cafo are subject to regulation,see e,the epa could quite reasonably conclude that runoff from a land application area is runoff from a cafo.
thus,we reject the challenge to the cafo rule regulation of land application discharges,including uncollected discharges.
challenges to the cafo rule effluent limitations 
the environmental petitioners bring a host of challenges to the cafo rule effluent limitation guidelines and the cafo rule failure to promulgate additional water quality based effluent limitations.
again,we note that the specific effluent limitations contained in each individual npdes permit are dictated by the terms of more general effluent limitation guidelines elgs,which are separately promulgated by the epa.epa california,ex rel.state water res.control,d an npdes permit serves to transform generally applicable effluent limitations and other standards including those based on water quality into the obligations of the individual discharger.elgs,and the effluent limitations established in accordance with them,are restrictions on water pollution they are because they are established in accordance with various technological standards that the act statutorily provides and that,pursuant to the act,vary depending upon the type of pollutant involved,the type of discharge involved,and whether the point source in question is new or already existing.see.for existing facilities,the act requires that elgs be based on standards that include the best available technology economically achievable bat,see b a the best conventional pollutant control technology bct,see b a and the best practicable control technology currently available bpt,see b a.the technology standard for new point sources,which is commonly referred to as a new source performance standard,is based on the best available demonstrated control technology.see.
the epa here established elgs for the production areas of cafos,and did so on a by basis.of these,two are relevant the subcategory for dairy cows and cattle other than veal calves,grouped together under part,subpart c of epa regulations subpart c cafos,see,and the subcategory for swine,poultry and veal calves,grouped under part,subpart d,subpart d cafos,see.the epa,which was required to set bat,bpt and bct standards for the production areas of subpart c and subpart d cafos,here determined that the identical technologies satisfy these standards,and accordingly promulgated elgs based on the same technologies.generally speaking,these elgs,whether based on bat,bct or bpt standards set forth a prohibition on discharges from the production area of a cafo except insofar as the discharges are caused by precipitation require best management practices for the production area,including the installation of depth markers in manure lagoons and storage tanks,daily inspections of water lines,and weekly inspections of animal waste storage structures and of equipment used for channeling stormwater or runoff require additional best management practices for land application areas and provide an opportunity for alternative performance standards based upon alternative technologies that achieve a quantity of pollutants discharged from the production area equal to or less than the quantity of pollutants that would be discharged under the baseline.see cfr a.
the environmental petitioners present several challenges to the elgs promulgated by the epa.specifically,they challenge the elgs,the elgs for pathogens,and the new source performance standard adopted for subpart d cafos.the environmental petitioners also challenge the epa decision not to impose additional water quality based effluent limitations.we address each set of challenges in turn.
challenges to the bat standards 
the environmental petitioners contend that the cafo rule the elgs reflecting the best available technology economically achievable bat,see b a violate the clean water act,or are otherwise arbitrary and capricious,in three respects.to wit,the environmental petitioners claim that a in establishing the bat standards,epa failed to consider the technologies in the cafo industry b epa improperly abandoned a more suitable option as bat for beef and cattle cafos subpart c cafos and c the epa improperly rejected a more suitable option for swine,poultry and veal cafos subpart d cafos.we deny all these challenges.
failure to consider the best performing technologies 
the environmental petitioners sweepingly contend that,in developing its bat standards,the epa failed to consider the performing or optimally operating cafo in each category or subcategory and then adopt bat standards that reflect the respective performances of those cafos.we reject this summary challenge.the record reflects that epa extensively surveyed available technologies,narrowed the list of potential bat candidates to seven options,and subsequently found,within the bounds of its discretion,that option described the best candidate for bat,because all the other options considered either did not perform better than option,were not adequately supported in science,or were not economically achievable.
the epa engaged,here,in extensive data collection.the epa conducted more than site visits to cafos in over states.it obtained information regarding the operational characteristics,waste management systems,and financial situations of cafos from several agencies within the usda such as the national agricultural statistics service,the animal and plant health inspection service,and the economic research service.epa also attended conferences,obtained research from the land grant university system,met with several trade associations,and conducted extensive literature reviews.it received and considered approximately public comments on the proposed cafo rule,see preamble to the final rule at,as well as an additional or so comments following the publication,in november and july,of notices of data availability documents that summarized new data and information presented to the epa.see id.at.on the basis of this data collection,the epa ultimately found that the bat standards it generally require improved operation and significantly reduce cafo discharges as well or better than any other available,economically achievable technologies.and it generally justified this decision within the bounds of its discretion.see,id.at one recent study from iowa state university suggested percent of earthen manure structures lacked appropriate accompanying management and maintenance activities.another study in north carolina stated more than percent of violations were attributed to operation and management deficiencies.
to be sure,the cafo rule does not explicitly identify the single,existing cafo in each category or subcategory of the rule.however,it is obvious that the cafo rule substantively establishes standards that make reference to the best performer in any industrial category and nothing in the act or the legislative history indicates that any more was required of the epa.see a legislative history of the water pollution control act amendments of,committee print compiled for the senate committee on public works by the library of congress,ser.we believe that in all bat subcategories,the epa has either adopted the technology employed by the best performers or declined to do so for permissible reasons.indeed,the environmental petitioners can not identify any specific performance standard that the epa failed to consider or rejected for impermissible reasons in adopting its bat standards.thus,the epa has complied with its statutory duties in setting the bat standards,and we consequently reject the environmental petitioners challenge to them.
bat for beef and cattle cafos subpart c cafos 
the environmental petitioners also challenge the bat standards on the narrower ground that the epa improperly abandoned a more suitable option as bat for beef and cattle subpart c cafos.specifically,the environmental petitioners contend that epa should have selected what epa had called option,rather than option as bat for subpart c cafos.
by way of brief background,after reviewing an array of various pollution control technologies and best management practices,the we previously the list of potential bat candidates to seven options.those seven options can be generally summarized as follows 
option would require controls on land application of manure,based on the ability of the soil to assimilate the nitrogen content of the manure,plus inspection and recordkeeping requirements for the production area 
option would require the same controls as option,but would restrict the rate of manure application instead to a generally lower application rate where necessary,depending on soil conditions 
option would require the same controls as option,but would also require ground water monitoring and discharge controls,unless the cafo could show that the groundwater beneath manure storage areas or stockpiles do not have a direct hydrologic connection to surface waters 
option would require the same controls as option,but would also require sampling of surface waters adjacent to the production area land under control of the cafo to which manure is applied 
option would least for subpart d same controls as option,but would also establish a zero discharge requirement that does not allow overflows from the production area under any circumstances 
option would require the same controls as option,but would also require that swine and dairy operations install and implement anaerobic digestion and gas recovery to treat manure and 
option would require the same controls as option,but would also prohibit manure application to frozen,or saturated ground.
see epa,proposed rule development document to.
the epa initially proposed adopting option as bat for subpart c cafos,see proposed rule at,but ultimately adopted option.see preamble to the final rule at.that is to say,the epa initially proposed that various requirements be uniformly imposed on cafos,but ultimately decided that requirements be implemented,as necessary,on a basis.see proposed rule at the environmental petitioners claim that the rejection of option groundwater requirements is unsupported in the record.the epa argues,in opposition,that it reasonably determined that option is better technology than option,and that option would impose prohibitive economic costs on the cafo industry.we believe that the record adequately supports epa determinations and accordingly defer to the agency selection of option.
the epa principally claims that option is better technology than option because requirements are highly dependent on variables and that,accordingly,such requirements are more effectively evaluated and implemented on a basis,rather than imposed uniformly.the record adequately supports this claim.studies do show that variability in topography,climate,distance to surface water,and geologic factors influence whether and how pollutant discharges at a particular site enter surface water via groundwater.see epa,proposed rule development document.for example,a study by clapp and hornberger demonstrates that variability in soil types significantly affects the rates at which water flows through them indeed,clapp and hornberger reported that water flowed through sand about times faster than through clayey sic soils and about times faster than through silty soils.id.given that there is sufficient record support for epa determination that requirements are better imposed on a basis,and given that option requires cafos to consider whether such requirements are needed,see proposed rule at,we find that epa has adequately justified its finding that option constitutes better technology than option.see wildlife fed epa,upholding the epa determination to regulate color discharges from pulp and paper mill process on a basis where such discharges were dependent on conditions.
the record also supports the epa decision to reject option as economically prohibitive and not likely to result in any significant reduction in groundwater pollution.see am.petroleum inst.epa,cir epa would disserve its mandate were it to tilt at windmills by imposing bat limitations which removed de minimis amounts of polluting agents from our nation waters,while imposing possibly disabling costs upon the regulated industry.epa final economic analysis showed a nearly increase in the number of beef,dairy,and heifer cafos projected to close under option,were that option,rather than option,adopted.this amounted to a potential facility closure rate under option of for heifer cafos,for beef,and for the subcategory as a whole.see epa,final rule economic analysis.at the same time,the epa found that while it was difficult to quantify on an basis the pollutant reduction that would be associated with elgs for groundwater controls,its pollution reduction models showed a difference of less than between the nitrogen load reduction achieved under option as opposed to option.see epa,proposed rule development document.
in light of all the above,we deny the environmental petitioners challenge to the selection of option as bat for subpart c cafos.
bat for swine,poultry and veal cafos subpart d cafos 
although the epa initially proposed option as bat for subpart d cafos,see proposed rule at,the epa ultimately determined that the costs of option would not be economically achievable and,accordingly,adopted option.see preamble to the final rule at.the environmental petitioners here challenge the epa rejection of option on the grounds that the epa gave undue consideration to cost the epa economic modeling is flawed and even assuming the reasonableness of the epa economic models,the agency has,in other contexts,deemed economically achievable technologies that produced the same or worse economic costs.we reject all of these challenges and uphold the epa selection of option as bat for subpart d cafos.
as a preliminary matter,we note that environmental petitioners are correct that cost is only one of the factors that epa is supposed to consider in establishing bat standards.see b b specifying that the epa should consider the age of equipment and facilities involved,the process employed,the engineering aspects of the application of various types of control techniques,process changes,the cost of achieving such effluent reduction,quality environmental impact including energy requirements,and such other factors as the administrator deems appropriate.however,the clean water act does not state what weight should be accorded to the relevant factors rather,the act gives epa the discretion to make those determinations.bp exploration oil,epa,cir.and as this court previously indicated in riverkeeper,epa,the administrator is obligated to inquire into the initial and annual costs of applying the technology and make an affirmative determination that those costs can be reasonably borne by the industry,cir.thus,if the epa determines,with adequate support in the record,that a given set of costs can not reasonably be borne by a given industry,courts must defer to that determination.
we believe that the epa has here determined,with adequate support in the record,that subpart d cafos can not reasonably bear the costs associated with option,because the conducting extensive economic analysis,involving numerous economic tests and that option would render of swine cafos and of subpart d cafos,on the whole,vulnerable to closure.see epa,final rule economic analysis at to 
environmental petitioners challenge the probity of the epa economic modeling,because,in their view,the epa should have assumed that cafos could offset their compliance costs by obtaining state and federal funding assistance and by passing the costs on to consumers cost passthrough.in evaluating this challenge,we wish to make clear,at the outset,that the epa determinations about costs,as well as the methodology that the epa employs in making such determinations,are entitled to deference while epa must take seriously its statutory duty to consider cost,courts of review should be mindful of the many problems inherent in an undertaking of this nature and uphold a reasonable effort made by the agency.wildlife fed epa,quoting fmc train,cir.a reviewing court can neither epa analysis nor undertake its own economic study rather,the court must uphold the regulations if epa has established in the record a reasonable basis for its decision.id.at citation omitted see also chem.mfrs.ass epa,cir a court inquiry will be limited to whether the agency considered the cost of technology,along with the other statutory factors,and whether its conclusion is reasonable citation omitted.
we believe that the epa has reasonably justified its decision not to consider either assistance or cost passthrough in promulgating the final cafo rule.first,with respect to assistance,the epa determined,within the bounds of its discretion,that there were too many uncertainties regarding the extent to which any such assistance would mitigate compliance costs and that,accordingly,it would be inappropriate to consider assistance as a reliable offset to compliance costs.in its proposed economic analysis,epa determined,for example,that although the usda environmental quality incentives program eqip could theoretically ease the economic strain that option might impose,the eqip program should not be relied upon because it might not cover all new applications from cafos,might limit the eligibility of cafos through various requirements,and might delay distributing funds to cafos given various waiting lists and geographic priorities.see epa,proposed rule economic analysis to.and while certain legislation passed by congress in eliminated some restrictions on eqip participation and substantially increased funding for eqip,epa still believed,at the time it conducted its final economic analysis,that the benefits of the eqip program were still too speculative to count on because it remained unclear what the actual funding levels would be,what limits might be placed on the types of waste management practices covered,and what share of dollars would be allocated to confinement opposed to other agricultural to operations.see epa,final rule economic analysis to.we can not say that the epa unreasonably determined that federal allocations were too uncertain to rely upon.
second,with respect to cost passthrough,we believe that epa determined,within the bounds of its discretion,that the possibility of passing costs on to consumers was also too uncertain to rely upon.the epa explained in its proposed rule economic analysis that farmers are at the bottom of a long food marketing chain,subject to imperfect market conditions characterized by local oligopsony conditions,or few buyers.see epa,proposed rule economic analysis,citing rogers and sexton,assessing the importance of oligopsony power in agricultural markets,amer.agr.econ.given the limited bargaining power of those who raise and confine animals,see id.at to,the epa thus concluded that i ndividual farmers generally have a limited ability to pass on increased costs associated with regulations and that,as a result,it would be a mistake to rely on cost passthrough.see id.at.we can not say that the epa acted unreasonably in making these determinations 
having rejected the challenges to the soundness of the epa economic models,we move finally to environmental petitioners claim that,even assuming the reasonableness of the epa economic modeling,the results do not support a finding that option was economically unachievable because the agency has,in other contexts,deemed economically achievable technologies that produced the same or worse economic costs.we reject this claim as well.the epa here estimated that option would expose up to of subpart d cafos to financial stress sufficient to create a risk of closure.see epa,final rule economic analysis at.while the treated more substantial risks of closure as nonetheless supporting a finding of economic achievability,see,chem.mfrs.epa,at upholding bat where of facilities would be forced to close,it is also true that the treated less substantial risks of closure as supporting a finding of economic unachievability.for example,the circuit has upheld an epa determination that a projected closure rate of less than could support a finding of economic unachievability.see wildlife fed epa.in the end,economic achievability is a determination the epa must make on an basis because each industry has its own special attributes and requires an individual assessment of appropriate financial criteria.and we must defer to such determinations unless they are unreasonable.see,at.
thus,we reject the environmental petitioners claim that the epa unlawfully selected option,rather than option,as bat for subpart d cafos.
challenge to the bct standard for pathogens 
the environmental petitioners next claim that the epa failure to adopt any requirements specifically designed to reduce pathogen discharges violates the clean water act and is otherwise arbitrary and capricious in violation of the administrative procedure act we agree with the environmental petitioners in part.
the epa does not dispute that it is required,under the clean water act,to promulgate effluent guidelines for at least one pathogen,namely fecal coliform.see a listing fecal coliform as a conventional pollutant subject to regulation b e requiring the promulgation of bct standards for pollutants.that is to say,the epa does not dispute that it is required to promulgate a technology standard for achieving pathogen reductions that reflects the best conventional pollutant control technology.the epa also does not here dispute that there is a more than de minimis presence of pathogens in the animal waste regulated by the cafo rule.in the preamble to the cafo rule,for example,the epa expressly acknowledges the presence of pathogens in animal wastes and the potential risk they pose to human health and the environment.preamble to the final rule at.see also epa,response to comments on the npdes permitting requirements and effluent limitations guidelines for concentrated animal feeding operations epa recognizes the presence of pathogens in animal wastes and the potential risk they pose to human health and the environment proposed rule at noting that livestock manure contains countless microorganisms,including bacteria,viruses,protozoa,and parasites,that m ultiple species of pathogens may be transmitted directly from a host animal manure to surface water and that o ver pathogens found in livestock manure are associated with risks to humans.
the epa argues that,notwithstanding the above,its failure to impose any elgs specifically designed to achieve pathogen reductions is justified.principally,the epa argues that the pathogen controls it did evaluate,most of which appear to relate to the use or potential use of anaerobic digestion technology,would not necessarily lead to significant pathogen reduction,but would impose significant costs,see preamble to the final rule at and the elgs otherwise adopted by the cafo rule may incidentally achieve some reductions of the pathogens in cafo discharges.see brief of respondents united states environmental protection agency,et at see also preamble to the final rule at although the elg requirements in this rule are not specifically designed to reduce the pathogens in animal wastes,today rule may achieve some reductions of pathogens in cafo discharges.
in our view,however,the cafo rule violates the clean water act because the epa has not made an affirmative finding that the elgs adopted in the cafo rule do in fact represent the best conventional pollutant control technology for reducing pathogens.the epa may well determine,within the bounds of its discretion,that the elgs otherwise adopted by the cafo do in fact represent the best conventional pollutant control technology for reducing pathogens.it may well be the case,to put it slightly differently,that the epa determines,after considering all the relevant factors,that the elgs otherwise adopted by the cafo rule will just pathogens and do so better than any other pollutant control technology.but we can not,consistent with the act,allow the epa to avoid imposing any other pollutant control technology without an express finding in this regard.the act requires that the epa select the best pollutant control technology for reducing pathogens,and we must enforce that requirement 
accordingly,we grant the petition to the extent that environmental petitioners challenge the epa failure to impose elgs specifically designed to reduce pathogens in cafo discharges as a violation of the clean water act.
challenge to the new source performance standard for swine,poultry,and veal 
the environmental petitioners claim that the epa new source performance standard for the production areas of swine,poultry,and veal cafos is arbitrary and capricious and the epa introduced a change to the standard that was not subject to public new source performance standard for the production areas of swine,poultry,and veal cafos violates the clean water act public participation requirements.we agree with them in part.
the clean water act requires the epa to promulgate new source performance standards nsps for new,as opposed to already existing,sources of pollution.see.the act provides that these standards must reflect the greatest degree of effluent reduction which the administrator determines to be achievable through application of the best available demonstrated control technology,processes,operating methods,or other alternatives,including,where practicable,a standard permitting no discharge of pollutants.a.the act further requires that the epa take into consideration the cost of achieving such effluent reduction,and any quality,environmental impact and energy requirements.b b.and we note that the epa is given considerable discretion to weigh and balance the various factors required by statute to set nsps.riverkeeper,epa,cir citation omitted.
the epa initially proposed that the nsps for the production areas of swine,poultry and veal cafos include various requirements,see proposed rule at,and also proposed that the nsps for the production areas of swine,poultry,and veal cafos include a total prohibition on production area discharges.see id.there must be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants into waters,including any pollutants discharged to ground water which have a direct hydrological connection to surface waters.in the final rule,however,the epa changed course in several respects the nsps did not include the requirements the nsps still barred all production area discharges,but provided that a cafo could comply with this requirement by designing,constructing,operating and maintaining production areas that could contain all manure,litter,and process wastewater including the runoff and the direct precipitation from a,rainfall event and the nsps empowered permitting authorities to establish alternative performance standards that allow production area discharges,so long as such discharges were accompanied by an equivalent or greater reduction in the quantity of pollutants released to other media by the cafo.see.the environmental petitioners here challenge all three aspects of the final nsps.
we reject the challenge to the extent that it concerns the epa failure to include requirements as part of the nsps.the epa decision not to include such requirements as part of the nsps was predicated on the same findings underlying its decision not to include requirements as part of the bat for subpart c cafos.and as we have already explained,we believe that these findings are supported in the record.see discussion supra.
however,we agree with the environmental petitioners that there is not adequate support in the record for either the epa decision to allow cafos to comply with the total prohibition requirement by designing,operating,and maintaining a facility to contain the runoff from a,rainfall event or the epa decision to allow cafos to comply with the total prohibition requirement through alternative performance standards.
with respect to the former,the epa claims that the,rainfall event design standard is functionally equivalent to or a logical outgrowth of a total prohibition standard.the epa has not,however,adequately substantiated this claim.for example,the epa never modeled the potential overflows and pollutant loads from a system with a,storm event design capacity so far as we can tell,the epa modeled only the potential overflows and pollutant loads from a system with a,storm event.and while certain studies may have shown that the production area bmps adopted by the cafo rule would have substantially prevented the production area discharges documented in the record,we think it obvious that substantially preventing discharges is not the same as prohibiting them outright.
with respect to the latter,the epa has not justified in any alone with adequate support in the decision to allow a cafo to comply with the total prohibition standard through an alternative standard permitting production area discharges so long as the cafo aggregate pollution is equivalent to or lower than what it would have been without the production area discharges.
additionally,because the epa did not indicate,until the adoption of the final rule,that it was considering either the,rainfall event option or the possibility of alternative performance standards,we find that the epa decision to adopt such provisions as part of the nsps for swine,poultry,and veal violates the clean water act public participation requirements.see e public participation in the development,revision,and enforcement of any regulation,standard,effluent limitation,plan,or program established by the administrator or any state under this act shall be provided for,encouraged,and assisted by the administrator and the states.
challenge to the epa failure to impose water quality based effluent limitations 
we now consider the final challenge brought in this consolidated petition,namely,whether the cafo rule violates the clean water act and is otherwise arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act because the rule fails to promulgate water quality based effluent limitations wqbels and also bars states from doing so.we agree with the environmental petitioners that it does,at least in part.
as stated above,the clean water act not only requires that the epa promulgate effluent limitations,but also provides that additional wqbels shall be established either by the epa,see a,or by the states,see where discharges of pollutants from a point source or group of point sources would interfere with the attainment or maintenance of that water quality in a specific portion of the navigable waters which shall assure protection of public health,public water supplies,agricultural and industrial uses,and the protection and propagation of a balanced population of shellfish,fish and wildlife,and allow recreational activities in and on the water.a.the act authorizes the imposition of such wqbels because t he limitations necessary to achieve a given level of water quality in one reach of a waterway may require more control of effluents than that attainable through application of the best available technology.a legislative history of the water pollution control act amendments of,committee print compiled for the senate committee on public works by the library of congress,ser.
the cafo rule does not,here,promulgate any wqbels.this much is clear.and this does not present a problem to the extent that the rule fails to bars the states from for any agricultural stormwater discharge,as that term is defined in e agricultural stormwater discharges are,after all,statutorily exempt from any effluent limitations,including wqbels,because they are not point source discharges.see.
what is fully unclear is why the cafo rule exempts discharges other than agricultural stormwater discharges from wqbels,and whether the cafo rule bars the states from promulgating wqbels for discharges other than agricultural stormwater discharges,and,if so,why.with regard to the former,the epa has here indicated its intention not to promulgate any wqbels whatsoever the preamble to the final rule states,after all,that the epa does not expect that water effluent limitations will be established for cafo discharges resulting from the land application of manure,litter or process wastewater.preamble to the final rule at.the epa has,however,only justified its determination not to impose wqbels,only insofar as agricultural stormwater discharges are concerned.see id.the epa has not attempted,in any way,to explain its failure to promulgate wqbels for cafo discharges other than agricultural stormwater discharges as that term is defined in e.the epa sidesteps the issue completely on appeal,and the preamble to the cafo rule similarly fails to explain,let alone justify,its decision.since there is otherwise evidence in the record suggesting that the epa effluent limitation guidelines may not,on their own,assure protection of public health,see,memorandum from laurel staley,chief,treatment and destruction branch,land remediation pollution control division,epa,re assessment of the necessity for controlling potentially infectious microorganisms in animal wastes,we find that the epa failure to justify the lack of wqbels for cafo discharges other than agricultural stormwater discharges violates a and is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the administrative procedure act accordingly,on remand,we direct the epa to explain whether or not,and why,wqbels are needed to assure that cafo discharges will not interfere with the attainment or maintenance of that water quality in a specific portion of the navigable waters which shall assure protection of public health,public water supplies,agricultural and industrial uses,and the protection and propagation of a balanced population of shellfish,fish and wildlife,and allow recreational activities in and on the water.a.
additionally,we find that the preamble to the rule is ambiguous about whether states may promulgate wqbels for discharges other than agricultural stormwater discharges as that term is defined in e.on the one hand,the preamble does,at one time,seem to suggest that states may promulgate wqbels it provides that a lthough,as noted above,manure and process wastewater discharges from the land application area are not directly subject to water effluent limits,epa encourages states to address water quality protection issues in their technical standards for determining appropriate land application practice.preamble to the final rule at.on the other hand,the preamble elsewhere says that where a cafo has implemented practices designed to ensure appropriate agricultural utilization of nutrients,it is free from any further regulation.to wit,the preamble states 
in explaining how the scope of cafo point source discharges is limited by the agricultural storm water exemption,epa intends that this limitation will provide a floor for cafos that will ensure that,where a cafo is land applying manure,litter or process wastewater in accordance with site specific practices designed to ensure appropriate agricultural utilization of nutrients,no further effluent limitations will be authorized,for example,to ensure compliance with water quality standards.
id.emphasis added.given the ambiguity in the preamble,and given the fact that at least one state has expressed concern that the rule prevents the imposition of any state wqbels,see wisconsin dep t of natural res.comments on epa proposed rule revisions for concentrated animal feeding operations at july,we believe it necessary for the epa to explain more clearly,on remand,whether in fact states may promulgate wqbels for discharges other than agricultural stormwater discharges as the term is defined in e and,if not,why.
accordingly,we grant the environmental petitioners challenge to the extent that they claim that the cafo rule is arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act because the epa has not sufficiently justified its decision not to promulgate wqbels for discharges other than agricultural stormwater discharges,as that term is defined in e.additionally,we grant the environmental petitioners petition to the extent that it seeks clarification of whether the cafo rule bars the states from promulgating wqbels 
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the petitions are granted in part and denied in part.we hereby vacate those provisions of the cafo rule that allow permitting authorities to issue permits without reviewing the terms of the nutrient management plans allow permitting authorities to issue permits that do not include the terms of the nutrient management plans and that do not provide for adequate public participation and require cafos to apply for npdes permits or otherwise demonstrate that they have no potential to discharge.we also remand other aspects of the cafo rule to the epa for further clarification and analysis.specifically,we direct the epa to definitively select a bct standard for pathogen reduction and a process that adequately involves the statutory and evidentiary basis for allowing subpart d cafo to comply with the new source performance standard by either a designing,constructing,operating and maintaining production areas that could contain all manure,litter and process wastewater including the runoff and the direct precipitation from a,rainfall event or b complying with alternative performance standards that allow production area discharges,so long as such discharges are accompanied by an equivalent or greater reduction in the quantity of pollutants released to other media.additionally,we direct the epa to clarify the statutory and evidentiary basis for failing to promulgate water quality based effluent limitations for discharges other than agricultural stormwater discharges,as that term is defined in e,and also direct the epa to clarify whether states may develop water quality based effluent limitations on their own.we uphold the cafo rule in all other respects.
the term discharge of a pollutant is defined to mean,inter alia,any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.a.
the term person is defined to mean an individual,corporation,partnership,association,state,municipality,commission,or political subdivision of a state,or any interstate body.
the term point source is defined to mean any discernible,confined and discrete conveyance from which pollutants are or may be discharged.notably,the act includes concentrated animal feeding operation as an example of a point source.id.
under b,an animal feeding operation afo is defined to mean a lot or facility other than an aquatic animal production facility where the following conditions are met i animals other than aquatic animals have been,are,or will be stabled or confined and fed or maintained for a total of days or more in any period,and ii crops,vegetation,forage growth,or residues are not sustained in the normal growing season over any portion of the lot or facility.
the cafo rule defines a concentrated animal feeding operation as an afo animal feeding operation that is defined as a large cafo or as a medium cafo by the terms of this paragraph,or that is designated as a cafo in accordance with paragraph c of this section.b.paragraph c provides that an appropriate authority either a state director,the epa administrator or both may designate an afo as a cafo upon a determination that the afo is a significant contributor of pollutants to waters of the united states.c.
according to b,the term medium cafo includes any afo with the type and number of animals that fall within any of the ranges listed in paragraph b i of this section and which has been defined or designated as a cafo.an afo is defined as a medium cafo if i the type and number of animals that it stables or confines falls within any of the following ranges a to mature dairy cows,whether milked or dry b to veal calves c to cattle other than mature dairy cows or veal calves.cattle includes but is not limited to heifers,steers,bulls and pairs d to swine each weighing pounds or more e to swine each weighing less than pounds f to horses g to sheep or lambs h to turkeys i to laying hens or broilers,if the afo uses a liquid manure handling system j to chickens other than laying hens,if the afo uses other than a liquid manure handling system k to laying hens,if the afo uses other than a liquid manure handling system l to ducks if the afo uses other than a liquid manure handling system or m to ducks if the afo uses a liquid manure handling system and ii either one of the following conditions are met a pollutants are discharged into waters of the united states through a ditch,flushing system,or other similar device or b pollutants are discharged directly into waters of the united states which originate outside of and pass over,across,or through the facility or otherwise come into direct contact with the animals confined in the operation.
however,the animal feeding operation raising the chickens must use something other than a liquid manure handling system.see b j.
b classifies an animal feeding operation as a large cafo if it stables or confines as many as or more than the number of animals specified in any of the following categories i mature dairy cows,whether milked or dry ii veal calves iii cattle other than mature dairy cows or veal calves.cattle includes but is not limited to heifers,steers,bulls and pairs.iv swine each weighing pounds or more v swine each weighing less than pounds vi horses vii sheep or lambs viii turkeys ix laying hens or broilers,if the afo uses a liquid manure handling system x chickens other than laying hens,if the afo uses other than a liquid manure handling system xi laying hens,if the afo uses other than a liquid manure handling system xii ducks if the afo uses other than a liquid manure handling system or xiii ducks if the afo uses a liquid manure handling system.
see,epa,development document for the final revisions to the national pollutant discharge elimination system regulation and the effluent guidelines for the concentrated animal feeding operations,noting that b y,the value of poultry production exceeded billion,and much of the poultry output was generated by corporate producers on large facilities producing more than birds.citations omitted.
the usda estimates that operations that confine livestock and poultry generate about million tons of animal manure each three times more raw waste than humans generate in the united states,according to the epa.preamble to the final rule at.
several estimates indicate that of waste is land applied.epa,state compendium programs and regulatory activities related to animal feeding operations may.
that suit,brought by the nrdc and public citizen,was resolved by a consent decree in which the epa agreed to propose new effluent limitation guidelines for the swine,poultry,beef and dairy subcategories of cafos.see consent decree,as amended,nrdc reilly,modified sub,nrdc whitman.
b defines production area as that part of an afo that includes the animal confinement area,the manure storage area,the raw materials storage area,and the waste containment areas.the animal confinement area includes but is not limited to open lots,housed lots,feedlots,confinement houses,stall barns,free stall barns,milkrooms,milking centers,cowyards,barnyards,medication pens,walkers,animal walkways,and stables.the manure storage area includes but is not limited to lagoons,runoff ponds,storage sheds,stockpiles,under house or pit storages,liquid impoundments,static piles,and composting piles.the raw materials storage area includes but is not limited to feed silos,silage bunkers,and bedding materials.the waste containment area includes but is not limited to settling basins,and areas within berms and diversions which separate uncontaminated storm water.also included in the definition of production area is any egg washing or egg processing facility,and any area used in the storage,handling,treatment,or disposal of mortalities dead animals.
the elgs promulgated by the cafo rule apply only to large cafos.see preamble to the final rule at.
we refer to both sets of petitioners as they refer to themselves.
the farm petitioners also challenge the cafo rule for impermissibly assuming jurisdiction over all surface waters,when the clean water act confers upon the epa the authority to regulate only navigable waters,a term defined by the act to mean waters of the united states,including the territorial seas.the epa has clarified,however,that the cafo rule employs the term surface waters only in an effort to distinguish surface water from groundwater and that the agency fully recognizes that its regulatory authority encompasses only the waters of
