ii.background 
in the early,the growers and other parties around the country sued dupont for damages caused by a dupont fungicide,benlate.the growers alleged that benlate was contaminated with a toxic chemical,sulfonylureas,that killed their plants instead of the fungus on their plants.notwithstanding ongoing accusations of discovery fraud and litigation misconduct against dupont in the growers case and other cases,dupont and the growers settled.the growers released dupont from all claims and promised not to commence any action against dupont based upon or in any way related to any causes of action,claims,demands,actions,obligations,damages or liabilities which are the subject of this release.the standard release also provided that the growers would pay attorney fees and costs for dupont were they to file claims contrary to the release.
following that settlement,events turned for the worse for dupont.in one of the first benlate cases to go to trial,in re dupont de nemours litigation.the bush ranch case,dupont was sanctioned and ordered to pay a fine of million for committing fraud on the court,contempt of court,and other discovery violations.the court found that dupont and its independent testing company alta labs,with the knowledge of its counsel alston bird,had falsified test results and other key corporate documents.id.at.after we reversed the district court in the bush ranch case on procedural grounds,see cir,the district court referred the matter to the united states attorney for prosecution,and dupont settled with the bush ranch parties for million.see matsuura alston bird,cir recounting the history of the bush ranch case.
after learning of the discovery infractions committed by dupont in the bush ranch case,the growers filed these lawsuits in the southern district of florida alleging fraudulent inducement,fraud on the court,rico violations,and other causes of action.dupont filed a counterclaim for breach of the settlement agreement.because the settlement agreements were governed by delaware law,the district court certified the following question to the delaware supreme court under delaware law,does the release in these settlement agreements bar plaintiffs fraudulent inducement claims in dupont de nemours florida evergreen foliage,the delaware supreme court ruled that the growers were not unambiguously barred by the settlement agreement from complaining that they had been fraudulently induced to settle by misinformation during discovery.
on august,the district court granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of dupont in one of the consolidated cases.an interlocutory appeal from that judgment was heard in this court and,in green leaf nursery dupont de nemours,we affirmed the district court.we held that florida law provides absolute immunity from tort claims based on a party conduct during the course of litigation.id.at.because dupont alleged misconduct occurred during the underlying litigation and during other benlate litigation,according to the supreme court of florida,florida law clearly provides an absolute immunity to dupont for their alleged misconduct.id.at.we also affirmed on the alternative basis that,even if dupont did not have an absolute immunity,the plaintiffs could not show that they reasonably relied on dupont misrepresentations in the light of the plaintiffs knowledge of its discovery violations in other cases.id.at.
the growers originally filed motions to make identical amendments to their complaints while their appeal in green leaf was pending,and the district court was without jurisdiction to grant leave to file an amended complaint.see id.at.on remand,the growers moved again to amend their complaints to allege new violations of the florida rico statute.dupont moved for summary judgment in all the consolidated cases.the district court denied the growers motions to amend their complaints.d.the district court reasoned that the growers could and should have made any necessary amendments to their pleadings years ago before this court and dupont expended enormous time and effort in addressing the merits of the claims asserted originally.id.at.the district court also held that the amended claims would be futile either because they would be substantially similar to claims rejected in green leaf or,alternatively,would fail to allege a rico enterprise under florida law.finally,the district court adopted the determination of the delaware supreme court that the settlement agreement did not bar the growers from filing fraudulent inducement claims and granted summary judgment against dupont on its breach of contract claim.id.at.
iii.standard of review 
we review the denial of a motion to amend a complaint for an abuse of discretion.compagnoni united states,cir.however,when the district court denies the plaintiff leave to amend due to futility,we review the denial de novo because it is concluding that as a matter of law an amended complaint would necessarily fail.freeman first union,cir citation omitted.we review a summary judgment de novo.in re optical,cir.
iv.discussion 
our resolution of this appeal begins with a review of the denial of the growers motions to amend their complaints.if the district court abused its discretion in denying the growers motions to amend their complaints,then the district court also erred by granting partial summary judgments,one for the growers and the other for dupont,based on the allegations of the growers unamended complaints.for that reason,we divide our discussion in three parts first,we review the denial of the growers motions to amend their complaints second,we review the partial summary judgment for dupont on the growers claims and,third,we review the partial summary judgment in favor of the growers on the breach of contact claim of dupont.
a.the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the growers motions to amend their complaints.
a party may amend the party pleading only by leave of the court or by written consent of the adverse party and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.a.u nless a substantial reason exists to deny leave to amend,the discretion of the district court is not broad enough to permit denial.shipner air lines,cir.a motion to amend may be denied on numerous grounds such as undue delay,undue prejudice to the defendants,and futility of the amendment.producers video,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the lengthy nature of litigation,without any other evidence of prejudice to the defendants or bad faith on the part of the plaintiffs,does not justify denying the plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their complaint.bryant dupree,cir.the district court denied the growers motions to amend because of untimeliness and futility.we address each ground in turn.
the growers argue that the district court denied their motions to amend their complaints solely based on the lengthy nature of the litigation or mere passage of time.we disagree.the district court referenced the length of time between the original complaints and the growers motions to amend to explain its finding of undue delay.see maynard bd.of regents of div.of univs.of.dep t of,cir because we conclude that the plaintiff has failed to
