we affirm the district court decision that a california law governing cleanup of a federal nuclear site violates the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity.because we decide that the state law impermissibly regulates and discriminates against the federal government and its contractor,we do not reach the question of whether the federal laws governing nuclear materials and cleanup of hazardous substances preempted the state law.we need not reach boeing section claim for a declaratory judgment and an injunction.
the federal government made and tested rockets,nuclear reactors,and various nuclear applications for war and peace at the santa susana field laboratory beginning shortly after world war ii.when built in the,this lab was far from people,thirty miles from los angeles in ventura county.los angeles grew,though,and now over people live within five miles of the site and half a million people live within ten miles.
when the state law challenged in this case was promulgated,acres of the acre lab site were federally owned and managed by the national aeronautics and space association nasa.most of the site,the remainder,was owned by boeing,a defense contractor,which acquired the land from another defense contractor,rockwell international corporation,in.rockwell international and its predecessor,north american aviation,had occupied or owned the land since.for convenience,we refer to boeing and its predecessors,rockwell international and north american aviation,as boeing.since the,the federal department of energy doe and its predecessor agencies have leased acres of the site from boeing,where it built and operated nuclear reactors of various sorts and over facilities for nuclear research.
these two federal agencies,doe and nasa,hired boeing to assist in the nuclear research and rocket testing.most of boeing work was as a contractor on behalf of the federal government,though it also did some commercial work on its own account at the site.boeing operated one commercial nuclear reactor under a license from the atomic energy commission.it also handled what the california statute calls radiological contaminants under licenses from the state of california to perform activities involving the use of machines,calibration devices,gas chromatographs,smoke detectors,and various gauges.
all this work created a terrible environmental mess.it also created tremendous benefits,for war and peace,but the government work unarguably imposed tremendous harm to the environment.the soil,ground water,and bedrock were seriously contaminated.disasters and foolishness added to the environmental harm.
in,one of the reactors experienced a partial meltdown that released radioactive gases into the atmosphere for three weeks.this partial meltdown accounts for about of the radioactive contamination.much of the rest came from other nuclear reactor accidents,an open burn pit for materials,and numerous fires and accidents at the hot lab.the hot lab was used for cutting up spent nuclear fuel from the site reactors and spent fuel shipped to the lab from elsewhere in the united states.radioactive material was also dumped at various locations around the site.one disposal procedure consisted of shooting barrels of toxic substances with shotguns to make them explode and burn.
the federal government,not boeing,appears from the record to be responsible for the radioactive pollution.though boeing conducted some commercial nuclear work at the site,no radioactive contamination has been traced to boeing private activity.it is undisputed in this case that the site radioactive contamination either resulted from federal activity or is indistinguishable from federal contamination.
that is not to suggest that the pollution was merely wanton.the united states air force and nasa used the site to test rocket engines for ballistic missiles and space exploration.in the,the air force hired boeing to help develop the navaho guided missile system.the air force and nasa also used boeing to test rocket engines,many of which were used in the space program.but over gallons of the solvent used to clean rocket engines and launch sites,trichloroethylene,contaminated the soil,along with heavy metals and other toxins.a trichloroethylene containment system was implemented in,after which boeing did its private commercial testing,but the damage was already done.california concedes that it can not identify any chemical contamination that resulted from activity and that,to the extent that there is any contamination from boeing private activity,it can not be distinguished from federal contamination.
all this nuclear and rocket research is over now.doe ended its nuclear research at santa susana in the.in,doe decided to close its research center and removed many of the facilities.the air force and nasa rocket research ended in.operations at the site now are limited to trying to clean it up.different aspects of the cleanup are carried out under different federal and state authorities.the federal government supervised the cleanup of radioactive contamination,and the california department of toxic substances control supervised the cleanup of chemical contamination under generally applicable state law.
the subject of this litigation is a state authority,as opposed to the federal government authority,to regulate the cleanup of radioactive pollution.the issue is whether the state may mandate more stringent cleanup procedures,not generally applicable within the state,to a particular site where the federal government undertook to clean up nuclear contamination it created.in the circumstances of this case,the answer is no.
so far,the federal department of energy,as successor to the atomic energy commission,has supervised and implemented the cleanup of radioactive material.under the atomic energy act,doe is responsible for establishing a comprehensive health,safety,and environmental program for managing doe nuclear facilities nationwide doe has implemented that authority by issuing orders that set health and safety limits for radioactive releases and cleanup and procedures 
to clean up the radioactive contamination,doe hired boeing.boeing conducted a study of the contamination at santa susana.the soil,bedrock,and groundwater contamination has been extensively sampled and analyzed.different parts of the site have different sorts of pollutants,since rocket testing was done in some areas,and nuclear research in others.in,doe adopted an environmental assessment for cleaning up radioactive waste in the area where nuclear research was performed.this federal plan proposed to clean it up to standards suitable for industrial,recreational,and even suburban residential use.as a cleanup contractor,boeing is actively cleaning up the santa susana site on behalf of doe.boeing pays a portion of the cleanup costs and will bear the portion of costs not paid by or recovered from the federal government.the federal government sets the standard for the entire cleanup of radioactive materials the only waste at issue in this case and directs boeing conduct.
not everyone was satisfied with the doe plan.the federal environmental protection agency epa,the state of california,and various advocacy groups have challenged both the plan and doe decision to prepare an environmental assessment as opposed to an environmental impact statement.the question whether an environmental impact statement should be prepared is not before us in this litigation.a federal district court injunction in another case prohibits doe from transferring ownership,possession,or control over anything in the primary area of radioactive contamination until it prepares an environmental impact statement 
chemical pollutants are regulated differently from radioactive pollutants the california department of toxic substances control regulates the cleanup of chemical contamination,pursuant to an agreement with epa authorizing state control,under a different federal statute from the one applicable to radioactive materials the various state and federal agencies involved,and boeing,agreed upon an order from california department of toxic substances control to clean up the chemical contamination to a level adequate for suburban residential use.that order does not address the cleanup of radioactive materials.
this case arises from the state of california decision to extend its control to cleanup of radioactive pollutants.in october,california passed senate bill,cleanup of santa susana field laboratory,prescribing cleanup standards for both radioactive and chemical contamination the statutory standard requires that the site be made suitable for suburban residential or rural residential agricultural use,whichever produces the lower permissible residual concentration for each contaminant found at the site the state statute does not further define the rural residential agricultural standard,but the federal epa agricultural standard apparently intended by the state statute assumes consumption of farm products for a subsistence farmer,getting all his or her vegetables,fruit,meat,fish,and milk from the land,along with incidental consumption of soil and inhalation of dust in effect,senate bill sb would require that hypothetical subsistence farmers could live safely on their farms eating nothing but their chickens,eggs,crops,and cheese and drinking their milk from their cows eating the grass,in this patch of nuclear and chemical toxic waste in the los angeles suburbs.
boeing and the federal agencies contend that this standard is more demanding than the usual practice under state and federal law of setting a cleanup level commensurate with a site reasonably foreseeable use it may well be unreasonable to foresee subsistence farming at the site.the record does not show why this standard was adopted,or whether subsistence farming of this sort was contemplated for the los angeles suburbs.the subsistence farming standard is more stringent than the suburban residential standard required by the order governing the cleanup of chemicals.doe cleanup procedures specifically rejected the state law standard as not a reasonable scenario for the site.boeing has made a public commitment to dedicate the site for public use as open space parkland,not subsistence farming.but reasonable foreseeability of subsistence farming is not the controlling issue in this case.the relevant tension in this case is the state authority to impose its subsistence farming standard as against the less stringent federal industrial,recreational,and residential standard.
until sb cleanup standard is met,the state law makes it a crime for any person or entity to sell,lease,sublease,or otherwise transfer the land the statement of uncontroverted facts,not disputed by the california department of toxic substances control,says that remediating the groundwater to the california standard could take as long as years.
boeing filed this lawsuit in federal district court challenging the validity of the california statute,sb,controlling cleanup of the santa susana laboratory grounds.boeing argued,and the district court agreed,that the federal government had preempted the field of regulation of nuclear safety,and alternatively that cleanup of radioactive materials at the santa susanna site is a federal activity,so state regulation of how the federal government cleans it up violates the supremacy clause and the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity.
the california department of toxic substances control california appeals.we vacated oral argument to give the government an opportunity to file an amicus brief,which it did.the federal government agrees with the district court that the state law,sb,is unconstitutional under the supremacy clause and alternatively,because congress has preempted the field.
the case was decided on summary judgment,so we review de novo 
california does not challenge boeing standing,but some advocacy groups as amici curiae do.their argument is that boeing suffers no injury in fact from sb because as a federal contractor,it will be paid for its work and bears no other costs.we disagree.the law prohibits boeing from transferring its own real property,injury enough even if the federal government does pay for all the cleanup work,the estimated year delay in transferability based on estimated time for cleanup of groundwater to be completed is indeed an injury in fact to boeing as landowner.nor has the federal government agreed to cleanup the entire site at its own expense to sb standards.california concedes that boeing will pay the portion of the cleanup expenses not borne by the federal government.injury in fact is clear.
ii.intergovernmental immunity 
under the supremacy clause,the activities of the federal government are free from regulation by any state.accordingly,state laws are invalid if they regulate the united states directly or discriminate against the federal government or those with whom it deals.sb is invalid on both grounds.
direct regulation of the government 
sb regulates the department of energy cleanup activities directly.sb authorizes california department of toxic substances control to use any legal remedies available under the state hazardous waste laws to compel a responsible party or parties to take or pay for appropriate removal or remedial action necessary to protect the public health and safety and the environment at the santa susana field laboratory site.doe is a responsible party with respect to radioactive contamination.all of the contamination at santa susana is the result of federal activity or is indistinguishable from contamination caused by federal activity.in addition,sb legislative findings state that the act is necessary in large part because of federal activity at the site and because doe declined to follow the joint policy between epa and doe and chose to instead rely on less protective cleanup standards.
the federal department of energy has accepted responsibility for the cleanup of radioactive contamination,and it is actively conducting the cleanup through its cleanup contractor,boeing.sb affects nearly all of doe decisions with respect to the cleanup,including the environmental sampling that is required,the cleanup procedures to be used,and the money and time that will be spent.the state law requires an application of more stringent cleanup standards than federal laws and doe cleanup procedures do.whether state law is better or worse does not affect state authority,just whether the state regulates federal activity.
the federal government decision to hire boeing to perform its cleanup work does not affect the legal analysis.in goodyear atomic miller,the supreme court held that a federally owned facility performing a federal function is shielded from direct state regulation,even though the federal function is carried out by a private contractor,unless congress clearly authorizes such regulation.in gartrell construction aubry,we held that california licensing requirements for construction contractors were preempted to the extent that they applied to federal contractors california argues that boeing must stand in the government shoes in order to assert immunity from state regulation.the cases that california cites to are inapposite as they discuss generally applicable state tax laws,which resulted in merely an increased economic burden on federal contractors as well as others.these tax laws did not regulate what the federal contractors had to do or how they did it pursuant to their contracts.
sb directly interferes with the functions of the federal government.it mandates the ways in which boeing renders services that the federal government hired boeing to perform.the state law replaces the federal cleanup standards that boeing has to meet to discharge its contractual obligations to doe with the standards chosen by the state.it overrides federal decisions as to necessary decontamination measures.unlike the tax cases,sb regulates not only the federal contractor but the effective terms of federal contract itself.
thus,sb violates intergovernmental immunity unless congress has clearly and unambiguously authorized california to exercise authority over the department of energy with respect to radioactive materials.it is well settled that the activities of federal installations are shielded by the supremacy clause from direct state regulation unless
