measure e is a kern county ballot measure that was designed to ban in unincorporated areas of the county the use of agricultural fertilizer made from recycled municipal sewage sludge.the application of this fertilizer,known in the industry as biosolids,is a major,widespread,comprehensively regulated form of recycling upon which many municipalities waste management systems depend.in fact,kern cities,including bakersfield,taft,wasco and delano,continue to apply biosolids to farmland in incorporated areas,which are unaffected by measure 
if enforced,measure e would have the effect of preventing plaintiff city of los angeles and others including kern county itself from continuing to apply biosolids in unincorporated areas as a means of disposing of sewage sludge on farms they either own or contract with in kern county.the litigation has been proceeding through federal and state courts for more than six years.most recently,the complaint was refiled in the superior court after a federal district court judgment invalidating the measure was vacated for reasons having nothing to do with the merits.just as the district court had done earlier,the superior court issued a preliminary injunction to prevent the measure from taking effect,and defendant kern county appeals.
just like the district court and the superior court,we conclude that a preliminary injunction was appropriate.we agree with both courts that plaintiffs were reasonably likely to succeed on two of their contentions that measure e is preempted by the california integrated waste management act pub.resources code,et ciwma,and that measure e conflicted with a state constitutional principle known as the regional welfare doctrine and therefore exceeded kern county authority.
we are confident the superior court did not abuse its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction in this case.first and foremost,the superior court,in a determination not challenged by any party in this appeal,concluded there was no evidence at all of hardship to kern county if the injunction were granted.the proponents of measure e insisted that land application of biosolids is dangerous,but the record in this case so far does not support their view.at the same time,there is a substantial likelihood of harm,including irreparable harm,to plaintiffs if the preliminary injunction is not granted.
a preliminary injunction should be granted when the moving party shows that it is likely to succeed on the merits of a cause of action and the balance of hardships resulting from granting or not granting the injunction tips in the moving party favor.the more likely it is that the moving party will prevail on the merits,the less strongly the balance of hardships needs to tip in its favor.in light of the undisputed lack of a showing of hardship to kern county,we conclude plaintiffs showing of a likelihood of success on the merits was more than sufficient.
factual and procedural histories 
local governments in california and elsewhere are continuously obliged to collect and treat municipal sewage and to dispose of the byproducts of sewage treatment.city of los angeles county of kern d,los angeles kern ii.these byproducts,known as sewage sludge or biosolids city of los angeles county of kern d,los angeles kern i w,have often been disposed of by placing them in landfills or incinerating them.in california,however,local governments are mandated by the ciwma to reduce their streams of solid waste going to landfills and incinerators.pub.resources code.one way in which they do this is to make their biosolids available for use as an agricultural fertilizer.this use is known as land application of biosolids.los angeles kern i,supra,d at.as of,percent of biosolids generated by sewage treatment plants in california were disposed of via land application.
land application of biosolids is subject to federal,state,and local regulations.in,the united states environmental protection agency epa issued part of title of the code of federal regulations part,which divides biosolids into a class a and a class b according to the quantity of pathogenic microorganisms remaining after treatment.class b biosolids are treated to eliminate percent of these microorganisms.the federal regulations allow land application of them with site controls,such as restrictions on human access to the farm fields and setbacks from property lines.
class a biosolids are treated to eliminate virtually all pathenogenic microorganisms.the federal regulations allow them to be applied to land with few restrictions and also allow them to be bagged and sold for home gardening use.a yet grade is class a exceptional quality eq biosolids.in these,eight trace metals may be present in concentrations no greater than a specified level.eq biosolids are not subject to part general requirements and management practices for land application.environmental protection agency,environmental regulations and technology,control of pathogens and vector attraction in sewage sludge july b,table.the state water resources control board swrcb has imposed additional regulations in the form of a general order issued in,water quality order dwq this general order requires each land application site to be approved before any biosolids are applied.before measure e,kern county also regulated land application of biosolids.these regulations included a prohibition on land application of all biosolids except class a eq biosolids.for purposes of this appeal,it is undisputed that plaintiffs complied with all the regulations in place before measure 
government regulators have generally maintained that land application of biosolids is safe and have promoted land application as a beneficial use of biosolids,as well as an effective means of disposing of the byproducts of sewage treatment without landfilling or incineration.los angeles kern ii,supra,d at.in,at the request of the epa,the national research council nrc evaluated the effectiveness of part in protecting human health.los angeles kern ii,supra,at.the nrc found no documented scientific evidence that the part rule has failed to protect public health.ibid.it called for additional scientific work is needed to reduce persistent uncertainty arising from anecdotal allegations of disease,as well as to ensure that the regulation standards were supported by current data and methods,that the management practices called for by the regulations were effective,and that the regulations were being enforced.ibid.additional research followed but found nothing to undermine the conclusion that land application of biosolids in compliance with the part regulations presents minimal risk to human health.ibid.
when the swrcb issued its regulations,it relied on a statewide program environmental impact report eir it had commissioned.california swrcb statewide program environmental impact report covering general waste discharge requirements for biosolids land application the eir concluded that the environmental impacts of land application of biosolids in compliance with the regulations would be less than significant.california swrcb,general waste discharge requirements of biosolids land application draft statewide program eir at es table es kern county,in its e regulations restricting land application to class a eq biosolids,stated that it recognize d that exceptional quality biosolids are considered by the environmental protection agency to be a product,whether distributed in bulk form,bags or other containers,that can be applied as freely as any other fertilizer or soil amendment to any type of land.the county stated,however,that it would evaluate the need for further regulation in the future.
apart from safety,land to which biosolids have been applied may have nuisance issues.it may emit a foul odor and attract flies.los angeles kern ii,supra,d at epa,biosolids generation,use,and disposal in the united states.
when the legislature enacted the ciwma in,plaintiff city of los angeles adopted a policy of beneficially reusing percent of its biosolids and disposing of none of them in landfills.in,it began a program of applying biosolids as fertilizer at green acres farm,a acre farm in the unincorporated area of kern county,miles southwest of bakersfield and miles north of los angeles.the city purchased the farm in for almost million.when kern county adopted the regulations restricting land application to class a eq biosolids,los angeles spent about million to upgrade its sewage treatment plants to enable them to process biosolids to the required quality level.today,about percent of the biosolids generated by los angeles sewage treatment plants are applied at green acres farm.
plaintiffs county sanitation district of los angeles county and orange county sanitation district began supplying biosolids to farmers for land application in the unincorporated area of kern county beginning in and,respectively.plaintiff responsible biosolids management,contracts with los angeles to manage the transportation of biosolids to green acres farm and the application of biosolids there.plaintiff sierra transport,contracts with responsible biosolids management,to carry biosolids from los angeles to green acres farm by truck.plaintiff r g fanucchi,contracts with los angeles to carry out the farming operations at green acres farm.plaintiff california association of sanitation agencies is a nonprofit corporation representing cities and other public agencies that provide sewer service to over percent of those californians who have sewer service.it maintains a biosolids program designed to promote the recycling of biosolids 
in june,measure e was placed on the kern county ballot.known as the keep kern clean ordinance of,it included the following statement 
there are numerous serious unresolved issues about the safety,environmental effect,and propriety of land applying biosolids or sewage sludge,even when applied in accordance with federal and state regulations.biosolids may contain heavy metals,pathogenic organisms,chemical pollutants,and synthetic organic compounds,which may pose a risk to public health and the environment even if properly handled.sampling and other monitoring mechanisms are not feasibly capable of reducing the risks associated with biosolids to a level acceptable to the people of kern county.land spreading of biosolids poses a risk to land,air,and water,and to human and animal health.it may cause loss of confidence in agricultural products from kern county.it causes the loss of productive agricultural lands capacity for human food production for significant periods of time.it presents a risk of airborne biosolid particulate matter in circumstances unique to kern county.it presents risks of unique odor,insect attraction,and other nuisances which are unacceptable to the people of kern county and can not be feasibly controlled to a risk level acceptable to the people of kern county.
for each of the foregoing reasons,individually and collectively,and in order to promote the general health,safety and welfare of kern county and its inhabitants,it is the intent of this chapter that the land application of biosolids shall be prohibited in the unincorporated area of kern county.
the federal district court described the angeles tone of the campaign.the court quoted the following campaign statements measure e will stop from dumping on kern we will proclaim our independence from polluting southern california and los angeles a lot of voters are just kind of tired of being the dumping ground for everyone else in the state enough sludge,enough sexual predators,enough prisons,enough dairies.when does the county stand up for itself los angeles kern ii,supra,d at.the campaign web site featured graphics that state keep sludge out of kern county and depict stacked outhouses,with the top labeled la county and the bottom labeled kern county.ibid.the web site had a link to an editorial stating 
until kern county voters say no to sludge and yes to measure e,every man,woman and child who lives here will have to put up with southern california dumping its human and industrial waste on us.why because kern county is the cheapest place for southern california to dump the chemical and goo that is scraped from the bottom of its sewer plants.measure e on the june ballot will prohibit the land application of sludge in unincorporated areas of kern county.southern california will have to find a better,safer way to dispose of its goo,which contains heavy metals,industrial solvents,feces,medical waste and pharmaceuticals.los angeles kern ii,supra,d at.
the district court quoted more campaign material of similar character los angeles kern ii,supra,d at and stated that the material was relevant to show the voters intent id.at,fn.some of these,and other similar,examples of campaign literature,are quoted in the record in this case as well.measure e passed with over percent of the vote.id.at.
measure e did not affect the incorporated areas of the county and could not have done so as those areas are outside the county jurisdiction.cities in kern county apply biosolids to farmland within city boundaries.the district court stated that these cities include bakersfield,taft,wasco,and delano.the district court also stated that percent of kern county voters live in incorporated areas los angeles kern ii,supra,d at,including percent in bakersfield alone id.at,and that t his means that over of the tolerate local disposition of locally generated biosolids,but have prevented recyclers from engaging in precisely the same activity by banning the operation of any biosolid recycling facilities in the unincorporated areas of the county id.at.
plaintiffs filed suit in federal court shortly after measure e passage.their complaint alleged that measure e contravened the negative or dormant implications of the commerce clause of the federal constitution,violated the equal protection clause of the federal constitution,exceeded the county police power by violating the regional welfare doctrine,and was preempted by the federal clean water act,the ciwma,and provisions of the california water code.the complaint prayed for declaratory judgment,an injunction,and damages.
the district court granted plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction on november.los angeles kern i,supra,d at.it found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of three claims the dormant commerce clause violation,ciwma preemption,and exceeding the county police power by violating the regional welfare doctrine.los angeles kern i,supra,at.the court also found that the balance of hardships tipped sharply in plaintiffs favor.id.at.los angeles would lose some of the value of the million it had spent buying green acres farm and the million it had spent upgrading its facilities to comply with kern county earlier regulations.it also would face increased costs of million annually to operate a program of applying biosolids to land at another location.county sanitation district of los angeles county and orange county sanitation district would need to dispose of more biosolids in landfills and would incur costs in sending their biosolids to more distant sites.ibid.los angeles contractors and subcontractors responsible biosolids management,sierra transport,and r g fanucchi,all would face costs,including risk of total business failure,if los angeles were prevented from continuing its biosolids operation at green acres.id.at.the harm to kern county from biosolids application,by contrast,was merely potential,and not yet supported by substantial evidence.id.at.
on august,the district court granted plaintiffs motion for summary adjudication on two causes of action and entered judgment for plaintiffs.los angeles kern ii,supra,d at.the court ruled that there were no triable issues of material fact about,and that plaintiffs were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on,the dormant commerce clause claim and the ciwma preemption claim.los angeles kern ii,supra,at.the court found it could not grant summary adjudication on plaintiffs police welfare claim.it believed the resolution of this claim depended on remaining factual questions about the suitability of green acres farm as a site for biosolids application and the reasons for los angeles decision to use green acres farms instead of a site closer to the city.id.at.the court entered judgment for plaintiffs even though it had not granted summary adjudication on all claims because its rulings on the dormant commerce clause and the ciwma preemption rendered the remaining claims moot.los angeles kern ii,supra,at.
without reaching the merits of any of plaintiffs claims,the ninth circuit in dismissed plaintiffs dormant commerce clause claim and vacated the district court judgment.city of los angeles county of kern cir.the court of appeals held that plaintiffs lacked prudential standing to bring the dormant commerce clause claim in federal court because,being located in the same state as defendants,their interest in sending biosolids to kern county did not fall within the zone of interests protected by the dormant commerce clause doctrine.id.at.the court vacated the entire judgment of the district court and remanded with instructions to that court to consider whether it should exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the ciwma preemption claim.city of los angeles county of kern,supra,at.in an unpublished order filed november,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and dismissed the case,leaving plaintiffs to pursue relief in state court.the court stated that principles of comity strongly supported dismissal because the remaining issues raised sensitive issues about the allocation of state and local power in california,which would be better resolved in state court.
on january,kern county sent plaintiffs an enforcement notice stating that plaintiffs were subject to measure e and must stop applying biosolids within six months of the date of the letter.plaintiffs filed their complaint in superior court on january,the complaint alleged ciwma preemption,the police welfare doctrine claim,and the dormant commerce clause claim.it also alleged two additional claims based on the california constitution.
plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.in an order meriting reproduction at length here,the tulare county superior court found that plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of the police welfare claim and the ciwma preemption claim.it also found that plaintiffs had shown a balance of hardships tipping sharply in their favor 
on the police welfare doctrine claim legislation is a valid exercise of the police power if it is reasonably related to the general welfare,with the caveat associated home builders livermore cal d that if the enactment has an effect beyond the territory of the enacting local government,the general welfare to be considered is that of the entire affected area and not just that of the local jurisdiction.
the enactors must identify,consider,and weigh any competing interests affected.the question for a reviewing court is whether,considering the extraterritorial effect of the ordinance,it represents a reasonable accommodation of any competing interests.
the record is devoid of any consideration of any competing interests,and of any attempt to accommodate any competing interests.since e was enacted by initiative,there is no legislative history to look at.we are left with campaign material,which,as a generality,seems to be an indication the proponents were seeking to prevent big la from taking advantage of little kern by exporting its foul products to kern and dumping them in kern.
the competing interests here are kern need to protect its citizens from the unknown potential harm from biosolids,and their alleged effect on the reputation of kern agricultural products,versus la need to dispose of biosolids in an environmentally appropriate and least costly manner.
there is no law with statewide application which prohibits the land application of biosolids.
there are federal and state laws and regulations which contemplate the propriety of the land application of biosolids,and which regulate that activity.
california does not consist of separate fiefdoms,or of three or four separate regions,all insular from each other.as noted by the court of appeal in county sanitation dist.county of kern,in the context of effects to be considered in an eir,localities can not retreat into isolationism and ignore this fact.we all live here,and what any state actor does elsewhere may affect us all.
la can not engage in source reduction.its population is increasing.it has to do something with its biosolids,and whatever it does,and wherever it does it,someone will be affected.
a reasonable accommodation would seem to be the ordinance,restricting the land application to a grade biosolids.
e represents no accommodation.a complete ban precludes an accommodation.
the court thus finds that there is a very reasonable probability that la will prevail on the theory that e is invalid as beyond the scope of an allowed police power measure.
on the ciwma preemption claim the declared policy of the act is to promote source reduction,recycling,and of solids to reduce the amount going into landfills.
kern argues that the act only promotes but does not require this.however,as stated by the court of appeal in county sanitation district,supra,the act requires the use of recycling and source reduction to reduce the amount of solid waste going into landfills and this legislation caused sewage sludge to be diverted from disposal in landfills in favor of recycling it as a fertilizer applied to agricultural land.
the act allows local regulation not in conflict with the policies of the act,but a complete ban is not a permitted regulation.
e takes away as to kern county a method of disposing of biosolids that state law specifically requires be promoted by local governments.
the court finds that it is reasonably probable that la will prevail on the theory that e is invalid as contrary to state law.
on the balance of hardships la presents declarations from qualified individuals with first hand knowledge of the sites and,particularly as to green acres,who have studied the test reports relating to the subject biosolids.
these experts opine that continued biosolid applications will not affect the groundwater will not affect the water banks nearby that metals will not leach down anywhere near the water level.they opine that the net effect of the application is a benefit to kern,in that it improves the soil and allows marginal land to grow crops.
la presents declarations from qualified persons with respect to the costs incurred to date,and additional significant costs,and expenses which would be incurred in effectuating alternatives to continued kern application,and the adverse environmental effects of some of these.
other plaintiffs present declarations regarding the effect on their business and employees jobs were land application to be stopped by kern.
la also discusses the time which would be required to set up and start operations with alternatives,specifically a composting facility.
kern presents a declaration,without reference to the subject sites and conditions,to the effect that there is some literature in the united states without differentiating between a and b classes indicating there could possibly be some as yet unknown risks which biosolids could pose.
kern also now claims there are composting businesses in kern with permits sufficient to handle the quantity of biosolids being applied by.however,there is no evidence these sites would take it all,or of how long a process would be required to do so la says at least months.
kern presents declarations from water bank operators,with no admissible information other than that the banks are in the area of green acres.
kern presents no evidence of any actual harm to the environment to the air,water,or soil,as a result of la continued application of biosolids.
kern does present individual complaints of adjacent for the most part employees to the effect that the two farms smell bad,and that there are many flies in their area adjacent to the farms.
per other declarations,there are also dairies in the area.dairies are famous for the pervasive odor of urine and manure,and for flies.the same goes,to a lesser extent,for cattle ranches and horse ranches.
the declarants are careful to say the smell is different from dairy smell but do not compare on an offensiveness scale.
it can not be ascertained from the declarations the extent to which the flies result from the application of biosolids,or from other uses,nor the extent to which there may also be smell from dairies,the cattle ranch,and the horse operation.
there is some degree of smell inherent in agricultural operations.dairies smell feedlots smell.dairies are frequently scraped,and the untreated manure applied to other ag land as fertilizer,causing that land to smell.
dairy pond water is also frequently used for irrigation,also causing smell from the watered land.
there are fly and odor control requirements in la water quality permit,with only one fly violation noted years ago.
the l egislature has long recognized that a problem,consisting mainly of many nuisance suits,was being caused by residential encroachment into ag areas,particularly dairies chino.
this resulted in the l egislature enacting,in,the right to farm law civil code section,under which any farm or processing plant,cc section legally in operation for three years could not be declared a nuisance due to a change in the area.
these complaints represent something those of us who live in agricultural areas know we simply have to put up with as part of our local ag based economy.
the declarants here report an annoyance to their olfactory sensibilities with apologies to justice richli for stealing her phrase in the nature of a private nuisance.this does not represent a health and safety issue.
la seeks to preserve the long time status quo.the private nuisance aspects are limited to a few individuals working immediately adjacent to the property.kern presents no evidence whatsoever of any health and safety or environmental actual harm.
la presents evidence of substantial monetary harm and the inability to quickly adapt to alternatives.individual plaintiffs present evidence of irreparable harm consisting of job losses.
there is no public policy reason to deny the injunction,and a good public policy reason to grant it.
the court finds that there is no evidence at all that kern will suffer any harm or injury by the grant of the injunction,and that there is a substantial likelihood of significant,and some irreparable,harm to plaintiffs if the injunction is denied.
discussion 
the granting of a preliminary injunction is governed by code of civil procedure section.the trial court must consider two interrelated factors a the likelihood that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits at trial,and b a comparison of the harm the plaintiff will suffer without the injunction with the harm the defendant will suffer with it.king meese cal d.the more likely it is that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits,the less severe must be the harm it will suffer if the injunction does not issue.id.at.
we review the trial court decision for an abuse of discretion.king meese,supra,cal d at.where,as here,the superior court has granted the injunction,the restrained defendant can prevail on appeal by showing that the court abused its discretion as to only one of the two factors.smith adventist health th,smith.kern county is therefore correct in its assertion that we must reverse if the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on at least one cause of action,even if plaintiffs have proved that the balance of hardships tips in their favor.at the same time,the degree of likelihood of success on the merits that plaintiffs had to show is affected by kern county undisputed total failure to show any hardship to it from the granting of the injunction.
under the abuse of discretion standard,to the extent that the challenged ruling was based on factual findings,we affirm if the ruling is supported by substantial evidence.to the extent that the ruling was based on pure conclusions of law,we review it independently.smith,supra,th at.
i.the limitations period under united states code section d 
kern county first argues that plaintiffs can not succeed on the merits because their complaint was untimely filed in the superior court.plaintiffs maintain that it was filed timely.the dispute arises from the parties competing interpretations of subsection d of united states code section,a federal statute that governs the limitations period for refiling a dependent claim in state court after it has been dismissed by a federal court.in our view,plaintiffs interpretation is correct.
united states code section a provides that federal district courts have supplemental jurisdiction over claims that are part of the same case or controversy as claims over which those courts have original jurisdiction.section c provides that the district courts may decline this supplemental jurisdiction under certain circumstances.section d provides for an extended statute of limitations for the refiling in state court of claims as to which supplemental jurisdiction has been declined.it states that t he period of limitations for any claim asserted under subsection a shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of days after it is dismissed unless state law provides for a longer tolling period.
plaintiffs argue for the natural interpretation of this language the statute of limitations stops running while the claim is pending in federal court and for days after it is dismissed then the statute of limitations begins to run again from the point where it left off.so,for instance,suppose a state law claim has a statute of limitations of one year,and the plaintiff files it in federal court six months after it accrues.later,the federal court decides not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claim and dismisses it.at that point,the statute of limitations begins to run again and the plaintiff has the remaining six months plus the days added by united states code section d to refile in state court.under this interpretation,the statute of limitations stopped running in this case when plaintiffs filed their complaint in federal court shortly after measure e passage in and did not begin to run again until days after the district court dismissed the case on november,so that plenty of time remained when plaintiffs filed the complaint in superior court in january 
plaintiffs rely on the third district court of appeal opinion in bonifield county of nevada th,and on a federal district court opinion,in re vertrue marketing sales practices litigation d.those cases state that the running of the limitations period is suspended during the pendency of the claim in federal court and for days after its dismissal plaintiffs consequently refer to their interpretation of united states code section d as the suspension approach.bonifield holds to toll the statute of limitations period means to suspend the period,such that the days remaining begin to be counted after the tolling ceases.bonifield,supra,at.in consequence,after dismissal,a plaintiff has that number of days plus days to refile in state court.id.at.plaintiffs also cite cases reaching the same conclusion.goodman best buy,turner kight.
kern county interpretation of united states code section d is that the limitations period is not suspended while the claim is pending in federal court,and instead continues to run during that time but if it would otherwise expire during that time or during the days after dismissal,then it is extended until the day after dismissal.kern county relies on the second district court of appeal opinion in kolani gluska th kolani,on two cases berke buckley broadcasting huang ziko,and on an unpublished case from the supreme court of the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands juan government of commonwealth of northern mariana islands wl,all interpreting united states code section d in this way.kern county refers to these courts interpretation as the extension approach.
kern county also cites chardon fumero soto,in which the supreme court discussed different kinds of tolling effect a law that tolls a limitations period can have.a tolling effect is the method of calculating the amount of time available to file suit after tolling has ended.the statute of limitations might merely be suspended if so,the plaintiff must file within the amount of time left in the limitations period.if the limitations period is renewed,then the plaintiff has the benefit of a new period as long as the original.it is also possible to establish a fixed period such as six months or one year during which the plaintiff may file suit,without regard to the length of the original limitations period or the amount of time left when tolling began.id.at,fn.
kern contends that the suspension approach and the extension approach are equally plausible readings of the words of the statute,and that we must break the tie in favor of the extension approach because of policy considerations identified by the kolani court.in that court view,the suspension approach is unreasonable since it is not needed to avoid forfeitures,because days is ample time for a diligent plaintiff to refile his claims and keep them alive.kolani,supra,th at.the suspension approach also would do significant harm to the statute of limitations policy,which the court described as ensuring prompt filing of claims.ibid.
the two approaches are not equally plausible readings of the statutory language,however.kern is correct that there is authority for the view that toll does not always equal suspend,but that is what it most plausibly means in the context at issue here.the alternative argued for by kern that toll means extend simply does not fit into the sentence congress drafted.what happens if we substitute the words suspend and extend for toll in that sentence the period of limitations for any claim shall be suspended while the claim is pending and for a period of days after it is dismissed makes sense and straightforwardly expresses the meaning for which plaintiffs contend.the period of limitations for any claim shall be extended while the claim is pending and for a period of days after it is dismissed,by contrast,is obscure and would be an obtuse way of expressing the meaning for which kern contends.the fact that other meanings of toll have been identified in case law therefore sheds no light on what toll means here.if congress had intended the rule kern supports,it could have written that the period of limitations for any claim that would otherwise expire while it is pending or during a period of days after it is dismissed shall be extended by days from the time of dismissal,or something similar.it did not.
further,it is far from clear that policy reasons favor kern interpretation.in essence,kern says it is better policy not to exclude the time when the case was pending in federal court from the calculation of the limitations period because that way claims must be refiled sooner after dismissal.that policy is better for defendants,of course just as the plaintiffs approach is better policy for plaintiffs.we,however,are neutral as between and policy considerations.the law does encourage prompt filing of claims,but it balances that concern with a concern for ensuring that meritorious claims can have their day in court.there is no rule that,where one interpretation of a statute results in a longer limitations period and another results in a shorter,a court should always choose the shorter.there being no policy factor favoring either side here,the linguistic considerations discussed above carry the day.
for these reasons,we reject kern county argument that plaintiffs complaint was not timely filed in the superior court.
ii.preemption by the ciwma 
when it enacted the ciwma in,the legislature set out to reduce the quantity of solid waste being sent to landfills and incinerators statewide.section required every city and county to use source reduction,recycling,and composting to divert percent of its solid waste from landfills and incinerators by january,and percent by january.the key provision of the ciwma for purposes of this case,section,provides 
in implementing this division,the board and local agencies shall do both of the following 
a promote the following waste management practices in order of priority 
source reduction.
recycling and composing.
environmentally safe transformation and environmentally safe land disposal,at the discretion of the city or county.
b maximize the use of all feasible source reduction,recycling,and composting options in order to reduce the amount of solid waste that must be disposed of by transformation and land disposal.for wastes that can not feasibly be reduced at their source,recycled,or composted,the local agency may use environmentally safe transformation or environmentally safe land disposal,or both of those practices.
section reinforces the mandates of section.it explains that the overarching purposes of the ciwma include maximizing recycling 
the purpose of this division is to reduce,recycle,and reuse solid waste generated in the state to the maximum extent feasible in an efficient and manner to conserve water,energy and other natural resources,to protect the environment,to improve regulation of existing solid waste landfills,to ensure that new solid waste landfills are environmentally sound,to improve permitting procedures for solid waste management facilities,and to specify the responsibilities of local governments to develop and implement integrated waste management programs.
finally,in section,the legislature made it clear that,although local government was still authorized to make its own regulations on land use and solid waste management facilities,these regulations would be valid only if reasonable and consistent with the ciwma and its policies 
this division,or any rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto,is not a limitation on the power of a city,county,or district to impose and enforce reasonable land use conditions or restrictions on solid waste management facilities in order to prevent or mitigate potential nuisances,if the conditions or restrictions do not conflict with or impose lesser requirements than the policies,standards,and requirements of this division and all regulations adopted pursuant to this division.
under state law preemption principles,a county is authorized to make ordinances only if they are not in conflict with general laws.cal,art.xi.if otherwise valid local legislation conflicts with state law,it is preempted by such law and is void.candid enterprises,grossmont union high school dist.cal d.a conflict exists if an ordinance contradicts general law morehart county of santa barbara cal th,and an ordinance is contradictory to general law when it is inimical thereto sherwin williams city of los angeles cal th.
we agree with plaintiffs that they are likely to prevail on their claim that the ciwma preempts measure section requires local agencies like kern county and the city of los angeles to p romote and m aximize recycling.an ordinance of one local government that prohibits,within its jurisdiction,the employment by another local government of a major,widely accepted,comprehensively regulated form of recycling is not consistent with this mandate.
in great western shows,county of los angeles cal th,the california supreme court discussed but had no occasion to adopt a federal case containing an analysis that is helpful here.blue circle cement,board of county com rs cir,considered a local ordinance that purported to grant local authorities discretion to ban industrial waste disposal and treatment facilities within a county,even though the federal resource conservation and recovery act et had as one of its main purposes the enlistment of state and local governments in a cooperative effort to facilitate the recovery of materials and energy from solid waste.the court of appeals held that the federal statute did not permit a total ban on industrial waste facilities because the use of these to recover resources was an activity encouraged by that statute.our supreme court stated that the case stood for the proposition that when a statute or statutory scheme seeks to promote a certain activity and,at the same time,permits more stringent local regulation of that activity,local regulation can not be used to completely ban the activity or otherwise frustrate the statute purpose.great western shows,supra,at.
under this analysis,which we consider appropriate here,measure e is likely to be held invalid because land application of biosolids,which undisputedly allows solid waste to be disposed of through recycling instead of in landfills or incinerators,is an activity the ciwma seeks to promote and measure e purports totally to ban.some local regulation of biosolids may be compatible with the ciwma.for instance,in county sanitation dist.county of kern,supra,th at pages,we upheld over several challenges not involving the ciwma the kern county regulation that preceded measure e and that restricted land application to class a eq biosolids.that regulation might be acceptable under the ciwma as well.a total ban,however,is inimical to the ciwma.
kern county several counterarguments are unpersuasive.it first contends that plaintiffs can not bear the heavy burden of demonstrating preemption because solid waste was a traditional subject of local control before the passage of the ciwma and because,under the ciwma,a large role remains for local government,which is charged with formulating and implementing waste management plans.kern county accuses the trial court of ignoring these propositions,but we perceive no deficiency in its order in this regard.the fact that solid waste management was a subject of local control before the ciwma,and the fact that local government is still involved in solid waste management under the ciwma,can not save measure e from preemption if measure e conflicts with the ciwma.
kern county next contends that the potential preemptive scope of section is strictly limited by its opening phrase,in implementing this division it asserts that this phrase means local governments are required to promote and maximize recycling and other methods only when setting up and carrying out their own waste management reduction plans as required by the ciwma.they are under no obligation to do so when regulating waste generated outside their jurisdictions.it maintains that when its voters adopted measure e,they were not implementing the ciwma,so the requirements of section are irrelevant.
this can not be correct,at least under the circumstances of this case.land application of biosolids is a widely used,widely accepted,comprehensively regulated method by which municipalities fulfill their obligation to reduce the flow of waste to landfills.kern county jurisdictions use it just as others do.one jurisdiction action to ban it,and to interfere with other jurisdictions efforts to comply with their ciwma obligations,is not consistent with a statutory scheme that presumes all jurisdictions will have access to crucial methods.if we held that kern county is empowered to ban land application of biosolids,we would necessarily be implying that all counties and cities are empowered to do the same.as the superior court observed,los angeles has to do something with its biosolids.the same goes for every city and county in the state.kern county asks us to adopt a position that would authorize all local governments to say not here.that principle would not be consistent with a statute that requires all local governments to adhere to waste management plans in which recycling is maximized.the ciwma announces statewide goals and means to achieve them.kern county claims an entitlement to ban those means and thwart the achievement of those goals for others so long as it is complying with its own obligation to reduce the flow of waste it collects itself.this claim will likely be rejected in a trial on the merits 
section supports our conclusion.it states as two separate purposes of the ciwma the maximizing of recycling and the specification of local governments responsibilities in managing their own jurisdictions waste.this further undermines kern county notion that the mandates of section relate only to local governments plans to manage their own jurisdictions waste.
kern county next offers an argument based on section.that section provides that n othing in this chapter shall infringe on the existing authority of counties and cities to control land use or make land use decisions,and nothing in this chapter provides or transfers new authority over that land use to the board.kern county says this provision means the ciwma does not preempt measure e.since sections and are not in the same chapter as section,however,it is difficult to see how the disclaimer about what that chapter does not do could negate the preemptive effect of sections and.
in an attempt to meet this problem,kern county says that the chapter containing section delineates procedures for the creation and approval of local governments waste management programs,that the approval is given by the board,now,the department of resources recycling and recovery,and that therefore the board approval authority can not infringe on the existing authority of counties to make land use decisions.in our view,all this is irrelevant to the preemption question.the statute clearly states a purpose of requiring all jurisdictions to maximize recycling and other methods of reduction,and kern position would allow all jurisdictions to undermine that purpose by banning methods of reduction.whether the department of resources recycling and recovery could theoretically order a city or county not to ban a major method is not a question we need to answer as it would have no bearing on this case.
kern county next cites section b of title of the california code of regulations,a provision promulgated pursuant to the ciwma.that regulation requires each city and county to consider changing zoning and building code practices to encourage recycling of solid wastes,such as,rezoning to allow siting of a recycling center in residential neighborhoods or revising building codes to require adequate space be allotted in new construction for interim storage of materials.kern county says this implies that local governments can change their ordinances to encourage recycling if they want to do so,but they are never required to change them for that purpose consequently,the superior court was wrong to find that measure e is likely to be held invalid.
the regulation does not support kern county conclusion.the regulators decision to require cities and counties to consider whether any of their ordinances should be changed to encourage recycling is entirely consistent with the court decision that one ordinance illegally blocks recycling.to tell governments they may encourage recycling voluntarily by changing their ordinances does not imply that they may ban major forms of recycling if they wish 
kern county next contends that plaintiffs biosolids application activities do not count as recycling for purposes of the ciwma.this is so,kern county maintains,because section allows governments to receive credit toward their goals based on land application of biosolids only if the department of resources recycling and recovery makes findings after a hearing that the biosolids will not pose a threat to public health or the environment.the purpose of this requirement is to ensure that each sludge diversion,for which diversion credit is sought,meets all applicable requirements of state and federal law,and thereby provides for maximum protection of the public health and safety and the environment,subd.b.plaintiffs do not claim there were any administrative hearings or findings regarding their biosolids.they state,instead,that they never sought diversion credit for their biosolids activities at least as to plaintiff city of los angeles because they began recycling the waste before the ciwma took effect,so that activity was included in the baseline from which additional reductions were required to be made.
kern county view misses the point.the goal of the ciwma is to reduce the stream of waste going to landfills and incinerators,regardless of what counts for diversion credit.measure e thwarts an important category of recycling that reduces the waste stream going to landfills.the illegality of this does not depend on whether plaintiffs are receiving diversion credit for any particular biosolids.to put the point another way if we adopted kern county position,then all cities and counties would be free to ban land application of biosolids at all locations,including those for which a
