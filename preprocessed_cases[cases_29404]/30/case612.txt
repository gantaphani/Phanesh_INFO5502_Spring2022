central south dakota cooperative grazing district grazing district appeals the district court grant of summary judgment affirming administrative action by the united states department of agriculture forest service forest service the grazing district argues that the forest service violated the national environmental policy act of nepa,specifically,because it failed to consider reasonable alternatives to reducing grazing levels in the fort pierre national grasslands grasslands,and that its methodologies for assessing species populations and range conditions were so unreliable that they made its choice of stocking levels arbitrary and capricious.the forest service responds,in part,by asserting that the grazing district lacks standing to pursue its nepa claim.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the forest service.
background 
the national forest management act of nfma,et,provides for a forest planning process.first,the forest service is to develop a land and resource management plan forest plan,which is a general planning tool that provides guidelines and approved methods by which forest management decisions are to be made.sierra club robertson,cir.forest plans are to be prepared in accordance with nepa.g robertson,at.second,the forest service implements the forest plan through actions,assessing each such action to determine its compatibility with the forest plan,nepa and other applicable law.sierra club united states forest,cir hereinafter forest service.if the proposed action was not adequately analyzed in an environmental impact statement or eis for the forest plan,as required by nepa,a eis must be completed,unless the agency has determined through its environmental assessment or ea that the project will not significantly affect the environment finding of no significant impact,or fonsi,in which case the ea itself may suffice.q forest service,at.
under this nfma configuration,a forest plan identifies suitable grazing lands,while permits to graze,if appropriate under that general plan,are issued pursuant to an appropriate project analysis.see generally lujan national wildlife fed n,d mining permits forest service,at timber sales robertson,at same natural res.defense council,hodel,grazing permits.grazing permits convey no right,title,or interest in lands or resources,b,and are subject to modification according to changes in management needs or resource conditions,a.
in this case,the grazing district is an association that has a permit to graze cattle upon the grasslands.in,after completion of an eis,the forest service adopted and approved the nebraska national forest land and resource management plan nebraska forest plan to regulate use of the grassland resources.this plan emphasizes wildlife habitat,directing the forest service to a lter grazing systems,season of use,and stocking levels to enhance wildlife habitat.it also requires the forest service to have developed residual cover guidelines for the grouse and greater prairie chicken by the close of fy.in to having considered all resource factors,seeking involvement of all interested parties,or conducting the requisite nepa forest service authorized the issuance of permits to graze cattle on the grasslands at a maximum stocking rate of animal unit months aums documentation incorporated into the grazing district grazing agreement indicated that proper range condition analyses needed to be conducted,that when residual cover requirements were established,the permits would be subject to them and that as monitoring and evaluation were conducted,the stocking levels could be revised.
after extensively studying the impact of grazing on the wildlife habitat,the forest service ultimately determined that the stocking level made it impossible to satisfy the nebraska forest plan requirements for rangeland health and productivity,wildlife habitat,woody draw habitat,and soil and water protection.therefore,in accordance with the nfma and nepa,the forest service prepared an environmental assessment in which it considered maximum grazing levels of an alternative considered at the request of the grazing district,and aums,along with a alternative.in,after giving public notice and receiving comments,the forest service issued a decision notice establishing the total maximum stocking level for the grasslands at aums and made a finding of no significant impact for the selected level.
the grazing district subsequently filed a complaint seeking judicial review of this agency action.both the grazing district and forest service filed simultaneous motions for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the forest service.
ii.agency action 
we review a district court summary judgment decision de novo,applying the same standards as those applied by the district court.friends of the boundary waters wilderness dombeck,cir.when reviewing agency action intended by congress to carry the force of law,we accord substantial deference to the agency interpretation of the statutes and regulations it administers.compare id.with united states mead,d distinguishing degrees of deference to agency action pursuant to chevron natural res.defense council,d,and skidmore swift,based on whether congress intended to delegate authority to regulate with the force of law,and friends of airport faa,cir indicating that agency rulings not reached as the result of adjudicatory adversary proceedings or formal rule making are not entitled to deference but are nevertheless accorded respect by the courts to the extent they have the power to persuade.here,it is apparent that congress intended that public land be managed with the force of law,see,providing intricate detail for land management process,including,notably,public participation.following statutory and regulatory guidance,the forest service amended the grazing plan through the public comment process.
although nepa does not authorize a private right of action,the administrative procedure act apa provides for judicial review of agency action.sierra club slater,cir.under the apa scheme,we must uphold agency action unless it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law,at quoting a.
a decision is arbitrary and capricious if 
the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.

we therefore accord appropriate deference to the agency action under both acts.because the grazing district does not indicate that additional evidence is necessary to resolve its claims,we will consider them on their merits and not remand to the district court see dombeck,at.
a.the national environmental policy act 
as a threshold issue,the forest service contends that the grazing district lacks standing to pursue its nepa claim.the issue of standing implicates constitutional limitations on federal court jurisdiction and prudential limitations on the exercise thereof.bennett spear,d.prudential standing is ascertained according to the test,that is whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.id.at.quoting association of data processing serv,camp,d.article iii standing is assessed based on test,which,for associations,includes the issue of whether the interests at stake are germane to the organization purpose.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.services toc,d.here,the grazing district unavailing efforts to demonstrate that it has prudential standing reveal that it also lacks article iii standing.see id.at.
the forest service reasons that b ecause the grazing district has suffered only economic injury,it has no standing under nepa.the forest service logic makes a good deal of sense in light of nepa overall purpose of establishing a broad national commitment to protecting and promoting environmental quality,robertson methow valley citizens council,d,including promot ing efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere.nevertheless,nepa standing jurisprudence requires us to closely scrutinize the asserted basis for standing.see,sierra club morton,d hawaii county green party clinton,d.
economic interests alone are clearly not within the zone of interests to be protected by nepa.churchill truck lines,united states,cir accord,western radio servs,espy,cir.however,even though nepa procedures are not implicated unless a plaintiff has an environmental injury at stake,once those procedures have been invoked,a plaintiff can assert an injury arising from the agency failure to consider nepa particular purpose or provisions,which might include economic considerations.dombeck,at.still,whether a plaintiff interest is arguably protected by a statute under the test for prudential standing is determined by reference to the particular provision of law upon which the plaintiff relies,and not by reference to the overall purpose of the act in question.bennett,at.
here,the grazing district argues that c and a,along with dombeck,provide for protection of economic interests.the grazing district ignores that in this matter,the forest service issued a fonsi and therefore no eis was prepared,which is of central import to section c and to dombeck,at stating that the particular provisions relied on by the plaintiffs indicate that the social and economic effects of proposed agency action must also be considered once it is determined that the proposed agency action significantly affects the physical environment.robinson knebel,cir distinguishing churchill based on the fact that,in that case,the agency had not filed an eis,and thereby finding prudential standing where a plaintiff environmental concerns were not so insignificant that they ought to be disregarded altogether.also,like section,section a,which addresses maintaining conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony,is a broad policy statement.regardless of that overall broad policy,we must look to the specific provision under which the grazing district raised its nepa claim.bennett,at.
the grazing district relies on a nepa provision that requires all federal agencies to study,develop,and describe appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action in any proposal which involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.e.this provision requires agencies to consider alternatives to proposals where an eis is not required,but unlike considerations within an eis,does not specifically consider the human environment.compare id.with c requiring eis that includes detailed statement on alternatives to the proposed action on major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,and human environment shall be interpreted comprehensively to include the natural and physical environment and the relationship of people with that environment.this means that economic or social effects are not intended by themselves to require preparation of an environmental impact statement.when an environmental impact statement is prepared and economic or social and natural or physical environmental effects are interrelated,then the environmental impact statement will discuss all of these effects on the human environment.citation omitted.
based on the statutory structure and language,the manifest purpose of section e is to require federal agencies to consider environmentally sound alternatives to proposed actions without reference to the human environment and,thus,to economic interests.this impels us back to the position highlighted in churchill,which is that an economic injury is an insufficient basis for prudential standing within the meaning of nepa.at.consequently,if its interests are only economic,the grazing district is not within the zone of interests of the provision under which it has asserted its claim and thereby lacks prudential standing.
acknowledging that an economic interest was an insufficient basis for standing,to find a requisite environmental interest,the district court relied on the grazing district complaint,which asserts that evaluation of the management indicator species population trend data demonstrated that wildlife habitat was sustained under the stocking rate authorized by the grazing agreement.however,for an association to have article iii standing to bring suit on behalf of its members,the interests at stake must be germane to the organization purpose.friends of the earth,at.the grazing district is a corporation of individual ranchers organized to cooperatively operate and manage grazing lands.we find no indication that the grazing district has any interest in protecting the wildlife habitat within the grasslands.moreover,the grazing district fails to show that the forest service action will cause environmental injury to itself or its members.see id.consequently,the grazing district lacks article iii standing to pursue its nepa claim.
reasonable alternatives 
even if we were to assume the grazing district requisite standing,its nepa claim still fails.the grazing district argues that the forest service violated nepa by failing to consider or evaluate alternatives that permitted stocking rates over aums.we reject this contention.
as we indicate above,the forest service found that the chosen stocking level would have no significant impact on the environment when an agency has concluded through an environmental assessment that a proposed project will have a minimal environmental effect,the range of alternatives it must consider to satisfy nepa is diminished.missouri mining,icc,cir.an agency latitude in this vein is not,however,unbounded.yet,to prevail on its claim,the grazing district must demonstrate that its preferred stocking level is within the range of alternatives that reasonably needed to be considered.id.it has failed to do so.
an agency need not consider all policy alternatives in its,motor vehicle,at.nor must an agency pursue policy alternatives that are contrary to the pertinent statutory goals,dombeck,at,or do not fulfill a project purpose,city of richfield faa,cir.accord citizens against burlington,busey,indicating a proposed alternative is reasonable only if it will bring about the ends of the federal action.in contrast to a policy alternative generally,an alternative within the ambit of an existing s tandard may not be abandoned without any consideration whatsoever.motor vehicle,at.still,an agency may revoke a standard if it reasonably explains the available evidence and offers a rational connection between that evidence and its choice.id.at.when an agency has considered relevant evidence and arrived at a rational result,a party mere dissatisfaction with the agency decision does not entitle it to relief.von eye united states,cir.
the grazing district argument that the ea acknowledged that grazing at the aum level had achieved usda habitat goals for grouse,is a somewhat generous reading favoring its position.again,the aum stocking level was only temporarily authorized when the nebraska forest plan had not been subjected to the requisite nepa or scientific range analysis.since,the actual stocking rate had not risen above aums,and the forest service acknowledgment rested on its assessment of the average habitat suitability between and.more importantly,as the forest service explained in its ea,nesting cover under the most favorable conditions barely satisfied the habitat goals when the actual stocking level was below aums,and,therefore,as we see it,that level was an impetus for modification of the permitted stocking level.in addition,the
