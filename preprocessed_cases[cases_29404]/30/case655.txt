when a smelter emits lead,arsenic,cadmium,and mercury compounds through a smokestack and those compounds contaminate land or water downwind,can the of the smelter be held liable for cleanup costs and natural resource damages under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,a all parties agree the answer turns on whether the smelter can be said to have arranged for the disposal of those hazardous substances within the meaning of cercla.bound by a previous en banc case interpretation of deposit the only theory of disposal urged by plaintiffs in this interlocutory appeal as not including the gradual spread of contaminants without human intervention,we must answer no.
background 
the history of legal disputes over damage caused in the state of washington by emissions of toxic chemicals from defendant teck cominco metals,teck smelter,located ten miles north of the border in trail,british columbia,stretches back almost years the claim in this lawsuit is only the latest chapter in the saga.
this particular lawsuit initially focused on a different form of waste disposal teck dumping of slag into the columbia river.the early procedural history of the river pathway claims in this lawsuit was recounted in prior appeals and is not repeated here.pakootas teck cominco metals,cir.pakootas ii pakootas teck cominco metals,cir.pakootas i.since our last published opinion in this case,some issues relevant to the river pathway claims have proceeded to trial in the district court phase i while other issues remain to be tried.
while phase i was ongoing,plaintiff the confederated tribes of the colville reservation and the state of washington collectively,plaintiffs sought leave to file a third amended complaint to add a new cercla claim,alleging that,in addition to dumping hazardous substances into the river,teck also emitted hazardous substances into the air.those substances were carried by air currents to the upper columbia river site ucr site,including upland areas of the ucr site the district court initially denied the motion as untimely.however,after the phase i trial was completed,the district court changed its position and allowed plaintiffs to amend their complaints to add claims for cost recovery and natural resource damages resulting from teck aerial emissions.
plaintiffs fourth amended complaints allege 
from approximately to the present time,teck cominco emitted certain hazardous substances,including,but not limited to,lead compounds,arsenic compounds,cadmium compounds and mercury compounds into the atmosphere through the stacks at the cominco smelter.the hazardous substances,discharged into the atmosphere by the cominco smelter travelled through the air into the united states resulting in the deposition of airborne hazardous substances into the upper columbia river site.
the environmental impact of the air emissions are described thus 
over time significant volumes of teck cominco slag,liquid waste and air emissions,and the hazardous substances contained therein,have come to be located in,and cause continuing impacts to,the surface water and ground water,sediments,upland areas,and biological resources which comprise the upper columbia river site.
evidence shows that the physical and chemical decay of slag,the settling of metals associated with liquid waste,the deposition of air emissions,and the subsequent release of elements including,but not limited to,arsenic,cadmium,copper,zinc,and lead,is an ongoing process in the buried slag,sediment and soils of the upper columbia river site.
humans are exposed to slag and contaminated sediment by direct contact with slag on the beaches of the upper columbia river and lake roosevelt,contact with contaminated sediment during low draw down periods,inhalation of airborne particles,dermal contact,and ingestion.in addition,humans are exposed from ingestion of water from the upper columbia river or lake roosevelt and through consumption of fish,aquatic resources,native plants,and agricultural crops.
environmental effects of slag include both chemical increased metal loads,potential bioaccumulation,toxicity problems in biota and physical scouring of plants and animals in substrates,severe erosion of fish gills,smothering of habitat components.
paragraph numbers omitted.
teck moved to strike or dismiss these claims on the ground that cercla imposes no liability when hazardous substances travel through the air and then into or on any land or water as opposed to when hazardous substances are directly deposited into or on land or water and are then emitted into the air.the district court rejected teck argument and denied the motion.
one month later,the ninth circuit issued center for community action environmentaljustice bnsf railway,cir,which held that emitting diesel particulate matter into the air and allowing it to be transported by wind and air currents onto the land and water did not constitute disposal of waste within the meaning of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra.teck filed a motion for reconsideration,arguing that center for community action foreclosed plaintiffs air pathway claims because cercla rcra definition of disposal.the district court denied the motion on the ground that the actionable cercla disposal in this case occurred when the hazardous substances emitted by teck entered the land or water at the ucr site,not when the substances were initially released into the air.however,recognizing that i n over years of cercla jurisprudence,no court has impliedly or expressly addressed the issue of whether aerial emissions leading to disposal of hazardous substances into or on any land or water are actionable under cercla,the district court certified the question for interlocutory appeal.we granted permission to appeal and now reverse and remand.

iii.discussion 
principles of statutory interpretation 
statutory interpretation begins with the text of the statute.unless a statute provides an explicit definition,we generally give words their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.chubb custom ins.space loral,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.if the meaning of the text is unambiguous,the statute must be enforced according to its terms.w hen deciding whether the language is plain,we must read the words in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.king burwell,internal quotation marks omitted.reviewing the whole statutory scheme is particularly important for a law such as cercla,which is a complex regulatory statute with a web of sections,subsections,definitions,exceptions,defenses,and administrative provisions.chubb custom,at quoting carson harbor,at.
cercla statutory text and framework 
cercla sets forth a comprehensive scheme for the cleanup of hazardous waste sites pakootas i,at.the statute has two primary goals to ensure the prompt and effective cleanup of waste disposal sites,and to assure that parties responsible for hazardous substances bear the cost of remedying the conditions they created.chubb custom,at alteration omitted quoting city of los angeles san pedro boat works,cir.
cercla does not set forth its own definition of disposal,the key word at issue in this case.rather,it rcra.the term disposal shall have the meaning provided in.rcra defines disposal as 
the discharge,deposit,injection,dumping,spilling,leaking,or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water so that such solid waste or hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters,including ground waters.
the word disposal and derivations thereof disposing,disposed appear in several places in cercla.in order to prevail in a private action under cercla for response costs or natural resource damages,a plaintiff must prove the following elements,among others 
the site on which the hazardous substances are found is a facility within the meaning of cercla,
a release or threatened release of any hazardous substance from the facility has occurred,a and 
the defendant is within one of the four broad classes of potentially responsible parties prps listed in a.
stevens creek assocs.barclays bank of,cir.
a facility is defined in relevant part as any site or area where a hazardous substance has been deposited,stored,disposed of,or placed,or otherwise come to be located.emphasis added.
a release is defined as 
any spilling,leaking,pumping,pouring,emitting,emptying,discharging,injecting,escaping,leaching,dumping,or disposing into the environment including the abandonment or discarding of barrels,containers,and other closed receptacles containing any hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant 
id.emphasis added.
the four prp classes are 
the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility,
any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of,
any person who by contract,agreement,or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment,or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment,of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person,by any other party or entity,at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances,and 
any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities,incineration vessels or sites selected by such person 
id.a emphases added.
cercla allows a number of affirmative defenses.two of them,the innocent landowner defense and the bona fide prospective purchaser defense,protect facility owners from liability if they can prove,inter alia,that they did not acquire the facility until after the disposal of hazardous substances at the facility 
in sum,the word disposal appears in the definitions of facility and release,the definitions of three of the four prp classes,and the innocent landowner and bona fide prospective purchaser defenses.our interpretation of disposal for purposes of determining whether teck can be held liable for arranging the disposal of hazardous substances has ripple effects throughout the rest of the statute,even though the only provision technically in dispute is a.see carson harbor,at.
whether teck arranged for disposal 
plaintiffs argue that they have properly alleged the deposit of hazardous substances into the land or water at the ucr site one of the verbs used to define disposal.
plaintiffs aerial deposition theory appears to depend on teck allowing hazardous substances to be deposit ed at the ucr site by the wind,as opposed to teck directly depositing hazardous substances there the dictionary definitions cited by plaintiffs all refer to natural forces slowly depositing layers of dirt or mud over time.for example,american heritage dictionary defines deposit,in relevant part,as t o put or set down place or t o lay down or leave behind by a natural process layers of sediment that were deposited on the ocean floor glaciers that deposited their debris as they melted.deposit,the american heritage dictionary,search for deposit last visited.defines deposit as to lay down or to let fall as sediment,as in layers of mud deposited by flood waters.deposit,search for deposit last visited.oxford dictionaries defines deposit as of water,the wind,or other natural agency lay down matter gradually as a layer or covering,as in beds where salt is deposited by the tide.deposit,oxford dictionaries,last visited.
plaintiffs interpretation appears a reasonable enough construction of a,and if we were writing on a blank slate,we might be persuaded to adopt it.however,we do not write on a blank slate.our en banc court in carson harbor and a prior panel in center for community action earlier interpreted the terms deposit and disposal.in carson harbor,the majority held that the term deposit,as used in cercla,is akin to putting down,or placement by someone and that n othing in the context of the statute or the term disposal suggests that congress meant to include chemical or geologic processes or passive migration,the gradual spread of contaminants without human intervention.at.it reasoned,where congress intended such a meaning,it employed specific terminology,such as leaching.id.at.
center for community action,which involved essentially the same facts as this case,see at alleging emission of hazardous substances into the air,some of which was directly inhaled before they touched the ground,and some of which touched the ground before being into the air by air currents,interpreted as requiring solid or hazardous waste to first be placed into or on any land or water and thereafter be emitted into the air.id.at.it observed that congress knew how to use the word emit when it wanted to.id.at.the disposal definition itself uses the term emitted in the second half of the sentence,but not the first.rcra definition of release uses the term emitting along with disposing.id.cercla definition of release is similar.id.these suggest that congress did not imagine emission as disposal,although it did allow that hazardous substances could escape into the environment through emission after they were disposed of,such as if a container of gas began to leak.
plaintiffs have offered no persuasive argument to distinguish either carson harbor or center for community action.we agree with plaintiffs that center for community action interpretation of disposal for rcra purposes does not absolutely foreclose a different interpretation of disposal for cercla purposes but the reasoning behind center for community action textual analysis is persuasive.similarly,carson harbor addressed former owner liability under a and not arranger liability under a,but plaintiffs offer no compelling reason to interpret deposit differently for purposes of those two subsections of cercla.
if interpreting deposit as not including teck conduct would thwart the overall statutory scheme or lead to an absurd result,chubb custom,at,in some way not considered by those cases,there might be some basis for deviating from them.however,the only inconsistencies with the statutory scheme that plaintiffs have pointed out is that cercla has a broad remedial purpose and that teck interpretation might render cercla federally permitted release exception surplusage.with regard to the first argument,it is axiomatic that cercla should be construed liberally to effectuate its remedial purpose,but statutory interpretation must still be grounded in the statute text and structure.cts waldburger.as for the second argument,the federally permitted release exception,see h,j,and the legislative history behind it hint that congress might have intended cercla to apply to emissions of hazardous substances up to the point where it ran into the clean air act.however,the federally permitted release exception could also be read as addressing emissions as releases and not emissions as a form of disposal.in contrast,plaintiffs interpretation of deposit seems to be inconsistent with the rest of cercla in the same way identified as problematic by carson harbor if aerial depositions are accepted as disposals,disposal would be a process,essentially eliminating the innocent landowner defense.at.
given that the language of cercla is not a model of precise crafting,id.at n either a logician nor a grammarian will find comfort in the world of cercla,we ordinarily would refer to legislative history to help us interpret the statutory language.tides v.the boeing,cir.if the statutory language is ambiguous we may refer to legislative history to discern congressional intent.however,the legislative history of cercla is not particularly helpful in this case.although that history makes clear that cercla was intended to be construed expansively,see united states grace,cir,it sheds no light on the question before us because congress did not appear to consider a fact pattern like this one 
nor have we been presented with an agency interpretati
