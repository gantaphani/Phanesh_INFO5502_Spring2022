introduction 
a second superceding indictment charged john edward hubenka with three counts of discharging pollutants into the wind river in violation of the clean water act,a and c a.a jury found hubenka guilty on all three counts.hubenka appeals his convictions.he argues his activities on the wind river lie beyond the reach of the clean water act.hubenka also contends the district court violated rule b of the federal rules of evidence when it admitted into evidence certain testimony about hubenka past activities on the wind river.this court exercises jurisdiction pursuant to and affirms.
ii.background 
the wind river originates in wyoming wind river range,on the east slope of the continental divide near togwotee pass.from there,it flows southeast through the wind river indian reservation.near riverton,wyoming,the wind river is joined by the little wind river and the popo agie river.downstream from this confluence,the river is called the big horn river.water in the big horn river flows north,joins the yellowstone river in montana,and eventually flows east into the missouri river.the wind river flows,with higher volume in the late spring and early summer,and lower volume in the fall and winter 
appellant john hubenka works as a manager for the leclair irrigation district lid and lives on a ranch near the wind river approximately eighteen miles west of riverton.although the river is not a property boundary,it roughly separates hubenka land on the north from the wind river indian reservation to the south.lid maintains a diversion gate on the river to the northwest of hubenka property.the diversion gate allows water from the river to flow into an irrigation canal which parallels the north side of the river for some distance.
in the vicinity of hubenka property,the wind river is a braided stream which flows through multiple channels within a broad flood plain.historically,the river main flow was contained in a north channel which was closer to the lid irrigation canal and further from the indian reservation.
over the years,hubenka and lid have attempted to divert the flow of the river away from the north channel so that the bank of the river does not erode and threaten the irrigation canal.in,lid obtained a permit from the united states army corps of engineers corps to stabilize the north bank of the river at and downstream from the diversion gate.at the same time,lid dredged the river bottom,effectively moving the main channel of the river away from the north bank.lid original permit did not authorize this recontouring of the river bottom,but in the corps granted lid a permit which retroactively allowed the dredging.hubenka signed as the permitee on behalf of lid.
in,under hubenka supervision,lid constructed a dike in the north channel of the wind river,slightly downstream of its diversion gate.the dike was constructed using river cobbles as well as scrap metal,cottonwood trees,car bodies,and a washing machine.similarly,downstream from the dike on hubenka property,the north bank of the river was reinforced with scrap metal and construction debris.the corps sent lid,via hubenka,a notice of violation.the notice advised lid that its actions constituted unauthorized discharges and instructed lid to refrain from adding material to the dike and to remove the debris.the corps sent a similar notice of violation directly to hubenka.
in october of,tom johnson,a representative of the corps,conducted a site visit to assess whether the prohibited materials had been removed.during the site visit,johnson observed a truck dumping more material on the dike.after discussions with hubenka and other representatives of lid,the corps took action to require lid to remove the dike in its entirety and to require hubenka to remove all debris except for clean concrete from the river bank on his property.after lid and hubenka complied with the corps directive,the agency worked with them to develop and issue a permit to stabilize the north bank of the river downstream from the diversion gate using more acceptable techniques and materials the stabilization project was constructed in and successfully protected the north bank from erosion even during periods of high water.
at some point in the late or early in,the river primary course shifted from the north channel to a new south channel.relative to the north channel,the south channel is closer to the indian reservation and further from the lid irrigation canal.the cause of the river change in course is unclear.several witnesses living nearby testified that the wind river shifted to the south channel naturally.the corps johnson,however,felt the change was not natural.johnson,an expert in hydrology,testified that something else happened to cause that sudden and dramatic change.
in march of,hubenka hired heavy equipment operator curtis neal to construct a series of dikes or berms in the north channel of the wind river.using a bulldozer,neal pushed river cobble from the north channel to form an initial dike at the point where the north and south channels diverge,just downstream of the lid diversion gate.dike one blocked the north channel by directing high flows along the face of the dike and into the south channel.downstream from dike one,hubenka had neal construct a second dike parallel to the south channel.dike two prevented water from the south channel from returning to the north channel.further downstream,neal constructed a third dike dike three which again blocked water from reentering the north channel all of the dikes were below the ordinary high water mark of the wind river.none of the dikes was authorized by a permit from the corps.
early in,hubenka was charged with three violations of the clean water act.specifically,the government alleged that each of the three dikes constructed in constituted a knowing discharge of pollutants into the wind river,a water of the united states within the jurisdiction of the clean water act.hubenka was convicted on all three counts.
iii.analysis 
application of the clean water act to the wind river 
hubenka argues the corps authority to regulate dredge and fill activities under the clean water act does not extend to his activities on the wind river.he contends the corps is without jurisdiction because the dikes were built in a river that is neither nor adjacent to other waters,and because the dikes have no effect on navigable waters downstream.we must decide whether the district court erred in concluding that the clean water act gives the corps authority to regulate hubenka construction activities in the north channel of the wind river.the construction and applicability of the clean water act is an issue of law which this court reviews de novo.see united states telluride,cir.
under the clean water act,the corps has jurisdiction over dredge and fill activities in navigable waters.a.the statute itself defines navigable waters as waters of the united states.id.as the supreme court has recognized,congress chose to define the waters covered by the act broadly.united states riverside bayview homes,d.
at first,corps regulations interpreted the clean water act so as to apply only to waters.see id.at.in,however,the corps issued new regulations which redefined waters of the united states.id.under the revised regulations,the clean water act applied not just to waters,but inter alia,to tributaries of navigable waters and interstate waters.id.substantially identical regulations remain in place today.see a tributary rule.hubenka argues the corps tributary rule inappropriately expands the agency jurisdiction under the clean water act and exceeds the agency statutory authority to regulate discharges of dredged and fill material.
analysis of the tributary rule under the chevron framework 
when a case involves an agency interpretation of a statute it administers,this court uses the approach announced in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.see utah wilderness alliance dabney,cir.under this approach,when congress has addressed the precise question at issue,we give effect to the express intent of congress.id.citing chevron,at.if the statute is silent or ambiguous,however,we defer to the agency interpretation,so long as it is permissible.id.citing chevron,at.
under the first step of the chevron framework,this court must determine whether the clean water act precisely addresses the question of whether congress intended to include within the act purview tributaries of navigable or interstate waters.as noted above,the clean water act applies to navigable waters,which it defines as waters of the united states.the supreme court has observed that congress broad definition evidenced an intent to exercise its powers under the commerce clause to regulate at least some waters that would not be deemed navigable under the classical understanding of that term.riverside,at.nevertheless,the statute does not reveal the extent to which nonnavigable tributaries may be regulated.accordingly,t he statutory term waters of the united states is sufficiently ambiguous to constitute an implied delegation of authority to the corps.united states deaton,cir.because the clean water act definition of navigable waters is ambiguous,we move to the second step of the chevron analysis.
normally,under chevron second step,this court will defer to an agency interpretation of a statute that it administers,so long as the agency interpretation is permissible.see chevron,at.hubenka argues,however,that the corps tributary rule reaches the outer limits of constitutional authority and raises serious constitutional questions.in such circumstances,hubenka contends,this court should not extend chevron deference to the corps regulations.see solid waste agency of cook county army corps of engineers swancc,d.
in swancc,the supreme court reviewed the corps migratory bird rule.id.at.the migratory bird rule purported to extend the corps jurisdiction under the clean water act to isolated intrastate waters,so long as those waters were used as habitat by certain migratory birds.id.at.the court struck down the migratory bird rule,concluding the text of the clean water act clearly did not contemplate such expansive federal jurisdiction.id.at.it went on to note,however,that even if the statute itself had not clearly addressed the issue,the court would not have extended chevron deference to the migratory bird rule.id.the court determined the corps rule invoke d the outer limits of congress power,and could find no indication that congress intended that result.id.at.it further observed that the migratory bird rule raise d significant constitutional questions.id.at.the court read the statute to avoid the significant constitutional and federalism questions,and therefore declined to give chevron deference to the corps migratory bird rule.id.at.
in contrast to the migratory bird rule at issue in swancc,the corps tributary rule neither invokes the outer limits of congress power nor raises significant constitutional questions.it has long been settled that congress has extensive authority over this nation waters under the commerce clause.kaiser aetna united states,d.it has the power to regulate waters to limit pollution,prevent obstructions to navigation,reduce flooding,and control watershed development.see,riverside,at.united states republic steel,d united states appalachian power.moreover,congressional authority is not limited to waters it exists throughout watersheds and can encompass actions on nonnavigable,intrastate tributaries.see,riverside,at.oklahoma ex rel.phillips guy atkinson.
given this background,it is not surprising that courts have consistently acknowledged congress authority to regulate the discharge of pollutants into nonnavigable tributaries.see,united states texas pipe line,cir united states ashland oil transp,cir.indeed,the supreme court has recognized that congress power to regulate water pollution extends beyond tributaries and reaches even wetlands adjacent to navigable waters.riverside,at.accordingly,we can not say that the corps tributary rule invokes the outer limits of congress power under the commerce clause or raises serious constitutional questions we join with the sixth and fourth circuits in holding that the corps tributary rule is owed deference under the second step of the chevron framework.see united states rapanos,cir,cert.granted,d deaton,at.
proceeding under chevron second step,this court will defer to the corps tributary rule as a valid interpretation of the clean water act so long as the rule is a permissible construction of the statute.see utah wilderness alliance,at citing chevron,at.w e will give effect to the agency interpretation unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.we accord the agency such deference given its special institutional competence pharmanex shalala,cir citation omitted.
this court has long acknowledged the corps authority to regulate the introduction of pollutants into the tributaries of navigable waters.see,quivira min,cir united states earth sciences,cir.indeed,we have concluded that i t is the intent of the clean water act to cover,as much as possible,all waters of the united states instead of just some.quivira min,at.in short,this court precedent indicates the corps tributary rule is a permissible construction of the clean water act.hubenka,however,argues that the aforementioned cases are no longer good law in light of the supreme court decision in swancc.
in swancc,the court was confronted with the question of whether nonnavigable,isolated,intrastate ponds were subject to the clean water act under the corps migratory bird rule.at.the court reviewed its prior decision in riverside,where it had recognized the corps authority to regulate wetlands adjacent to navigable waters.id.at.it noted that the corps could regulate adjacent wetlands because of the significant nexus between the wetlands and the navigable waters.id.at.the court further observed that congress concern for the protection of water quality and aquatic ecosystems indicated its intent to regulate wetlands inseparably bound up with the waters of the united states.id.at.quoting riverside,at.although the ponds at issue in swancc served as habitat for migratory birds,they were otherwise isolated from navigable waters.id.at.the supreme court determined the corps regulatory authority under the clean water act is rooted in congress traditional jurisdiction over navigable waters.id.at.the court held that the corps exceeded its authority when it attempted to regulate isolated intrastate waters based solely on their status as habitat for migratory birds.id.at.
swancc,hubenka contends,must be interpreted to mean that the corps jurisdiction under the clean water act extends only to waters that are navigable in fact or waters that are actually adjacent to navigable waters.he urges this court to adopt the reasoning of the fifth circuit court of appeals,which determined,under swancc,that the clean water act is not so broad as to permit the federal government to impose regulations over tributaries that are neither themselves navigable nor truly adjacent to navigable waters.in re needham,at see also rice harken exploration,cir a body of water is protected under the act only if it is actually navigable or is adjacent to an open body of navigable water.
the swancc court observed that a significant nexus between the subject water and a navigable water is sufficient to establish jurisdiction under the clean water act.see at.discussing rationale for the court prior decision in riverside.the fifth circuit concluded that a significant nexus occurs only when a nonnavigable water is actually adjacent to a navigable water.see rice,at.under its view,the term adjacent does not encompass all tributaries that eventually flow into navigable waters.in re needham,at.
the supreme court opinion in swancc does not compel such a narrow interpretation of the phrase significant nexus.the court has noted the evident breadth of congressional concern for protection of water quality and aquatic ecosystems.riverside,at.indeed,congress enacted the clean water act with the comprehensive objective of restor ing and maintain ing the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.a.the legislative history is clear 
the pollution control strategy of the act extends to navig
