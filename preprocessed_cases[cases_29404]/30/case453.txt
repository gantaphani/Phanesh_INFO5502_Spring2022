the environmental protection agency epa redesignated cuyahoga county,ohio hereinafter cleveland from nonattainment to attainment for particulate matter,specifically for particles known as particles smaller than microns in diameter,on december.this was done pursuant to d e of the clean air act,d e.robert greenbaum,a cleveland resident and sierra club member,and intervenor,sierra club petitioners,appeal the agency action.petitioners argue that the epa illegally waived statutory requirements when it redesignated the cleveland area to attainment.
statutory framework 
the clean air act caa establishes a comprehensive program for controlling and improving the nation air quality through both state and federal regulation.the administrator formulates national ambient air quality standards naaqs that specify the maximum permissible concentrations of certain air pollutants.the epa initially designates geographic areas as attainment or nonattainment based on whether the areas meet the pollution limits for a particular pollutant,pursuant to the naaqs for that particular pollutant.nonattainment areas are further classified as moderate or serious,depending on the severity and persistence of the problem.the caa requires states to submit a state implementation plan sip to the epa,containing specific pollution control measures necessary for the attainment,maintenance,and enforcement of the naaqs.the sips must be drafted to meet requirements as outlined in caa a,a.part d of title i of the caa provides that a sip for nonattainment areas such as cleveland before the redesignation must include a new source review nsr.nsr is a permit program for major new and modified sources of pollutant.basically,the program requires new or modified sources of pollutant to obtain a permit that requires certain pollution controls and other measures to ensure that the new or modified source will not exacerbate the pollution problem in the area.sips must also include programs for enforcement of the nsr provisions and other measures included in the plan.
the epa reviews and either approves or disapproves the sip submissions.if the epa approves the sip,either wholly or partially,the approved provisions become enforceable by the federal government.if the epa disapproves the sip,then the state is subject to sanctions,as well as federally imposed clean air measures.
states may ask the epa to redesignate geographical areas from nonattainment to attainment for a particular pollutant once a naaqs has been met.d e.the epa must approve or deny such redesignation within months.d d.the epa may not redesignate an area to attainment unless i the epa has determined that the area has attained the applicable naaqs ii the epa has fully approved the applicable sip under k iii the epa has determined that the improvement in air quality is due to permanent and enforceable reductions in emissions resulting from implementation of the sip and other required reductions iv the epa has fully approved a maintenance plan under caa that has been adopted by the state,which demonstrates that the area will maintain the naaqs for at least years after redesignation and v the epa has determined that the state containing the area seeking redesignation has met all applicable sip requirements for that area under with respect to sips generally,and under part d with respect to sip provisions for nonattainment areas.d e.
ii.the redesignation of cleveland 
cleveland was designated as a moderate nonattainment area in.in,ohio submitted a sip revision,which was supplemented twice.the epa partially approved and partially disapproved the plan.epa approved the majority of the submission on may,but disapproved parts of it because of various deficiencies.the epa stated in its may,notice that it would address in separate rulemakings the contingency measures required by c of the act and the part d nsr requirement.ohio submitted a sip revision,approved by the epa,that addressed the contingency measures.ohio submitted another revision,correcting the deficiencies identified by the epa in may,which the epa subsequently approved.thus,the sip was fully approved,except for the part d nsr.
in the meantime,air quality monitoring in the cleveland area showed that it had achieved attainment of the particulate matter naaqs.on may,ohio submitted a request to the epa,asking it to redesignate cleveland from nonattainment to attainment.the epa proposed redesignating cleveland on july.approval and promulgation of implementation plans ohio,designation of areas for air quality planning purposes ohio.july.in response,the earthjustice legal defense fund,representing the ohio chapter of the sierra club,submitted numerous comments,some of which addressed the lack of an nsr program in ohio sip.the epa issued a rulemaking,redesignating cleveland and addressing the submitted comments,on december.approval and promulgation of implementation plans and designation of areas for air quality planning purposes ohio.
in response to the comments with respect to the nsr program,the epa stated that it continues to believe that it has fully approved the applicable sip for cuyahoga and jefferson counties.id.at.it stated that it believes that cuyahoga and jefferson counties may be redesignated to attainment notwithstanding the lack of a nsr program meeting the requirements of the clean air act amendments.id.at.the epa continued,stating that it believes that its decision not to insist on a fully approved nsr program as a prerequisite to redesignation is justifiable as an exercise of the agency general authority to establish de minimis exceptions to statutory requirements as application of the statutory requirements would be of trivial or no value environmentally.ibid.citing.power costle.the epa stated that once an area is redesignated to attainment,a new program called prevention of significant deterioration psd replaces nsr and governs compliance.ibid.compare c,requiring nsr for sips governing nonattainment areas with requiring psd in sips governing attainment areas.according to the epa,psd requires that new sources demonstrate that their construction will not increase ambient concentrations significantly and will not result in concentrations above the air quality standard.at.it concluded that there would be trivial if any environmental value of applying nonattainment new source requirements in cuyahoga and jefferson counties rather than psd requirements.ibid.
the epa noted that another purpose of requiring the approval of a part d nsr program would be to ensure that nsr would become a contingency provision in the maintenance plan required for these areas by section d e iv and d.it stated that whether an approved nsr program must be included as a contingency provision depends on whether it is a measure for the control of the pertinent air pollutants.ibid.the epa stated that the term measure is not defined in section d and that congress used the term differently in different provisions of the caa.this indicates that the term is susceptible to more than one interpretation and that epa has the discretion to interpret it in a reasonable manner in the context of section.ibid.therefore,epa believes it is reasonable to interpret measure,as used in section d,not to include nsr.ibid.
finally,the epa concluded that ohio maintenance plan required by d included sufficient contingency measures to correct any future violation of the naaqs.
petitioners argue that d e of the caa is explicit in stating the requirements that must be met before the epa may redesignate a nonattainment area to attainment.one requirement is that the epa fully approve the applicable implementation plan for the area under section k d e.at the time of redesignation,ohio sip did not contain a fully approved or approvable nsr program as required by a c and part d,and as required as part of cleveland maintenance plan by.petitioners argue that the epa violated the express and unambiguous requirements of d e ii,iv,v,and.they argue that the epa has misstated the scope of its authority to carve out de minimis exceptions,and has failed to carry its burden of showing that such an exception applies in this case.moreover,they argue,enforcing the caa nsr requirement will not lead to absurd results,noting that more stringent requirements are imposed on an area under an nsr program than are imposed by a psd program.petitioners also maintain that the epa position that the term measure does not include the nsr program is untenable and its explanation of its method in reaching this conclusion is contorted.finally,petitioners argue that the epa illegally approved a maintenance plan that lacks contingency measures adequate to correct promptly any naaqs violation that might occur after redesignation.
iii.standard of review 
this court reviews the epa action with deference,and should affirm unless the action was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a southwestern.growth alliance browner,cir.in chevron,natural res.def.council,d,the supreme court established a process for reviewing an agency interpretation of a statute it administers.if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue the court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.emphasis added.if congress has been either silent or ambiguous about the precise question at issue,then a reviewing court must defer to the agency interpretation if it is reasonable.ibid.to uphold epa interpretation of a statute,the court need not find that it is the only permissible construction that epa might have adopted but only that epa understanding of this very complex statute is a sufficiently rational one to preclude a court from substituting its judgment for that of epa.southwestern.growth alliance,at quoting chem.mfrs.ass natural res.def.council,d.
iv.analysis 
de minimis authority 
unless congress has been extraordinarily rigid,there is likely a basis for an implication of de minimis authority to provide exemption when the burdens of regulation yield a gain of trivial or no value.power costle.determination of when matters are truly de minimis naturally will turn on the assessment of particular circumstances,and the agency will bear the burden of making the required showing.id.at.
the epa argues that the part d nsr program is inapplicable to attainment areas,so that the requirement disappears upon redesignation.after redesignation,part d nsr is replaced by a psd,another permitting program designed to ensure maintenance of the naaqs in attainment areas.compare c,requiring nsr for sips governing nonattainment areas with requiring psd in sips governing attainment areas.therefore,requiring nsr approval prior to redesignation would provide de minimis environmental benefit.
the petitioners argue that that the nsr requirement is rigid,and the epa action was a departure from the statute.they argue that the court in alabama power made it clear that the focus of de minimis authority is whether a statute literal terms lead to absurd or futile results.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.they argue that the clear congressional mandate in this case does not lead to an absurd result and that the epa did not have authority to depart.they urge that requiring an nsr program in cleveland furthers the act purpose because it provides much greater assurance than does a psd program that the area will maintain its naaqs.
it is not necessary in this case to reach the question of whether the epa exceeded or misstated its de minimis authority to depart from the statute.the epa approved ohio part d nsr program in a final rule issued january.approval and promulgation of implementation plans ohio.the deadline for challenges to the rule expired march,and none were filed.if we were to remand the redesignation to the epa,it would result in a duplicative rulemaking to redesignate the cleveland area once again.the nsr program would not be implemented as approved,as nsr programs are only required in nonattainment areas.under the doctrine of prudential mootness,we decline to reach the specific issue of whether ohio nsr program should have been fully approved prior to redesignation as the circumstances have changed,and we can no longer afford petitioners any meaningful relief on this point.see utah wilderness alliance smith,cir chamber of commerce of united states of america united states dep t of energy,in some circumstances,a controversy,not actually moot,is so attenuated that considerations of prudence and comity for coordinate branches of government counsel the court to stay its hand,and to withhold relief it has the power to grant.
however,the approval of ohio nsr program does not moot the rest of the issues on appeal.petitioners argue that because of the belated approval,the epa may now claim that the nsr program was not contained in the implementation plan before redesignation,and is therefore not a required maintenance contingency measure within the meaning of our decision in this case declining to address the propriety of redesignation absent an approved nsr program is in no way an invitation for the epa to circumvent the mandates of the caa.the nsr should have been approved before redesignation,and for the purposes of addressing petitioners claims regarding,we will treat it as if it had been.
interpretation of the word measure 
section requires that when a state submits a request for redesignation of an area to attainment,it must submit a sip revision to provide for the maintenance of the naaqs for at least ten years after redesignation.a.these provisions must require the state to implement all measures with respect to the control of the air pollutant concerned which were contained in the state implementation plan for the area before redesignation of the area as an attainment area.d.
the petitioners maintain that the nsr program is a required pollution control measure,and therefore should be among the contingency measures required by the caa.the epa stated that it believes it is reasonable to interpret measure,as used in section d,not to include nsr.at.as the nsr program is not a pollution control measure,it is not among the contingency measures required by the caa.
the substance of the epa argument relies upon statutory construction and its interpretation of the meaning of the word measure as used in.under the deferential chevron standard of review,we must first determine if the statute is ambiguous with respect to the precise issue in question.if so,we must defer to the agency interpretation if it is reasonable.chevron,at.however,if the apparent statutory ambiguity can be resolved using traditional tools of statutory construction,an agency interpretation is not entitled to chevron deference.care found.labor relations,cir quoting ins,d see also chevron,at.
in determining whether congress has specifically addressed the question at issue,a reviewing court should not confine itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation.the certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.a court must therefore interpret the statute as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,and fit,if possible,all parts into an harmonious whole.
fda brown williamson tobacco,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the epa argues that congress did not speak directly to the definition of the word measure in.although the statute requires implementation of all measures with respect to the control of the air pollutant concerned that were in the nonattainment sip,the epa notes that it is apparent that congress meant for some aspects of the nonattainment sip to be measures to be included as contingency measures in the maintenance plan,and some not.it argues that does not indicate which provisions are to be included,and so it had to turn to other parts of the statute.it states that it turned to,which lists the required sip provisions.section requires control measures as components of a sip.a a.the epa argues that subparagraph a requires a sip to include enforceable emission limitations and other control measures,means,or techniques as may be necessary or appropriate to meet the requirements of the act.ibid.subparagraph c requires the sip also to include a program to provide for the enforcement of the measures described in subparagraph a,and regulation of the modification and construction of any stationary source,including a permit program as required in parts c and d of this subchapter.id.at a c.the epa argues that if the part d nsr permit program were among the control measures mentioned in subparagraph a,the separate reference to it in subparagraph c would be unnecessary.the epa concluded that the measures with respect to the control of the air pollutant concerned in section d and the control measures in section a a are the same,and do not include the part d nsr permit program.
petitioners argue that the epa position is untenable,and its statutory interpretation tortured.they argue that the term measure is unambiguous in meaning and unquestionably includes nsr programs,citing webster collegiate dictionary a step planned or taken as a means to an end.they list several of the nsr program pollution controls,and assert that,therefore,the nsr program is a step planned or taken as a means to the end of controlling and reducing air pollution,and is therefore a measure.they argue that the epa applied an aid to statutory construction to a different section of the statute to create an ambiguity in where none otherwise exists.
first,we note that there may be no ambiguity,but for a different reason than the one offered by the petitioners.according to c,sips governing nonattainment areas must include nsr programs.under,by contrast,sips governing attainment areas must include psd programs.thus,although nsr was or should have been in the sip,it would make little sense for it to be included in the sip,as the clean air act statutes explicitly states that attainment area sips must include a psd program.yet,even if the clear directive of does not establish that measure unambiguously excludes nsr,the potential statutory conflict is enough to create an ambiguity as to the proper scope of measure in.
before reaching that conclusion,however,we must determine whether traditional tools of statutory construction provide resolution to the ambiguity.chevron,at.the normal rule of statutory construction assumes that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.sorenson sec y of treasury,d quoting helvering stockholms enskilda bank.however,as the court has also noted,l ike all such maxims,this is merely a general assumption,and is not always valid or applicable.sullivan stroop,d blackmun,dissenting.if the two provisions are meant to serve the same purpose,the rule might apply,but if not,the applicability of the rule might be limited.id.at.citing helvering,at.s ince most words admit of different shades of meaning,susceptible of being expanded or abridged to conform to the sense in which they are used,the presumption readily yields when the words,though in the same act,are found in dissimilar connections.as the apparent statutory ambiguity can not readily be resolved using traditional tools of statutory construction,we apply chevron deference to the agency interpretation.
the epa interpretation of the word measure in is reasonable,and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the federal agency.the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.davis.dep t of treasury,d.section d requires implementation of all measures with respect to the control of the air pollutant concerned contained in the nonattainment sip.it was entirely permissible,and indeed logical,for the epa to look to to determine the meaning of the word measure in as lists the provisions required to be included in a nonattainment sip.petitioners argue this was done merely to create an ambiguity where one did not otherwise exist.however,t he certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.brown williamson tobacco,at.citing brown gardner,d ambiguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context.
likewise,the epa argument that the reference to the part d nsr program in subparagraph c of would be surplusage if it were among the control measures mentioned in subparagraph a of is reasonable.a a c.subparagraph c requires a nonattainment sip to contain a program to provide for the enforcement of the measures described in subparagraph a,and regulation of the modification and construction of any stationary source within the areas covered by the plan a c emphasis added.the latter clause of the sentence refers to the part d nsr permit program,while the former refers to the measures described in subparagraph a.it was not unreasonable for the epa to conclude that given this structure of,that congress intended that the term measure not include the part d nsr permit program.
we also find persuasive the epa argument that the very nature of the nsr permit program supports its interpretation that it is not intended to be a contingency measure pursuant to d.the contingency measures required by require immediate emission reductions on existing sources.the beginning of the paragraph reads each plan revision submitted under this section shall contain such contingency provisions as the administrator deems necessary to assure that the state will promptly correct any violation of the standard which occurs after the redesignation of the area as an attainment area.d.the nsr program would have no immediate effect on emissions.it is a permitting program under which those who want to construct a new major pollutant source,or modify an existing major pollutant source,must acquire a permit.the program has no effect on existing sources,which would be the cause of any violation of the standard.we therefore defer to the epa reasonable definition of the word measure in.
c.the maintenance plan 
when a state submits to the epa a request for redesignation,requires that the state submit a sip revision to provide for the maintenance of the naaqs for at least ten years after the redesignation.a.
section d provides 
each maintenance plan submitted under this section shall contain such contingency provisions as the administrator deems necessary to assure that the state will promptly correct any violation of the standard which occurs after the redesignation of the area as an attainment area.
d emphasis added.the language clearly indicates that congress expressly delegated authority to the epa to determine what contingency measures are necessary.we give such determinations by regulation controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,at.petitioners argue that the epa determination in this case is all three.we disagree.
in response to comments regarding the maintenance plan,the epa stated that ohio enforcement program,commitment of resources,and legal authority are adequate and assure that measures in the sip including maintenance plan measures will be implemented.it noted that the ohio sip contained contingency measures that had been approved by the epa on may.ibid.citing approval and promulgation of implementation plans ohio.may.when the epa approved these contingency measures,the epa stated that ohio contingency measures provided for a reasonable level of continued progress toward the attainment goal during an interim period between any prospective determination that the sip has failed to provide for timely attainment of the naaqs and the additional formal air quality planning following the determination.at.
in its rulemaking redesignating cleveland as an attainment area,the epa stated that s ection d does not dictate that the maintenance plan contingency measures be sufficient by themselves to correct any violation of the standard.instead,these measures need only be sufficient in epa judgment to help assure that the state will promptly correct any future violation.at.it reasoned that is emitted from a variety of sources,and therefore it could not reasonably expect maintenance plan contingency measures by themselves to address all possible future violations.ibid.the epa also reasoned
