this appeal raises issues relating to environmental standing under the national environmental policy act nepa and state taxpayer standing.we hold that the appellants have standing to challenge the adequacy of the navy environmental impact statement under nepa,but have not established taxpayer standing sufficient to bring their state law claims in federal court.
background 
this dispute concerns the plans for the future use of the closed long beach naval station naval station.the naval station is located on terminal island in the port of long beach.several of the buildings on the naval station were designed by los angeles architect paul williams,the first fellow of the american institute of architects and principal architect for the navy during the world war ii era.a number of the structures on the station qualified for inclusion on the national register of historic places due to their strong association with the development of the roosevelt base as an administrative center for training and for ship repair of the pacific fleet during the second world war.
at the time the complaint in this case was filed,portions of the naval station served as a habitat for several bird species.two federally endangered species,the california least tern and the california brown pelican,foraged in acres of shallow water habitat in the area of the station known as the west basin.the night heron,which is protected by the migratory bird act of and has been classified by the california department of fish and game as a california special animal,had rookeries in the large ornamental ficus trees on the naval station.
in,the department of defense announced that the long beach station would be closed,and in the navy ceased operations at the station.to prepare the area for its planned use as a commercial marine container terminal,the historic buildings on the base have been demolished,the ornamental ficus trees destroyed,and the shallow water habitat dredged.the appellants the birdwatchers are residents of long beach and lakewood,california.they belong to a variety of environmental groups and have opposed the plan to destroy the buildings and bird habitats on the naval station in preparation for the future use of the property.
before disposing of any surplus real property located at a military installation scheduled for closure,the defense base closure and realignment act dbcra requires the secretary of defense to consider redevelopment plans submitted by affected local governments for the use of such property by the local community.see defense base closure and realignment act of.b d stat.before transferring the surplus property to the local government,the secretary of defense must prepare a decision document in accordance with nepa.nepa requires any federal agency considering major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment to prepare an environmental impact statement eis identifying the environmental consequences of the proposed action and recommending ways to minimize those which are adverse.c.under the dbcra procedures,the local government redevelopment plan is to be treated as part of the proposed federal action.see.b k ii.
the navy designated the city of long beach as its local reuse authority.in,the long beach city council authorized the formation of the navy properties reuse committee npr to develop a reuse plan.the birdwatchers allege that the npr failed to actively develop reuse proposals,but instead,early in the process,summarily decided on a marine container terminal to be leased to the chinese overseas shipping company.
in september,the board of harbor commissioners,approved an environmental impact report,mandated by the california environmental quality act,for the development of a marine container terminal at the naval station.in april,the navy and the city of long beach issued a joint final environmental impact statement feis under nepa.the feis evaluated four alternatives the marine container proposal,an auto terminal,an institutional campus,and the no project alternative.the birdwatchers allege that the feis was deficient because it did not give full and complete consideration to the environmental effects of the marine container terminal proposal,and because the navy adopted an unreasonably small range of reuse project alternatives.in may,the navy issued its record of decision for disposal and reuse of naval station long beach approving long beach plan to convert the former station into a commercial marine container terminal.
the original complaint in this matter was filed in the district court on june.the primary defendants were the city of long beach and the united states department of the navy.the complaint set forth state law claims against the city of long beach alleging violations of the state tidelands trust,and contending that the proposed use is a waste of public assets and a public gift in violation of the california constitution.the action against the navy set forth not only these state taxpayer claims,but also challenged the adequacy of the feis under nepa.over the summer,the district court denied two ex parte applications for a temporary restraining order,and dismissed the complaint for lack of standing with leave to amend.the birdwatchers then filed an amended complaint and two further unsuccessful ex parte applications for a temporary restraining order.by october,the city of long beach began to tear down the buildings and trees at the naval station in preparation for the marine container terminal.on december,the district court denied the birdwatchers motion for a preliminary injunction,and granted appellees motion to dismiss for lack of standing without leave to amend.by the time appellants filed their brief in this appeal in may,the historic buildings and bird habitats on the naval station had been destroyed.
ii.mootness 
long beach and the navy contend that this appeal is moot because the historic buildings on the naval station have been destroyed and the trees and structures of the station have been razed in preparation for the construction of the marine container terminal.the burden of demonstrating mootness is a heavy one.northwest environmental defense center gordon,cir citing county of los angeles davis,d.a case becomes moot whenever it los es its character as a present,live controversy of the kind that must exist if we are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law.hall beals,d.in deciding a mootness issue,the question is not whether the precise relief sought at the time the application for an injunction was filed is still available.the question is whether there can be any effective relief.gordon,at quoting garcia lawn,cir.
we recently addressed mootness in the context of nepa in west secretary of the department of transportation,cir.in west,we held that an action challenging an agency decision to exclude a highway interchange project from review under nepa was not moot even though the first stage of the project was complete and the new interchange was carrying traffic.pointing out that t he central question of all mootness problems is whether changes in the circumstances that prevailed at the beginning of the litigation have forestalled any occasion for meaningful relief,id.at quoting wright miller federal practice and procedure at,we found that effective relief could still be granted in the form of requiring additional environmental review and conceivably ordering the interchange closed or taken down.id.at.similarly,in gordon,we reversed the district court holding that a challenge to regulations governing the salmon fishing season was mooted by the close of the season.gordon,at.we held that t he fact that the alleged violation has itself ceased is not sufficient to render a case moot.as long as effective relief may still be available to counteract the effects of the violation,the controversy remains live and present.id.at.we found that the damage caused by the measures could be repaired or mitigated obviously not by restoring the fish harvested in,but by allowing more fish to spawn in.see also tyler cuomo,cir.holding that a challenge to a housing project is not mooted by the completion of the project because changes can still be made to alleviate any adverse effects pyramid lake paiute tribe hodel,cir challenge to water diversion is not mooted after diversion took place where impacts on fishery could be remedied by storing more water in a reservoir for use in future spawning seasons.
when evaluating the issue of mootness in nepa cases,we have repeatedly emphasized that if the completion of the action challenged under nepa is sufficient to render the case nonjusticiable,entities could merely ignore the requirements of nepa,build its structures before a case gets to court,and then hide behind the mootness doctrine.such a result is not acceptable.west,at quoting columbia basin land protection ass schlesinger,cir.accordingly,defendants in nepa cases face a particularly heavy burden in establishing mootness.
on appeal,the birdwatchers concede that the destruction of the historic buildings on the naval station can not be remedied.nevertheless,if required to undertake additional environmental review,the defendants could consider alternatives to the current reuse plan,and develop ways to mitigate the damage to the birds habitat by,for example,creating new nesting and foraging areas on the land that was formerly the station or utilizing other nearby land for mitigation purposes.since effective relief may still be available,the demolition of the naval station was insufficient to render the case moot.
iii.standing under nepa 
the navy contends that the birdwatchers do not have standing to challenge the adequacy of its environmental impact statement regarding the naval station proposed reuse.to satisfy article iii standing requirements,a plaintiff must show 
it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
friends of the earth,laidlaw environmental services,d.in addition to these constitutional requirements,a plaintiff bringing suit under the administrative procedure act for a violation of nepa must show that his alleged injury falls within the zone of interests that nepa was designed to protect.douglas county babbitt,cir.the navy does not dispute that the birdwatchers have satisfied this prudential standing requirement.the birdwatchers interest in preserving the historic buildings and natural environment of the naval station and preventing adverse environmental effects from its proposed reuse falls squarely within the zone of interests protected by nepa.see,b noting congressional purpose to preserve important historic,cultural,and natural aspects of our national heritage.accordingly,we consider below whether the birdwatchers have met the standing requirements under article iii.
injury in fact 
nepa is a procedural statute,city of davis coleman,cir,and the birdwatchers allege a procedural injury by challenging the adequacy of the navy feis.to satisfy the injury in fact requirement,a plaintiff asserting a procedural injury must show that the procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of his that is the ultimate basis of his standing.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.in nepa cases,we have described this concrete interest test as requiring a geographic nexus between the individual asserting the claim and the location suffering an environmental impact.douglas county,at stating that the geographic nexus test is the same as the concrete interest test.in this case,the fact that the birdwatchers are seeking to enforce a procedural right does not affect our injury in fact analysis as in conventional standing cases,the birdwatchers must show the invasion of a concrete and particularized interest 
the birdwatchers assert that they have a concrete interest in viewing the birds and natural environment at the naval station.the supreme court has held that environmental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened by the challenged activity.laidlaw,at.at quoting sierra club morton,d see also defenders of wildlife,at.of course,the desire to use or observe an animal species,even for purely esthetic purposes,is undeniably a cognizable interest for purposes of standing.an environmental plaintiff need not live nearby to establish a concrete injury r epeated recreational use itself,accompanied by a credible allegation of desired future use,can be sufficient,even if relatively infrequent,to demonstrate that environmental degradation of the area is injurious to that person.ecological rights foundation erf pacific lumber,cir.
the birdwatchers have demonstrated a sufficiently concrete interest to establish an injury in fact under the test set forth in laidlaw.for example,the complaint alleges that plaintiff anne cantrell,a resident of long beach,has on several occasions,both before and after the closure of the naval station,visited the areas in and around the station to observe the habitats of the least terns,the brown pelicans,and the black crown night herons,and that the removal of the bird habitats would directly affect her interest in and appreciation of the bird habitats and ability to enjoy such.the complaint alleges that each of the other plaintiffs similarly conducted regular visits to observe the bird habitats at the naval station,continued to do so from areas adjacent to and outside the station after it was closed to the public,and had specific plans to make similar visits in the future.in declarations in opposition to the motion to dismiss,plaintiffs cantrell and larkey stated that they drove and walked around the perimeter of the station on several occasions to view the birds and nesting areas,and had specific plans to visit the areas around the station in the future.the complaint and declarations thus assert that the removal of the trees and the shallow water habitat at the naval station would directly and concretely affect the birdwatchers recreational and aesthetic interests.
the birdwatchers averments that they had visited the affected area in the past and that the defendant challenged activity would impede their ability to appreciate and use the specified area are sufficient to establish that they have suffered an injury to a concrete and particularized interest.see laidlaw,at.at.however,the navy raises an additional objection.citing the supreme court statement in defenders of wildlife that the asserted injury must be an invasion of a legally protected interest,at,the navy argues that the birdwatchers can not establish standing because they have no legal right to enter the closed station or to stand adjacent to the station and gaze over the property line at the birds and their habitat.we need not decide whether the birdwatchers have a legal right of access to the naval station because their desire to view the birds at the naval station from publicly accessible locations outside the station is an interest sufficient to confer standing.
the district court held that the birdwatchers interest in looking over the property line of the station to view the birds was insufficient to establish an injury in fact.emphasizing that there is generally no right to a view over other property,the district court found that an adjacent viewer aesthetic enjoyment is not a legally protected interest.however,we have never required a plaintiff to show that he has a right of access to the site on which the challenged activity is occurring,or that he has an absolute right to enjoy the aesthetic or recreational activities that form the basis of his concrete interest.if an area can be observed and enjoyed from adjacent land,plaintiffs need not physically enter the affected area to establish an injury in fact.for example,the plaintiffs in laidlaw had used specific areas in and around a river to picnic,birdwatch,walk,and swim but alleged that they would no longer be able to do so because the river had been polluted by the discharges
