center for biological diversity,san diego audubon society,save our forest association,and sierra club,plaintiffs in a ceqa california environmental quality act pub.resources code,et action,appeal an order on attorney fees that was rendered on remand after an earlier appeal on the merits.the trial court originally awarded plaintiffs a reduced amount of fees under code of civil procedure section the private attorney general statute,based on their limited success at trial they lost on two ceqa claims and won on one claim.on remand,plaintiffs moved for fees incurred on the appeal,and for supplemental fees incurred at the trial court level based on their greater success on appeal on the ceqa claims.the court determined it lacked jurisdiction to hear the supplemental fees matter because plaintiffs had dismissed their appeal of the postjudgment order on fees and the order was final.plaintiffs persuasively contend the court jurisdictional finding was in error.a motion for supplemental fees based on greater success on appeal does not challenge the original fee order and poses no jurisdictional impediment.thus,we remand for consideration of supplemental fees.
further,we agree with plaintiffs that the court abused its discretion with regard to the amount of the award of attorney fees for appellate work.where unrefuted evidence shows that qualified local counsel is unavailable,it is error to base the allowable lodestar hourly rate on local rates without regard to reasonable hourly rates charged by competent counsel outside the local legal market.additionally,where the record affirmatively shows that the court reduced the number of allowable hours by more than half without taking into account fundamental differences between trial and appellate work,remand is necessary.accordingly,we reverse the order and direct the court to hold further proceedings on attorney fees.
factual and procedural background 
hawarden development company hawarden,real party in interest,seeks to develop acres of property near lake arrowhead,california,into a residential subdivision called blue ridge at lake arrowhead.in august the county of san bernardino the county certified an environmental impact report eir for the project and approved the project,subject to hawarden satisfaction of certain conditions,including its completion of feet of cumberland road,a segment that runs through or adjacent to the development,and contributing a pro rata share toward the future cost of extending the road from the development to highway.
plaintiffs are environmental groups that appealed the county actions to its board of supervisors,which denied the appeal and approved the project.plaintiffs then challenged the approval in superior court by filing a petition for writ of mandate.the trial court granted writ relief on one of three issues,finding the county fire safety plan requires that cumberland road be completed prior to development occurring and that the general plan is unambiguous as to this issue.this issue is not a ceqa issue and rather pertains to the county general plan.the court rejected plaintiffs ceqa challenges,that substantial evidence did not support the eir findings pertaining to the project impact on the southern rubber boa,a threatened species found on the project site,and on water supply for the project.on january,the court issued a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the county to vacate and set aside its project approval.
the county and hawarden appealed the judgment and plaintiffs.while the appeal was pending,plaintiffs moved for in costs and attorney fees under section.this amount included attorney fees of,an enhancement of based on a multiplier of,costs of,and attorney fees of for bringing the attorney fees motion first fee motion.in its opposition,hawarden argued the fee request should be drastically reduced because plaintiffs only prevailed on one portion of their three causes of action,and almost of plaintiffs brief was devoted to one of the causes of action on which they failed to prevail.hawarden asked the court to disallow fees for time spent on ceqa issues.
after a hearing on may,the court issued a minute order granting plaintiffs a reduced award.the order states due to the limited relief granted on the underlying petition and the fact that the court finds the claimed fees to be excessive,the fees are reduced.plaintiffs are awarded in attorney fees inclusive of all staff time,plus in costs.
the court issued a formal order on june.the county and hawarden appealed the order and plaintiffs.the parties entered into a stipulation to stay the appeal of the fee award pending resolution of the pending appeal of the judgment.division two of the fourth appellate,however,denied the parties stipulation for a stay.the parties then entered into a stipulation to dismiss with prejudice their appeals of the attorney fees order.
in an unpublished opinion,division two of this district affirmed the judgment with respect to the appeal by the county and hawarden.as to plaintiffs appeal,the court held the trial court erred by denying their two ceqa claims.the court modified the judgment issuing the writ of mandate to require the county to prepare an eir that complies with ceqa in addressing the issues of water supply for the blue ridge project and the impact on the southern rubber boa.center for biological diversity,county of san bernardino,nonpub.opn.hawarden i.
on remand,the case was reassigned to a new trial judge per plaintiffs peremptory challenge.plaintiffs then moved for an additional fee award second fee motion.in addition to seeking attorney fees for the appeal,they argued their greater success on appeal entitles them to a supplemental award for work performed at the trial court level.they pointed out that the county and hawarden opposed their original fee request on the ground they achieved only partial success at trial,the court noted that reason for reducing the fee award,and the award of was roughly a third of the augmented amount they requested for trial court work.
plaintiffs sought a total of in fees,including for trial work for appellate work an augment of based on a multiplier of for the contingent portion of the representation and for bringing the motion for fees.the request included an offset of for the first fee award.
on july,after extensive briefing and a hearing,the court issued its ruling.the court determined it lacked jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs request for supplemental fees for trial work because they had dismissed their appeal of the postjudgment order awarding in fees and the order has become final and can not be altered.
for the appeal in hawarden i,the court reduced the claimed fees to on the ground they duplicated work done at the trial court level.further,the court disallowed hourly rates of counsel that exceeded local inland empire rates of,and it refused to apply a multiplier to the lodestar amount.the court allowed in fees incurred in bringing the second fee motion.
discussion 
itrial court jurisdiction to consider motion for supplemental attorney fees under section 
the question of the trial court jurisdiction is a pure question of law subject to our independent review.thompson pacific construction,city of sunnyvale th.
section codifies the private attorney general doctrine the supreme court adopted in serrano priest cal d.woodland hills residents,city council cal d.the doctrine rests upon the recognition that privately initiated lawsuits are often essential to the effectuation of the fundamental public policies embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions,and that,without some mechanism authorizing the award of attorney fees,private actions to enforce such important public policies will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible.citations.citation.entitlement to fees under section requires a showing that the litigation served to vindicate an important public right conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons and was necessary and imposed a financial burden on plaintiffs which was out of proportion to their individual stake in the matter.citation.citation.in short,section acts as an incentive for the pursuit of public litigation that might otherwise have been too costly to bring.families unafraid to uphold rural el dorado county board of supervisors th.
it is well settled that the private attorney general theory applies to an action to enforce provisions of ceqa.city of board of supervisors d,san bernardino valley audubon society,county of san bernardino d,litigation brought to enforce the provisions of ceqa has been held to involve important rights affecting the public interest for purposes of section.
the court has discretion to reduce attorney fees in a ceqa case based on the plaintiffs degree of success.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d,fn.sokolow county of san mateo d.the california supreme court has also instructed,however,that attorney fee awards under section should be fully compensatory,and absent circumstances rendering the award unjust,an award should ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent.ketchum moses cal th,sundance municipal court d,rather than adopt a rigid holding,we conceive it to be far more beneficial to leave it to the discretion of the trial court to determine whether time spent on an unsuccessful legal theory was reasonably incurred.
in support of their position,plaintiffs cite the following language from mcqueen bd.of directors d mcqueen,disapproved of on another ground in western states petroleum superior court cal th,fn typically,where a ceqa petitioner has obtained greater relief on appeal than in the trial court,the appellate court has remanded the matter to the trial court for reconsideration of its ruling on a request for attorney fees pursuant to section.mcqueen,supra,at,and cases cited therein.in mcqueen,the trial court denied the petitioner any meaningful relief on his ceqa claim,and based thereon denied his later motion for attorney fees in a statement of decision.the appellate court reversed the order on the merits and directed the trial court to issue a writ of mandate and reconsider the petitioner request for attorney fees based on his greater success on appeal.id.at.
hawarden asserts mcqueen is inapplicable because in that case there was a separate pending appeal on the attorney fees issue.in hawarden view,when there is a separately appealable postjudgment order on attorney fees,as here,on remand the trial court may not consider a request for supplemental fees based on greater success on appeal unless there is a pending appeal on the postjudgment order.
we disagree with hawarden analysis and conclude the court jurisdictional finding was erroneous.contrary to the court concern,plaintiffs request for supplemental attorney fees for trial work,based on a greater success at trial on the ceqa issues,does not challenge or potentially tamper with the final postjudgment order partially granting plaintiffs first fee motion.in their motion for supplemental fees,plaintiffs clearly deducted the originally awarded them.on remand from hawarden i,plaintiffs entitlement to supplemental fees was an open question the court was required to consider.successful ceqa plaintiffs are entitled to attorney fees if they meet the criteria of section,and here,plaintiffs were denied fees for ceqa work even though they ultimately succeeded on the issues.plaintiffs were not required to appeal the postjudgment order on fees to seek supplemental fees after the appeal in hawarden i,and thus their appeal of the order and subsequent dismissal of the appeal are immaterial 
hawarden reliance on soldate fidelity national financial,th,is misplaced.soldate explains that a subsequent posttrial order setting the amount of an appealable not reviewable on appeal,unless the posttrial order setting the fees is expressly specified in a notice of appeal.id.at.here,the issue is not whether the original order on fees is subject to review on appeal.it is not.as discussed,however,plaintiffs motion for supplemental fees based on a greater success on appeal does not affect the original order on fees.hawarden reliance on colony hill ghamaty th,is misplaced for the same reason.the court error requires reversal of the order and further proceedings on remand.
amount of award for hawarden i 
plaintiffs contend the court abused its discretion by limiting the hourly rates of their attorneys to local market rates,and by drastically reducing the claimed hours.given our reversal of the order on fees on the jurisdictional ground,we are not required to reach these issues.at the parties joint request,however,we exercise our discretion to do so for purposes of judicial economy.see horsford board of trustees of california state university th,horsford.the market rate issue is also germane to the court reconsideration on remand of plaintiffs request for supplemental fees for their counsels work at the trial court level.
plaintiffs contend the court abused its discretion by reducing the hourly rates of their attorneys.plaintiffs are represented by the santa monica law firm carstens carstens primarily represents environmental and community groups,and it generally accepts cases based upon a reduced rate level negotiated with the clients,sometimes with a cap on fees,and sometimes on a fully contingent basis,except for payment of costs.the firm representation here is largely on a contingent fee basis.
plaintiffs sought hourly attorney rates of,and,depending on experience levels.the attorney seeking the hourly rate is jan,who has more than years experience in environmental matters.she was listed in the los angeles magazine as a and southern california super lawyer in the field of environmental law.the attorney principally responsible for the case,douglas carstens,seeks an hourly rate of.he was admitted to the california bar in and he has an environmental law background.
carstens submitted a declaration that states the hourly rates are well within the range charged by other attorneys of comparable experience,as reflected in a survey by t he national law journal.a december,billing rate survey conducted by the national law journal shows that in the los angeles area where our offices are located,partner billing rates typically ranged between,and associate billing rates typically ranged between.a copy of the billing survey is attached to his declaration.
the carstens declaration also states the requested hourly rates are similar to rates plaintiffs attorneys have been awarded in past environmental cases.in a sacramento county case,the court awarded per hour and carstens per hour in a san mateo county case the court awarded per hour and carstens per hour in a los angeles county case the court awarded per hour and carstens per hour and in a case in riverside county the court awarded per hour and carstens per hour carstens declaration also states the reasonableness of the rates requested is also established by the fact that in the past year,we have been retained and paid at our market rate of per hour for and per hour for carstens.
the court limited hourly fees for all attorneys to.its order states,the court is familiar generally with the local prevailing rates and concludes the rate of per hour is more in line for similar work in this community.italics added.
plaintiffs claim the court abused its discretion by applying local market rates because they presented undisputed evidence that qualified local representation that would accept reduced rates or a contingency arrangement was unavailable.we agree.
the burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove that the fees it seeks are reasonable.citation.it is also plaintiffs burden on appeal to prove that the court abused its discretion in awarding fees.gorman tassajara development th.under the abuse of discretion standard,a trial court ruling will not be disturbed,and reversal of the judgment is not required,unless the trial court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary,capricious,or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice.citation.polanski superior court th.the abuse of discretion standard is deferential,but it is not empty.citation.i t asks in substance whether the ruling in question falls outside the bounds of reason under the applicable law and the relevant facts citations.citation.ibid.when we are reviewing an award of attorney fees for appellate work,we need not accord the same degree of deference we would give to rulings that involve the trial court knowledge.perkins standard oil of california cir.further,when,as here,the fee order under review was rendered by a judge other than the trial judge,we may exercise somewhat more latitude in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion than would be true in the usual case.perkins standard oil of california,supra,at.
t he fee setting inquiry in california ordinarily begins with the lodestar,the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.california courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys fee award.pclm group,ins.drexler cal th.generally,the reasonable hourly rate used for the lodestar calculation is that prevailing in the community for similar work.ketchum moses,supra,cal th at the lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community.after making the lodestar calculation,the court may augment or diminish that amount based on a number of factors specific to the case,including the novelty and difficulty of the issues,the attorneys skill in presenting the issues,the extent to which the case precluded the attorneys from accepting other work,and the contingent nature of the work.serrano priest,supra,cal d at.t he purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the particular action.ketchum moses,supra,at.
in horsford,supra,th,an action for employment discrimination brought under california fair employment and housing act feha et,the court rejected the notion that fee awards are invariably limited to local rates,despite language in ketchum moses,supra,cal th at page,that the lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community.horsford,supra,at.the horsford court explained the supreme court has never hinted that,in the unusual circumstances that local counsel is unavailable,the trial court is limited to the use of local hourly rates.the purpose of statutory attorney fee provisions is to provide financial incentives necessary for the private enforcement of important civil rights.citation.if a potential defendant is too intimidating to the local bar or so replete with resources as to potentially overwhelm local counsel,or if the local plaintiffs bar has not the resources to engage in complex litigation on a basis,the public interest in the prosecution of meritorious cases requires that the financial incentives be adjusted to attract attorneys who are sufficient to the cause.in the absence of any realistic indication plaintiffs could have found local counsel,it was an abuse of discretion to fail even to consider an hourly rate based on counsel home market rate,italics added.
in horsford,the court held the trial court erred by failing adequately to consider the propriety of a higher hourly rate for murray,a san francisco attorney,in order to accomplish the purposes of feha.horsford,supra,th at.the plaintiff submitted overwhelming and uncontradicted evidence he had contacted several attorneys in the local fresno area,but not one of them was willing to represent him.id.at.the court explained the method of achieving adequate compensation for counsel,when reasonably necessary,rests within the trial court discretion.if all lawyers for the prevailing party are from the area,the court might consider that factor in determining whether to award an enhancement multiplier to a lodestar initially calculated using local hourly rates.in cases like the present,where only some attorneys are from the area,the court should consider making the adjustment for the hourly rate of that attorney,rather than adjusting upward all of the fees through a multiplier,which might unjustly compensate local attorneys.id.at.
in nichols city of taft th nichols,the court clarified that in horsford it had concluded that because the plaintiff showed a effort to find local counsel and demonstrate d that hiring local counsel was impracticable,the trial court should have considered the counsel higher rates,either in calculating the initial lodestar figure or evaluating whether to award a multiplier to a lodestar initially calculated using local hourly rates.nichols,supra,at,citing horsford,supra,th at.
in nichols,the court held the trial court abused its discretion by applying a fee multiplier to compensate for the higher rates of counsel when the plaintiff did not meet her burden of showing that hiring local counsel was impracticable.nichols,supra,th at.the court noted it is clear from plaintiff declaration that,although she had concerns that she would be unable to find adequate representation,no effort was made to retain local counsel.despite the fact that plaintiff failed to make an adequate threshold showing,the trial court proceeded to impose a fee multiplier on the attorneys higher rates.use of a fee multiplier to compensate for the higher rates of counsel requires a sufficient plaintiff failed to make in this hiring local counsel was impracticable.id.at.
here,plaintiffs request for home market rates for their attorneys is based on the declaration of peter jorris,a member of the san bernardino audubon society,one of the plaintiffs in this case,which he made on personal knowledge of the facts.the declaration states for the past years,since,i have been actively involved in environmental and conservation issues in the san bernardino mountains,participating with many citizen organizations i am familiar with the local san bernardino attorney market.in the past i have been aware of a couple attorneys who have represented environmental petitioners in the area,but are either not currently active in the area or,based upon our experience,do not possess appropriate expertise to adequately represent the interests of petitioners involved in this litigation.
the declaration adds that prior to undertaking this case,the san bernardino valley audubon society was represented by carstens in another ceqa case against the county of san bernardino.the declaration closes by stating,as far as i know,there are no local attorneys in san bernardino county that regularly practice environmental law on behalf of environmental groups,will do such work on a contingent or reduced rate basis,and possess sufficient expertise available to represent audubon or the other petitioners in this litigation.in short,we were required to obtain counsel from out of the area because equivalent local counsel was not available.
hawarden asserts the jorris declaration is merely conclusory and thus it was of no assistance to the trial court a plaintiff threshold showing of impracticability,however,is not onerous horsford,supra,th at,and the jorris declaration is sufficient and competent evidence that plaintiffs acted in good faith and hiring qualified counsel in the san bernardino area was impracticable.jorris has been involved in local environmental issues for many years,and he has participated in local litigation as a member of a local environmental group,and he can vouch for the unavailability of qualified local counsel.under these particular circumstances,plaintiffs were not required to produce more detailed evidence,such as evidence of contacts to numerous attorneys who refused the case.through his experience,jorris was well aware of the local market.notably,hawarden vigorously opposed plaintiffs second fee motion,but it adduced no evidence suggesting qualified local counsel was available 
as the only evidence on the issue of availability of local counsel showed plaintiffs need to retain counsel,the court abused its discretion by applying local market rates rather than counsel home market rates.see graciano robinson ford sales,th.we direct the court on remand to hold further proceedings to determine the reasonable home market rate to which plaintiffs attorneys are entitled,both for the appeal in hawarden i and for supplemental fees for trial work based on plain
