this case presents the question,inter alia,as to whether the likely environmental consequences of a potential terrorist attack on a nuclear facility must be considered in an environmental review required under the national environmental policy act.the united states nuclear regulatory commission nrc contends that the possibility of a terrorist attack on a nuclear facility is so remote and speculative that the potential consequences of such an attack need not be considered at all in such a review.the san luis obispo mothers for peace and other groups disagree and petition for review of the nrc approval of a proposed interim spent fuel storage installation.we grant the petition in part and deny it in part.
the nrc is an independent federal agency established by the energy reorganization act of to regulate the civilian use of nuclear materials.intervenor pacific gas and electric company pg e filed an application with the nrc under part for a license to construct and operate an interim spent fuel storage installation storage installation or isfsi at pg e diablo canyon power plant diablo canyon in san luis obispo,california.the nrc granted the license.the question presented by this petition for review is whether,in doing so,the nrc complied with federal statutes including the national environmental policy act of nepa,the atomic energy act of aea,and the administrative procedure act apa.
nepa establishes a national policy to encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment,and was intended to reduce or eliminate environmental damage and to promote the understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the united states.of transp.pub.citizen,d quoting.the supreme court has identified nepa twin aims as plac ing upon an agency the obligation to consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action,and ensur ing that the agency will inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process.baltimore gas natural res.def.council,d.
rather than mandating particular results,nepa imposes on federal agencies procedural requirements that force consideration of the environmental consequences of agency actions.pub.citizen,at.at nepa core is the requirement that federal agencies prepare an environmental impact statement eis,or 
include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,a detailed statement by the responsible official on i the environmental impact of the proposed action,ii any adverse environmental effects which can not be avoided should the proposal be implemented,iii alternatives to the proposed action,iv the relationship between local uses of man environment and the maintenance and enhancement of productivity,and v any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.

while nepa requires the nrc to consider environmental effects of its decisions,the aea is primarily concerned with setting minimum safety standards for the licensing and operation of nuclear facilities.the nrc does not contest that the two statutes impose independent obligations,so that compliance with the aea does not excuse the agency from its nepa obligations.the aea lays out the process for consideration of the public health and safety aspects of nuclear power plant licensing,and requires the nrc to determine whether the licensing and operation of a proposed facility is in accord with the common defense and security and will provide adequate protection to the health and safety of the public.a.
the nrc is not,however,required to make this determination without assistance federal law provides a framework for hearings on material issues that interested persons raise by specific and timely petition.a.the initial hearing is held before a atomic safety and licensing board licensing board.the licensing board findings and decision constitute the agency initial determination,although a party may file a petition for review with the commission within days of the licensing board decision.if the petition is granted,the commission specifies the issues to be reviewed and the parties to the review proceedings,c,and renders a final decision.a party may then petition this court for review of the commission final decision.
with this general statutory background,we turn to the facts underlying the petition for review.on december,pg e applied to the nrc pursuant to part for a license to construct and operate a storage installation at diablo canyon.the storage installation would permit the necessary and storage of spent fuel,the byproduct of the two nuclear reactors at that site.pg e expects to fill its existing spent fuel storage capacity at diablo canyon sometime this year.therefore,unless additional spent fuel storage capacity is created,the diablo canyon reactors can not continue to function beyond.
pg e proposes to build a dry cask storage facility.the basic unit of the storage system is the canister canister,a stainless steel cylinder that is filled with radioactive waste materials and welded shut.the canisters are loaded into concrete storage overpacks that are designed to permit passive cooling via the circulation of air.the storage casks,or the filled canisters loaded into overpacks,are then placed on one of seven concrete pads.the storage installation would house a total of storage casks,more than the projected to be required for storage of spent fuel generated at diablo canyon through.
on april,the nrc published a notice of opportunity for hearing.under the regulatory scheme,interested parties could then request a hearing or petition for leave to intervene.a.a written hearing request,which must contain the contentions the party wants litigated at the hearing,will be granted if the petitioner has standing,and has posed at least one admissible contention id.
on july,the san luis obispo mothers for peace,a corporation concerned with diablo canyon local impact,the sierra club,a corporation concerned with national environmental policy,and peg pinard,an individual citizen,collectively petitioners submitted a hearing request and a petition to intervene,asserting contentions for admission.
in licensing board proceeding,nrc lbp,the atomic safety and licensing board addressed the admissibility of the july petition five technical and three environmental contentions one technical contention,dealing with the state of pg e finances,was deemed admissible the acceptance of at least one contention meant that the petition was granted.although the licensing board deemed two environmental contentions,dealing with the failure to address environmental impacts of terrorist or other acts of malice or insanity,and,dealing with the failure to evaluate environmental impacts of transportation of radioactive materials inadmissible,the licensing board nonetheless referred the final ruling as to the admissibility of these two contentions to the nrc,in light of the commission ongoing top to bottom review of the agency safeguards and physical security programs.nrc at.
in a memorandum and order,nrc cli,the nrc accepted the licensing board referral of its decision to reject the environmental contentions related to terrorism.although the commission affirmed the licensing board rejection of the contentions,it based its decision on a different rationale.the nrc relied on four prior decisions in which it held that the nepa does not require a terrorism review these decisions,most particularly private fuel storage,nrc,outlined four reasons for this holding the possibility of terrorist attack is too far removed from the natural or expected consequences of agency action to require study under nepa because the risk of a terrorist attack can not be determined,the analysis is likely to be meaningless nepa does not require a analysis and nepa public process is not an appropriate forum for sensitive security issues.the nrc concluded 
our decision today rests entirely on our understanding of nepa and of what means are best suited to dealing with terrorism.nonetheless,our conclusion comports with the practical realities of spent fuel storage and the congressional policy to encourage utilities to provide for spent fuel storage at reactor sites pending construction of a permanent repository.storage of spent fuel at commercial reactor sites offers no unusual technological challenges.indeed,it has been occurring at diablo canyon for many years and will continue whether or not we license the proposed installation.
in september of,prior to the nrc decision on the first petition,petitioners submitted a second petition,this time requesting suspension of the storage installation licensing proceeding pending comprehensive review of the adequacy of diablo canyon design and operation measures for protection against terrorist attack and other acts of malice or insanity.unlike the july petition,this one addressed security measures for the entire diablo canyon complex,not merely the storage installation.petitioners explained that,which prohibits challenges to any nrc rule or regulation in an adjudicatory proceeding involving initial or renewal licensing,prevented the raising of contentions contesting the adequacy of nrc safety requirements protecting against terrorist or other malicious attacks on the entire complex in the july petition.petitioners also stated that prevented them from raising emergency planning contentions in the earlier petition.thus,petitioners insisted that the second petition d id not constitute a request for rulemaking,nor for enforcement action,and instead defined it,without reference to any particular provision of the regulations,as a request for actions that are necessary to ensure that any licensing decision made by the commission with respect to the proposed diablo canyon installation complies with the commission statutory obligations under the atomic energy act.
in a memorandum and order,nrc cli,the nrc denied the september petition.because the petition did not,according to the nrc,fit comfortably in any specific category,the commission treat ed it as a general motion brought under the procedural requirements of.in rejecting the petition,the commission reasoned that by not suspending operating licenses at installations and power plants following the september,terrorist attacks,it had demonstrated its implicit conclusion that the continued operation of these facilities neither posed an imminent risk to the public health,nor was inimical to the common defense.further,the commission concluded that because it had already initiated a thorough review of its safeguards and physical security program,there was no reason to suspend the diablo canyon licensing proceeding to address the concerns raised by the petitioners.it stated that t here certainly is no reason to believe that any danger to public health and safety would result from mere continuation of this adjudicatory proceeding,given that the proceeding was in its initial stages,that construction was not scheduled to begin for several years,and that the petitioners would be able to comment on any changes in the rules resulting from the commission ongoing review of matters if and when they were to occur.
in a memorandum and order,nrc cli,the nrc denied the petitions for agency review of the licensing board decisions that cumulatively,rejected challenges to the pg e installation application.this denial thus became a final order,reviewable by this court on petition for review.
in october of,the spent fuel project office of the nrc office of material safety and safeguards released its environmental assessment related to the construction and operation of the diablo canyon independent spent fuel storage installation.the document contains the nrc conclusion that the construction,operation,and decommissioning of the diablo canyon installation will not result in significant impact to the environment,and therefore that an eis is not warranted for the proposed action,and pursuant to,a finding of no significant impact is appropriate.
the ea is not devoid of discussion of terrorist attacks.indeed,the document contains the commission response to a comment submitted by the california energy commission in response to an earlier draft that there is no discussion in the ea of the potential destruction of the casks or blockage of air inlet ducts as the result of sabotage or a terrorist attack nor is there a description of how decisions are being made regarding the configuration,design and spacing of the casks,the use of berms,and the location of the isfsi to minimize the vulnerability of the isfsi to potential attack.the nrc responded 
in several recent cases,the commission has determined that an nrc environmental review is not the appropriate forum for the consideration of terrorist acts.the nrc staff considers the security of spent fuel as part of its safety review of each application for an isfsi license.in addition to reviewing an isfsi application against the requirements of cfr part,the nrc staff evaluates the proposed security plans and facility design features to determine whether the requirements in cfr part,physical protection of plants and materials,are met.the details of specific security measures for each facility are safeguards information,and as such,can not be released to the public.
the nrc has also initiated several actions to further ensure the safety of spent fuel in storage.additional security measures have been put in place at nuclear facilities,including isfsis currently storing spent fuel.these measures include increased security patrols,augmented security forces and weapons,additional security posts,heightened coordination with law enforcement and military authorities,and additional limitations on vehicular access.also,as part of its comprehensive review of its security program,the nrc is conducting several technical studies to assess potential vulnerabilities of spent fuel storage facilities to a spectrum of terrorist acts.the results of these studies will be used to determine if revisions to the current nrc security requirements are warranted.
petitioners argue that,in denying their petitions,the nrc violated the aea,the apa,and nepa.although we reject the aea and apa claims,we agree with petitioners that the agency has failed to comply with nepa.we have jurisdiction over those final orders of the nrc made reviewable by,which includes final orders entered in licensing proceedings,under.
we turn first to petitioners aea argument.specifically,petitioners argue that the nrc violated its regulations implementing the aea,as well as the aea hearing provisions,when it denied petitioners a hearing on whether nepa required consideration of the environmental impact of a terrorist attack on the storage installation they also argue that the nrc violated the aea hearing provisions in denying petitioners a hearing on security measures for the entire diablo canyon complex.both of these challenges fail.
the nrc did not violate the aea or its implementing regulations when it failed to explain its rejection of petitioners contentions by addressing each of their arguments.nothing in the regulations or the aea requires the nrc to provide such an explanation.
section a of the aea grants public hearing rights upon the request of any person whose interest may be affected by an nrc licensing proceeding.the nrc public hearing regulations,at,promulgated pursuant to the aec power to make,promulgate,issue,rescind,and amend such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the aea,p,specify the procedures required of both petitioners and the nrc in making and deciding hearing petitions.
petitioners correctly observe that the nrc,in its decision,did not discuss whether petitioners satisfied the regulatory standard.they are mistaken,however,in their unsupported contention that this omission amounts to the agency failure to follow its own regulations and thus is reversible error.the regulations simply do not require the nrc to explain its decisions in any particular manner.although the nrc regulations are specific and demanding in what they require of petitioners,they demand far less of the nrc in responding to a petition the regulations require only a timely decision.see i decision on.the presiding officer shall,within days after the filing of answers and replies issue a decision on each request for to intervene.because petitioners do not claim that the nrc violated this requirement,we must reject this challenge.
the nrc denial of a hearing on whether nepa requires consideration of the environmental effects of a terrorist attack on the storage installation did not violate the aea hearing provisions.
petitioners contend that the nrc relied on an improper ground in denying their request for a hearing on whether nepa requires the commission to consider the environmental impacts of,the ground that it had determined in earlier decisions that nepa imposes no such obligation.thus,petitioners do not challenge the substantive validity or coherence of those earlier opinions in making their aea claim,but rather the reliance upon a prior determination of the merits in order to reject a petition presenting the same issues.as such,sierra club nrc,cir,on which petitioners rely,does not apply.in that case,the nrc rejected the petitioners contentions as lacking in reasonable specificity,and yet went on to analyze the merits of those supposedly unacceptable contentions.id.at.here,however,where the agency is rejecting the contentions as contrary to a prior decision,the merits and the reason for the inadmissibility of the contention collapse.put differently,the nrc did not reach the merits of the petition as much as it assessed the issues raised against issues resolved by prior decisions.we hold that in doing so,the commission complied fully with the aea.to hold otherwise would unduly restrict the agency evaluation of hearing petitions,by requiring it to grant a hearing on issues it has already resolved whenever a petitioner claims to have new evidence.we can find,and petitioners point to,nothing in the aea that would require this result.
the nrc denial of a hearing on security measures for diablo canyon as a whole also did not violate the aea.petitioners argue that the aea requires the nrc to grant petitioners a hearing on all issues of material fact,including the security of the entire diablo canyon complex.petitioners therefore conclude,citing union of concerned scientists nrc,that the nrc violated the aea when it denied a hearing on that issue.
petitioners argument misreads union of concerned scientists,in which the circuit held only that the agency can not by rule presumptively eliminate a material issue from consideration in a hearing petition.union of concerned scientists requires the agency to consider a petition it does not require that the agency grant it.
the nrc in cli did not deny that security requirements for the entire complex might need to be upgraded,but rather maintained that a licensing proceeding hearing and one regarding an installation,not the entire complex was not the correct forum in which to address the issue.the commission directed petitioners to participate in a rulemaking or to raise their concerns in a hearing then pending before the licensing board.petitioners contend that these alternative fora are illusory,and that rejection of their petition amounted to the denial of any opportunity to participate in the consideration of security measures for the diablo canyon complex.
petitioners argue i f the nrc were going to resolve petitioners concerns that grossly inadequate security made the diablo canyon facility vulnerable to terrorist attacks generically,through a rulemaking,such a rulemaking would have been initiated as a result of the comprehensive security review undertaken by the nrc.thus,petitioners argue that it would have been futile to submit a rulemaking petition.this argument must fail,as petitioners did not use the available procedures for initiating a rulemaking.petitioners can not complain that nrc failed to institute a rulemaking they never requested.
given that rulemaking may have been an avenue for petitioners participation,had they chosen to pursue it,their argument that they had no forum in which to raise their contentions loses its force.however,even were petitioners correct in their assertion that they were unfairly denied the opportunity to participate in a rulemaking proceeding,the argument that the licensing board hearing was similarly illusory would fail.in fact,petitioners were attempting to use the present storage installation licensing proceeding as a means of launching a much broader challenge to the diablo canyon complex.the nrc correctly observes that a petition alleging that existing nrc regulations are grossly inadequate to protect against terrorist attack,and therefore must be supplemented by additional requirements can not in fact be raised before the licensing board,which can not hear challenges to nrc rules.the limited scope of licensing proceedings does not,however,amount to the arbitrary denial of a forum,as petitioners claim.while petitioners could have raised issues relating to the common defense and security that were not controlled by existing rules or regulations to the licensing board,they are not entitled to expand those proceedings to include the entire complex,and issues already covered by agency rules.
in short,the nrc did not violate the aea in denying the petitions for a hearing.neither the aea nor its implementing regulations required the nrc to grant petitioners a hearing on whether nepa required a consideration of the environmental impact of a terrorist attack on the storage installation or the security measures adopted for the entire diablo canyon complex.
the nrc reliance on its own prior opinions in its decision in this case does not violate the apa notice and comment provisions.petitioners argue that the decisions in cli and pfs amount to the announcement of a general policy of refusing to consider the environmental impacts of terrorist attacks in environmental impact statements.petitioners rely on fitzpatrick,cir to claim that this policy depends on factual determinations not found subsequent to an evidentiary proceeding,and constitutes a binding substantive norm,the promulgation of which,without a public hearing,violates the apa notice and comment provisions contained in b,c the flaw in petitioners argument is the mistaken assertion that the nrc decisions were factual and not legal.if the nrc conclusion that terrorism need not be examined under nepa were factual,then petitioners would be correct that its determination would have to comply with apa rulemaking requirements,including notice and comment,or else the agency would have to permit petitioners to challenge it in every proceeding where it was disputed.
that nepa does not require consideration of the environmental impacts of terrorism is a legal,and not a factual,conclusion.greenpeace action franklin,cir reasoning that a challenge to the adequacy of an ea turned on factual,not legal,principles where both nepa applicability and the requirements it imposed were uncontested see also alaska wilderness recreation tourism ass morrison,cir noting that although challenges to agency actions which raise predominantly legal,rather than technical questions,are rare,the court was there required to address just such a challenge.petitioners analysis is therefore inapposite.the agency has the discretion to use adjudication to establish a binding legal norm.see sec.exch.comm chenery.t he choice made between proceeding by general rule or by individual,ad hoc litigation,is one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.we therefore agree with the nrc characterization in its brief to this court having come to the legal conclusion that nepa does not require consideration of the environmental consequences of terrorist attacks,w hen petitioners in this case presented a proposed contention seeking an eis that analyzed the impacts of possible terrorist acts at the proposed diablo canyon installation,the nrc reasonably concluded that this request was sufficiently similar to the request in pfs to justify the application of that decision here.
although we hold that the agency did not violate the apa when it relied on the prior resolution of a legal issue through adjudication,we come to a different conclusion as to that determination compliance with nepa.because the issue whether nepa requires consideration of the environmental impacts of a terrorist attack is primarily a legal one,we review the nrc determination that it does not for reasonableness.see alaska wilderness recreation tourism ass n,at reviewing predominately legal issue for reasonableness because it makes sense to distinguish the strong level of deference we accord an agency in deciding factual or technical matters from that to be accorded in disputes involving predominately legal questions ka kohala ohana,water supply,cir because this case involved primarily legal issues based on undisputed historical facts,we conclude that the reasonableness standard should apply to this case.
here,the nrc decided categorically that nepa does not require consideration of the environmental effects of potential terrorist attacks.in making this determination,the nrc relied on pfs,where it consider ed in some detail the legal question whether nepa requires an inquiry into the threat of terrorism at nuclear facilities.nrc.in that case,intervenor state of utah filed a contention claiming that the september terrorist attacks had materially changed the circumstances under which the board had rejected previously proffered terrorism contentions by showing that a terrorist attack is both more likely and potentially more dangerous than previously thought.id.at.the nrc concluded that even following the september attacks,nepa did not impose such a requirement,reasoning 
in our view,an eis is not an appropriate format to address the challenges of terrorism.the purpose of an eis is to inform the decisionmaking authority and the public of a broad range of environmental impacts that will result,with a fair degree of likelihood,from a proposed project,rather than to speculate about scenarios and how to prevent them.
the nrc determined that four grounds cut against using the nepa framework to consider the environmental effects of a terrorist attack the possibility of a terrorist attack is far too removed from the natural or expected consequences of agency action because the risk of a terrorist attack can not be determined,the analysis is likely to be meaningless nepa does not require a analysis and nepa public process is not an appropriate forum for sensitive security issues.id.at.we review each of these four grounds for reasonableness,and conclude that these grounds,either individually or collectively,do not support the nrc categorical refusal to consider the environmental effects of a terrorist attack.
the commission relied first on finding that the possibility of a terrorist attack is too far removed from the natural or expected consequences of agency action.id.at.section of nepa requires federal agencies to prepare a detailed statement on the environmental impact of any proposed major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c i.the question thus becomes whether a given action significantly affects the environment.
the nrc claims that the appropriate analysis of section is that employed by the supreme court in metropolitan edison people against nuclear energy,d.in metropolitan edison,the court noted that t o determine whether section requires consideration of a particular effect,we must look to the relationship between that effect and the change in the physical environment caused by the major federal action at issue,looking for a reasonably close causal relationship like the familiar doctrine of proximate cause from tort law.at.the commission claims that its conclusion that the environmental impacts of a possible terrorist attack on an facility is beyond a reasonably close causal relationship was a reasonable application of this proximate cause analogy.
the problem with the agency argument,however,is that metropolitan edison and its proximate cause analogy are inapplicable here.in metropolitan edison,the petitioners argued that nepa required the nrc to consider the potential risk of psychological damage upon reopening the three mile island nuclear facilities to those in the vicinity.noting that nepa is an environmental statute,the supreme court held that the essential analysis must focus on the closeness of the relationship between the change in the environment and the effect at issue.at.
the appropriate analysis is instead that developed by this court in no gwen alliance aldridge,cir.in no gwen,the plaintiffs argued that nepa required the air force to consider the threat of nuclear war in the implementation of the ground wave emergency network gwen.we held that the nexus between construction of gwen and nuclear war is too attenuated to require discussion of the environmental impacts of nuclear war in an ea or eis.at.
the events at issue here,as well as in metropolitan edison and no gwen,form a chain of three events a major federal action a change in the physical environment and an effect.metropolitan edison was concerned with the relationship between events and the change in the physical environment,or increased risk of accident resulting from the renewed operation of a nuclear reactor,and the effect,or the decline in the psychological health of the human population.the court in metropolitan edison explicitly distinguished the case where the disputed relationship is between events and we emphasize that in this case we are considering effects caused by the risk of accident.the situation where an agency is asked to consider effects that will occur if a risk is realized,for example,if an accident occurs is an entirely different case.id.at.in no gwen,we followed the court admonition and,in addressing the relationship between events and,we held that the metropolitan edison analysis did not apply because it discusse d a different type of causation than that at issue in this case which require d us to examine the relationship between the agency action and a potential impact on the environment.id.at.no gwen relied on our decision in warm springs dam task force gribble,cir,which held that an impact statement need not discuss remote and highly speculative consequences.applying that standard to the plaintiffs claims that the military gwen system installation would increase the probability of nuclear war,and that gwen would be a primary target in a nuclear war,we held both propositions to be remote and highly speculative,and,therefore,nepa did not require their consideration.
in the present case,as in no gwen,the disputed relationship is between events and the federal act,or the licensing of the storage installation,and the change in the physical environment,or the terrorist attack.the appropriate inquiry is therefore whether such attacks are so remote and highly speculative that nepa mandate does not include consideration of their potential environmental effects.
the nrc responds by simply declaring without support that,as a matter of law,the possibility of a terrorist attack is speculative and simply too far removed from the natural or expected consequences of agency action to require a study under nepa.nrc at.in doing so,the nrc failed to address petitioners factual contentions that licensing the storage installation would lead to or increase the risk of a terrorist attack because the presence of the storage installation would increase the probability of a terrorist attack on the diablo canyon nuclear facility,and the storage installation itself would be a primary target for a terrorist attack.we conclude that it was unreasonable for the nrc to categorically dismiss the possibility of terrorist attack on the storage installation and on the entire diablo canyon facility as too remote and highly speculative to warrant consideration under nepa.
in so concluding,we also recognize that the nrc position that terrorist attacks are remote and highly speculative,as a matter of law,is inconsistent with the government efforts and expenditures to combat this type of terrorist attack against nuclear facilities.in the pfs opinion,the nrc emphasized the agency own efforts against the threat of terrorism 
at the outset,however,we stress our determination,in the wake of the horrific september terrorist attacks,to strengthen security at facilities we regulate.we currently are engaged in a comprehensive review of our security regulations and programs,acting under our duty to protect public health and safety and the common defense and security.we are reexamining,and in may cases have already improved,security and safeguards matters such as guard force size,physical security exercises,clearance requirements and background investigations for key employees,and requirements.more broadly,we are rethinking the nrc threat assessment framework and design basis threat.we also are reviewing our own infrastructure,resources,and communications.
our comprehensive review may also yield permanent rule or policy changes that will apply to the proposed pfs facility and to other facilities.the review process is ongoing and cumulative.it has already resulted in a number of actions to address terrorism threats at both active and defunct nuclear facilities.
nrc at.among these actions is the establishment of an office of nuclear security and incident response,responsible for immediate operational security and safeguards issues as well as for policy development,work ing closely with law enforcement agencies and the office of homeland security,coordinat ing the nrc ongoing comprehensive security review.id.at.
we find it difficult to reconcile the commission conclusion that,as a matter of law,the possibility of a terrorist attack on a nuclear facility is remote and speculative,with its stated efforts to undertake a top to bottom security review against this same threat.under the nrc own formulation of the rule of reasonableness,it is required to make determinations that are consistent with its policy statements and procedures.here,it appears as though the nrc is attempting,as a matter of policy,to insist on its preparedness and the seriousness with which it is responding to the terrorist threat,while concluding,as a matter of law,that all terrorist threats are remote and highly speculative for nepa purposes 
in sum,in considering the policy goals of nepa and the rule of reasonableness that governs its application,the possibility of terrorist attack is not so remote and highly speculative as to be beyond nepa requirements.
the nrc reliance upon the second pfs factor,that the risk of a terrorist attack can not be adequately determined,nrc at,is also not reasonable.first,the nrc dismissal of the risk of terrorist attacks as unquantifiable misses the point.the numeric probability of a specific attack is not required in order to assess likely modes of attack,weapons,and vulnerabilities of a facility,and the possible impact of each of these on the physical environment,including the assessment of various release scenarios.indeed,this is precisely what the nrc already analyzes in different contexts.it is therefore possible to conduct a low consequence analysis without quantifying the precise probability of risk.the nrc itself has recognized that consideration of uncertain risks may take a form other than quantitative probabilistic assessment.in its proposed policy statement on severe accidents and related views on nuclear reactor regulation,the commission stated that 
in addressing potential accident initiators including earthquakes,sabotage,and multiple human errors where empirical data are limited and residual uncertainty is large,the use of conceptual modeling and scenario assumptions in safety analysis reports will be helpful.they should be based on the best qualified judgments of experts,either in the form of subjective numerical probability estimates or qualitative assessments of initiating events and casual sic linkages in accident sequences.
at emphasis added.
no provision of nepa,or any other authority cited by the commission,allows the nrc to eliminate a possible environmental consequence from analysis by labeling the risk as unquantifiable.see limerick ecology action,nrc,cir scirica,dissenting finding no statutory provision,no nrc regulation or policy statement,and no case law that permits the nrc to ignore any risk found to be unquantifiable.if the risk of a terrorist attack is not insignificant,then nepa obligates the nrc to take a hard look at the environmental consequences of that risk.the nrc actions in other contexts reveal that the agency does not view the risk of terrorist attacks to be insignificant.precise quantification is therefore beside the point.
even if we accept the agency argument,the agency fails to adequately show that the risk of a terrorist act is unquantifiable.the agency merely offers the following analysis as to the quantifiability of a potential terrorist attack 
the horrors of september notwithstanding,it remains true that the likelihood of a terrorist attack being directed at a particular nuclear facility is not quantifiable.any attempt at quantification or even qualitative assessment would be highly speculative.in fact,the likelihood of attack can not be ascertained with confidence by any methodology.that being the case,we have no means to assess,usefully,the risks of terrorism at the pfs facility.
nrc at.the agency nonetheless has simultaneously shown the ability to conduct a top to bottom terrorism review.this leaves the commission in the tenuous position of insisting on the impossibility of a meaningful,quantifiable,assessment of terrorist attacks,while claiming to have undertaken precisely such an assessment in other contexts.further,as we have noted,the nrc has required analysis of such threats,involving numerous recognized scenarios 
thus,we conclude that precise quantification of a risk is not necessary to trigger nepa requirements,and even if it were,the nrc has not established that the risk of a terrorist attack is unquantifiable.
the nrc third ground,that it is not required to conduct a analysis,is a non sequitur.although it is a true statement of the law,the agency errs in equating an assessment of the environmental impact of terrorist attack with a demand for a analysis.
the council on environmental quality ceq regulations,promulgated with the purpose of tell ing federal agencies what they must do to comply with nepa procedures and achieve the goals of nepa,have been interpreted by the supreme court as entitled to substantial deference.robertson methow valley citizens council,d citing andrus sierra club,d.these regulations mandated analyses until,when ceq replaced the former,requiring an agency,when relevant information was either unavailable or too costly to obtain,to include in the eis a analysis and an indication of the probability or improbability of its occurrence,with the new and current version of the regulation,which requires an agency to instead deal with uncertainties by including within the eis a summary of existing credible scientific evidence which is relevant to evaluating the reasonable foreseeable significant adverse impacts on the human environment,and the agency evaluation of such impacts based upon theoretical approaches or research methods generally accepted in the scientific community.b.the current requirement applies to those events with potentially catastrophic consequences even if their probability of occurrence is low,provided that the analysis of impacts is supported by credible scientific evidence,is not based on pure conjecture,and is within the rule of reason.b.the supreme court held in robertson that the amendment of the regulations had nullified the analysis requirement.at.edwardsen dep t of interior,cir.
the commission is therefore correct when it argues that nepa does not require a analysis.it is mistaken,however,when it claims that petitioners request for an analysis of
