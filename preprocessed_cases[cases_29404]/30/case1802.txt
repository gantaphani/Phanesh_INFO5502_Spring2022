riverwatch and pala band of mission indians together riverwatch appeal a judgment denying their petition for writ of mandate that challenged the validity of an agreement between the olivenhain municipal water district omwd and gregory canyon gcl based on omwd alleged noncompliance with the california environmental quality act public resources code,et ceqa.on appeal,riverwatch contends the trial court erred by concluding omwd approval of the agreement did not require its prior ceqa review of the environmental impacts of the agreement omwd was a responsible agency under ceqa and the county of san diego department of environmental health deh was not an indispensable party to this action.
factual and procedural background 
in november the voters of san diego county approved proposition c,providing for the construction and operation of a landfill and recycling collection center at the gregory canyon site in northern san diego county landfill.in february deh,as the lead public agency,certified a final environmental impact report eir for the landfill project and,in october approved the landfill project.in july riverwatch joined by the city of oceanside filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the adequacy of the eir.on october,the trial court issued a minute order granting in part and denying in part that petition.the court stated w hile the eir heavily relies on the pumping of groundwater citations for which admittedly there is yet no permit citation,there is no meaningful discussion concerning alternative sources of water or plans to obtain necessary water for the project should the permit not be issued or should water become unavailable the court noted that a update to the eir discussed the trucking of water to the landfill site in the event sufficient groundwater was unavailable the court concluded since trucking water to the site would potentially cause adverse environmental impacts,this alternative should have been studied and included in a supplemental environmental document.thus,riverwatch is correct that the final eir was required to identify the source of water necessary to construct and operate the landfill and to analyze the impacts of obtaining water.citation.the court stated 
riverwatch correctly conclude s the final eir relies on a appropriative right and undocumented riparian rights to conclude that there is sufficient water for the landfill.since the eir is defective as to water supply,it is necessarily defective as to baseline impacts.the final eir is consequently defective in these respects and the court grants riverwatch writ petition as to water supply impacts.
insofar as riverwatch argued respondents should have recirculated the final eir issued a supplemental or subsequent eir based on the new information concerning water supply and specifically information concerning trucking water onto the site,the court grants riverwatch writ petition in that regard as well.citation.
on january,the trial court entered its judgment granting riverwatch petition in part and issued a peremptory writ of mandate ordering deh and the director of the county of san diego solid waste local enforcement agency to set aside the february,decision certifying the eir for the landfill project the june,decision making findings in connection with its approval of the landfill project under ceqa and the june,decisions approving the solid waste facility permit,statement of overriding considerations,and mitigation monitoring and reporting program for the landfill project.the writ remanded those decisions to deh for reconsideration.
on february,omwd board of directors approved an agreement for omwd to provide gcl with up to gallons of recycled water per day for use at the landfill for a term of up to years.at the meeting,gcl counsel informed the board that about truck trips per day would be required to pick up the recycled water at omwd reservoir and pump station near the ranch neighborhood and deliver it to the landfill.the minutes of the board meeting show the directors did not address the eir or any other environmental impacts of the agreement effective as of march,omwd and gcl,as owner of the landfill,entered into the agreement agreement pursuant to which omwd agreed to sell to gcl up to gallons of recycled water per day for a term of up to years.the agreement provided gcl was solely responsible for the use and transportation of the recycled water,which was to be supplied by omwd to gcl at the point of delivery,omwd pump station.section of the agreement provided 
installation of improvements.as a material term of this agreement,gcl shall pay for all new capital facilities that will be necessary to fill gcl trucks at the delivery site.these improvements include at a minimum,but are not limited to,approximately feet of wide asphalt road way,water handling facilities including meter necessary to fill the trucks,concrete loading pad,and other ancillary appurtenances as may be required by omwd in its sole discretion these improvements are currently estimated to cost fifty thousand dollars however,in no case are the costs for the improvements limited to this amount.all improvements determined necessary by omwd must be completed prior to commencing deliveries,and no hauling will be allowed until all necessary regulatory permits if any are acquired by gcl 
section of the agreement provided 
completion of ceqa review and other permits.gcl shall be solely responsible for complying with all ceqa and national environmental protection act requirements necessary for gcl receipt,use and transportation of the recycled water under this agreement.gcl shall also be solely responsible for any and all permits required under any state,federal or local law for its receipt,use and transportation of recycled water under this agreement.
on july,deh,as lead agency for the landfill project,issued a notice of availability of its revised partial draft eir revised draft eir for the gcl landfill project and a related public meeting.the notice stated the revised draft eir was prepared to comply with the trial court january,order and revised limited portions of the eir,noting the public services and facilities section has been revised to analyze impacts of the proposed use of recycled water from omwd,including impacts from improvements at the omwd santa fe valley reservoir and pump station.this water would be trucked from the omwd santa fe valley reservoir and pump station located near the intersection of artesian road and maranatha way in rancho bernardo.the revised draft eir consisted of almost pages.
on august,riverwatch filed the instant petition for writ of mandate challenging omwd approval of the agreement.on march,riverwatch filed the operative first amended petition for writ of mandate.the petition alleged in part 
omwd had discretionary authority with regard to the provision of treated wastewater to gcl,yet omwd did not consider the environmental effects of the agreement as shown in a validly adopted environmental impact report or negative declaration by another agency.omwd also failed to consider feasible mitigation measures and alternatives within its power at the time the agreement was being considered by omwd,the county of san diego was considering revisions to an environmental impact report concerning the proposed landfill project,yet omwd did not wait until the completion and certification of this report before considering the agreement.
omwd did not conduct any environmental review prior to the omwd board action approving the agreement on february,or prior to executing the agreement on march.omwd has not stated that its actions in approving and executing the agreement were exempt from ceqa,and it has not filed a notice of exemption under public resources code section.omwd has not issued a notice of determination under public resources code section.
by failing to provide notice under ceqa or to conduct any environmental review as required by ceqa,omwd made it impossible for persons to comment on the agreement and the potential environmental impacts of entering into the agreement 
riverwatch hereby seek s the issuance of a writ of mandate injunctive or declaratory relief to require omwd to terminate the agreement and to not approve or execute any agreement for a similar purpose unless and until it completes a legally adequate review under ceqa,with notice of the proposed actions provided to residents in the area who will be directly impacted by the activities.
the relief sought by riverwatch included a writ of mandate directing omwd to withdraw its approval of and to terminate the agreement with gcl and to not approve any such agreement to provide treated wastewater to gcl unless and until such time as omwd complies with the requirements of ceqa a temporary restraining order,preliminary injunction,permanent injunction prohibiting omwd gcl from taking any further action to perform under the agreement,including any action that would facilitate,approve,or allow development of the delivery point,until such time as omwd complies with ceqa,and receives all necessary approvals and a declaration that omwd action in approving the agreement violated ceqa.
on june,the trial court overruled omwd and gcl demurrers to the first amended petition.after considering the parties briefs and other papers and hearing counsel arguments on the merits of the petition,the trial court issued its statement of decision denying the petition.the court concluded in the court view,omwd execution of the agreement did not constitute the approval of a project for ceqa purposes,such that prior environmental review was required.citing section of the agreement and the parties two subsequent letters clarifying that provision,the trial court concluded p erformance under the agreement is conditioned upon the completion of adequate review because performance under the agreement here is conditioned on ceqa compliance,the agreement does not constitute an approval subject to ceqa review.because the trial court denied the petition on the ground that omwd approval and execution of the agreement did not constitute approval of a project under ceqa,it did not consider the parties other arguments regarding whether omwd was a lead or responsible agency,whether the agreement constitutes a project under ceqa,and whether riverwatch was required to name deh as party to the action.
on november,the trial court entered judgment for omwd and gcl,denying the petition.riverwatch timely filed a notice of appeal.
discussion 
istandard of review 
the abuse of discretion standard of review applies to our review of omwd compliance with ceqa in the circumstances of this case.section provides 
in any action or proceeding,other than an action or proceeding under section,to attack,review,set aside,void or annul a determination,finding,or decision of a public agency on the grounds of noncompliance with this division,the inquiry shall extend only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.
an appellate court review of the administrative record for legal error and substantial evidence in a ceqa case,as in other mandamus cases,is the same as the trial court the appellate court reviews the agency action,not the trial court decision in that sense appellate judicial review under ceqa is de novo.citations.we therefore resolve the substantive ceqa issues on which we granted review by independently determining whether the administrative record demonstrates any legal error by the public agency and whether it contains substantial evidence to support the public agency factual determinations.vineyard area citizens for responsible growth,city of rancho cordova cal th,d.because omwd did not make any determinations of disputed facts in this case,we review de novo,or independently,the question whether it complied with ceqa,proceeded in a manner required by law in approving and executing the agreement.when a public agency fails to comply with procedures required by law,its decision must be set aside as presumptively prejudicial.sierra club state bd.of forestry cal th,d.noncompliance by a public agency with ceqa substantive requirements constitute s a prejudicial abuse of discretion within the meaning of sections and,regardless of whether a different outcome would have resulted if the public agency had complied with those provisions,subd.a.
ceqa generally 
in general,ceqa compels government first to identify the environmental effects of projects,and then to mitigate those adverse effects through the imposition of feasible mitigation measures or through the selection of feasible alternatives.it permits government agencies to approve projects that have an environmentally deleterious effect,but also requires them to justify those choices in light of specific social or economic conditions.sierra club state bd.of forestry,supra,cal th at,d.
with narrow exceptions,ceqa requires an eir whenever a public agency proposes to approve or to carry out a project that may have a significant effect on the environment.citations.project means,among other things,a ctivities directly undertaken by any public agency or an activity undertaken by a person which is supported,in whole or in part,through contracts or other forms of assistance from one or more public agencies.citation.the legislature has made clear that an eir is an informational document and that t he purpose of an environmental impact report is to provide public agencies and the public in general with detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment to list ways in which the significant effects of such a project might be minimized and to indicate alternatives to such a project.citation.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d,fns.omitted laurel heights.
under ceqa,the public is notified that a draft eir is being prepared citations,and the draft eir is evaluated in light of comments received.citations.the lead agency then prepares a final eir incorporating comments on the draft eir and the agency responses to significant environmental points raised in the review process.citations.the lead agency must certify that the final eir has been completed in compliance with ceqa and that the information in the final eir was considered by the agency before approving the project.citation.before approving the project,the agency must also find either that the project significant environmental effects identified in the eir have been avoided or mitigated,or that unmitigated effects are outweighed by the project benefits.laurel heights,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.if ceqa is scrupulously followed,the public will know the basis on which its responsible officials either approve or reject environmentally significant action,and the public,being duly informed,can respond accordingly to action with which it disagrees.citations.the eir process protects not only the environment but also informed.id.at.
t he ultimate decision of whether to approve a project,be that decision right or wrong,is a nullity if based upon an eir that does not provide the,and the public,with the information about the project that is required by ceqa.santiago county water dist.county of orange d.in city of santee county of san diego d,we stated that only through an accurate view of the project may the public and interested parties and public agencies balance the proposed project benefits against its environmental cost,consider appropriate mitigation measures,assess the advantages of terminating the proposal and properly weigh other alternatives id.at.if a final eir does not adequately apprise all interested parties of the true scope of the project for intelligent weighing of the environmental consequences of the project,informed decisionmaking can not occur under ceqa and the final eir is inadequate as a matter of law.id.at.
although a lead agency is responsible for considering the effects of all activities involved in a project and,if required by ceqa,preparing the draft and final eir and certifying the final eir for a project,a responsible agency typically has permitting authority or approval power over some aspect of the overall project for which a lead agency is conducting ceqa review.citations.responsible agencies have limited ability to conduct their own environmental review outside the processes initiated and managed by the lead agency.citations.the responsible agency relies on the lead agency environmental document in acting on whatever aspect of the project requires its approval.the responsible agency must,however,issue its own findings regarding the feasibility of relevant mitigation measures or project alternatives that can substantially lessen or avoid significant environmental effects.furthermore,where necessary,a responsible agency must issue its own statement of overriding considerations.citations.remy et,guide to the cal.environmental quality act ceqa ed ch.iii,subd.b.
alternatively stated,r esponsible agencies are agencies,other than the lead agency,that have some discretionary authority for carrying out or approving a project.citation.responsible agencies generally rely on the information in the ceqa document prepared by the lead agency,an eir and ordinarily are not allowed to prepare a separate eir or negative declaration.citations.further,while the lead agency is responsible for considering all environmental impacts of the project before approving it,a responsible agency has a more specific charge to consider only those aspects of a project that are subject to the responsible agency jurisdiction.citations.kostka zischke,practice under the cal.environmental quality act ed.more importantly to this case,b efore reaching a decision on the project,the body of the responsible agency must consider the environmental effects of the project as shown in the eir or negative declaration and feasible mitigation measures or alternatives within the agency powers.citation.if the responsible agency finds that any alternatives or mitigation measures within its powers are feasible and would substantially lessen or avoid a significant effect of the project,the responsible agency may not approve the project as proposed,but must adopt the feasible mitigation measures or alternatives.citation.each responsible agency must certify that its body reviewed and considered the information in the eir or negative declaration on the project.citation.kostka zischke,supra.furthermore,a responsible agency must adopt findings when it approves a project for which an eir was prepared.citation.b ecause a responsible agency considers only the parts of the project that are subject to its jurisdiction citation,its findings are required only for those effects within the scope of the responsible agency jurisdiction.kostka zischke,supra.
the agreement activities as part of the landfill project under ceqa 
to determine whether omwd approval of the agreement without consideration of an eir prepared by deh violated ceqa,we first determine whether the activities approved by or to be carried out by omwd under the agreement were part of the landfill project within the meaning of ceqa.
a project subject to ceqa is defined as an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment,and which is any of the following a an activity directly undertaken by any public agency.b an activity undertaken by a person which is supported,in whole or in part,through contracts,grants,subsidies,loans,or other forms of assistance from one or more public agencies.c an activity that involves the issuance to a person of a lease,permit,license,certificate,or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies,italics added.for example,projects or activities directly undertaken by a public agency include public works construction and related activities,clearing and grading of land,and improvements to existing public structures,tit,subd.a.for purposes of ceqa,environment is defined as the physical conditions which exist within the area which will be affected by a proposed project,including land,air,water,minerals,flora,fauna,noise,and objects of historic or aesthetic significance.ceqa applies only to discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or approved by public agencies,subd.a.
project is given a broad interpretation to maximize protection of the environment.mcqueen board of directors d,disapproved on another ground in western states petroleum superior court cal th,fn,d.project refers to the whole of an action,which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment,tit,subd.a,italics added.the term project refers to the activity which is being approved and which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies.the term project does not mean each separate governmental approval,tit,subd.c.whether a particular activity constitutes a project in the first instance is a question of law.black property owners city of berkeley th,d.
based on the undisputed facts in the record,we conclude the activities set forth in the agreement constitute part of the landfill project for purposes of ceqa.because the eir did not include an adequate analysis of water supply issues regarding the landfill project,the trial court issued its january,judgment partially granting riverwatch petition and issued a writ ordering deh and gcl to revise that part of the eir to correct the deficiencies regarding traffic,water supply,and mitigation.the trial court october,statement of decision that partially granted the petition stated in part w hile the eir heavily relies on the pumping of groundwater citations for which admittedly there is yet no permit citation,there is no meaningful discussion concerning alternative sources of water or plans to obtain necessary water for the project should the permit not be issued or should water become unavailable it noted that a update to the eir discussed the trucking of water to the landfill site in the event sufficient groundwater was unavailable.the court concluded since trucking water to the site would potentially cause adverse environmental impacts,this alternative should have been studied and included in a supplemental environmental document.thus,riverwatch is correct that the final eir was required to identify the source of water necessary to construct and operate the landfill and to analyze the impacts of obtaining water.citation.
in an effort to confirm the availability of sufficient water for the landfill construction and operations as required for a revised partial eir for the landfill project,gcl presumably then entered into negotiations,and,as of march,entered into the agreement with omwd for a contractual right to a supply of recycled water that could be trucked to the landfill site.subsequently,on july,deh issued a notice of availability of the revised draft eir,noting the public services and facilities section of the original eir has been revised to analyze impacts of the proposed use of recycled water from omwd,including impacts from improvements at the omwd santa fe valley reservoir and pump station.this water would be trucked from the omwd santa fe valley reservoir and pump station located near the intersection of artesian road and maranatha way in rancho bernardo.furthermore,the july revised draft eir described the landfill project as includ ing the use of recycled water that will be trucked to the project site from omwd santa fe valley reservoir and pump station site near the intersection of artesian road and maranatha way west of.in order to provide adequate water truck access to omwd site,approximately feet of foot wide asphalt roadway will be constructed around omwd blending reservoir.a concrete loading pad will be installed on the site with water handling facilities that include a inch meter to fill the trucks.the revised draft eir also states the primary source of water for the project will be recycled water purchased from omwd.
based on the undisputed facts in the administrative record,we conclude,as confirmed by the subsequent july revised draft eir for the landfill project,the activity of trucking recycled water from omwd to the landfill site is part of the whole action or operations of the landfill project for purposes of ceqa.that activity includes the construction on the omwd site of feet of a asphalt roadway,a concrete loading pad,and a meter.on completion of that construction,as both the agreement and the revised draft eir reflect,the landfill operations will include the trucking of water from omwd to the landfill site,requiring as many as water truck trips to deliver as much as gallons of recycled water per day.gcl performance of the required construction and operation of the water delivery trucks are activities undertaken by gcl supported,in whole or in part,through a contract,the agreement with omwd,a public agency,subd.b.furthermore,it can not reasonably be disputed those activities may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment.the activity of construction of the asphalt road and concrete loading pad at the omwd site presumably will cause noise,traffic,air pollution,and possibly other physical changes in the environment,tit,subd.a project includes activities of grading of land and improvements to existing public structures.more importantly,gcl operational activity of using trucks to transport from omwd to the landfill site up to gallons of recycled water per day for a period of up to years presumably will cause physical changes in the environment.the noise,traffic,and air pollution caused by up to daily trips by water trucks over a period of years can not be deemed to cause no change in the environment.
furthermore,omwd contractual commitment pursuant to the agreement to deliver to gcl up to gallons of recycled water per day for a period of years also raises questions regarding the potential adverse impact on omwd current and future customers and omwd ability to meet the agreement required supply amount in the event of future droughts or water shortages that may occur over the course of the agreement lengthy period.accordingly,we conclude the activities to be undertaken by gcl through the agreement with omwd constitute part of the landfill project,which is subject to ceqa.san joaquin rescue center county of stanislaus th,d housing development project for purposes of ceqa included required expansion of wastewater treatment plant and extension of existing sewer lines to development site santiago county water dist.county of orange,supra,d at.construction of additional water lines and supply of water to proposed mining operation were part of project for ceqa purposes.
omwd as a responsible agency under ceqa 
riverwatch contends that because omwd proposed to carry out or approved part of the landfill project,activities pursuant to the agreement,omwd is a responsible agency under ceqa.
a responsible agency under ceqa is any public agency that proposes to carry out or approve a project,for which a lead agency is preparing or has prepared an eir or negative declaration and for which it has discretionary approval over all or part of that project,tit,see also.if an agency approval is required for any activity integral to the project and the agency could,in its discretion,deny approval,then that agency is a responsible agency under ceqa.lexington hills state of california d.although the lead agency is responsible for considering all environmental impacts of the project before approving it,a responsible agency has a more specific charge to consider only those aspects of a project that are subject to the responsible agency jurisdiction.citations.kostka zischke,practice under the cal.environmental quality act,supra.
based on the undisputed facts in the administrative record,we conclude omwd is a responsible agency under ceqa because it proposes to carry out approved part of the landfill project,those activities described in the agreement.both the construction and water delivery activities provided in the agreement constituted part of the landfill project for ceqa purposes.on february,omwd board of directors approved the agreement and omwd subsequently signed the agreement as of march,pursuant to that approval.by approving the agreement and the activities described therein,omwd exercised its discretionary authority as a public agency to approve part of the landfill project,tit.furthermore,because the agreement requires omwd to deliver to gcl up to gallons of recycled water per day for a period of years,omwd direct activities constitute,in effect,its carrying out part of the landfill project,tit.it can not reasonably be argued that omwd is not a responsible agency under ceqa with respect to the landfill project.
a responsible agency is not limited to those public agencies that approve,or issue a permit for,an entire project,the entire landfill project,but also includes those agencies that carry out or approve part of a proposed project subject to ceqa.furthermore,the fact there are regulatory or other administrative agencies with oversight over recycled water or its use does not preclude omwd from being a responsible agency.see,water code.we are unpersuaded by gcl unsupported argument that a public agency can not be a responsible agency if it merely approves or enters into a contract necessary to carry out part of a project.
was omwd approval of the agreement an approval of a project under ceqa 
riverwatch contends the trial court erred by concluding omwd approval of the agreement did not constitute an approval of part of the landfill project under ceqa.
before approving or carrying out part of a project under ceqa,a responsible agency must consider a final eir or negative declaration prepared and certified by the lead agency and must issue its own findings regarding the feasibility of relevant mitigation measures or project alternatives that can substantially lessen or avoid significant environmental effects.furthermore,where necessary,a responsible agency must issue its own statement of overriding considerations.citations.remy et,guide to ceqa,supra,ch.iii,subd.b,see also.before reaching a decision on the project,the body of the responsible agency must consider the environmental effects of the project as shown in the eir or negative declaration and feasible mitigation measures or alternatives within the agency powers.citation.if the responsible agency finds that any alternatives or mitigation measures within its powers are feasible and would substantially lessen or avoid a significant effect of the project,the responsible agency may not approve the project as proposed,but must adopt the feasible mitigation measures or alternatives.citation.each responsible agency must certify that its body reviewed and considered the information in the eir or negative declaration on the project.citation.kostka zischke,supra.therefore,as with a lead agency,deh,b efore approving the project,the responsible agency,omwd must find either that the project significant environmental effects identified in the eir have been avoided or mitigated,or that unmitigated effects are outweighed by the project benefits.laurel heights,supra,cal d at.
a lead or responsible agency ultimate decision of whether to approve all or part of a project,be that decision right or wrong,is a nullity if based upon an eir that does not provide the,and the public,with the information about the project that is required by ceqa.santiago county water dist.county of orange,supra,d at.eir must be written early enough so that whatever information is contained can practically serve as an input into the decision making process.citation.no oil,city of los angeles cal d,fn.if postapproval environmental review were allowed,eir would likely become nothing more than post hoc rationalizations to support action already taken.laurel heights,supra,cal d at.accordingly,if a responsible agency approves all or part of a project without first considering an eir that has been or is being prepared by the lead agency and without making required findings,the responsible agency has not complied with ceqa and its approval must be set aside.
in this case,omwd and gcl argued,and the trial court concluded,that because omwd performance under the agreement was subject to certain conditions and imposed on gcl the sole responsibility for complying with ceqa,omwd approval and execution of the agreement did not constitute approval of all or part of a project under ceqa.
ceqa regulations often referred to as guidelines define approval as follows 
a approval means the decision by a public agency which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any person legislative action in regard to a project often constitutes approval.
b with private projects,approval occurs upon the earliest commitment to issue or the issuance by the public agency of a discretionary contract,grant,subsidy,loan,or other form of financial assistance,lease,permit,license,certificate,or other entitlement for use of the project,tit,italics added.
interpreting that definition of approval,the california supreme court recently addressed the question of when an agency favoring of and assistance to a project ripens into a commit ment.to be consistent with ceqa purposes,the line must be drawn neither so early that the burden of environmental review impedes the exploration and formulation of potentially meritorious projects,nor so late that such review loses its power to influence key public decisions about those projects.save tara city of west hollywood cal th,d,save tara.save tara addressed the question of whether a ceqa compliance condition necessarily eliminates the need to prepare and consider an eir before approving a development agreement 
a ceqa compliance condition can be a legitimate ingredient in a preliminary agreement for exploration of a proposed project,but if the agreement,viewed in light of all the surrounding circumstances,commits the public agency as a practical matter to the project,the simple insertion of a ceqa compliance condition will not save the agreement from being considered an approval requiring prior environmental review.id.at,d,italics added.
discussing the circumstances in two cases that concluded ceqa conditions precluded agency approval under ceqa and without questioning the correctness of their dispositions,save tara stated that each case involved particular circumstances limiting the reach of its logic neither convinces us a broad rule exists permitting eir preparation to be postponed in all circumstances by use of a ceqa compliance condition.id.at,d.in stand tall on principles shasta union high sch.dist.d,d stand tall,a school district board authorized the district administration to purchase real property for a new school site,specifying that any offer to purchase was to be made contingent on completion of the eir process and final state approval.id.at,d.stand tall concluded the board resolutions regarding the site selection do not constitute an approval under ceqa because they do not commit the district to a definite course of action since they are expressly made contingent on ceqa compliance.id.at,d.however,save tara limited stand tall to its facts because it involved a specific exception for land acquisition agreements t he ceqa regulations exception provides that agencies may designate a preferred site for ceqa review and may enter into land acquisition agreements when the agency has conditioned the agency future use of the site on ceqa compliance,tit,subd.b a.save tara,supra,at,d.save tara explained the ceqa guidelines exception for land purchases is a reasonable interpretation of ceqa,but it should not swallow the general rule reflected in the same regulation that a development decision having potentially significant environmental effects must be preceded,not followed,by ceqa review.see laurel heights,supra,cal d at,a fundamental purpose of an eir is to provide decision makers with information they can use in deciding whether to approve a proposed project,not to inform them of the environmental effects of projects that they have already approved.ibid.
save tara likewise limited the second case,concerned mccloud citizens mccloud community services dist.th,d mccloud,to its particular circumstances.save tara,cal th at,d.in mccloud,a district executed an agreement giving a commercial water bottler exclusive rights to bottle and sell water from the district sources,but the agreement was contingent on the district and the bottler completing during the contingency period proceedings under ceqa without any challenges thereto.mccloud,at,d.mccloud concluded the district had not approved the project because of its contingencies,reasoning the biggest if in the agreement however is if all discretionary permits,expressly defined as including ceqa documentation,review and approvals,along with the final adjudication of any legal challenges based on ceqa,are secured and all environmental,title,physical,water quality and economic aspects of the project are assessed.id.at,d,fn.omitted.save tara noted mccloud relied in part on the agreement lack of information as to the springs that would be exploited,the site of the bottling plant,how the water would be transported,and other details essential to environmental analysis of the project.without that information,mccloud concluded,preparation of an eir would be premature.any analysis of potential environmental impacts would be wholly speculative and essentially meaningless.mccloud,supra,th at,d.in the terms used by the ceqa guidelines to define approval the decision by a public agency which commits the agency to a definite course of action,tit,subd.a mccloud thus speaks as much as to definiteness as to commitment and does not establish that a conditional agreement for development never constitutes approval of the development.save tara,at,d.
save tara rejected the argument that an agency execution of a development agreement could never constitute approval of a project if that agreement provided that the agency retained future discretion to make final ceqa decisions.save tara,supra,cal th at,d.the court stated 
such a rule would be inconsistent with the ceqa guidelines definition of approval as the agency earliest commitment to the project,tit,subd.b,italics added.just as ceqa itself requires environmental review before a project approval,not necessarily its final approval pub.resources code,so the guideline defines approval as occurring when the agency first exercises its discretion to execute a contract or grant financial assistance,not when the last such discretionary decision is made.save tara,at,d.
save tara explained 
a public entity that,in theory,retains legal discretion to reject a proposed project may,by executing a detailed and definite agreement with the private developer and by lending its political and financial assistance to the project,have as a practical matter committed itself to the project for similar reasons,we have emphasized the practical over the formal in deciding whether ceqa review can be postponed,insisting it be done early enough to serve,realistically,as a meaningful contribution to public decisions.id.at,d,italics added.
accordingly,postponing eir preparation and consideration thereof until after a binding agreement for development has been reached would tend to undermine ceqa goal of transparency in environmental decisionmaking when an agency reaches a binding,detailed agreement with a private developer and publicly commits resources and governmental prestige to that project,the agency reservation of ceqa review until a later,final approval stage is unlikely to convince public observers that before committing itself to the project the agency fully considered the project environmental consequences.id.at,d.
on the other hand,we can not agree with the suggestion that any agreement,conditional or unconditional,would be an approval requiring prior preparation of ceqa documentation if at the time it was made the project was sufficiently well defined to provide meaningful information for environmental assessment.citations.save tara,supra,cal th at,d.approval,within the meaning of sections and,can not be equated with the agency mere interest in,or inclination to support,a project,no matter how well defined.save tara,at,d.
save tara adopted the following general approach 
c ourts should look not only to the terms of the agreement but to the surrounding circumstances to determine whether,as a practical matter,the agency has committed itself to the project as a whole or to any particular features,so as to effectively preclude any alternatives or mitigation measures that ceqa would otherwise require to be considered,including the alternative of not going forward with the project.see,tit,subd.e.in this analysis,the contract conditioning of final approval on ceqa compliance is relevant but not determinative.save tara,supra,cal th at,d.

first,the analysis should consider whether,in taking the challenged action,the agency indicated that it would perform environmental review before it makes any further commitment to the project,and if so,whether the agency has nevertheless effectively circumscribed or limited its discretion with respect to that environmental review.second,the analysis should consider the extent to which the record shows that the agency or its staff have committed significant resources to shaping the project.if,as a practical matter,the agency has foreclosed any meaningful option to going forward with the project,then for purposes of ceqa the agency has approved the project.remy et,guide to the cal.environmental quality act ceqa,supra.as this passage suggests,we look both to the agreement itself and to the surrounding circumstances,as shown in the record of the decision,to determine whether an agency authorization or execution of an agreement for development constitutes a decision which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project,tit.save tara,supra,cal th at,d.
applying that general approach to the circumstances in save tara,the court concluded that the c ircumstances surrounding city approval of the draft and final development agreements confirm city commitment to the project.save tara,supra,cal th at,d.despite the final agreement inclusion of a condition granting the city complete discretion over ceqa matters,the city public announcements,its actions preparing to relocate tenants from the property,its substantial financial contribution to the project,and its willingness to bind itself,by the draft agreement,to convey the property if the developer satisfied ceqa requirements,as reasonably determined by the city manager,all demonstrate that city committed itself to a definite course of action regarding the project before fully evaluating its environmental effects.that is what sections and prohibit.save tara,at,d.accordingly,the court returned the matter to the superior court to order the city to set aside its prior approval of the project if the city decides no subsequent or supplemental eir is required,to review that decision and to make any other order necessary and proper under section.save tara,at,d.
based on our independent review of the agreement and the undisputed circumstances surrounding omwd approval and execution of the agreement,we conclude omwd approval and signing of the agreement constituted approval of part of the landfill project within the meaning of ceqa and its guidelines,as interpreted by save tara under ceqa,approval is a decision by a public agency which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any person,tit,subd.a,italics added.furthermore,w ith private projects,approval occurs upon the earliest commitment to issue or the issuance by the public agency of a discretionary contract,tit,subd.b.because the agreement set forth the specific details regarding omwd obligation to deliver recycled water to gcl,and the construction required to allow that delivery,omwd approval and signing of the agreement satisfied the definiteness requirement,a definite course of action.furthermore,when on february,omwd board approved the agreement and omwd execution of the agreement,omwd clearly committed itself to the course of action set forth in the agreement,which is a discretionary contract.therefore,by february,omwd made its earliest commitment to a definite course of action regarding its part of the landfill project,to deliver up to gallons of recycled water to gcl per day for a period of years for use at the landfill project site.
although the agreement contained a provision regarding ceqa responsibility,that provision did not,in any reasonable construction,provide that omwd retained its complete discretion under ceqa as a responsible agency to consider a final eir certified by deh and thereafter approve or disapprove its part of the landfill project pursuant to the agreement or to require mitigation measures or alternatives to its part of the project.section of the agreement provided 
completion of ceqa review and other permits.gcl shall be solely responsible for complying with all ceqa and national environmental protection act requirements necessary for gcl receipt,use and transportation of the recycled water under this agreement.gcl shall also be solely responsible for any and all permits required under any state,federal or local law for its receipt,use and transportation of recycled water under this agreement.
that section provides it is gcl sole responsibility for complying with ceqa regarding gcl receipt,use,and transportation of the recycled water it purchases from omwd pursuant to the agreement.it does not provide that omwd is responsible for complying with ceqa as a responsible agency or even that omwd performance of the agreement is subject to omwd broad discretion to approve or disapprove the agreement or to require mitigation measures or alternatives to the water delivery and construction activities set forth in the agreement after omwd has considered a final eir certified by deh regarding the landfill project.although the trial court,in interpreting section of the agreement,considered two letters between omwd and gcl sent after execution of the agreement,neither letter supports a reasonable inference that section of the agreement conditioned omwd performance on its subsequent exercise of its ceqa responsibilities and discretion after considering a final eir certified by deh.on april,omwd sent gcl a letter stating 
the purpose of this letter is to reiterate per the terms of of the agreement that omwd will not deliver recycled water to gcl until such time gcl has completed a legally adequate ceqa process which addresses the impacts of the use of recycled water on the project,san diego county has adopted the eir for the project and all other necessary permits for the project are in place.italics added.
in reply,on may,gcl counsel sent omwd a letter,stating 
gcl is in receipt of your letter dated april,confirming that paragraph of the agreement executed with omwd on march,expressly conditions the delivery of recycled water to the gcl landfill upon completion and certification of an eir prepared by deh that analyzes all environmental impacts of the project,including those associated with the use of recycled water.
gcl acknowledges and agrees that paragraph requires the completion and certification of an eir by deh that analyzes all environmental impacts of the project,including those associated with the use of recycled water.italics added.
assuming arguendo the trial court properly considered those letters in interpreting the agreement,neither letter supports an interpretation of the agreement that omwd as a responsible agency retained its full discretion under ceqa,after considering a final eir certified by deh regarding the landfill project,to approve or disapprove the activities provided for in the agreement or to require mitigation measures regarding or alternatives to those activities.rather,section of the agreement,even as subsequently clarified by the parties letters,merely acknowledges that deh as the lead agency is in the process of preparing a final eir that will address the environmental impacts of the landfill project,including gcl use of recycled water obtained from omwd,and that gcl is responsible for complying with ceqa,those requirements set forth in the final eir certified by deh.the agreement omits any reference to omwd duties,as a responsible agency regarding the landfi
