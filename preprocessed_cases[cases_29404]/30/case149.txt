the plaintiffs appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york kevin castel,judge,which,among other things,dismissed on a motion for summary judgment their claims challenging the public resource depredation order,the depredation order,on the grounds that it violates treaty obligations of the united states and federal statutes.we consider on appeal whether the defendants issued the depredation order in compliance with the migratory bird treaty act mbta,et,the administrative procedure act apa,the national environmental policy act nepa,et,and international treaties relating to the treatment of migratory birds to which the united states is a party.
background 
the plaintiffs are individuals who,and organizations whose members,derive pleasure from observing water birds known as cormorants cormorants in their natural habitat.these birds are not protected by the endangered species act,et,but their treatment is regulated by international treaties to which the united states is a party,and by federal statutes and regulations.the fish and wildlife service fws has been delegated primary responsibility for regulating migratory birds,including cormorants.see migratory bird permits regulations for cormorant management.
the plaintiffs brought this action to challenge the depredation order,which,they allege,violates the relevant treaties and statutes by authoriz ing state fish and wildlife agencies,indian tribes,and department of agriculture employees to kill an unlimited number of federally protected cormorants in new york and other states,without any restrictions on time of year or location of the killings,without any advance notice to the fws,and without any showing of specific,localized harm caused by the cormorants.compl.
because they are migratory birds,cormorants regularly cross national boundaries.prior to,the treatment of these birds was regulated by individual nations within their own borders,making it difficult for any individual country to protect their populations from or other harm.in order to create a uniform system for migratory birds that passed through their territories,the united states in negotiated a treaty with the united kingdom,acting on behalf of canada,to coordinate protection of certain bird populations.see convention between the united states of america and the united kingdom of great britain and ireland for the protection of migratory birds in the united states and canada,proclamation,stat.convention.similar treaties were later entered into by the united states with mexico in,japan in,and the soviet union in.see convention between the united states of america and the united mexican states for the protection of migratory birds and game mammals,stat.mexico convention convention between the government of the united states of america and the government of japan for the protection of migratory birds and birds in danger of extinction,and their environment,convention between the united states of america and the union of soviet socialist republics concerning the conservation of migratory birds and their environment.each of these treaties lists the birds that are protected under its terms.only the mexico convention,as amended in,explicitly applies to cormorants.
the original mexico convention provides,in pertinent part 
article i.in order that the species may not be exterminated,the united states and mexico declare that it is right and proper to protect birds denominated as migratory by means of adequate methods which will permit,in so far as the respective high contracting parties may see fit,the utilization of said birds rationally for purposes of sport,food,commerce and industry.
article ii.the united states and mexico agree to establish laws,regulations and provisions to satisfy the need set forth in the preceding article,including 
a the establishment of close seasons,which will prohibit in certain periods of the year the taking of migratory birds 
c the limitation of their hunting to four months in each year,as a maximum,under permits issued by the respective authorities in each case.
d the establishment of a close season for wild ducks

migratory birds.
mexico convention,arts.i,ii,iv,stat.at.the amendments to the mexico convention added the cormorant family of birds,but did not specify whether it was a game or bird.see agreement between the government of the united mexican states and the government of the united states of america amending article of the convention for the protection of migratory birds and game mammals,signed at mexico city on february,mexico convention amendments.it is undisputed for present purposes that the cormorant is a bird.
the mbta implements these treaties as federal law.it was first enacted in to reflect the mandates of the convention,and later amended to reflect each of the subsequently negotiated treaties.the statute makes it unlawful at any time,by any means or in any manner,inter alia,to take birds listed in the relevant treaties.a.to take a bird means to pursue,hunt,shoot,wound,kill,trap,capture,or collect,or attempt to pursue,hunt,shoot,wound,kill,trap,capture,or collect it.
the mbta also delegates authority to the united states secretary of the interior,
from time to time,having due regard to the zones of temperature and to the distribution,abundance,economic value,breeding habits,and times and lines of migratory flight of such birds,to determine when,to what extent,if at all,and by what means,it is compatible with the terms of the conventions to allow hunting,taking,capture,killing,possession,sale,purchase,shipment,transportation,carriage,or export of any such bird,or any part,nest,or egg thereof,and to adopt suitable regulations permitting and governing the same,in accordance with such determinations,which regulations shall become effective when approved by the president.
this authority has been subdelegated by the secretary to the fws.see.
when migratory birds converge in large numbers,they may consume large quantities of local plants,fish,or other species.in doing so,they may harm commercial activity dependent on those species.for example,as the cormorant population has grown over the past several decades,the fws has received increasing numbers of complaints from fishermen and operators of aquaculture facilities,such as commercial catfish farms,asserting that cormorants are responsible for plundering the same fish that they seek to gather,cultivate,and sell.
when migratory birds cause,or are about to cause,such acts of depredation,the fws may,upon application,issue a permit that allows a person to take migratory birds for depredation control purposes.see.applications for such permits must include,inter alia,a description of the area where depredations are occurring the nature of the crops or other interests being injured the extent of such injury and the particular species of migratory birds committing the injury.id.permittees are subject to a variety of conditions,including limitations on the manner in which the birds in question may be killed and the proper methods of disposing of their remains.id.
as an alternative to individual permits,the fws may,u pon the receipt of evidence clearly showing that migratory game birds have accumulated in such numbers in a particular area as to cause or about to cause serious damage to agricultural,horticultural,and fish cultural interests issue by publication in the federal register a depredation order.such an order must state explicitly that it is an emergency measure designed to relieve depredations only and it must impose certain restrictions on the manner in which birds may be killed.id.
in addition to these general provisions for addressing depredations,the fws also provides specific rules for depredation orders that have been issued relating to specific species.see.the rules referred to above were all in effect prior to and at the time of the fws promulgation of the orders at issue in this appeal.
agency proceedings 
in response to complaints that cormorants habits were becoming increasingly costly to aquaculture and other industries,the fws in adopted an aquaculture depredation order,allowing the taking of cormorants without a permit when they are found committing or about to commit acts of depredation on aquaculture stocks,subject to various conditions and only within thirteen enumerated states.see id.this provision was amended when the fws adopted the depredation order at issue in this appeal.
in response to continued complaints of depredations,and an increase in complaints unrelated to aquaculture,the fws in issued a notice of intent to develop a national cormorant management plan with an accompanying environmental impact statement eis as required by nepa.migratory bird permits notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement and national management plan for the cormorant,see also c.the fws also formed a cormorant team consisting of staff members from various fws offices which consulted with the department of agriculture animal and plant health inspection service aphis.the team evaluated methods of managing the cormorant population.in december,it released a draft eis deis for public comment.notice of availability draft environmental impact statement on cormorant management.the deis presented six management alternatives to address biological and socioeconomic resource conflicts associated with cormorants.id.they included no action continuation of existing cormorant management practices only management techniques expansion of existing cormorant management policies a new depredation order reduction of regional cormorant populations and frameworks for a cormorant hunting season.id.from these alternatives,the team recommended the fourth,proposing in the deis the adoption of a new depredation order to allow public resource managers greater flexibility in dealing with cormorant conflicts while ensuring federal oversight via reporting and monitoring requirements.id.
the proposed depredation order,as described by the deis,authoriz es state,tribal,and federal land management agencies to implement a cormorant management program,while maintaining federal oversight of cormorant populations via reporting and monitoring requirements.fish and wildlife service,draft environmental impact statement cormorant management,available at.gov migratorybirds issues cormorant deis chapter.pdf last visited july.these land management agencies would be allowed to take cormorants without a permit to protect biological resources on public lands and waters,though they were to utilize management tools to the extent they consider ed appropriate.id.at.the agencies would be required to keep records of all activities and report this data to the fws annually.id.at.the fws reserved the authority to immediately suspend or revoke any agency authority under the proposed depredation order if the agency did not adhere to the terms specified in the order,if the fws determined that cormorants no longer posed a threat to public resources,or if the viability of the cormorant population was threatened.id.
in march,the fws published a proposed rule reflecting slight modifications of the proposed depredation order as described in the deis.migratory bird permits regulations for cormorant management.proposed,to be codified at pt.among other changes,the proposed rule reduced the number of states to which the proposed depredation order would apply from to,identified with greater specificity the agencies to which the order would apply,restricted its applicability to land and freshwater therefore excluding saltwater,and allowed more methods for taking cormorants.id.at.it also noted that w hile the fws has the primary responsibility for regulating cormorant management,management activities are largely carried out by entities such as state fish and wildlife agencies,wildlife damage control agencies such as the wildlife services program of aphis and,in some cases,by private citizens.id.
the fws published its final eis in august and issued a final rule on october.see notice of availability final environmental impact statement on cormorant management,migratory bird permits regulations for cormorant management final rule.the final rule established the depredation order,and amended the aquaculture depredation order.
before issuing the order,the fws reviewed studies related to the growth,breeding,and travel patterns of cormorants in north america.based on what it considered to be the available science,the agency concluded that 
cormorants are generalist predators whose diet varies considerably between seasons and locations and tends to reflect fish species composition the present composition of cormorant diet appears to have been strongly influenced by changes in the natural balance of fish stocks impact can occur at different scales,such that ecological effects on fish populations are not necessarily the same as effects on recreational or commercial catches,or vice versa cormorant impact is generally most significant in artificial,highly managed situations and because environmental and other conditions vary locally,the degree of conflicts with cormorants will vary locally.
final rule.at.the fws noted that in addition to the losses at aquaculture facilities resulting from cormorant depredations,cormorants could also have an adverse impact on other birds and local vegetation.id.
in its final form,the depredation order authorizes state fish and wildlife agencies,federally recognized tribes,and state directors of the wildlife services program to prevent depredations on the public resources of fish,wildlife,plants,and their habitats by taking without a permit cormorants found committing or about to commit,such depredations.c.the rule requires the initial use of control methods,id.d,applies only to cormorants,id.d,and mandates specific measures intended to limit the impact of control efforts on species protected under the endangered species act,id.d.agencies acting pursuant to the depredation order must,for each year in which they intend to act,provide a written notice to the fws indicating their intent to act under the depredation order,id.d,and they must notify the fws in writing thirty days in advance if any single control action would individually,or a succession of such actions would cumulatively,kill more than percent of the cormorants in a breeding colony,id.d i.the fws has the power to prohibit such activity if the fws deems it a threat to the sustainability of cormorants or any other migratory bird species.id.d ii.agencies are also required to submit annual reports describing their activities under the depredation order,including numbers of cormorants killed and nests whose eggs were oiled,id.d,and the fws reserves the right to suspend or revoke the authority of any person acting pursuant to the depredation order,id.d.in addition to adopting the depredation order,the fws expanded the aquaculture depredation order to allow cormorants to be taken at their winter roost sites.final rule.at.
district court proceedings 
in february,the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york challenging,inter alia,the fws adoption of the depredation order,asserting that it was contrary to treaties to which the united states is a party,federal statutes,and fws regulations.the parties all eventually moved for summary judgment.
in a memorandum and order filed march,the district court concluded that the depredation order is not in conflict with the mbta because it balances the factors set forth by the mbta and determines when,to what extent,if at all,and by what means the taking of cormorants is permissible.fund for animals norton,d,quoting a.to the extent that the mbta requires a national approach to migratory bird management,the district court reasoned,the requirement is not in conflict with the depredation order limited delegation of discretion to state agencies and regional branches of the fws because the fws has not abdicated its authority,or granted states free reign over management of the cormorant population,particularly in light of the depredation order notice requirements and limits placed on the manner in which cormorants may be taken.id.at.the district court also concluded that the depredation order does not conflict with the mexico convention.although the convention requires that each nation establish close seasons during which takings are prohibited,the district court deferred to the fws view that this provision applies only to the category of game birds,which the parties agree does not include the cormorant.id.at.
the district court rejected the plaintiffs argument that the defendants adoption of the depredation order was arbitrary and capricious,and contrary to the apa,for it found that the record adequately demonstrates that the cormorant adversely affects public resources the depredation order is a reasonable method of effectuating the goals of the mbta and the depredation order does not conflict with the fws internal regulations.id.at.the court also determined that the defendants had complied with the requirements of nepa by issuing the final eis.id.at.
the district court therefore granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,dismissing all of the plaintiffs claims.
the plaintiffs appeal the judgment of the district court,but only as to some of the issues it decided

ii.whether the depredation order violates the mbta 
the plaintiffs argue that by delegating management authority to the states and other agencies,the depredation order violates the mbta requirement that any killings of protected birds be specifically authorized by the fws.we agree with the district court,however,that the discretion granted to these third parties is limited and subject to adequate oversight by the fws,and that the depredation order therefore does not contravene the mbta.
delegation of statutory responsibility by federal agencies and officers to outside parties is problematic because lines of accountability may blur,undermining an important democratic check on government,telecom ass fcc,cert.denied,and because outside parties,whether private or sovereign,might not share the agency national vision and perspective,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we agree with the circuit that,absent statutory authorization,such delegation is impermissible.id.
the mbta authorizes the secretary of the interior to determine when,to what extent,if at all,and by what means takings may occur,a,and to adopt suitable regulations permitting and governing the same,but the statute does not specifically provide for this authority to be delegated to third parties.because any unauthorized delegation of this authority beyond the agency would be impermissible,our inquiry focuses on whether the depredation order is,in fact,such a delegation.
an agency delegates its authority when it shifts to another party almost the entire determination of whether a specific statutory requirement has been satisfied,telecom,at,or where the agency abdicates its final reviewing authority,park conservation ass stanton,d.agencies may seek advice and policy recommendations from outside parties,but they may not decisions made by others under the guise of seeking their advice.telecom,at.if all it reserves for itself is the extreme remedy of totally terminating the delegation agreement,park,d at,an agency abdicates its final reviewing authority,id.at.
in the case at bar,the authority delegated by congress to the fws under the mbta bears little resemblance to the far narrower band of discretion afforded to those acting under the depredation order.the mbta requires the secretary to determine when,to what extent,if at all,and by what means,it is compatible with the terms of the conventions to permit takings and killings of migratory birds.by contrast,third parties acting pursuant to the depredation order are limited to takings of cormorants,and cormorants only,and even then,solely to prevent depredations on the public resources of fish,wildlife,plants,and their habitats.c.even if we accept the plaintiffs warning that the term depredation is not explicitly defined by the fws and could include birds engaging in the natural behavior of eating fish with no evidence of harm to a fish population overall,the depredation order nonetheless restricts the species,locations,and means by which takings in response to such depredations could occur,thereby restricting the discretion that may be exercised by third parties acting under the order.
the depredation order therefore does not represent a delegation of authority but is,instead,a permissible grant of permission conditioned on the decision of another entity,such as a state,local,or tribal government,with a reasonable connection between the outside entity decision and the federal agency determination.telecom,at.by adopting a rule that provides local agencies discretion to determine what constitutes a depredation within a localized context,the fws was exercising its broad permitting authority while incorporating obviously relevant local concern s as element s of its decision process.id.
as a practical matter,of course,by issuing the depredation order,the fws has limited its ability to regulate in advance those takings that are authorized by the order.in this regard,the depredation order differs from the permit and rulemaking system for handling requests for depredation permits set forth at,which prohibits depredation control efforts unless the fws first affirmatively issues a permit or order,and which requires the fws to consider beforehand evidence of damage caused or about to be caused by migratory birds.there is,however,no statutory requirement that the fws provide prior authorization in the form of a permit for specific takings of migratory birds.the mbta mandates only suitable regulations permitting and governing takings.a.the regulations restricting the taking of migratory birds,even in the absence of an advance permitting scheme,satisfy this statutory requirement.
it is also worth noting that the fws does retain some authority to regulate takings under the depredation order before they occur.for example,the fws must be notified days in advance of depredation control efforts that would kill more than percent of the cormorants in a breeding colony and may pre
