jim hodges,the governor of south carolina,has appealed the june,order of the district court,which awarded summary judgment to the united states department of energy and its secretary,spencer abraham collectively,the doe.governor hodges contends that the doe has failed to comply with the national environmental policy act nepa in connection with its transfer of surplus plutonium from colorado to south carolina.in response,the doe maintains that governor hodges lacks standing to pursue this case and that,in any event,it has complied with the mandate of nepa.as explained below,we conclude that,although the governor possesses standing to maintain this action,nepa has not been contravened.we therefore affirm.
in,the doe began to consider the issues of whether and how to close its rocky flats environmental technology site near denver,colorado rocky flats.in order to carry out such a closing,the doe must transfer the plutonium at rocky flats to other doe sites for storage and eventual disposition as such,the doe considered utilizing its savannah river site the srs,located near aiken,south carolina,for the storage and disposition of the rocky flats plutonium.it prepared various nepa compliance documents and materials analyzing and explaining the potential use of srs for these purposes.after nearly seven years of study,the doe announced,in its april,amended record of decision the april rod,that six metric tons of surplus plutonium will be transferred from rocky flats to srs for storage.
on may,governor hodges initiated this lawsuit,seeking to enjoin the doe from shipping the rocky flats plutonium into the palmetto state.he maintained that the doe violated nepa in failing to properly consider the environmental consequences of its april rod,and that it had failed to comply with nepa procedures prior to issuance of the rod.on for summary judgment,the district court rejected the positions of governor hodges in their entirety,and it declined to award injunctive relief against the doe hodges abraham,ca,memorandum opinion and order,june,the opinion on appeal,the doe contends,for the first time,that governor hodges lacks standing to pursue his claims in this case.before analyzing the standing question which implicates our jurisdiction in this proceeding and the merits of governor hodges appeal,we will review the pertinent facts and legal principles governing the nepa issues presented 
the events giving rise to this dispute began over fifty years ago,with the advent of nuclear technology and nuclear weapons.during the cold the late to the late united states and the soviet union engaged in a nuclear arms race,and they produced thousands of nuclear weapons powered by tons of plutonium.following the demise of the soviet union and the end of the cold war,our country and the government of russia acted both bilaterally and unilaterally to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpiles.in january,they issued a joint statement between the united states and russia on nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means of their delivery,which established the mutual goal of safe,secure,storage and disposition of surplus fissile materials.in order to demonstrate our nation commitment to this goal,president clinton,on march,unilaterally announced that a total of metric tons of our plutonium was no longer necessary for defense purposes,and that it therefore constituted surplus plutonium.in september,the united states and russia formally pledged in writing that each would dispose of metric tons of surplus plutonium.agreement between the government of the united states of america and the government of the russian federation concerning the management and disposition of plutonium designated as no longer required for defense purposes and related cooperation.pursuant to this agreement,each country committed to seek to begin operation of facilities to dispose of the surplus plutonium not later than december.
in this country,the responsibility for monitoring,storing,and disposing of nuclear materials,including plutonium,necessarily rests with the federal government,specifically the doe,a.since the president pledge,the doe has studied and explored several options aimed at determining the most effective way to fulfill its responsibility to store and dispose of our nation surplus plutonium.throughout this effort,the doe has been subject to the requirements of nepa,a statute enacted in to ensure that environmental concerns play a role in government decisionmaking.
nepa establishes a national policy of protecting and promoting environmental quality.hughes river watershed conservancy glickman,cir.although nepa does not place substantive requirements on federal agencies,it requires them to follow certain procedures prior to undertaking any proposed action,proposal,or project that may affect the environment.robertson methow valley citizens council,d.once the proper nepa procedures are completed,the adverse environmental effects of the proposed action are adequately identified and evaluated,a federal agency is entitled to decid e that other values outweigh the environmental costs.id.as the supreme court has observed,nepa merely prohibits than action.id.at.the purpose of nepa is.first,it ensures that an agency,in reaching its decision,will have available,and will carefully consider,detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts.id.at.in other words,nepa guarantees that an agency will take a hard look at environmental consequences before making a decision that may affect the environment.id.at.quoting kleppe sierra club,d.second,compliance with nepa procedures ensures that relevant information about a proposed project will be made available to members of the public so that they may play a role in both the decisionmaking process and the implementation of the decision.hughes river,at.
pursuant to section of nepa,a federal agency must prepare an environmental impact statement eis for every recommendation or report on proposals for major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.the council on environmental quality ceq,a governmental body created by nepa for the purpose of advising the president on environmental matters,has promulgated extensive regulations to aid federal agencies in determining whether a proposed action might significantly affect the quality of the human environment.providing that ceq guidelines are binding on all federal agencies incorporating ceq guidelines into doe regulations in determining whether an environmental impact is significant,the ceq regulations require agencies to consider both the context and the intensity of the potential impact of a proposed action,with the former focusing on the affected geographical region and its interests,and the latter looking to the severity of the proposal environmental impact.if,in the circumstances,it is unclear whether an eis is necessary,the agency is obliged to complete what is known as an environmental assessment ea,which is a concise public document reviewing and analyzing whether an eis is required.
a federal agency responsibilities under nepa do not end with the preparation of an eis.if an agency plans change,or if the circumstances surrounding a project are altered,nepa obligations may be triggered.as the supreme court has observed,i t would be incongruous with nepa approach to environmental protection for the blinders to adverse environmental effects,once unequivocally removed,to be restored prior to completion of agency action simply because the relevant proposal has received initial approval.marsh oregon natural res.council,d.the ceq regulations mandate that a federal agency prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement seis if t he agency makes substantial changes in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns,or if t here are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.c.in addition,the doe regulations for the implementation of nepa provide that it shall prepare an seis if there are substantial changes to a proposal or significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns.a.if it is unclear whether an seis is required in connection with one of its projects,the doe is obliged to prepare what is called a supplement analysis sa.c.under the doe regulations,an sa must contain sufficient information for the doe to determine whether an existing eis should be supplemented,whether a new eis should be prepared,or whether no further nepa documentation is necessary.c.in sum,nepa requires the doe,before undertaking a proposed action or altering an existing one,to examine the environmental consequences thereof 
in the wake of the president pledge that the united states would dispose of metric tons of surplus plutonium,the doe began exploring its options with respect to the storage and disposition of the surplus plutonium at rocky flats.the doe continuing effort to comply with nepa included the following statements,analyses,and records of decision 
in december,the storage and disposition of fissile materials final programmatic environmental impact statement the peis 
in july,the supplement analysis for storing plutonium in the actinide packaging and storage facility and building at the savannah river site the sa 
in november,the surplus plutonium disposition final environmental impact statement the november eis 
in january,the record of decision for the surplus plutonium disposition final environmental impact statement the rod 
in january,the amended record of decision the rod 
in february,the supplement analysis for storage of surplus plutonium materials in the material storage facility at the savannah river site the sa 
in april,the amended record of decision the april rod.
we now turn to the contents and conclusions of these nepa materials.
in december,the doe issued its peis,which studied various alternatives for the storage and disposition of this country surplus and plutonium.one of the goals of the peis was the reduction of the number of sites utilized by the doe as federal storage facilities for plutonium.toward that end,the peis proposed closing rocky flats and transferring its plutonium to other doe sites.the doe preferred alternative contemplated,inter alia,the possibility of building three new facilities at srs and the prompt transfer of some of the rocky flats plutonium to the new srs facilities.the additional srs facilities contemplated by the peis were 
a plutonium storage facility known as the actinide packaging and storage facility apsf.the decision to build apsf had actually been made in,and its original purpose was to stabilize,package,and store materials already located at srs.the peis,however,proposed modifying the construction plans for apsf to allow for the receipt of plutonium from rocky flats.
a facility that could dispose of surplus plutonium through immobilization.the process of immobilization calls for surplus plutonium to be placed in glass or ceramic material for disposal in a geologic repository pursuant to the nuclear waste policy act.in,srs already had facilities that could be dedicated to immobilization,but the peis contemplated modifying those facilities or constructing new ones to handle the immobilization of some of the nation surplus plutonium.
a facility to convert surplus plutonium into mixed oxide fuel mox fuel.the peis proposed utilizing a mox fuel disposition strategy in conjunction with immobilization,by which surplus plutonium would be mixed with uranium dioxide and burned in existing domestic,commercial reactors,with subsequent disposal of the spent fuel in a geologic repository pursuant to the nuclear waste policy act.as with immobilization,the peis did not rule out simply modifying existing buildings at srs to create the mox fuel fabrication facility.
although the preferred alternative of the peis addressed only the storage of surplus plutonium at srs pending its disposition,the peis also studied other options.one such proposal was to upgrade the contemplated apsf to handle the storage of surplus plutonium from several doe sites,including rocky flats,for up to fifty years pending its disposition.
in july,the doe prepared the sa,announcing that it could save the government approximately billion by closing rocky flats in,four years earlier than had been previously contemplated.prior to closing rocky flats,however,it was necessary for the doe to transfer all of that facility plutonium to other doe sites.this planned plutonium transfer was complicated by the fact that the apsf,which was to serve as the srs storage facility for the plutonium from rocky flats,was not scheduled to be completed by the time such plutonium shipments were to commence.the sa consequently analyzed whether an existing building at,also known as kams could be expanded and modified for interim storage of the rocky flats plutonium for a period of up to ten years.the sa concluded that there would be no environmentally significant difference in storing the rocky flats plutonium at for up to ten years,rather than as the peis had contemplated at apsf.thus,in the sa,the doe concluded that no further nepa study or documentation was necessary with respect to the temporary storage of the rocky flats plutonium at.
in its november eis,the doe took the next step in the nepa process leading to the present controversy,by examining how to dispose of up to fifty metric tons of plutonium specifically,the november eis analyzed the utilization of a hybrid approach to surplus plutonium disposition,whereby metric tons of plutonium would be converted into mox fuel and seventeen metric tons would be immobilized.thereafter,on january,the doe issued its rod,announcing that it intended to pursue the hybrid disposition approach studied in the november eis.pursuant thereto,srs was designated as the site for both the immobilization facility and the mox fuel facility.the rod provided,however,that t he construction of new facilities for the disposition of surplus plutonium would not take place unless there is significant progress on plans for plutonium disposition in russia.id.at.
in january,the doe again altered its plans.in the rod,it abandoned its plan to construct the apsf at srs,and it instead decided to modify an existing building at srs for the interim storage of surplus plutonium,pending its disposition.as we have noted,the doe,in its sa,had contemplated storage of the rocky flats plutonium at the facility for up to ten years.with the cancellation of the apsf project,however,the doe recognized that it might be necessary to store surplus plutonium in the facility for a longer period of time,and it then proceeded to assess the feasability of plutonium storage at.as a result,the doe issued the sa.the doe therein examined whether the storage of plutonium at created any new environmental impacts not previously considered in the peis and the sa,and it determined that none existed.the doe therefore concluded that the safe storage of surplus plutonium in kams can continue beyond years pending disposition,and that no further nepa study was necessary.sa at.
during,the schedule for design,construction,and operation of the immobilization facility at srs was delayed indefinitely by budgetary constraints.the doe thereafter announced,inter alia,in its april rod that it was cancelling its plans to immobilize plutonium at srs and that had been selected as the consolidated storage site for the surplus plutonium at rocky flats.the april rod also stated that the prospect of disposing of surplus plutonium by converting it into mox fuel was still under consideration by the doe and would be determined after further study.in reaching the decisions set forth in the april rod,the doe expressly relied on the fact that it had reviewed the peis and related supplement analyses and determined that the analyses remain valid for the decisions announced herein.id.at.observing that those analyses had explored the impact of the storage of plutonium at srs generally,and at in particular,the doe concluded that the environmental effects of the storage of the rocky flats plutonium at had been adequately considered.id.the doe therefore determined that it need not perform any further study of the environmental consequences of its decision.upon issuance of the april rod,the doe indicated that it would immediately begin shipment of the rocky flats plutonium to srs.
on may,governor hodges filed his complaint against the doe in the district of south carolina.the governor sought a declaratory judgment that the doe april rod contravened nepa,and he also sought an injunction prohibiting the doe from transferring surplus plutonium from rocky flats to srs.following a hearing conducted in aiken on june,the district court orally ruled against the governor.in so doing,the court granted the doe motion for summary judgment and declined to enjoin the doe transfer of the rocky flats plutonium to srs.four days later,the court filed its opinion,reducing its bench ruling to writing 
governor hodges then filed a timely appeal from the adverse rulings of the district court.he also moved for an injunction pending appeal,seeking to have us enjoin the doe from shipping the rocky flats plutonium to srs during his appeal.by order of june,we declined to award the governor such an injunction,and we expedited this proceeding.on appeal,governor hodges maintains that the doe failed to comply with nepa before issuing its april rod,and he requests that we enjoin the doe from shipping the rocky flats plutonium to srs until the doe has fulfilled its nepa obligations in response,the doe asserts that governor hodges lacks standing to initiate and pursue this case,and that it has complied with nepa 
because our jurisdiction has been called into question,we must,before turning to the merits of governor hodges appeal,first examine whether he possesses the necessary standing to pursue this action.while the doe did not raise the issue of standing in the district court,standing to sue is a jurisdictional issue of constitutional dimensions,and it may be raised and addressed for the first time on appeal steel citizens for a better env t,d.
pursuant to article iii of the constitution,federal courts may only adjudicate actual cases and controversies allen wright,d.the standing doctrine is designed to ensure that federal litigants possess a sufficiently personal stake in the outcome of any litigation they pursue.lujan defenders of wildlife,d see also valley forge christian college americans united for separation of church state,d observing that federal courts are not publicly funded forums for the ventilation of public grievances or the refinement of jurisprudential understanding.as spelled out by the supreme court,the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.defenders of wildlife,at.in order to possess standing to sue,a plaintiff must show that he has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical that his injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and that his injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d quotation and citation omitted defenders of wildlife,at.in this case,governor hodges is plainly capable of satisfying the last two elements of the standing test enunciated by the court.the doe asserts,however,that the governor falls short on the first element,because he has not suffered an injury in fact as a result of the doe proposed actions.
the doe contends that governor hodges sole interest in this action derives from his responsibility to protect the health and of the residents of south carolina,and that this lawsuit is therefore a parens patriae action.see alfred snapp son,puerto rico ex rel.barez,d observing that parens patriae suit is one in which state asserts injury to of its populace.the supreme court has clearly established that a parens patriae action can not be maintained against the federal government.id.at.massachusetts mellon.i t is no part of a state duty or power to enforce their rights in respect of their relations with the federal government.in that field it is the united states,and not the state,which represents them as parens patriae.as such,if governor hodges seeks only to protect the health and of the residents of south carolina,his action is of the parens patriae variety,and it may not be pursued.
governor hodges maintains,however,that the interests underlying his challenge to the doe are not simply in protecting the of south carolinians.rather,he contends that he has suffered an injury to his procedural rights,and that such an injury is sufficient to provide him with standing to sue.pursuant to the court decision in defenders of wildlife,a person entitled to a procedural right,the right to have the executive observe procedures mandated by law,can thereby possess article iii standing without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.at.a plaintiff only possesses such standing,however,if the procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of his that is the ultimate basis of his standing.id.at.in addition,such an interest must be one that falls within the zone of interests that the challenged statute is designed to protect.clarke sec.indus.ass n,d the essential inquiry is whether congress intended for a particular class of plaintiffs to be relied upon to challenge agency disregard of the law.
governor hodges contends that he possesses a threatened concrete interest deriving from his proprietary interest and control,as governor,over vast swaths of land and natural resources owned by south carolina,including the state highways,its streams,and its woodlands.in addition,the governor notes that,under the south carolina pollution control act,et,he bears official responsibility for preserving the state groundwater,and that under the safe drinking water act,he has a similar duty to preserve and protect public drinking water.governor hodges maintains that these interests are all threatened by the doe uninformed shipment of plutonium into south carolina and its proposed storage of such plutonium at srs.he therefore contends that he has shown a sufficient procedural injury to accord him standing,in his capacity as governor,to sue the doe.
thus,whether governor hodges possesses standing to sue the doe turns on whether his asserted proprietary interests in the land,streams,and drinking water of south carolina are sufficiently concrete to qualify as the bases for a recognized procedural right.as justice scalia observed in defenders of wildlife,an individual living next to the proposed site for a federally licensed dam would possess standing to challenge a failure to comply with nepa,while an individual living across the country from the dam would not possess any such standing.at.it is uncontroverted that at least one state highway runs through srs,and that several streams and wildlife habitats are located near srs.in these circumstances,the governor,in his official capacity,is essentially a neighboring landowner,whose property is at risk of environmental damage from the doe activities at srs.governor hodges therefore has a concrete interest that nepa was designed to protect as such,he is not merely pursuing a parens patriae action,and he possesses the requisite standing to enforce his procedural rights under nepa.
because governor hodges has standing to initiate and maintain his nepa challenges to the doe actions,we possess jurisdiction,pursuant to,to consider his appeal.we therefore turn to the merits thereof.
we review de novo an award of summary judgment by a district court.shaw stroud,cir.in reviewing an agency efforts to comply with nepa,we are required to perform a analysis.first,we examine whether the agency took a hard look at a proposed project environmental effects before acting.hughes river watershed conservancy glickman,cir.in essence,we assess whether the adverse environmental effects of the proposed action have been adequately identified and evaluated prior to final decisionmaking.robertson methow valley citizens council,d.if we are satisfied that the agency has taken the mandated hard look at the environmental effects of a proposed agency action,we must then consider whether the agency conclusions are arbitrary or capricious.hughes river,at.thus,in conducting our nepa inquiry,we must make a searching and careful inquiry into the facts and review whether the decision of the agency at the time it was made was based on consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.city of alexandria fed.highway,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.if the agency has followed the proper procedures,and if there is a rational basis for its decision,we will not disturb its judgment.
in his assertion that the doe failed to comply with nepa,governor hodges raises three separate contentions.two of these contentions are of a substantive nature,while the third involves a procedural point.first,he maintains that the sa failed to fully evaluate the risks of storage of surplus plutonium at.second,the governor contends that the sa only considered the potential effects of storing plutonium at for up to twenty years,rather than evaluating the storage period selected by the doe in its april rod.finally,as a procedural matter,the governor asserts that the doe failed to complete the required nepa documents before issuing the april rod.
before proceeding to address the specific contentions of governor hodges,it bears emphasizing that nepa is an statute.it requires federal agencies to identify and evaluate the environmental consequences of their proposed actions.robertson,at.hughes river,at.under nepa,an agency is obliged to take a hard look at a proposal environmental consequences before deciding to proceed however,once it has taken such a look,the agency is not obligated to choose any particular course of action.robertson,at.moreover,if the agency has taken the required hard look,we must defer to it unless its decisions were arbitrary or capricious.hughes river,at.therefore,in assessing the merits of governor hodges contentions,we must consider whether the doe adequately identified and evaluated,prior to its april rod,the environmental consequences of storing the rocky flats plutonium at.if we conclude that the doe acted properly in that connection,we must then determine whether the decisions it premised on that analysis were arbitrary or capricious 
in most instances,the doe will discharge its nepa responsibility to take a hard look at potential environmental consequences by completing,prior to undertaking a proposed action,either an eis,an seis,an ea,or an sa.however,in order to make an initial determination about whether a change or new information meets the threshold of significance or uncertainty needed to require further environmental documentation,the doe may also review and consider nepa documents.see piedmont envtl.council united states dep t of,d.in essence,the doe is entitled to conduct a preliminary inquiry into whether the environmental impact of a change in an existing proposal is even possibly significant.if the doe concludes,based on such a preliminary inquiry,that the environmental effect of the change is clearly insignificant,it has taken the hard look required by nepa,and no further nepa documentation is necessary.see idaho sporting congress alexander,cir concluding that agency may use environmental evaluation procedures to determine whether new information or changed circumstances require the preparation of a supplemental ea or eis price.neighborhood ass united states dep t of,cir.the doe authority to conduct such a review is limited it may only conduct such a preliminary inquiry to determine whether it is possible that the altered proposal environmental impact will be significant.idaho sporting congress,at.if the environmental impacts resulting from the design change are significant or uncertain,as compared with the original design impacts,then the doe must complete additional nepa documentation.price,at.
in his first contention on the merits,governor hodges maintains that the doe failed to adequately consider the risks of storage of the rocky flats plutonium at.contrary to his position,however,the sa evaluated whether the storage of surplus plutonium at would create any environmental consequences not considered by the doe in its earlier nepa compliance documents.in performing this evaluation,the sa explicitly incorporated the doe peis and its sa,as well as other nepa materials relating to the potential environmental effects of surplus plutonium being shipped into south carolina and stored at srs.see permitting incorporation of materials by reference to cut down on bulk without impeding agency and public review of the action.by its peis,the doe had examined various options for the storage of surplus plutonium,including its possible storage at the proposed apsf facility at srs for up to fifty years.and the sa had explored whether temporary storage of the surplus plutonium at,for a period of up to ten years,would create any environmental consequences not contemplated in the peis.in the sa,the doe examined whether storage of surplus plutonium at for a period longer than ten years would create any additional impacts on the environment or would increase the risk of a nuclear accident.sa at.after performing this evaluation,the doe concluded in the negative,stating that 
the potential impacts from the storage of surplus plutonium materials in the kams facility at srs,pending final disposition,are not significantly different than or are bounded by the impacts identified in the peis.
id.at emphasis added.
in view of the foregoing,governor hodges has failed to identify any particular risk arising from the storage of surplus plutonium at that was not addressed by the sa or the nepa materials incorporated by reference therein.as such,we must conclude that the doe,in the sa,fulfilled its nepa obligations by taking a hard look at the risks of plutonium storage at.
governor hodges next contends that the sa only contemplated storage of the rocky flats plutonium at for a period of twenty years,rather than for a period of fifty years.in support of this contention,he points to its statement that the doe plans to dispose of its surplus plutonium as soon as practical and believes storage in kams would be necessary for less than years.id.although this provision suggests that the doe hoped and perhaps continues to hope to dispose of the surplus plutonium within twenty years,this isolated statement,standing alone,does not resolve the question of whether the doe had analyzed the potential environmental consequences of plutonium storage at for a longer period.indeed,the sa specifically analyzed the environmental impact of plutonium storage at for up to fifty years.see id.at for the srs workforce,storage operations at kams will add latent cancer fatality lcf for up to years.moreover,and importantly,the sa incorporated the peis into its assessment and findings,and it explicitly compared the peis study of storage of surplus plutonium at apsf for up to fifty years with the doe new plan to store the plutonium at.we therefore find ourselves in agreement with the district court,which concluded after careful analysis that it is clear that the impacts of storage in general,and storage at kams,in particular,were examined.opinion at.
governor hodges final contention on appeal is that,even if the doe substantively examined the environmental effects of its proposed action,it failed to comply with nepa procedures in connection with its april rod.as the district court properly observed,the april rod decouples storage and disposition,taking away a precondition to storage of rocky flats plutonium at srs which had been found in all prior rods approval of srs for the immobilization facility.id.at.the governor asserts that this change in the doe storage at pending disposition to storage at without regard to the doe to prepare and file another nepa compliance document,such as an sa.he maintains that the doe was required to examine whether this change in its proposal created any significant environmental impacts not previously studied,and that it had therefore failed to take a hard look at the environmental consequences of its april rod.
in fact,however,the doe properly explored,prior to issuance of the april rod,whether the decoupling of plutonium storage from plutonium dis
