in july,the united states forest service issued a land and resource management plan for the superior national forest the forest plan.sierra club,friends of the boundary waters wilderness,and northeastern minnesotans for wilderness collectively,sierra club sought judicial review of the forest plan in the district court.as relevant to this appeal,sierra club argued that the forest service assessment of the forest plan environmental impacts violated the national environmental policy act nepa.in particular,sierra club claimed that the forest service had failed to consider the plan effects on the boundary waters canoe area wilderness bwcaw.the district determined that the forest service had considered adequately the impacts on the nearby wilderness area in accordance with nepa,and therefore granted the agency motion for summary judgment.sierra club kimbell,d.sierra club appeals,and we affirm.
the superior national forest was created by a proclamation of president theodore roosevelt in and expanded through a series of subsequent acquisitions.today,the forest encompasses over three million acres in northeastern minnesota along the united border near lake superior.within the superior national forest lies a million acre wilderness area known as the bwcaw.the bwcaw is one of the nation most popular wilderness areas,attracting nearly visitors annually to its many lakes and pristine forested landscapes.
federal efforts to protect the bwcaw date back to at least,when square miles within the superior national forest were set aside as a canoe recreation area.the wilderness act of expanded the protected area and officially designated the bwcaw as wilderness,thereby restricting authorized uses of the area to preserve its wilderness character.see b.in,the boundary waters canoe area wilderness act,stat,gave the area its current name,set aside additional acreage as wilderness,and further restricted authorized uses.id.the bwcaw act ended all logging within the wilderness and established stricter limitations on motorized recreational use.id.c,e,f,a.
the superior national forest,which includes the entire bwcaw,is part of the national forest system,and is subject to the national forest management act of nfma.as relevant to this appeal,nfma directs the secretary of agriculture to develop,maintain,and,as appropriate,revise forest plans for units of the national forest system.id.a.a forest plan is a general planning tool that establishes the overall management direction for the forest unit for ten to fifteen years,and serves as a programmatic statement of intent to guide future decisions.sierra club robertson,cir.in developing a forest plan,the forest service,which manages the forest system,must comply with the multiple act of.this act requires the forest service to account for both environmental and economic considerations in the plan,see g,including outdoor recreation,range,timber,watershed,wildlife and fish,and wilderness.id.e.
the forest service also must develop a forest plan in compliance with the procedural requirements of nepa.under nepa,if an agency proposes to undertake a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,c,the agency must prepare an environmental impact statement eis.the forest service has therefore promulgated regulations requiring the preparation of a draft and final eis in conjunction with a proposed forest plan.see b the forest service must consider in the eis a broad range of reasonable alternatives to help identify the alternative that best maximizes net public benefits.id.f.the agency also must evaluate the physical,biological,economic,and social effects of those alternatives in compliance with nepa procedures.id.g,h.
the development and implementation of a forest plan generally involves a process.robertson,at.initially,the forest service creates a proposed forest plan and accompanying draft and final eis to evaluate alternative management scenarios.see b.after receiving public input,the regional forester either approves or disapproves the proposed plan.id.b,c.if the forest plan is approved,the forest service issues a record of decision to document the rationale for the management approach adopted in the plan.id.c.the process then moves to a second stage in which the forest plan is implemented and individual projects are proposed and assessed.robertson,at.an approved forest plan,for example,might establish logging goals for the forest as a whole,but before the forest service can permit a specific logging project,the agency must,among other things,ensure that the project conforms with the forest plan,see e,and conduct environmental analysis pursuant to nepa.see,b see also ohio forestry ass sierra club,d.
this case focuses on a dispute involving the first stage of the forest planning process for the superior national forest.pursuant to nfma requirement that a forest plan be revised at least every fifteen years,see f a,the forest service announced in its intention to revise the plan for the superior national forest that had been in effect since.after a period of study and analysis,the forest service issued a draft eis in.the draft eis discussed and compared the anticipated environmental impacts of several proposed approaches to forest management.the forest service considered public comments to the draft eis,and,in july,issued a final eis feis,a record of decision rod,and the revised forest plan.
the feis identifies seven alternative approaches for managing the superior national forest.these approaches,labeled a through g,differ in the amount and location of human activity including logging and recreation that they allow,and in their goals for plant and animal life in the forest.alternative b,for example,would reduce timber harvesting from current levels,restore old growth forest,designate new wilderness study areas adjacent to the bwcaw,and decrease the number of new atv and snowmobile trails.feis.similarly,alternative d emphasizes recreational activities,such as hiking and canoeing,along with the restoration of old growth forest through a reduction in logging.feis.alternative c,by contrast,allows an increase in timber production relative to the plan.feis.alternative e falls between these options with respect to timber,emphasizing more harvesting than alternatives b and d,but less than alternative feis.alternative e also permits the greatest number of new snowmobile and atv trails,and designates no new wilderness study areas.feis.
a common feature of each alternative is a commitment to continue to manage the bwcaw in accordance with the boundary waters canoe area plan.the forest service adopted this plan in along with an eis specific to the wilderness area.the forest plan and accompanying feis,therefore,anticipate changes to the management approach only for those areas of the superior national forest outside of the boundary waters.another common point among the alternatives is their use of geographic analysis areas that extend in and out of the boundary waters.for example,the feis frequently employs the northern superior uplands as the area in which environmental impacts are measured.feis.this vast area,which includes the bwcaw,is preferred because m any ecosystem processes essential for sustainability operate at large spatial scales.feis.each of the alternatives also identifies a combination of management areas that emphasize different land use objectives,such as timber production or scenic recreation.the management areas vary in size and location by alternative.feis.
in the record of decision issued with the feis,the forest service identified alternative e as its choice to guide the management of the superior national forest.according to the agency,alternative e maximizes the net benefit to the public by maintaining the health of the forest while providing the best mix of sustainable economic,social,and ecological benefits.the revised forest plan discusses in detail how the forest will be managed under alternative e,and establishes a series of objectives,standards,and guidelines to govern future activities and to achieve desired forest conditions.under alternative e,the forest plan divides the area of the national forest outside of the bwcaw into three spatial management zones.feis.these zones permit varying levels of resource use.together with the management areas,they establish land use patterns.
sierra club present complaint is related to the spatial management zones.in the revised forest plan,the geographic area designated as spatial zone borders the bwcaw.the management areas in zone are eligible for the vast majority of timber harvesting permitted under the plan,feis,and they allow motorized recreational activities.the forest service contends that the purpose of the spatial zones is simply to ensure habitats within the forest.sierra club disagrees,and argues that the intense timber harvesting and other activities permitted near the bwcaw under alternative e will have adverse edge effects on the wilderness area that the forest service failed to consider in the feis.those alleged effects include habitat degradation along the wilderness edge,noise pollution,impairment of water quality,and increased illegal access to the bwcaw by vehicles.sierra club contends that the forest service violated nepa by approving the revised forest plan without analyzing the plan impact on the bwcaw,including these edge effects,and that the district court erred in granting the forest service motion for summary judgment.
before reaching the merits of sierra club nepa claim,we must consider whether sierra club has standing to challenge the forest plan and feis.the government raised no objection to standing in the district court,but it presses the issue on appeal,and we must consider a challenge to our jurisdiction at any time in the proceeding.see.h goos icc,cir.
article iii establishes as a constitutional minimum for standing the following three elements an injury in fact,meaning the actual or imminent invasion of a concrete and particularized legal interest a causal connection between the alleged injury and the challenged action of defendant and a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision of the court.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the forest service contends that because sierra club alleges only the potential for future harm at later stages of the forest planning process,it fails to satisfy the requirement in this initial phase.
the forest service relies heavily on our decision in sierra club robertson,cir.robertson held that the plaintiffs in that case lacked standing to challenge a forest plan for the ouachita national forest,because further agency action was necessary before the forest service could take steps that would cause injury.id.at.the plaintiffs in robertson limited their allegation of injury to a claim that the amount and method of timber harvesting permitted by the forest plan caused environmental or aesthetic harm.because nepa required an additional stage of analysis before any timber could actually be cleared,this court determined that the asserted injury was not sufficiently imminent at the initial forest planning stage to create an injury in fact.id.at.this view has been criticized by the seventh circuit,see sierra club marita,cir,but endorsed by the eleventh circuit in the closely related context of ripeness.see wilderness soc y alcock,cir.
sierra club argues in reply that robertson is not controlling here,because that case involved only a nfma claim,not a nepa claim.this is incorrect.the opinion of this court in robertson expressly states that the plaintiffs alleged violations of both nfma and nepa.at emphasis added.the district court published opinion in robertson also makes clear that the plaintiffs complaint raised claims under nfma and nepa,and the district court specifically analyzed a series of nepa claims.see sierra club robertson.
sierra club also cites sierra club army corps of engineers,cir,to support its standing to bring this nepa challenge.the court in army corps concluded that the plaintiffs had standing under nepa to dispute an agency environmental assessment of a levee construction project,even though further agency action was required before injury would occur.id.at.army corps,however,made no mention of robertson,and of course could not overrule a prior panel decision.army corps is consistent with the established rule that a defendant action need not be the very last step in the chain of causation to cause cognizable injury,bennett spear,d,but robertson is more directly on point with respect to whether a forest plan causes an injury in fact.
to the extent the plaintiffs here rely on the forest plan authorization of additional timber harvesting and the feis alleged failure to analyze the specific impacts of that harvesting,robertson poses a formidable hurdle.we conclude,however,that the plaintiffs have standing based on other aspects of the agency action.the plaintiffs here,unlike those in robertson,claim injuries that occur with the adoption of the forest plan,not merely harms that arise at some future time after further analysis and action by the agency.specifically,sierra club argues that the plan itself,with its endorsement of alternative e,represents a final agency decision to reject features in other alternatives,such as the designation of new wilderness study areas adjacent to the bwcaw,and a decrease in motorized recreational activity near the wilderness.had the forest service properly evaluated the impacts of its decision on the wilderness area,sierra club contends,the agency perhaps would have chosen to manage the forest pursuant to a different alternative that would not interfere with the plaintiffs enjoyment of the forest near the bwcaw.
standing can be based on harms to recreational or even aesthetic interests,see sierra club morton,d,and organizations like sierra club can assert the standing of their members.summers earth island,d see also hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d.here,the plaintiff organizations submitted affidavits from several individual members asserting imminent harms from the agency action.one member and frequent visitor to the superior national forest claimed that the agency selection of alternative e,which resulted in the designation of no new wilderness study areas,immediately diminished her opportunities for recreation near the bwcaw.another member described a similarly imminent interest in increasing opportunities for recreation in areas adjacent to the wilderness area that was harmed by the selection of alternative 
while alternatives rejected by the forest service would create wilderness study areas or additional recreational opportunities near the bwcaw,alternative e is a final agency decision to eliminate those options.alternatives b and d,for example,both call for twelve areas that border the bwcaw,comprising thousands of acres,to be designated as wilderness study areas,in which road development and motorized recreation would not be allowed.feis.the feis states that these areas could provide a more immediate wilderness experience,including opportunities for recreation in a pristine setting.feis.alternative e allows motorized activities in many of these areas.feis.alternative d would surround the bwcaw with management areas,thereby permitting few visitors,minimal roads,and,in many cases,no motorized vehicles,in order to preserve the natural conditions of the forest.feis.alternative d also would result in the closure of s ome existing motorized trails near the bwcaw,feis,and prohibit all snowmobile travel in the forest.feis.this feature would have the immediate effect of allowing recreationists to travel without encountering disruptions like noise pollution and wildlife habitat destruction.feis.alternative e,by contrast,allows for up to miles of additional snowmobile trails,and surrounds the bwcaw with roaded natural areas,in which motorized vehicle use and high visitor interaction are authorized.feis.
given the immediate,concrete consequences for the recreational interests of specific visitors to the superior national forest that result from the selection of alternative e over other alternatives rejected in the feis,we conclude that the plaintiffs have shown the injury in fact necessary for standing.unlike the plaintiffs in robertson,sierra club allege
