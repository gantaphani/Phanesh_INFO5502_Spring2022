the united states is a party to international conventions with canada and mexico for the protection of migratory birds.congress has implemented those conventions through the migratory bird treaty act,a statute first passed in.the statute makes it unlawful to hunt or kill migratory birds included in the terms of the conventions.a.in,this court concluded that the migratory birds protected under the act included the mute swan.see hill norton.
after the hill decision,congress enacted the migratory bird treaty reform act.the reform act amends the migratory bird treaty act so that the statute applies only to migratory bird species that are native to the united states or its territories.b.as the parties here agree,the mute swan is not native to the united states or its territories.as a result,the amended statute by its terms no longer prohibits the hunting or killing of the mute swan.
the plaintiffs in this case have advanced a variety of arguments why the amended migratory bird treaty act nonetheless continues to protect mute swans.we reject plaintiffs contentions.the text of the statute is plain the amended migratory bird treaty act does not ban the hunting or killing of migratory bird species,including mute swans.

in,congress passed and president wilson signed the migratory bird treaty act.the act prohibition has remained largely the same since enactment.unless authorized by regulations administered by the secretary of the interior,

starting in the,the secretary of the interior regularly published a list of species protected under the act.the list did not include the mute swan.a citizen eventually challenged the secretary decision not to protect the mute swan.in hill,we concluded that the secretary interpretation of the migratory bird treaty act was not reasonable when measured against the statutory text the statute covers birds included in the terms of the conventions themselves,and we stated that the canada convention undisputably include s mute swans.hill,at.although the secretary argued that the mute swan was not protected because it was not native to the united states,we stated that the secretary pointed to nothing in the statute,applicable treaties,or administrative record to support an exclusion for species.id.at.the text of the migratory bird treaty act and the canada convention references to swans weighed against such an exclusion and meant that the secretary interpretation was not reasonable.id.at.the opinion focused solely on the canada convention because it imposed the strictest limitation on the hunting or killing of migratory birds.id.at.
in,after the hill decision,congress passed and president bush signed the migratory bird treaty reform act.see consolidated appropriations act,div.e,title i,stat,codified at.the reform act amended the migratory bird treaty act prohibition on killing or hunting migratory birds so that the statute applies only to migratory bird species that are native to the united states or its territories.b.the reform act further defined the term native to the united states or its territories to mean occurring in the united states or its territories as the result of natural biological or ecological processes.id.b a.and subject to certain exceptions not relevant here,the reform act provided that a migratory bird species that occurs in the united states or its territories solely as a result of intentional or unintentional introduction shall not be considered native to the united states or its territories id.b b.congress directed the secretary of the interior to issue within days of the reform act enactment and after public comment a list of all nonnative,bird species to which the migratory bird treaty act does not apply.consolidated appropriations act,div.e,title i,c citation omitted.
the reform act also expressed congress apparent disagreement with this court hill decision as to the meaning of the migratory bird conventions it is the sense of congress that the language of this section is consistent with the intent and language of the bilateral treaties implemented by this section.id.d.in other words,congress indicated its belief that the canada convention and the other three migratory bird conventions did not cover species such as the mute swan.
consistent with the reform act,the fish and wildlife service,which is part of the department of the interior,promptly published and sought comment on a draft list of species that would not be protected under the statute.see draft list of bird species to which the migratory bird treaty act does not apply.the list excluded the mute swan from protection.id.at.the service pointed to the scientific and historical evidence that the species is not native to this continent.all existing populations of the mute swan in north america,the service noted,are derived from introduced stocks that were released or escaped at different localities and in different years and eventually established feral populations.id.at.
the humane society of the united states,an animal welfare organization,submitted comments opposing the service designation.the service treated those comments as a petition for rulemaking under the administrative procedure act to change the mute swan designation,which the service denied.see final list of bird species to which the migratory bird treaty act does not apply.the service published its final rule in march,and the list excluded mute swans.id.at.
the maryland department of natural resources then informed the humane society of its intention to begin killing adult mute swans in the chesapeake bay in the spring of.maryland had previously concluded that such killing was necessary because the mute swan population,which had surged dramatically between and,now posed a danger to the bay ecosystem.wildlife heritage.dep t of natural,mute swans in maryland a statewide management plan.maryland determined that the mute swan population consumed and disrupted large quantities of underwater plants that protect water quality,prevent erosion,and provide food and shelter for fish,shellfish,invertebrates,and other birds indigenous to the bay.id.at see also hill,at noting information to suggest that mute swans cause ecological damage.
the fund for animals,is an affiliate of the humane society.in april,the fund and three individuals sued the secretary under the administrative procedure act,a.plaintiffs conceded that the mute swan was not native to the united states or its territories.the complaint nonetheless challenged the service decision not to list the mute swan as protected,asserting that the statute continues to require protection of the mute swan.complaint at,fund for animals norton,d.the complaint sought a court order that would,among other things,direct the service to notify the state of maryland that mute swans may not be killed without a permit from the service.id.at.plaintiffs also moved for a preliminary injunction.three parties that aim to promote hunting as a means of wildlife conservation moved to intervene as defendants the safari club international,the safari club international foundation,and ducks unlimited.those emphasized that the mute swans compete with and behave aggressively toward birds indigenous to the chesapeake other words,that the mute swans are harmful to the environment.see fund for animals norton,d.
after a hearing,the district court denied the preliminary injunction.the district court concluded that the defendants overwhelming likelihood of success on the merits outweighs any other equitable factors favoring plaintiffs.id.at.the district court stated that nothing in the reform act itself appears ambiguous,and the reform act terms showed that congress intended to modify the migratory bird treaty act to exclude nonnative species.id.at.even if the reform act conflicted with the migratory bird conventions with canada and other nations,the district court concluded the reform act controlled because congress clearly has the power to abrogate or modify a treaty or earlier legislation,and when it does so,that is the final word.id.at.
at the parties request,the district court converted this ruling into a final judgment on the merits.see.a.this appeal followed.we review de novo the legal question whether the secretary decision to exclude mute swans from protection was consistent with the migratory bird treaty act.
standing to sue is a threshold question.see daimlerchrysler cuno,d.in hill,we held that the plaintiff,a maryland property owner who enjoyed the presence of mute swans on her property,satisfied the constitutional prerequisite for invoking federal,injury in fact fairly traceable to the conduct of the defendants and redressable by judicial relief.the same is true here.two of the individual plaintiffs are maryland residents with mute swans on their property.under hill,those plaintiffs suffer injury in fact because of the service designation of the mute swan as a species not protected by the migratory bird treaty act.that action freed maryland to kill a portion of the chesapeake bay mute swan population,which would include the swans on those residents property.judicial invalidation of the designation would restore protection to the mute swan and make maryland plan unlawful.the maryland plaintiffs have standing.we therefore need not evaluate the standing of the third individual plaintiff,a massachusetts resident who makes weekly visits to a pond inhabited by mute swans,or of the fund itself.
the migratory bird treaty act provides that,with certain exceptions,it shall be unlawful to hunt or kill any migratory bird included in the terms of the conventions.a.enacted in,the migratory bird treaty reform act amended this statutory prohibition on hunting or killing migratory birds to make clear that the statute applies only to migratory bird species that are native to the united states or its territories.b.as the secretary determined and the parties here agree,the mute swan is not a native migratory bird species.it follows,therefore,that the migratory bird treaty act does not protect the mute swan.
plaintiffs argue that this approach is too straightforward,contending in essence that this provision of the reform act does not mean what it says.their argument relies on the separate sense of congress provision in the reform act,which states it is the sense of congress that the language of this section is consistent with the intent and language of the bilateral treaties implemented by this section.consolidated appropriations act,div.e,title i,d.
plaintiffs creative attempt to weave ambiguity out of clarity goes as follows plaintiffs state that this court was correct to conclude in hill norton that the migratory bird conventions cover the mute swan.although the reform act on its face excludes the mute swan,plaintiffs point out that congress also indicated its sense that the amended statute is consistent with the conventions.given the apparent conflict between the conventions and the amended statute,together with congress stated belief that there is no such conflict,plaintiffs contend that the statute must be deemed ambiguous.and plaintiffs argue that we must therefore apply the canon of construction that ambiguous statutes should not be interpreted to abrogate a treaty namely,the conventions protection of the mute swan.
plaintiffs argument is mistaken at each turn.the statute is not ambiguous,and for that reason the canon against abrogation does not apply.
plaintiffs base their argument that the statute is ambiguous on the sense of congress provision in the reform act.indeed,plaintiffs recognize that the statute is clear but for the sense of congress provision.see tr.of oral arg.plaintiffs interpretation of the sense of congress provision is incorrect.by setting forth its sense that the reform act is consistent with the migratory bird conventions,congress merely suggested that it believes the conventions,as originally adopted,covered only native species of migratory birds.read most naturally,the sense of congress provision indicates nothing more than congress disagreement with this court decision in hill which had concluded that the canada convention undisputably include s mute swans,at.the sense of congress provision makes clear that the reform act was not an attempt to limit or back away from america treaty obligations,but rather was a correction of what congress believed to be an erroneous judicial interpretation of a treaty.in any event,congress may or may not be correct in its interpretation of the conventions original scope,but that is of no moment in this case.the sense of congress provision does not in any way alter the plain text of the reform act other provisions,which clearly and unambiguously provide that the migratory bird treaty act does not protect species such as the mute swan.
plaintiffs interpretation of the sense of congress provision would render the reform act meaningless,as plaintiffs candidly acknowledge.see tr.of oral arg.even accepting that congress on occasion may enact a statute that turns out to have no effect,courts presume that congress has used its scarce legislative time to enact statutes that have some legal consequence.see plaut spendthrift farm,d interpretation that would leave a statute utterly without effect is a result to be avoided if possible see also norman singer,statutes and statutory construction ed.a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions,so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant,and so that one section will not destroy another unless the provision is the result of obvious mistake or error.footnotes omitted.that plaintiffs interpret the reform act to be an empty gesture is yet another indication that their submission is erroneous.
the government also points out that plaintiffs position is inconsistent with the reform act legislative history,which contains evidence that members of congress specifically intended to exclude the mute swan and other birds from the migratory bird treaty act coverage.see,at,at.on that point,however,plaintiffs persuasively respond that those legislative materials are of little value because the version of the legislation under consideration when the senate and house reports were written did not yet include the sense of congress provision.in fact,the government concedes that n o legislative history explains the addition of that provision to the reform act.appellees br.at.we agree with plaintiffs that the legislative history cited by the government is not helpful in construing this statute.the government legislative history argument in this relies on pieces of legislative history unconnected to the key language in the a good example of misusing snippets of legislative history from a dynamic and evolving legislative dra
