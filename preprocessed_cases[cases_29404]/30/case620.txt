the friends of airport friends and the city of grandview,missouri grandview,filed a petition for judicial review of an order of the federal aviation administration faa releasing airport property,challenging the order on environmental grounds.consolidated with their petition is the separate petition of the aircraft owners and pilots association,challenging the faa statutory authority to make the release.after carefully considering the administrative record,we deny both petitions for review and affirm the order of the faa.
the airport was built in on land owned by the city of kansas city,missouri city.in,the city deeded the property free of charge to the united states air force for use as a permanent military base.the air force deactivated the base in,declaring approximately acres as surplus property.since then,it has been a public use general aviation airport primarily serving small privately owned aircraft.in august,the united states conveyed the property back to kansas city,pursuant to the surplus property act,see.this conveyance required the city to use the property as a public use airport.between and,the city had accepted approximately million in federal airport improvement program funds for airport development,and each grant required the city to give written assurances that the airport would be available to the public for aeronautical use.
for several years,the airport had consistently lost money.between and,losses exceeded million and were subsidized by the city two commercial airports.the airport losses were projected to continue at more than million annually.in,in an effort to pursue an opportunity to redevelop the land into a new intermodal freight distribution center kansas city submitted an application to the faa requesting permission to close the airport and seeking to be released from its federal obligations and assurances to maintain the property for public aeronautical use under the surplus property act and the airport improvement program.
the faa and kansas city negotiated a memorandum agreement dated july,in which the faa concluded that the terms it attached to the release and closure of the airport would result in a net benefit to aviation.the faa found that although the facility was maintaining operation as a general aviation airport,it was able to do so only at substantial losses which were heavily subsidized by kansas city other commercial airports,draining funds otherwise available to those facilities.the faa found that this financial burden was not necessary in a metropolitan area served by several other airports that remain available to general aviation.the memorandum agreement required kansas city to deposit million into an escrow account to be dispersed by the faa for federally eligible aviation improvement projects in the kansas city area the city also agreed that for years,it would deposit all net proceeds from the projected lease of the property into its aviation account for use solely for specified and general aviation projects.it agreed to notify the faa of each disbursement from the net proceeds account and to permit the faa to audit the account.
on february,the kansas city city council by ordinance approved a lease for development of the facility by the kansas city southern railway company kcsr.the voters of kansas city approved the ordinance in a referendum vote on august.on october,kansas city submitted an environmental documentation report,supported by exhibits,demonstrating that the development does not present any extraordinary circumstances that would require further environmental assessment.
in a letter dated december,the faa released kansas city from its federal obligations to maintain the property as an airport,allowing the city to close the airport and maintain the property as nonaeronautical,property of the kansas city aviation department consistent with the memorandum of agreement.the faa prepared no formal environmental analysis of this proposed action but considered several pertinent environmental factors before concluding that the closure was categorically excluded from the requirement of preparing an environmental assessment.the faa issued its categorical exclusion evaluation on the same date as the letter releasing the airport property.
the record indicates that the public had an opportunity to participate in and comment on the proposed redevelopment throughout the more than two years in which the application was pending before the faa.public meetings were held in a variety of locations in addition to open public meetings before the kansas city city council.four of the public meetings were held in the neighboring city of grandview,and there was substantial media coverage of the proposed redevelopment.a small number of citizens wrote letters opposing the project on a variety of grounds,and a group of pilots formed the opposition group known as the friends of airport.on the very afternoon that the faa issued its release,the faa received a faxed letter from the mayor of grandview expressing opposition to the release on environmental grounds,but this was the only opposition from any governmental agency throughout the application process.
pursuant to,the friends and grandview filed in this court a petition for judicial review of the faa action,challenging the faa decision to categorically exclude the closure of this airport from the requirement of preparing an environmental assessment.the aircraft owners and pilots association also petitioned for judicial review,asserting that the faa failed to satisfy the standards of the surplus property act and lacked authority to release kansas city from its federal obligations.we consolidated these petitions for purposes of briefing and argument,and permitted kansas city and the kansas city southern railway company to intervene in support of the faa decision.
a court of appeals reviewing a petition for judicial review of an order of the faa has exclusive jurisdiction to affirm,amend,modify,or set aside any part of the order.c.in reviewing an order under this section,the court may consider only those objections made in the agency proceeding,unless there was a reasonable basis for not making the objection earlier.see id.d.the statute mandates that the agency findings of fact are conclusive as long as they are supported by substantial evidence.see id.c.because does not specifically enunciate a standard for reviewing the faa nonfactual determinations,we turn to the administrative procedure act apa for the appropriate standard.see.the apa prescribes that an agency action is unlawful and may be set aside if it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.a.in sum,while our factual inquiry on the record must be searching and careful,our scope of review is quite narrow we are not empowered to substitute our own judgment for that of the agency.citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d.we determine merely whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.downer by and through dep t of agric.and soil conservation,cir quoting marsh oregon natural res.council,d.
the petitioners essentially challenge two agency decisions.first,they challenge the faa decision to categorically exclude the proposal to close the airport from the requirement of preparing an environmental assessment under the national environmental policy act nepa.second,they challenge the faa decision to grant kansas city a release from its federal obligations to maintain the property as an airport.
categorical exclusion 
we begin with the environmental challenge.the friends and grandview contend that the faa abused its discretion by not taking a hard look at the environmental impact of its decision as required by nepa.see.nepa requires federal agencies taking major federal actions that significantly affect the quality of the human environment to prepare a detailed environmental impact statement considering the effects of and alternatives to the proposed action.see id.c.the environmental impact statement requirement ensures that agencies take a hard look at the environmental consequences of a project before taking a major action.friends of the boundary waters wilderness dombeck,cir internal quotations omitted.
nepa council on environmental quality ceq has promulgated regulations to provide federal agencies with guidance for complying with nepa requirements.see.the regulations encourage agencies to document an environmental assessment,briefly providing the agency with sufficient evidence to determine whether the proposed agency action has no significant impact on the environment or whether the action has a significant impact that requires the preparation of a detailed environmental impact statement under nepa.see.the regulations also provide that agencies may categorically exclude certain types of federal activities from this environmental assessment review.see id.p requiring agencies to reduce paperwork in part by using categorical exclusions to define categories of actions that do not have a significant impact on the environment and are therefore exempt from nepa requirement to prepare an environmental impact statement b ii requiring agencies to develop specific criteria for identifying categorical exclusions.
the ceq regulations define categorical exclusions as a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a federal agency in implementation of these regulations.id.for actions falling within a categorical exclusion,neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.see id.the regulations require that an agency must also consider exceptions to the categorical exclusions by listing extraordinary circumstances in which a normally excluded action may have a significant environmental effect,thus requiring the preparation of an environmental assessment.id.
consistent with these ceq regulations,the faa promulgated a list of categorical exclusions and characteristics amounting to extraordinary circumstances,which are set forth in the airport environmental handbook,faa order see petitioners app.at.the federal release of airport land is listed in the handbook as an action that is categorically excluded from the requirement of preparing a formal environmental assessment.see id.at faa order a.relevant factors listed as extraordinary circumstances include any action that is likely to have an effect on property protected under the historic preservation act,be highly controversial on environmental grounds,be highly controversial with respect to the availability of relocation housing,cause a significant increase in surface congestion,or have a significant impact on noise levels or air quality.petitioners app.at faa order a.faa order a is an interpretive agency order.because it does not contain agency rulings reached as a result of adjudicatory adversary proceedings or formal rule making,it is not entitled to deference,but the order is nevertheless accorded respect by the courts to the extent it has the power to persuade.see christensen harris county,d skidmore swift.see also drake honeywell,cir stating that interpretive rules provide guidance to parties and carry no more weight on judicial review than their inherent persuasiveness commands internal quotations omitted.the faa airport environmental handbook,while not controlling upon the courts by reason of its authority,do es constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.skidmore,at.
the petitioners do not argue that the federal release of airport land is an action that can not be categorically excluded from the environmental assessment requirement,and we have no reason to doubt the agency informed decision in this matter.instead,they contend that the faa failed to adequately consider all of the relevant extraordinary circumstances that would prevent the use of the categorical exclusion in this particular case.
the faa documented its categorical exclusion evaluation in this case in which it considered and discussed the relevant extraordinary circumstances listed in faa order specifically,the faa considered the effect of the proposed action on property subject to the national historic preservation act,the potential noise,air quality,and water quality consequences of the action,its effect on farmlands,whether the action was highly controversial on environmental grounds,its effect on the natural environment,the availability of relocation housing,the potential community disruption,the cumulative impact of the action including the project effect on air quality and surface traffic congestion,and other relevant aspects likely to be at issue with this project.the faa concluded that based upon its evaluation of the likely impacts of the proposed action,no extraordinary circumstances existed to preclude a categorical exclusion of this action from the environmental assessment requirement.see petitioners app.at.
we review an agency determination that an action falls within a categorical exclusion under the arbitrary and capricious standard.see alaska ctr.for the env t united states forest,cir.the friends and grandview contend that the faa acted arbitrarily and capriciously in determining the categorical exclusion applied,asserting that several extraordinary circumstances required the faa to take a closer look by completing an environmental assessment.we consider each challenged extraordinary circumstance in turn 
highly controversial on environmental grounds 
the petitioners assert that the release of airport property was highly controversial on environmental grounds.the faa order states that a proposed action is highly controversial on environmental grounds thus requiring the preparation of an environmental assessment when the action is opposed on environmental grounds by a government agency or a substantial number of the persons affected by the action.see petitioners app.at faa order a,b.the faa found no significant environmental opposition.
the petitioners assert that the faa completely ignored the faxed letter from the mayor of grandview challenging the action on environmental grounds.the faa received no governmental environmental opposition until it received the mayor letter on the very day it issued its decision and its supporting extraordinary circumstances evaluation.regardless of any dispute over the timing of when faa officials actually received the letter during that day,we consider this one letter of governmental opposition to be too little,and far too late in a public proceeding that had been ongoing for approximately two years.thus,the faa did not act arbitrarily or capriciously by concluding that there was no governmental opposition to the action.
concerning citizen opposition,the faa noted that it received citizen letters opposing the project,of which only approximately expressed environmental concerns.even considering all of the opposing letters,however,the faa concluded that this number was insufficient to constitute substantial opposition on environmental grounds where the population of the area most affected the communities of belton and grandview exceeds.the agency determination that letters opposing the project most of which did not voice environmental concerns did not constitute a substantial controversy on environmental grounds is not arbitrary on this record.
the petitioners argue the faa ignored evidence that,although the residents of kansas city as a whole voted by referendum to pass an ordinance authorizing the city to proceed with the project,the majority of voters in wards closest to the airport voted no,and the citizens of belton and grandview,the areas most affected,had no vote.the petitioners assert that these circumstances reflect a concern that the project was highly controversial on environmental grounds.we disagree.although the citizens of belton and grandview have no vote on ordinances affecting property within the city of kansas city,four of the public meetings were held in grandview in an effort to give its citizens an opportunity to voice their concerns about the project,yet no substantial environmental opposition arose.also,those kansas city residents who voted no for the project did not provide any reasons explaining their vote and evidently did not write letters to the faa informing it of any environmental concerns.thus,the faa did not act arbitrarily by ignoring the evidence of no votes in wards closest to the affected area and the citizens of belton and grandview certainly were not isolated from the proceedings.
community disruption and surface traffic 
the petitioners contend that the faa ignored or improperly discounted evidence indicating that a substantial community disruption was likely and that the action would cause a significant increase in surface traffic congestion.this contention lacks merit.the faa categorical exclusion evaluation did consider the potential for community disruption and added surface traffic,concluding in relevant part that the project will not adversely affect local traffic movement and that planned highway improvements will more than adequately handle the traffic generated by the intermodal facility.
the faa found that the missouri department of transportation mdot has considered the proposed intermodal facility in its design for improving route,route,and the interchanges of,and route.mdot reported by letter that the planned roadway and interchange improvements will accommodate the additional truck traffic from the facility,even at its full build out.petitioners app.at.the environmental documentation report submitted by kansas city,and considered by the faa,notes that using railcars to carry more than one truck container actually results in fewer trucks on the roadways.see id.at.this report notes that b ased on traffic studies to date,the intermodal facility will contribute less than increase in traffic to the area.id.at.the report concluded that even in the worst case scenario,the adverse traffic effects of increased truck and rail traffic would be offset by new highway construction and improved intersections.an agency may rely on mitigating measures to be undertaken by a third party in making its finding of no significant impact.audubon soc y of cent.dailey,cir.
additionally,the faa found that no additional train traffic would occur for five years,after which the train traffic could be expected to increase over the next twenty years.the kansas city southern railway company indicated that even assuming a growth rate per year,no additional trains would be required in the first five years of operation because the present trains are currently running under capacity.see petitioners app.at.based upon these studies and the opinions of expert consultants,the faa found that the anticipated increase in train and truck traffic will not significantly affect the movement of local traffic or alter any planned development.the record supports this finding.
the petitioners argue that the faa acted arbitrarily by relying on documents that underestimate the capacity of the facility,which is measured in lifts per year.the petitioners argue that the faa estimated only lifts per year,yet plans to develop the facility show that up to about lifts per year will be performed,which represents only about of the facility capacity.the petitioners assert that growth is reasonably foreseeable and should be assumed.
we are not in a position to question the veracity of the growth estimate.the environmental documentation report and its supporting exhibits indicate an initial estimation of lifts per year,but the report also assumes a growth pattern,stating that kansas city southern is hoping to grow the facility to about lifts a year.petitioners app.at.in the next sentence,the report states that t he goal factor is about a year.all of this information was contained in the environmental documentation report,which was properly before the agency.the faa findings are supported by this documentation,and the faa has articulated a rational connection between the facts and the conclusions it made.the faa was entitled to rely on expert documentation provided in the record,and we can not say that the agency findings on this point lack substantial evidence to support them.
the petitioners argue that the faa reliance on the environmental documentation report,which concludes that there is no significant impact from the proposal,is arbitrary and capricious because it was provided by kansas city,a proponent of the project.they also question the source of information underlying the mdot projections of intermodal traffic.the faa urges that it independently reviewed the environmental consultants analysis and concurred with the conclusions reached.the faa also asserts that it is allowed to rely on the opinion of a state government agency.we agree with the faa.our duty is merely to ensure that the agency considered the proper factors and made no clear error of judgment.see marsh,at.once the agency considers the proper factors and makes a factual determination on whether the impacts are significant or not,that decision implicates substantial agency expertise and is entitled to deference.alaska ctr.for the env t,at.when specialists express conflicting views,an agency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable opinions of its own qualified experts even if,as an original matter,a court might find contrary views more persuasive.marsh,at.we conclude that the faa was entitled to rely on expert consultants,including the opinions of other governmental agencies,especially where the evidence deals with scientific judgments.see united states grand,cir.
noise pollution 
the faa found that most of the dnl db noise contour resulting from the intermodal facility train and truck traffic will remain well within the facility boundaries.petitioners app.at.the symbol dnl or ldn represents the d average sound level,which is a decibel measurement of the average sound level for a period.the faa has determined that all land uses are considered to be compatible with noise levels that are less than dnl db.id.d.airports are required to develop noise exposure maps showing contour lines of dnl,and db.in areas where the noise level is dnl db or greater,land uses must be identified and their compatibility determined.
to this end,the faa has developed a table indicating appropriate noise levels that can be tolerated for different land uses.the noise sensitive area nearest to the proposed facility is the belton community golf course,which is feet away from the noise source.the land use table indicates that a golf course can tolerate noise levels of dnl db.see pt,app.a,table use compatibility.the study indicates that the nearest point of the golf course is within the db contour lines of the facility.the nearest residence is located over feet away,which is well away from the dnl db contour line even under the full scenario.accordingly,the faa concluded that the project will not significantly increase noise in any noise sensitive areas,and therefore no further analysis was necessary.
the petitioners contend that the use of an unreasonably low number of expected lifts adversely affected the noise study.we disagree.the record indicates that the noise study includes full calculations for a full scenario,as well as calculations based on the lift estimation.the environmental documentation report specifically took into account the full scenario,providing full calculations for a full of the facility.the study indicated that resulting noise levels were well below acceptable levels.the full calculations indicate a dnl db in the scenario.additionally,the study indicates that the intermodal facility only generates noise in a localized and limited area to feet adjacent to the facility,while the airport generates noise patterns extending over feet away.petitioners app.at.there is no indication that the faa ignored evidence relevant to the noise impact of the facility.
the petitioners also assert that the faa ignored the possibility of continued airport use of the facility.to the contrary,the faa addressed the potential noise impact from continued use of the facility as an airport as a cumulative impact but concluded that while there is a possibility of future airport development at this site,there is no proposal reasonably foreseeable at this time.furthermore,any future airport plans would be subject to appropriate environmental review when proposed.thus,this possibility is an insufficient basis on which to find that the faa action at this time was arbitrary.
the petitioners remaining contentions are based in large part on the opinion of their own expert,which was not made a part of the administrative record.through a motion to this court,petitioners sought to supplement the record with letters and expert opinions that were not before the agency,in order to show that the agency overlooked substantial environmental issues and relevant factors.we are not in a position to substitute our own judgment for that of the agency by considering expert testimony that was not made a part of the administrative record.w hen a litigant challenges an agency determination on grounds that,in essence,allege that the agency expert review was incomplete,inconclusive,or inaccurate,the greater degree of deference expressed by the arbitrary and capricious standard is appropriate.greenpeace action franklin,cir alterations,quotations,and citations omitted.once we determine that an agency discretion is truly informed,we must defer to that informed discretion.see marsh,at.greenpeace,at see also newton county wildlife ass rogers,cir noting that our inquiry ends when we are satisfied that the agency considered all of the information available at the time of its decision.
our review of the record indicates that the faa considered all relevant factors and available evidence relating to the noise impact of the facility.the faa conclusions are based on substantial scientific data,and not on mere speculation.nepa does not require courts to resolve disagreements among experts.see greenpeace,at.t he record in this case reveals no complete failure to consider crucial factors.id.accordingly,we deny the petitioners motion to supplement the record.
in a argument,the petitioners contend that the noise impact of the facility on the nearby belton community golf course will interfere with enjoyment of the golf course so as to amount to a use of the property.section f of the department of transportation act provides in relevant part that the use of publicly owned land or a public park may be approved only if there is no feasible alternative and the project includes all possible planning to minimize the resulting harm.see c.the faa environmental handbook provides that an action that is likely to use section f lands is an extraordinary circumstance requiring an environmental assessment.see petitioners app.at faa order a,a.as already noted,the faa found that the nearest part of the golf course lies about feet from the boundary of the proposed facility.the full scenario shows a dnl db contour line encompassing property within feet of the noise source and a dnl db contour line encompassing property within to feet from the noise source.petitioners app.at.the faa determined that the golf course is a compatible land use with the facility dnl db level of noise.the record supports the faa finding that the proposed action will not physically take or use section f property.
air quality 
faa order a,paragraph f,states that an extraordinary circumstance exists where a government action has a significant impact on air quality.see petitioners app.at.the faa considered the intermodal facility potential effect on the air and determined that the resulting air quality impacts are not significant.since its initial determination,however,the faa has identified a mathematical miscalculation in its original analysis,which resulted in an underestimate of the air quality impacts.we permitted the faa to correct the record calculations based upon accurate information.the new calculations provided by the faa continue to indicate that the air quality effects of the new facility do not rise to a significant level.
the petitioners contend that the faa overlooked a significant impact on air quality because the study was based on underestimated traffic assumptions.we concluded earlier that the traffic analysis was not seriously underestimated.the petitioners also point to the opinion of their own expert for their assertion that the faa air quality analysis is flawed.we have denied their attempt to supplement the record with this expert opinion.also,there is no merit to the contention that an eis must be prepared whenever qualified experts disagree.see greenpeace,at.we refuse to engage in a de novo review of scientific data and opinions that are within the expertise of the agency.
historical property 
the friends assert that the facility will have an adverse effect on a historical property.although one building on the property is potentially eligible for protection under the national register of historic places,the faa determined that it is outside of the area of potential effect because it is not within the boundary of the lease,and any impacts on historical property resulting from the project will not extend beyond the lease line boundaries.we see nothing arbitrary in this decision.also,the faa considered the fact that the airport was named after two local pilots killed during world war i and the korean war,but it concluded that this does not make the airport eligible for protection as a historic site.the faa considered the relevant factors,and we will not disturb its finding of no significant impact.
relocation housing 
the faa airport environmental handbook states that an extraordinary circumstance exists if the action is likely to be highly controversial with respect to the availability of adequate relocation housing.petitioners app.at faa order a,d.the faa found that the intermodal facility project is not controversial with respect to the availability of relocation housing because it does not involve any housing issues and will not require the relocation of any residents.the faa also considered that the action will require the closure of the fixed base operation and the hangar facilities at the airport.the faa found that sufficient general aviation facilities are available in the area,although the hangar space is inadequate.in spite of the inadequacy of available hangar space,the faa did not alter its finding that the action is not highly controversial on the issue of relocation housing.
the friends contend that the faa defined adequate relocation housing too narrowly by ignoring the inadequacy of available hangar space for aircraft that will need to be relocated.they cite a,of the uniform relocation assistance and real property acquisition policies act of,which defines displaced person as any person who moves from real property,or moves his personal property from real property as a direct result of an agency action.the friends contend that the agency interpretation of the statute as involving only housing issues,and not also displacement of personal property,reads the statute too narrowly.
in the context presented here,we disagree.the faa order is specifically concerned with the environmental impact of agency actions that relocate people or businesses.we do not believe the faa purports to implement the uniform relocation assistance and real property acquisition policies act in its handbook.instead,the faa is implementing the policies of nepa and has discretion in doing so to decide that the displacement of people from their housing has a significant impact on the human environment,while the relocation of airplanes does not.nothing in the handbook prevents the pilots from obtaining any federal assistance to which they may be entitled under the uniform relocation assistance and real property acquisition policies act due to the relocation of their personal property.the faa was not arbitrary in deciding that any difficulty experienced in obtaining hangars for relocated airplanes does not create an environmental concern requiring the preparation of an environmental assessment in this case.
railroad construction 
the friends also contend that although the agency may properly categorically exclude the release of airport property,it may not categorically exclude the construction of a railroad track.however,the faa did n
