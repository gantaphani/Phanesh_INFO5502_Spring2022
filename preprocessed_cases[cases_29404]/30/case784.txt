sierra club and several environmental groups,collectively,petitioners,petition for review of the united states environmental protection agency epa approval of the state implementation plan sip for the san joaquin valley nonattainment area for the ozone national ambient air quality standard naaqs.petitioners contend that epa acted arbitrarily and capriciously,in violation of the administrative procedures act apa,by approving the sip knowing that the emissions inventory data on which the plan relied were,as an actual matter,outdated and inaccurate by the time epa approved the plan in epa violated the clean air act caa by approving the sip because the emissions inventory data on which it relied were outdated and inaccurate within the meaning of the statute epa violated the caa by approving the sip without the inclusion of the regulations on which the plan relied and epa violated the caa by approving the sip knowing that attainment of the ozone naaqs by the deadline was impossible.we have jurisdiction to review epa action pursuant to b,section b of the caa,and we hold that epa approval of the sip,which was based on data current only as of,was arbitrary and capricious.deciding that issue,we need reach no other.
the caa makes the states and the federal government partners in the struggle against air pollution.jensen family farms,monterey bay unified air pollution control,cir quoting motors united states,internal quotation marks omitted.the caa protects the nation air quality by authorizing epa to establish naaqs that apply to air pollutants that are dangerous to the general health of the public.epa designates areas that fail to attain naaqs as nonattainment areas.id.d.based on the severity of the pollution problem,nonattainment areas are further divided into five categories marginal,moderate,serious,severe,and extreme.id.central california san joaquin valley the valley has been designated as an extreme nonattainment area for the pollutant ozone 
epa first established naaqs for ozone in.this air quality standard limited the acceptable level of ozone in the ambient air to a maximum of parts per million ppm as measured by monitored levels averaged over one hour the hour ozone standard.at.in,epa reset that maximum to ppm as measured by monitored levels over an period the hour ozone standard.id.although the hour standard replaced the hour standard effective june,as an measure,epa retained some elements of the hour ozone standard for certain nonattainment areas that had yet to attain the hour ozone standard at the time of its revocation.id.at as a general matter,the planning and control requirements that remain applicable following the revocation of the hour ozone standard derive from caa sections,and under the measure,nonattainment areas remain subject to the hour requirements until they attain the hour ozone standard.the valley is subject to this provision.
state implementation plans 
the caa requires the states to address nonattainment areas by developing an sip that sets out how a nonattainment area will come into compliance with the requisite naaqs.a.generally,all sips for nonattainment areas must include,inter alia,an emissions inventory,important for the required attainment demonstration and the related rate of progress rop demonstration,that include s a comprehensive,accurate,current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of the relevant pollutant or pollutants in such area an attainment demonstration,developed from the emissions inventory,consisting of a technical analysis to predict whether the area will attain the naaqs by the deadline and a control strategy for how the state plans to actually meet the standard a means to measure reasonable further progress rfp nonattainment area permit requirements for new or modified stationary sources and contingency measures to be implemented if the nonattainment area does not make rfp or does not attain the naaqs by the required date.id.c.sips for extreme ozone nonattainment areas,such as the valley,must include an attainment demonstration based on photochemical grid or any other analytical method determined by the administrator,in the administrator discretion,to be at least as effective.id.c a,e.
after public notice and hearings,a state must adopt the sip and submit it to epa for review and approval.id.a.epa must then determine whether a sip submission is complete within days of receipt a ny plan that has not been affirmatively determined to be complete or incomplete shall become complete within months by operation of law.at discussing k.epa must then act on the sip,either approving it in whole or disapproving it in part or in whole.k.once approved by epa,an sip bec o me s federal law,and c annot be changed unless and until epa approve s any change.safe air for everyone epa,f d,cir.the caa provides a private right of action for citizens to enforce an sip by bringing a civil action in federal district court.
mobile source emissions regulation 
the caa also regulates mobile source emissions t he regulation of mobile source emissions is a federal responsibility,and congress has expressly preempted states from setting emissions standards for mobile sources.jensen family farms,at citing a.california,however,is a notable exception to this general rule,and the caa permits epa to authorize california to set its own mobile source emissions standards so long as it obtains epa approval.id.at citing b motor vehicles id.e nonroad sources see also ass of home builders san joaquin valley unified air pollution control,cir t he caa gives the states the job of regulating stationary sources of pollution,but the epa,and with the epa permission california,are responsible for regulating emissions from motor vehicles and other mobile sources.california thus relies on its own mobile source standards in the development of its sips.

once more,the state did not meet this deadline.to avoid sanctions,the state requested that epa reclassify the valley as an extreme ozone nonattainment area.caa reclassification,see also a.this voluntary reclassification gave the state extra time to submit its revised sip by resetting the state submission deadline for a revised sip consistent with the valley reclassification as an extreme ozone nonattainment area.at.the new deadline was november,and the new attainment deadline was november.id.the state submitted the sip for epa approval in november.at.

epa action on the sip 
the state amended the sip in october to substitute into the plan a new control strategy and to synchronize the rulemaking schedule with that in the valley plan for the naaqs for particulate matter less than or equal to micrometers in diameter.id.the state submitted these amendments to the plan to epa in march.id.in september,the state submitted clarifications regarding the extreme ozone attainment demonstration plan clarifications,which updated information on certain control programs,rop demonstration,and contingency measures in the sip.id.by operation of law,the original sip was deemed complete on may,the subsequent amendments on september,and the clarifications on september.see also k b.together,the sip as submitted in,the amendments,and the clarifications constitute the sip,now at issue.
in october,epa issued a proposed rule to approve the sip and sought public comment.approval and promulgation of implementation plans.after comments were received,epa withdrew its proposed rule approving the sip,and instead proposed to approve the sip in part,disapproving only the attainment contingency measures.at.in response,the state submitted supplemental technical information,and epa withdrew its proposed disapproval and proposed to approve the attainment contingency measures,and thus the sip in full,in october.approval and promulgation of implementation plans.epa finally approved the sip on march,six years after its original submission and just eight months before the plan november,attainment deadline.approval and promulgation of implementation plans.
we have jurisdiction to review epa approval of the sip under b.vigil leavitt,cir.because the caa does not specify a standard of review,we apply the general standard of review for agency actions set forth in the apa.latino issues forum epa,cir citing vigil,at.under the apa,we consider whether the epa action was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.quoting a.this standard requires the epa to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.id.quoting.cattle growers ass fish wildlife,cir.we review the record to ensure that agency decisions are founded on a reasoned evaluation of the relevant factors,and may not rubberstamp administrative decisions that are inconsistent with a statutory mandate or that frustrate the congressional policy underlying a statute id.quoting friends of yosemite valley norton,cir.chevron,natural res.def.council,generally sets forth the framework by which we review an agency interpretation of a statute.id.at.under this framework at the first step we determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.i f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
not all agency statutory interpretations are entitled to chevron deference,however.rather,chevron deference is appropriate where the agency can demonstrate that it has the general power to make rules carrying the force of law and that the challenged action was taken in the exercise of that authority.the wilderness soc y fish wildlife,cir quoting united states mead,see also vigil,at finding that chevron deference did not apply to epa statutory interpretations where epa has not,in fact,exercised its general rulemaking authority to define these terms.a very good indicator of delegation meriting chevron treatment is express congressional authorizations to engage in the process of rulemaking or adjudication that produces regulations or rulings for which deference is claimed.mead,at.
with respect to the caa,congress has given epa general rulemaking authority,a,which,when exercised,requires our deference in accordance with chevron.vigil,at.but epa has not exercised its authority to make rules carrying the force of law to fill in the meaning of current and accurate,the terms in the caa we now ponder.instead,epa interpretation of the caa in its material terms here is largely based on a policy guidance document issued by the office of air quality planning and standards and the office of transportation and air quality in along with the agency past practices.see memorandum from john seitz,office of air quality planning standards,and margo tsirigotis oge,office of transp.air quality,policy guidance on the use of for sip development and transportation conformity,available at http seitz memo.interpretations such as those contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines,all of which lack the force of law do not warrant deference.vigil,at quoting christensen harris.indeed,t hey are beyond the chevron pale.mead,at.
such views,however,even if not authoritative for purposes of chevron,are entitled to skidmore deference insofar as they constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.vigil,at quoting skidmore swift.under mead and skidmore,the weight that we are to give an administrative interpretation not intended by an agency to carry the general force of law is a function of that interpretation thoroughness,rational validity,and consistency with prior and subsequent pronouncements.wilderness soc y,at citing skidmore,at.moreover,c ogent administrative interpretations not the products of formal rulemaking nevertheless warrant respect.vigil,at quoting alaska dep t of envtl.conservation epa.

the crux of the case for us is whether epa actions were arbitrary and capricious,for if so,epa needs to conduct its process anew and other issues concerning statutory interpretation need not be reached.in assessing whether epa agency action approving the sip is arbitrary and capricious,we consider whether epa examine d the relevant data and articulate d a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the,state farm mut.auto.ins,quoting burlington truck lines,united states.
section c of the caa requires that nonattainment plans include a comprehensive,accurate,current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of the relevant pollutant or pollutants in such area.c emphasis added.petitioners contend that by the time epa approved the sip in,the mobile source data on which the emissions inventory in the sip relied were neither accurate nor current,as shown by the emissions inventory data that the state submitted in connection with its sip for the hour ozone standard.petitioners further contend that epa approval of the sip was arbitrary and capricious because,in approving the sip,epa did not reconcile the differences in the emissions data produced by the two models.epa also did not explain why it chose not to consider the data in approving the sip.we agree that the use of stale data was not adequately reconciled with the more current data.
the state based the sip emissions inventory data on mobile source data estimated through the use of the state computer modeling tool released in,called.estimated emissions from heavyduty diesel trucks based on where the trucks were registered.the sip emissions inventory data were compiled using mobile source data estimated using the next generation of that computer modeling tool,released in november and approved by epa in january.official release of motor vehicle emission factor model.improved mobile source emission estimates by basing them on where the trucks were being driven,which better accounted for the amount of pollution from trucks driven in,but not necessarily registered in,the valley.the change in computer modeling tool resulted in disparities in nox emissions estimates between the sip emissions inventory and the sip emissions inventory.for example,the sip emission inventory estimate for total valley nox emissions in was tons per day,but the same estimate for rose to tons per day in the sip.
although it knew of the disparities in mobile source emissions estimates between the sip and the sip,epa did not address those differences or their likely impact,if any,on the validity of the sip in its final rule approving the sip.instead,epa relied on its past practice and interpretation of the caa,as stated in the seitz memo,in which emissions inventory data are considered current and accurate within the meaning of c as long as the data are current and accurate when the state submits an sip to epa for approval and not necessarily when epa approves an sip see seitz memo at.
epa relies principally on the seitz memo and on the circuit holding in sierra club epa,to support its interpretation that emissions inventory data satisfy the accurate and current requirements of the caa as long as they are accurate and current when the sip is submitted for epa approval,and that no further review of the data was necessary.
the seitz memo,published in,gives policy guidance issued to address when to use in sip development and transportation conformity determinations.seitz memo at.in,supplanted as the most current iteration of epa computer modeling tool for highway vehicle emissions for state and local agencies outside of california.id.in the seitz memo,epa expressed its belie f that the caa would not require states that have already submitted sips or will submit sips shortly after release to revise these sips simply because a new motor vehicle emissions model is now available.seitz memo at.in coming to this conclusion,epa seemed concerned that requiring states to rework previously submitted or recently approved sips whenever a new model becomes available would pose an obstacle to epa approval.id.epa stated that,i t would be unreasonable to require the states to revise recently submitted or approved sips with since significant work has already occurred,and epa intends to act on these sips in a timely manner.id.emphasis added.
contrary to epa argument,however,the seitz memo does not appear unequivocally to stand for the proposition that epa action comports as a matter of course with c whenever epa approves an sip based on an old emissions computer modeling tool as long as the modeling tool was the most current and accurate at the time of sip submission.that is because at least part of the seitz memo rationale on not requiring an updated sip when a new computer modeling tool arrives appears to rest on the timeliness of epa subsequent action on the sip in question.see id.indeed,the latter part of the statement quoted above suggests that while there is some period of time after the release of a new computer modeling tool in which the caa does not require a finding that sips based on the previous version are not current and accurate,there comes a time after which reliance on outdated models and data is inconsistent with requisite guidelines for ensuring that agency action is timely and responsive to current public needs.the seitz memo itself further supports this perspective as it states the following 
epa also believes that the legal basis for approving a based sip is less clear the longer that is in place and available for use.since sips must be based on applicable models and data inputs,it could be difficult for epa to approve a sip developed with significantly after becomes available.
id.at emphasis added.it appears then that epa,when it promulgated its guidance,contemplated,not surprisingly,that relying on an outdated computer modeling tool after a significant amount of time has passed since the introduction of a newer model would pose a problem.here,was released to the public in november,submitted to epa for approval in april,and approved by epa in january.see.at.epa,however,did not approve the sip until,more than years after the release of.by march of,epa knew that a new computer modeling tool was available and had access to data compiled through the use of the more current tool.that data told a different story than that told by the earlier data about projected emissions of nox from mobile sources in the valley,which undermined the accuracy and currency of the sip emissions inventory data.epa,in its final rule approving the sip,however,did not analyze this new data or explain why it chose not to analyze the data in considering the sip.epa did not cogently explain why it exercised its discretion not to consider the new and available data.state farm,at.instead,epa merely repeated its mantra that,despite availability of the emissions inventory data three years before the approval of the sip,epa had no duty under the caa to consider new data so long as the data relied upon was current and accurate when submitted.but we think the agency in the public interest should have considered that six years had passed between the state submission of the sip and its approval by the agency.
epa also relies on the circuit holding in sierra club to support its contention that reliance on the currency and accuracy of the data at the time of submission renders its approval of the sip valid.in sierra club,the circuit considered,inter alia,the significance of epa introduction of on epa approval of the hour ozone sips,which were based on emissions data complied using.at.the rop plans for the years,based on,were originally submitted for epa approval in and then resubmitted as part of the sips in february,even though was made available one month earlier in january.epa approved the sips one year later in april.id.
the sierra club argued that epa approval of the sips there was arbitrary and capricious in light of the availability of the newer modeling tool.id.at.relying on the seitz memo,the d.circuit concluded,however,that t o require states to revise completed plans every time a new model is announced would lead to significant costs and potentially endless delays in the approval processes.id.at.accordingly,the circuit held that epa decision to accept the use of was neither arbitrary nor capricious.id.
contrary to epa argument,our conclusion today is not inconsistent with the circuit holding in sierra club because the facts here are not alike there are marked differences between the plans submissions and their approvals.in sierra club,the new modeling tool was available for only one year before epa approved the sips that were based on the previous iteration.here,was available to the public as early as november,and the sip was not approved until more than three years later in march.thus as the seitz memo itself suggests,epa stands on shaky legal ground relying on significantly outdated data,given the amount of time that was available and authorized for use before epa approved the sip.see seitz memo at 
second,in sierra club,the circuit noted the seitz memo argument that requiring a new compilation of emission data based on the new computer modeling tools would place an onerous burden on and unnecessarily prolong approval.indeed,in that case,no new data based on were available and a new study just to collect the raw data would have had to be commissioned.here,by contrast,the state had already collected the emissions data using,and had presented to epa the sip that relied on that updated data.there was no need for a new study to be commissioned,and the burden and expense of commissioning a new study was minimized as one had already been completed with respect to the hour ozone standard sip.based on these factual differences then,the circuit opinion in sierra club does not support epa contention that its approval of the sip here,without consideration of the long available updated emissions inventory data,was not arbitrary or capricious.
moreover,epa decision not to evaluate the data,of which epa had actual knowledge and which could reasonably be described as relevant to the efficacy of the sip,is also inconsistent with our holding in ass of irritated residents epa,cir.in,we considered whether epa decision not to evaluate the adequacy of california south coast nonattainment area previously approved sip was arbitrary and capricious after the state,upon new modeling,submitted a attainment demonstration revision that made clear that the attainment demonstration in the sip was inaccurate.at.epa ultimately disapproved the sip revision attainment demonstration,but took no further action to evaluate the sip extant attainment demonstration.we held that epa failure to evaluate the adequacy of the existing sip was arbitrary and capricious,because california,in its sip revision,acknowledged that the attainment demonstration in sip was inaccurate.id.at.we stated that,t hrough the sip revision,epa knew,or should have known,of the inadequacy of the sip,and that even if epa did not actually know the extent to which the new modeling undermined the existing sip,it has a duty to evaluate the adequacy of the existing sip as a whole when approving sip revisions.id.at.
in reasoning that epa obligation to take further action could be derived from the statutory requirement that the administrator issue a sip call upon a finding that the existing sip is substantially inadequate,we noted 
t he question is not whether epa has discretion in determining substantial inadequacies exist,but whether epa has unlimited discretion to ignore evidence indicating an existing sip might be substantially inadequate and choose to do nothing.we believe epa failure to act in light of the strong evidence provided in the sip revision demonstrating the substantial inadequacies of the plan is arbitrary and capricious.
id.at emphasis added.while addressed epa obligation to monitor the accuracy and efficacy of approved sips,its holding is relevant because it supports the proposition that if new information indicates to epa that an existing sip or sip awaiting approval is inaccurate or not current,then,viewing air quality and scope of emissions with public interest in mind,epa should properly evaluate the new information and may not simply ignore it without reasoned explanation of its choice.
the district argues that it was appropriate for epa to ignore the hour ozone emissions inventory data because they were not relevant to the hour ozone emissions inventory data,and that any comparison would not be an apples to apples comparison.we are not persuaded for several reasons.first,while the conclusions presented within the two sips might vary,the undisputed fact is that the revealed a significantly different measurement of expected nox emissions,tons per day in than did the data observed with,tons per day in.given nox integral role in the creation of harmful ozone,this disparity should have alerted epa to the possibility that the plan may have been significantly flawed.
second,although the district characterizes the hour ozone naaqs as being so different from the hour ozone standard as to make any comparison unreasonable,there is evidence that the two standards are significantly close enough that the differences in nox emissions should have reasonably alerted epa to the real possibility that the data on which the sip was based were inaccurate and ineffective.national ambient air quality standards for ozone,july,stating that the hour standard ppm generally represents the continuation of the present level of protection see also coast air quality mgmt,citing.at for the proposition that the hour ozone standard is only marginally more stringent than the hour ozone standard it replaced.
third,and most importantly,epa,in its final rule,did not bother to address substantively the apparent disparities between the emissions inventory data and the emissions inventory data,leaving us with no means of determining whether there is any merit to the district argument.in this light,the district conclusions in its briefing that the emissions inventory data should have had no bearing on epa approval of the sip are unpersuasive insofar as they are presented for the purposes of litigation rather than framed objectively and scientifically.see state farm,at t he courts may not accept appellate counsel post hoc rationalizations for agency action.epa did not bring its expertise to bear on the updated emissions inventory data in the sip approval process.id.at.the agency did not adequately address the staleness of its data and availability of more current data before reaching its conclusion.
our role is not to substitute our conclusions based on the facts presented for those of the agency,and we express no opinion as to what conclusion epa should have reached,with respect to the validity of the sip,upon consideration of the data.but we should not silently rubber stamp agency action that is arbitrary and capricious in its reliance on old data without meaningful comment on the significance of more current compiled data.we hold that epa failure to even consider the new data and to provide an explanation for its choice rooted in the data presented was arbitrary and capricious.indeed,it was unreasonable for epa summarily to rely on the point of view taken under markedly different circumstances in the seitz memo and in sierra club,without advancing an explanation for its action based on the facts found and the choice made.burlington truck lines,at.
concluding that the agency action in approving the challenged sip was arbitrary and capricious under the apa,we need not and do not reach petitioners other arguments.we grant the petition for review and remand the matter to epa for further proceedings consistent with our decision
