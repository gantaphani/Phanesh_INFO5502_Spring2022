environmental organization wildearth guardians sued to enjoin the federal government participation in the killing of predatory animals in nevada.wildearth alleged that the program continued reliance on a programmatic environmental impact statement peis causes the government to use outdated and unnecessarily harmful predator control techniques that interfere with wildearth members enjoyment of outdoor activities.the district court dismissed for lack of standing,holding that wildearth had not shown that its alleged injuries were caused by the government reliance on the peis,and that,in any event,nevada could choose to implement an independent predator damage management program if the federal government ceased its activities,so wildearth injuries were not redressable.both of these reasons for dismissal were erroneous,so we reverse.
background 
national environmental policy act 
the national environmental policy act nepa requires federal agencies to assess and publicly disclose the environmental impacts of proposed federal actions.for federal actions that significantly affect the quality of the human environment,the agency must develop an environmental impact statement eis that provide s full and fair discussion of significant environmental impacts and inform s decisionmakers and the public of the reasonable alternatives which would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment.c.when it is unclear whether the federal action will have a significant effect on the environment,the agency must prepare an environmental assessment to determine whether an eis is required.b.if,after completing the environmental assessment,the agency decides not to prepare an eis,the agency must prepare a finding of no significant impact to explain its decision.id.e.
an agency with an existing eis must supplement it if the agency makes substantial changes in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns or if t here are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.id.c.if there remains major federal action to occur,and if the new information is sufficient to show that the remaining action will affect the quality of the human environment in a significant manner or to a significant extent not already considered,a supplemental eis must be prepared.marsh or.natural res.council,brackets omitted.
aphis and its programmatic environmental impact statement 
the united states department of agriculture is authorized to protect the nation agricultural resources from damage associated with predatory wildlife.see.the department animal and plant health inspection service aphis carries out wildlife control programs through wildlife services see.aphis conducts its programs in cooperation with other federal,state,and local agencies,as well as with private organizations and individuals.
in,aphis assessed the environmental impact of its full program of ongoing wildlife damage control nationwide and issued an eis,referred to as a programmatic eis peis.the peis was revised in to make technical corrections.the peis discusses thirteen alternatives for wildlife management and identifies a preferred approach the current program alternative.rather than requiring the preferred approach to be implemented nationwide,however,the record of decision for the peis identifies five viable alternatives discussed in the peis and states that they would be forwarded to regional and local decision makers for consideration as management approaches.animal damage control program,record of decision based on final environmental impact statement.
predator damage control activities in nevada 
aphis and the nevada department of wildlife currently share responsibility for predator damage control in nevada.together,the two form the nevada wildlife services program nwsp.nwsp has been conducting predator damage management in nevada for over eighty years.aphis provides significant funding,staffing,and supervision for nwsp activities.nevada also provides some funding and personnel.
in,the of the nevada department of wildlife,kenneth mayer,wrote a letter to aphis the mayer letter stating that,if aphis stopped conducting predator damage management in nevada,the nevada department of wildlife would retain statutory responsibility for wildlife control and would either carry out the management of wildlife with existing personnel or contract the work to other capable entities.
in june,aphis issued an environmental assessment for nwsp ongoing predator damage management program in nevada.the environmental assessment incorporated by reference aphis peis.
the assessment considered five alternatives for predator management in nevada,including ending federal involvement.the assessment stated that,if federal involvement ceased,nevada likely would engage in some predator damage management,but that it was unlikely that nevada would conduct predator control at the level of the current program.the assessment noted that the effects on the environment of ceasing federal involvement were uncertain because they would depend on the actions of private individuals,who might attempt predator management on their own.the assessment nevertheless made some predictions about the likely rates of certain methods of predator control.specifically,the assessment stated that the killing of ravens a nevada predator would be likely to decrease substantially because nevada would not have access to the same avicide used by aphis.the assessment further hypothesized that ending federal involvement would greatly reduce aerial hunting of predator species,but would increase other forms of predator hunting.
ultimately,the environmental assessment concluded that continuing the joint aphis nevada predator damage management program would not have significant environmental impacts,but that monitoring of the program impacts on wildlife populations should continue.aphis issued a finding of no significant impact and therefore did not order a eis.
litigation history 
wildearth sued aphis in,asserting four claims based on alleged violations of nepa and one claim under the wilderness act,et.wildearth sought injunctive and declaratory relief.wildearth alleged that the data,science,and analysis used in the peis were based on studies from the and that have been called into question by more recent research.claims one and two alleged,respectively,that aphis failure to supplement the peis for its predator damage programs nationwide is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,not in accordance with law,or without observance of procedures required by law,a,d and an agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed,id.claim three alleged that the nevada environmental assessment was inadequate under nepa,and claim four alleged that the nevada finding of no significant impact was arbitrary and capricious,or without observance of procedures required by law,id.a,d.claim five alleged that the nwsp aerial hunting practices violate the wilderness act.
aphis moved to dismiss claims one through four under federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of standing,arguing that wildearth had not alleged that any of its members had suffered a concrete,redressable harm.aphis additionally asserted that claims one,two,and five should be dismissed under rule b for failure to state a claim.
in response to aphis motion to dismiss,wildearth submitted a declaration from don molde,a wildearth member,who engages in outdoor recreation in parts of nevada affected by nwsp predator control molde declaration described his frequent recreational use of areas in nevada impacted by nwsp activities,his plans to continue visiting those areas,and the negative effect of nwsp predator damage management on his recreational and aesthetic enjoyment of the impacted areas.for example,molde stated that he has curtailed his walks with his dog for fear that the dog would be caught in nwsp predator traps.molde further described how nwsp activities reduce the number of ravens that he is able to observe during his,and how nwsp aerial hunting practices reduce his chances of seeing coyotes.
the district court dismissed claims one through four for lack of standing.with respect to claims one and two,the district court concluded that wildearth had not alleged a sufficiently concrete injury traceable to aphis peis.regarding claims three and four,the district court concluded that wildearth injury was not redressable because the mayer letter indicated that nevada would carry out predator damage management even if aphis was enjoined from engaging in predator control in nevada.
the district court denied the motion to dismiss claim five,but wildearth then voluntarily dismissed that claim so that it could immediately appeal the standing holdings.

iii.discussion 
to establish standing,a plaintiff must show that he or she has suffered an injury in fact that is concrete and particularized,and actual or imminent the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct and the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable court decision.salmon spawning,at citing lujan defs.of wildlife.
to demonstrate standing to bring a procedural claim such as one alleging a nepa violation a plaintiff must show that the procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of his that is the ultimate basis of his standing.watersheds project kraayenbrink,cir.for an environmental interest to be concrete,there must be a geographic nexus between the individual asserting the claim and the location suffering an environmental impact.id.e nvironmental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened by the challenged activity.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.once plaintiffs seeking to enforce a procedural requirement establish a concrete injury,the causation and redressability requirements are relaxed.watersheds project,at.plaintiffs alleging procedural injury must show only that they have a procedural right that,if exercised,could protect their concrete interests.salmon spawning,at.
a.the claims challenging the peis 
the district court dismissed claims one and two,holding that wildearth had not shown that any of its members had a concrete injury caused by the peis.but the injuries molde alleges are concrete enough,and are sufficiently causally related to aphis failure to update the peis,to support wildearth standing for claims one and two.
an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right,the interests at stake are germane to the organization purpose,and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.friends of the earth,at citing hunt.state apple advert.comm n.as to the second and third prongs,it is clear that molde interest in recreational and aesthetic enjoyment of predators in the nevada wilderness is related to wildearth purposes of protecting and restoring wildlife and carnivore protection.and neither wildearth claims for procedural violations of nepa nor its requested relief require the participation of any individual wildearth members.the only dispute is over the first prong whether the harm to molde satisfies the concrete,causation,and redressability requirements for standing.we therefore focus on those issues.
molde injury is his reduced recreational and aesthetic enjoyment of areas in nevada impacted by nwsp predator damage management programs.his declaration names specific wilderness areas in nevada that he has visited and has specific plans to visit again.the declaration states that nwsp predator control negatively impacts molde enjoyment of those areas by causing him to curtail his recreational activities and reducing his likelihood of seeing predators,including coyotes and ravens.this satisfies the requirement.see ctr.for biological diversity kempthorne,cir holding that a declaration from plaintiffs that they have viewed animals in the affected region previously,enjoy doing so,and have plans to return satisfies the requirement for a concrete injury in fact with geographic nexus to the challenged action.
because wildearth seeks to enforce a procedural right under nepa,the requirements for causation and redressability are relaxed.watersheds project,at.under that relaxed standard,wildearth allegations,based on molde experience,are sufficient to support standing.wildearth alleges that aphis implements its predator damage management programs pursuant to the peis,and that aphis has improperly failed to update that peis.the record of decision for the final peis specifically states that aphis will rely on information from the final peis for nepa compliance.indeed,the nevada environmental assessment did incorporate the peis.this is a sufficient causal link between aphis alleged procedural violations of nepa and molde injury to satisfy the relaxed causation requirement for procedural claims.see salmon spawning,at holding that causation is satisfied under the relaxed requirements for procedural claims when t he asserted injury is not too tenuously connected to the agencies failure to take action.
contrary to aphis arguments,the fact that the peis also applies to programs in states for which wildearth has not submitted member declarations does not prevent wildearth from challenging the continued use of the peis.wildearth has adequately alleged that molde injury in nevada is caused by the failure to update the peis,which is sufficient to allow wildearth to challenge that failure to update.that the peis also applies to other geographic regions that molde does not visit is irrelevant to the standing analysis.see res,robertson,cir i f plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge a eis,the program as a whole could never be reviewed.to the extent that the plan predetermines the future,it represents a concrete injury that plaintiffs must,at some point,have standing to challenge.idaho conservation league mumma,cir holding that the plaintiffs had standing to challenge a eis that caused their injury in fact see also alaska ctr.for env t browner,cir upholding standing for challenge to statewide failure to regulate water quality when the plaintiffs alleged specific injury relating to some,but not all,streams within alaska.
molde injury also satisfies the relaxed redressability requirement for procedural claims.this requirement is satisfied when the relief requested that the agency follow the correct procedures may influence the agency ultimate decision.salmon spawning,at.this relaxed redressability standard governs procedural challenges to programmatic actions as well as to specific implementing actions.see cottonwood envtl.law ctr.forest,wl,at cir.june,as in salmon spawning,cottonwood allegation of a procedural injury relaxes its burden of showing causation and redressability.cottonwood need not show that the procedures sought would lead to a different result at either the programmatic or level.internal citation omitted.here,updating the peis could influence aphis predator damage management in nevada,which is sufficient to satisfy the redressability requirement for standing for a procedural claim.
because molde would have standing to bring claims one and two on his own,and wildearth also satisfies the other associational standing requirements,wildearth has standing for claims one and two 
b.the nevada specific claims 
claims three and four allege that aphis violated nepa by preparing an inadequate environmental assessment for nevada and consequently failing to prepare a eis.in support,wildearth argues that aphis nevada analysis was deficient because,among other things,it failed to analyze the environmental impacts of trapping,aerial hunting,and avicide use all practices that molde contends negatively impact his aesthetic and recreational enjoyment of affect
