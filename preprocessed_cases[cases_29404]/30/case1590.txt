background 
i.the etp and purse seine fishing 
the etp is a seven million square mile stretch of ocean that runs from the coast of california to the coast of peru.it is host to numerous species of wildlife,including yellowfin tuna and dolphins.one quarter of the world tuna catch occurs in the etp of all the tuna caught in the etp,yellowfin tuna is the most economically significant species.
a unique synergy exists in the etp between schools of yellowfin tuna and groups of dolphins.yellowfin tuna inexplicably aggregate in large numbers beneath dolphin schools.fishermen,seeking to exploit this synergy,devised a method of catching yellowfin tuna called purse seine fishing.purse seine fishing is based on the principle that dolphins must break the surface of the water to breathe every several minutes,allowing fishermen to easily identify and locate groups of dolphins.once a large dolphin group is located,fishermen use motorboats,explosives,and helicopters to chase the dolphins for extended periods in an attempt to exhaust them.
eventually,the group is herded into a small area,where the fishermen first surround the dolphins and the submerged yellowfin tuna with an immense fishing net,called a purse seine,and then draw the bottom of the net together to trap the tuna.the fishermen then haul the net on board to recover the tuna.dolphins are released through a backdown procedure,which takes place when the fishermen reverse the vessel direction after approximately of the purse seine net has been rolled onboard.purse seine fishing results in the drowning deaths of dolphins that become entangled in the net.from to,millions of dolphins were killed in this manner,and public outcry prompted congress to pass legislation banning purse seine fishing.
ii.statutes and international agreements 
in,congress passed the marine mammal protection act mmpa.the mmpa required that all marine mammal populations be managed to maintain their optimum sustainable population.marine mammal protection act,stat.codified as amended at.the mmpa created a moratorium on the taking and importation of marine mammals,except that marine mammals were permitted to be taken incidentally in the course of commercial fishing operations and permits allowing such incidental taking could be issued pursuant to the provisions of the mmpa.id.at codified at a.however,no permit could be issued for the taking of any marine mammal which had been designated by the secretary as depleted.id.at codified at a b.the mmpa further directed the secretary of the treasury to ban the importation of commercial fish or products from fish which have been caught with commercial fishing technology which results in the incidental kill or incidental serious injury of ocean mammals in excess of the united states standards.id.at codified at a.upon conducting research required by the mmpa,the nmfs concluded that three dolphin stocks were depleted in the etp the coastal dolphin,the northeastern offshore spotted dolphin,and the eastern spinner dolphin.regulation governing the taking and importing of marine mammals.taking and importing of marine mammals listing of the northeastern offshore spotted dolphin as depleted.taking and importing of marine mammals listing of the eastern spinner dolphin as depleted.
in,congress enacted the mmpa amendments of,stat.the amendments specified criteria for allowing access to the united states market by nations and imposed embargoes on tuna imports from countries,including mexico,that failed to meet those criteria.id.thereafter,in,congress enacted the dolphin protection consumer information act,stat,which established dolphin safe labeling standards and made it a violation of the federal trade commission act to label a product as dolphin safe if it contained tuna harvested on the high seas by a vessel engaging in drift net fishing or tuna harvested in the etp by a vessel using the purse seine method,unless the tuna product was accompanied by various statements demonstrating that no dolphins were intentionally encircled during the trip in which the tuna was caught.id.d,stat.at.
in,the united states entered into a international agreement la jolla agreement,which negotiated the creation of the international dolphin conservation program idcp.the la jolla agreement stated that its objectives were to progressively reduc e dolphin mortality in the eastern pacific ocean fishery to levels approaching zero through the setting of annual limits and with a goal of eliminating dolphin mortality in this fishery la jolla agreement,appendix 
in,the united states and eleven other countries signed the panama declaration,which formalized the la jolla agreement into a binding agreement.the purpose of the panama declaration was to strengthen the protection of dolphins by reducing dolphin mortality in the etp to levels approaching zero establishing annual dolphin mortality limits dml creating incentives for vessel captains to further reduce dolphin mortality and establishing measures to avoid bycatch.declaration of panama.the panama declaration is not.consequently,it could not become legally binding domestically unless congress implemented it through domestic legislation.trans world airlines,franklin mint,d since the convention is a treaty,no domestic legislation is required to give it the force of law in the united states.
in,congress passed the idcpa,stat.codified at,which implemented certain provisions of the panama declaration.the idcpa revised the mmpa and provided new import criteria for tuna products.under the idcpa,a nation is allowed to import tuna into the united states if it provides documentary evidence that it participates in the idcp and is a member of the tropical tuna commission,it meets its obligations under the idcp and is a member of the commission,and it does not exceed specified dmls.a b.
iii.the rule 
in the idcpa,congress charged the secretary of commerce with drafting implementing regulations.additionally,the act directed the secretary of state to procure a legally binding instrument establishing the idcp,which the secretary did through an executive agreement,the agreement on the international dolphin conservation program the international agreement.id.
on june,commerce published a proposed rule to implement the idcpa.taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations tuna purse seine vessels in the eastern tropical pacific ocean etp.june,proposed rule.commerce accepted public comment until july,during which time several of the plaintiffs submitted written comments.subsequently,commerce published its rule.taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations tuna purse seine vessels in the eastern tropical pacific ocean etp,rule.
the idcpa directed the secretary to issue regulations to implement the idcp and to govern the taking of marine mammals in the etp.a.the idcpa specified provisions that were to be included in the implementing regulations,such as requiring observers on each vessel,ensuring that backdown has begun thirty minutes before sundown,and establishing dmls.id.a b.at issue in this case is the rule provision relating to the backdown procedures.the rule states,in relevant part,that o n every set encircling dolphin,the backdown procedure must be completed no later than hour after sundown c iii.at emphasis added.
during the process of rule making,nmfs was also preparing an environmental assessment.as explained more fully below,under nepa,all federal agencies must include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,an assessment of the environmental impact through an environmental impact statement.c.in order to determine whether an environmental impact statement is necessary,agencies prepare environmental assessments addressing the proposal or action impact on the human environment.nmfs environmental assessment was designed to determine the impact of the rule on the human environment.it considered three alternatives the status quo under mmpa the rule as proposed and an adjusted version of the rule that required backdown to begin thirty minutes before sundown.nmfs found with respect to alternative number two that 
allowing large purse seine vessels to deploy a net on or encircle dolphins in the course of tuna purse seine fishing in the etp and allowing the import of yellowfin tuna catch in this manner from the etp tuna purse seine fishery should not have a significant impact on any dolphin stocks in the etp.
environmental assessment of rule to implement the international dolphin conservation program act and regulatory impact review environmental assessment.the environmental assessment resulted in a finding of no significant impact with respect to alternative number two.id.at.therefore,nmfs decided not to prepare an environmental impact statement.
iv.proceedings in the court of international trade 
on february,plaintiffs filed suit in the court of international trade,alleging that the rule was contrary to the idcpa and therefore not in accordance with law.plaintiffs contended that the provision of the rule relating to backdown procedures was contrary to the idcpa,because the statute required backdown to be completed hour before sunset.in addition,plaintiffs alleged that the environmental assessment prepared by nmfs was defective and violated nepa and that an environmental impact statement should have been prepared.plaintiffs also alleged that the findings made by the secretary of commerce with regard to mexico were not in accordance with the idcpa and therefore did not support the lifting of the tuna embargo against mexico.the court of international trade exercised jurisdiction pursuant to i,which provides that the court of international trade shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action commenced against the united states,its agencies,or its officers,that arises out of any law of the united states providing for embargoes or other quantitative restrictions on the importation of merchandise for reasons other than the protection of the public health or safety see turtle island restoration network evans.
on february,plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on the administrative record and sought a declaratory judgment that the agency action promulgating the rule violated both the idcpa and nepa.the government opposed plaintiffs motion,but did not for summary judgment.
reviewing nmfs rule making under the arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law standard of the administrative procedure act,a,the court of international trade denied plaintiffs summary judgment motion and entered judgment for the government dismissing the complaint.defenders of wildlife,d at.the court concluded that the idcpa includes a statutory mistake in a b v,where it states that all backdown procedures during sets of purse seine on marine mammals must be completed no later than hour before sundown.id.at.the court further concluded that this statutory mistake resulted in an inconsistency between the idcpa and the rule that,when corrected,properly expressed the intent of congress.id.the court also concluded that nmfs decision not to prepare an environmental impact statement was not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.at.finally,the court upheld the lifting of the mexican embargo.id.at.plaintiffs now appeal we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
standard of review 
summary judgment is appropriate where the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.of int l trade c anderson liberty lobby,d.we review the court of international trade summary judgment ruling upon the administrative record de novo and without deference to the court.int l light metals united states.we therefore apply the same standard as the court of international trade,holding unlawful and set ting aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law a.statutory interpretation is a matter of law that we review de novo without regard to the interpretation reached by the court of international trade.skf usa united states.
on appeal,plaintiffs make essentially two arguments.first,they challenge the court decision that the rule is consistent with the idcpa.second,they urge us to reject the court decision that the government did not violate nepa in promulgating the rule without preparing an environmental impact statement.we address these contentions in turn.
ii.sunset rule 
the idcpa states that the regulations promulgated under must ensur e that the backdown procedure during sets of purse seine net on marine mammals is completed and rolling of the net to sack up has begun no later than minutes before sundown a b v emphasis added.the rule,on the other hand,states that o n every set encircling dolphin,the backdown procedure must be completed no later than hour after sundown c iii emphasis added sunset rule.
the court of international trade acknowledged that the provision of the rule relating to sundown sets was contrary to the language of the idcpa.however,the court stated although the language of the regulation does appear to conflict with the express statutory language regarding sundown sets,it does not conflict with the intent of congress.defenders of wildlife,d at.in reaching this conclusion,the court pointed to p rior legislation that is part of the same legislative scheme to protect dolphins,legislative history,practical considerations and the international agreement as indicating that congress intended to use the word after rather than before,to establish the period for sundown sets.id.at.the court noted several points.first,prior to the enactment of the amendments to the mmpa,the committee on merchant marine and fisheries stated that the procedures would be completed and the net would be close to the seine vessel by minutes after sundown,at,reprinted in,emphasis added.id.second,the court noted that,in the amendments,congress directed commerce to prescribe regulations to ensure that the backdown procedure during sets of the purse seine net on marine mammals is completed and rolling of the net to sack up has begun no later than thirty minutes after sundown,stat,emphasis added.id.in addition,the court observed that annex viii to the international agreement on the idcp provides that a tuna boat operating in the agreement area must complete backdown no later than thirty minutes after sunset.annex viii.e emphasis added.id.finally,the court stated that employing a thirty minute after sundown standard made practical sense because of the difficulty a ship at sea would have in calculating the time of sundown in order to complete backdown thirty minutes before that time,whereas thirty minutes after sundown could be calculated based upon the observable phenomenon of sundown itself.id.in short,the court of international trade concluded that the use of the word before in the statute represented a drafting error because it did not represent a true expression of congress intent.id.consequently,the court held that the provision in the rule on sundown sets was not contrary to law.id.
plaintiffs argue that the rule promulgated by nmfs is not in accordance with the idcpa.specifically,they contend that nmfs rule is contrary to the plain language of the statute and that nmfs rule frustrates the intent of congress dolphin protection.in response,the government asserts that congress use of the word before is an inadvertent drafting mistake that should be corrected by the court.alternatively,the government argues that congress authorized commerce to alter,in its discretion,the requirements of the statute so long as the alterations are consistent with the idcp established by the state department in the international agreement.
in determining whether an agency regulatory interpretation of a statute is lawful,courts rely on chevron,natural resources defense council,d.a court must first determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if congress intent is ascertainable,we need not reach the issue of chevron deference,but must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if congress has not spoken directly to the issue,the court must determine if the agency interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.
deciphering the intent of congress begins with the text of the statute.hughes aircraft jacobson,d as in any case of statutory construction,our analysis begins with the language of the statute.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we begin our inquiry into the meaning of the idcpa with the language of the statute itself.the statute could not be clearer in its use of the term before,and since the statute does not define or limit the term before,we presume congress intended to give that term its ordinary meaning.asgrow seed winterboer,d.the rule is also clear in its use of the word after and,as such,directly conflicts with the statute.in this case,the language of the statute represents a clear statement of congress intent.chevron,at.where congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,we do not reach chevron deference.
as noted,however,the court of international trade concluded that the word before in the idcpa represented a drafting mistake on the part of congress.the government,relying on bohac department of agriculture,contends that a court may change the meaning of the words of a statute in the face of an obvious mistake.it urges us to change the word before in the idcpa to after based on the doctrine of mistake.
in bohac,the statute at issue granted successful plaintiffs any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential changes.id.at emphasis added.it was clear from the face of the statute that the word changes made no sense,and accordingly,the court altered the meaning to be any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages.id.emphasis added.bohac and other cases that resort to the doctrine of mistake largely involve mistakes that are clear from the text of the statute.see united states bank indep.ins.agents of,d in these unusual cases,we are convinced that the placement of the quotation marks in the act was a simple scrivener error,a mistake made by someone unfamiliar with the law object and design.it is not clear from the face of the idcpa,however,that the word before is a drafting error.
as did the court of international trade,the government takes the position that congress intended to use the word after instead of before based upon the fact that a prior legislative enactment,the amendments to the mmpa,required the backdown procedure to be completed hour after the sun has set.as did the court of international trade,the government also relies on the statutory scheme of the idcpa,where congress directed the state department to negotiate and implement an international agreement without returning to congress for approval,to suggest that congress intended the international standard to govern the implementing regulations.
in order to construe a statute contrary to the plain meaning of its text,the government must show a clear contrary intent by congress that supports its construction.garcia united states,d o nly the most extraordinary showing of contrary intentions from the legislative history would justify a limitation on the plain meaning of the statutory language.a prior statutory enactment by congress is not indicative of the changes that congress is likely to make at a later time.the government argument ignores the fact that congress may change the meaning of a statute from past provisions.congress prior use of the word after imports no additional information with respect to whether the change to the word before was intentional or an unintentional mistake.additionally,the supremacy clause mandates that a statute is supreme over an executive agreement,such as the international agreement on the idcp.const.art.vi,cl.congress,therefore,could not have intended,without more,for the international agreement to govern the implementation of the regulations.the idcpa clearly requires that the backdown procedure be completed hour before sunset.
we find more persuasive the government second argument.the idcpa states that t he secretary may make such adjustments as may be appropriate to requirements of subparagraph b that pertain to fishing gear,vessel equipment,and fishing practices to the extent the adjustments are consistent with the international dolphin conservation program.a c.the government argues that the period for permissible sundown sets is a fishing practice and that it was entitled to alter its regulation consistent with the idcp.
section a c grants commerce the authority to make adjustments to the requirements of the idcpa in certain circumstances we conclude that,under the current set of circumstances,nmfs was authorized to alter the backdown procedure in the idcpa.the period for permissible sundown sets is a fishing practice subject to section a c.moreover,the international agreement creating the idcp states that the backdown procedure must be completed no later than one half hour after sunset.agreement on the international dolphin conservation program,may,annex viii.e.in view of section a c,nmfs was authorized to draft the rule in a manner consistent with the idcp.nmfs decision to adopt the hour after sundown standard,therefore,is in accordance with the letter of the law.
plaintiffs object to this approach,however,because commerce did not rely on section a c in promulgating the rule.plaintiffs thus raise a chenery issue.see sec chenery.if the action rests upon an administrative exercise of judgment in an area which congress has entrusted to the course it must not be set aside because the reviewing court might have made a different determination were it empowered to do so.chenery stands for the proposition that a court may not make its own factual findings to support an agency determination.id.factual findings are properly left to the agency that oversees a statute.id.
in this case,there is not a chenery problem for two reasons.first,in nmfs response to comment to the proposed rule,nmfs relied on the international agreement creating the idcp as support for the rule and relied on the fact that the rule is consistent with the international agreement.see taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations tuna purse seine vessels in the eastern tropical pacific ocean etp.at.second,we are not required to make additional factual findings,as was the case in chenery.see fleshman west,t he doctrine does not prohibit a reviewing court from affirming an agency decision on a ground different from the one used by the agency if the new ground is not one that calls for a determination or judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make,and the doctrine does not require a remand to the agency if it is clear that the agency would have reached the same ultimate result had it considered the new ground.citations omitted.rather,we are called upon to determine whether nmfs had the authority under a c to issue the rule as drafted.in this case,nmfs already has exercised its discretion to draft the rule consistently with the idcp.for that reason,we conclude that the agency would have reached the same conclusion had it addressed the legal issue on which we rest our judgment.the government analysis,therefore,does not run afoul of chenery.we therefore will not disturb the decision of the court of international trade that the rule sunset rule does not conflict with the idcpa.
iii.nepa challenge 
the court of international trade rejected plaintiffs argument that,in promulgating the rule,nmfs violated nepa.defenders of wildlife,d at.the court held that the government decision not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the rule was not arbitrary or capricious.id.at.the court concluded that defenders fail ed to show the court that the nmfs committed error in preparing the environmental assessment,and certainly fail ed to convince the court that the environmental assessment is defective and represents an abuse of agency discretion.id.at.
as they did in the court of international trade,plaintiffs contend that,in promulgating the rule,commerce violated nepa.specifically,plaintiffs assert that nmfs decision not to prepare an environmental impact statement was arbitrary and capricious because its environmental assessment for the rule was deficient.plaintiffs level essentially four charges at the environmental assessment that it was based upon inaccurate and dated information that it erroneously took a piecemeal approach and failed to consider the cumulative effects on the dolphin population of various environmental impacts that it failed to address certain problems with the dolphin program and that it was flawed because of the lack of public participation in the process.
the government responds that nmfs environmental assessment was thorough and complete.the government claims that it properly delineated the affected environment,that it considered reasonable alternatives,and that it analyzed the environmental effects of each of the alternatives.moreover,it argues,nmfs decision not to file an environmental impact statement for the rule was not arbitrary or capricious.
nepa requires all federal agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement on all major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.the environmental impact statement requirement ensures that agencies take a hard look at the environmental consequences of their actions and at possible alternatives.kleppe sierra club,d.each agency is responsible for its own compliance with nepa.congress,however,created a central agency,the council on environmental quality ceq,to coordinate agencies compliance with nepa,and ceq promulgated regulations for implementing nepa that are binding on all agencies.these regulations help agencies determine whether an environmental impact statement is required.
when an agency decides whether or not to prepare an environmental impact statement,it creates an environmental assessment.through the environmental assessment,the agency considers whether the action it is taking is a major federal action and whether it significantly affects the human environment.c.if an agency determines on the basis of its environmental assessment that it need not prepare an environmental impact statement,it must make a finding of no significant impact and support it with a statement of reasons why the impact of its proposed action is insignificant.in addition,the finding of no significant impact must be made available to the impacted public.id.
the ceq regulations direct agencies to determine whether the proposed action is one that normally requires an environmental impact statement or normally does not require an environmental impact statement.id.in this case,the noaa promulgated procedures stating that the issuance of rules that affect the taking of marine mammals are actions that normally require an environmental assessment,but not necessarily an environmental impact statement.environmental review procedures for implementing the national environmental policy act f,available at last modified may.
in scrutinizing an agency determination of no significant impact,courts look to the test laid out in sierra club peterson.first,the court must ascertain if the agency took a hard look at the environmental problem.id.second,the court must determine if the agency identified the relevant areas of environmental concern.id.third,the court must determine whether the agency made a convincing case that the impact was insignificant.id.finally,the court must decide whether the agency sufficiently minimized any impact.id.a decision not to prepare an environmental impact statement should only be set aside if the decision is found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.marsh or.natural res.council,d.moreover,the scope of review is limited to the administrative record.id.
we begin with the premise that,through the idcpa,congress chose to permit fishermen to import and sell in the united states tuna caught by the purse seine method of fishing.congressional determinations,such as this,are not subject to the requirements of nepa.instead,we must decide whether nmfs,in deciding whether to prepare an environmental impact statement,took a hard look at the dolphin mortality problem and at the effect of the rule that implemented congress determinations.
in this case,nmfs identified the relevant areas of environmental concern.it took a hard look at the dolphin mortality problem,and it established that there was not a significant impact posed by its regulations.nmfs defined the affected environment as the physical environment,the biological environment,tuna purse seine fishing in the etp,and the economic environment.environmental assessment at.moreover,nmfs compared the impacts of three alternatives.the idcpa included many requirements for the regulations,and therefore,the alternatives that nmfs could consider were restricted.see a b i xii.we hold that nmfs complied with nepa and reasonably exercised its discretion in reaching its finding of no significant impact.we consider each of plaintiffs arguments to the contrary in turn.
plaintiffs arguments generally revolve around their contention that nmfs failed to consider how the physiological stress of the extended chase preceding encirclement,separation,and the of direct kills by ship captains would hinder the dolphin populations recovery.plaintiffs contend that nmfs failed to take a hard look at these environmental impacts and therefore improperly concluded that there would be no significant impact.
inaccurate and dated information 
the idcpa directed commerce to report on the effect of intentional encirclement including chase on dolphins and dolphin stocks incidentally taken in the course of purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical pacific ocean.a.on march,nmfs submitted a report report to congress.the report concluded that the northeastern offshore spotted dolphin population and the eastern spinner dolphin population were not increasing at the rate expected based on the low rate of reported mortalities from the fishery since and the reproductive potential for these populations.report,at vi.in the report,nmfs considered and explanations for the populations failure to recover and ruled out the possibility of environmental changes that could have affected the populations.it turned instead to explanations and,in particular,stress caused by an extenuated chase,separation of calves from their mothers as a result of the chase,and of direct kills by fishing captains.nmfs concluded that the information suggests but by no means conclusively that the fishery has been the source of significant adverse impact on these two populations.id.at.
plaintiffs contend that nmfs did not consider the report when it determined that all stocks,including the depleted eastern spinner stock and the northeastern offshore spotted stock,are stable or slightly increasing environmental assessment at.plaintiffs also contend that nmfs failed to cite or consider four research papers prepared for the report curry,stress in mammals the potential influence of stress on dolphins in the eastern tropical pacific ocean fiedler,eastern tropical pacific dolphin habitat variability gerrodette,preliminary estimates of abundance of four dolphin stocks in the eastern tropical pacific and goodman,decision framework for assessing the status of the eastern tropical pacific dolphin stocks.plaintiffs argue that these papers represented the highest quality information prepared by nmfs own staff at the time the environmental assessment was being prepared and that the papers and the report were all consistent with each other.plaintiffs conclude that nmfs failure to consider these documents rendered its environmental assessment arbitrary and capricious.
nmfs failure to cite the report and the four research papers does not mean that nmfs did not consider them.it means only that nmfs did not specifically rely on them to reach its finding of no significant impact.the choice of what information to rely upon is properly within the discretion of the agency,and the decision not to rely on a specific report does not render the environmental impact arbitrary and capricious.
cumulative effects under regulatory actions 
plaintiffs further argue that nmfs illegally separated its environmental assessment for the rule from the environmental assessment for three earlier regulatory actions and failed to consider the cumulative effects of these earlier regulatory actions on the dolphin populations.the earlier regulatory actions for which environmental assessments were prepared are as follows regulations to implement management and conservation measures under the pacific tunas conventions act measures to reduce bycatch by vessels in the etp purse seine fisheries and information collection for a regional vessel register and experiment under the international dolphin conservation program act.plaintiffs claim that the rule and these regulatory actions were closely related in subject matter and time and that all four actions should have been considered together in a single environmental assessment,as required by the ceq.see a proposals or parts of proposals which are related to each other closely enough to be,in effect,a single course of action shall be evaluated in a single impact statement.see also id.a kleppe,at.we are not persuaded by this argument.
plaintiffs statement that the subject matter in all four of these environmental assessments possess obvious synergies is not enough,without more,to show that the rule and the three cited actions were so closely related to each other that they comprised a single course of action requiring a single environmental assessment.see kleppe,at.the determination of the region,if any,with respect to which a comprehensive statement is necessary requires the weighing of a number of relevant factors,including the extent of the interrelationship among proposed actions and practical considerations of feasibility.resolving these issues requires a high level of technical expertise and is properly left to the informed discretion of the responsible federal agencies.absent a showing by the plaintiffs of arbitrary action,we must assume that nmfs appropriately exercised its discretion by considering the rule alone in this environmental assessment.
tuna label 
in may of,commerce published an initial finding regarding the impact of the intentional encirclement of dolphin in the etp,concluding that there is insufficient evidence that the chase and encirclement by tuna purse seine fishery is having a significant impact on depleted dolphin stocks in the etp.taking of marine mammals incident to commercial fishing operation tuna purse seine vessels in the eastern tropical pacific ocean etp initial finding.may,initial finding the secretary finding that the intentional encirclement of dolphins was not having a significant adverse impact on any depleted stock of dolphin automatically triggered a change in the dolphin safe labeling standard.see d h.the new standard allows tuna products that contain tuna harvested in the etp to carry the dolphin safe mark if the tuna was caught on a vessel that was not capable of deploying purse seine nets on dolphins or if a certification accompanies the product stating that no dolphins were killed or seriously injured during the sets in which the tuna were caught.id.d h.
the secretary initial finding was challenged in the united states district court for the northern district of california,where the district court found that the initial finding was contrary to law and an abuse of the secretary discretion.brower daley,d.in affirming,the ninth circuit stated that,based upon the research conducted by nmfs,all of the evidence indicated that dolphins are adversely impacted by the fishery.brower evans,cir.the court struck down the initial finding,causing the dolphin safe labeling standard to automatically revert to the original standard embodied in h 
plaintiffs argue that the environmental assessment failed to address several problems with the dolphin program.specifically,they contend that the ninth circuit holding in brower is inconsistent with nmfs finding of no significant impact in the environmental assessment.brower,however,interpreted the provisions in g regarding the secretary initial finding requirement and then considered the sufficiency of the secretary initial finding.brower did not address the question involved here,whether nmfs finding that the rule does not pose a significant impact to the affected environment was arbitrary or capricious.
plaintiffs also argue that nmfs prepared the environmental assessment based on fundamentally incorrect assumptions,including the assumption that the dolphin safe labeling standard would change and the assumption that customs would be able to regulate which tuna may properly be imported into the united states.plaintiffs contend that these assumptions are flawed and that the reliability of the environmental assessment is undermined.moreover,plaintiffs argue that these assumptions violate the high quality information and excellent action requirements in plaintiffs,however,fail to establish how these concerns would affect nmfs analysis of the impact on the dolphin populations or how they render the environmental assessment arbitrary.rather,they only support plaintiff contention that consumers will not know whether the tuna they purchase is caught in a manner that is truly safe for dolphin populations.these arguments are not sufficient to render nmfs finding that there is no significant impact to the human environment arbitrary or capricious 
participation by the public,state department,department of treasury,and customs service 
finally,plaintiffs argue that the environmental assessment is flawed because of the lack of public participation in the process and the lack of participation by the state department,department of treasury,customs service specifically,plaintiffs contend that the public should have been given the opportunity to comment on the proposed environmental assessment.
public participation is required by the ceq regulations if the proposed action is without precedent or is similar to an action that normally requires preparation of an environmental impact statement.e.in such cases,an agency must make its proposed finding of no significant impact available for public review thirty days before the agency makes its final determination whether to prepare an environmental impact statement.id.the government argues that the two circumstances requiring public review were not present here.it cites the environmental assessment of regulations that implemented the pacific tunas conventions a
