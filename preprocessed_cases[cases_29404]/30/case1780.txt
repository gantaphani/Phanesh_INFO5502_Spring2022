inyo citizens for better planning icbp petitioned the trial court for a writ of mandate directing inyo county the county,the inyo county board of supervisors the board,the inyo county planning commission the planning commission,and the inyo county planning department the planning department to set aside the county general plan amendment that alters the definition of net acreage gpa,for failure to prepare an environmental impact report eir begin the eir process for the gpa set aside approval of tentative parcel maps tpm,and,for failure to prepare an eir and failure to meet the zoning codes and direct the county to cease processing tpms,and until the court determines if the project complies with the general plan,the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et,and the zoning codes.icbp also requested declaratory and injunctive relief.the trial court denied icbp petitions for writ of mandate requests for declaratory relief and requests for injunctive relief.icbp contends substantial evidence supports a finding that the gpa could have a significant impact on the environment,therefore,the county should have prepared an eir tpms,and do not meet the minimum lot size requirements and eirs should have been prepared for tpms,and.we reverse in part and affirm in part.
factual and procedural history 
the county general plan defined net acreage as the remainder of land left after land devoted to streets,roads,and utilities are deducted from the parcel.the planning department became concerned that the definition of net acreage was confusing and could result in some parcels being rendered too small for development because the phrase devoted to is unclear.essentially,the concern was that property devoted to a utility easement should not have to be deducted from the net acreage calculation because the land was still useable,despite being encumbered by an easement.the planning department recommended that the board alter the definition of net acreage.
the planning department adopted a negative declaration in support of its recommendation that the definition be altered.many citizens of the county opposed the plan to alter the definition of net acreage.in particular,neighbors in an area known as the mclaren ranch subdivision were opposed to altering the definition of net acreage because it would essentially permit three neighbors to move forward with their plans to subdivide their properties.specifically,the mclaren ranch neighbors were opposed to the subdivisions planned in tpms,and.the neighbors were also concerned that more people would begin subdividing their property under the new definition,and that environmental resources,such as water and wildlife,would be adversely impacted.the neighbors asserted that the negative declaration did not adequately anticipate the potential for greater residential growth under the altered definition of net acreage.
the county argued that the general plan,and the eir prepared for the general plan,already anticipated the amount of growth that would be permitted under the altered definition of net acreage because the county always intended net acreage to be interpreted as including easement properties the county was only altering the definition to clarify its longtime policy.in other words,the growth anticipated by the definition of net acreage in the gpa was no greater than the growth anticipated by the definition of net acreage in the general plan,and therefore,a new eir was not required.
on february,the board adopted the negative declaration and approved the altered definition of net acreage in the gpa.the gpa definition of net acreage defined the term as t he remainder of a parcel or piece of property after land dedicated or otherwise encumbered by an easement for a public street or road,including a county road,is deducted from the gross acreage or gross parcel size.the board also approved tpms,and.
discussion 
legal background three step ceqa process 
we begin with a brief background of the ceqa process.
consistent with california strong environmental policy,whenever the approval of a project is at issue,the statute and regulations have established a process to ensure that public agencies inform their decisions with environmental considerations.citations.
threshold determination of ceqa applicability 
the first tier is jurisdictional,requiring that an agency conduct a preliminary review in order to determine whether ceqa applies to a proposed activity.citations.citation.ceqa applies if the activity is a project under the statutory definition,unless the project is exempt.citation.if the agency finds the project is exempt from ceqa under any of the stated exemptions,no further environmental review is necessary.citation.in such cases,the agency may file a notice of ceqa exemption,if it chooses to do so.citations.
if the project is not exempt either because it does not fall within an exempt category or because an exception makes the exemption unavailable then the agency must proceed to the second tier and conduct an initial study.citations.
initial study 
the second tier of the process,the initial study,serves several purposes.one purpose is to inform the choice between a negative declaration and an eir.citations.another of the initial study purposes is to eliminate unnecessary eirs.citation.
ceqa excuses the preparation of an eir and allows the use of a negative declaration when an initial study shows that there is no substantial evidence that the project may have a significant effect on the environment.citations.in certain situations where a straightforward negative declaration is not appropriate,the agency may permit the use of a mitigated negative declaration.citations.
environmental impact report 
if the project does not qualify for a negative declaration,the third step in the process is to prepare a full environmental impact report citations.
the california supreme court has repeatedly recognized that the eir is the heart of ceqa.citation.as the court observed more than three decades ago,since the preparation of an eir is the key to environmental protection under ceqa,accomplishment of the high objectives of that act requires the preparation of an eir whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact.citation.other cases have since confirmed the statutory preference for resolving doubts in favor of an eir.citations.san lorenzo valley community advocates for responsible education san lorenzo valley unified school dist.th,d.
substantial evidence 
icbp contends that substantial evidence supports a finding that the gpa could have a significant impact on the environment,and therefore,the county should have prepared an eir.we agree.
the issue of whether an eir must be prepared is resolved by applying the fair argument test.we have previously described this test as follows under public resources code section,a local agency ordinarily must prepare an eir on any project which may have a significant effect on the environment.citations.conversely,an agency may adopt a negative declaration only if there is no substantial evidence that the project may have a significant effect on the environment.citations.a trial court therefore reviews an agency decision to adopt a negative declaration using the fair argument test.under this test,the agency must prepare an eir whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that a proposed project may have a significant effect on the environment.citations.if such evidence is found,it can not be overcome by substantial evidence to the contrary.citations.the lead agency determination is thus largely legal rather than factual it does not resolve conflicts in the evidence but determines only whether substantial evidence exists in the record to support the prescribed fair argument.citation.the court function is to determine whether substantial evidence supported the agency conclusion as to whether the prescribed fair argument could be made.citation.citations.san bernardino valley audubon society metropolitan water dist.th,d,fn.omitted.if such evidence exists,then the court must set aside the agency decision to adopt a negative declaration as an abuse of discretion in failing to proceed in a manner as required by law.city of redlands county of san bernardino th,d,fn.omitted.
on appeal,the appellate court task is the same as that of the trial court that is,to review the agency actions to determine whether the agency complied with procedures required by law.citation.the appellate court reviews the administrative record independently the trial court conclusions are not binding on it.citations.burrtec waste industries,city of colton th,d,fn.omitted.
the following does not qualify as substantial evidence under ceqa argument,speculation,unsubstantiated opinion or narrative,evidence that is clearly inaccurate or erroneous,or evidence of social or economic impacts that do not contribute to,or are not caused by,physical impacts on the environment.substantial evidence,instead,consists of fact,a reasonable assumption predicated upon fact,or expert opinion supported by fact.city of redlands county of san bernardino,supra,th at,d,fns.omitted.
the bishop creek water association bcwa submitted a letter informing the county that a portion of the area affected by the gpa already experiences problems with low water during months when minimal flows are released in bishop creek.the bcwa believed that the gpa would create an increase in the number of subdivision applications.the bcwa expressed concern that the gpa would result in more water usage,which would have a negative impact on the aquatic resources in the area.further the bcwa assumed that changing the definition of net acreage,to include utility and ditch easements,would further complicate the bcwa ability to control water resources,because it would limit access to irrigation ditches.
in one area affected by the gpa,the mclaren ranch subdivision,residents used the ditches to irrigate the land for farming and ranching.virtually every parcel of property within the mclaren ranch subdivision bordered one or more ditch.the ditches and irrigation ponds were also used by firefighters to control fires in the area.
davis moxley,who owned a department of water and power lease just east of an area that would be impacted by the gpa,expressed concern that the county did not assess the amount of ground water that would be pumped for domestic uses as a result of amending the definition of net acreage.moxley noted that it use d to be common to hit ground water at feet,but today there is no water at sometimes feet.moxley further noted that the acres on the southern end of his lease,which had been grain and green pastures,was now sagebrush and weeds.
jacqueline harris,who lived in an area affected by the gpa,wrote that she and her neighbors accessed water by drilling wells on their properties,and relied on septic systems for wastewater.harris questioned whether it would be possible to design wells and septic systems on properties that had minimal acreage,and whether the impacted area could accommodate new wells.
dennis and phillis reed,who lived in an area affected by the gpa,wrote,several deep chasms have been encountered with recently drilled wells.some of them are over one hundred feet in depth.the reeds expressed concern about wastewater from septic systems crossing with well water,if people were required to drill deeper wells near large chasms.
a special agent for the national park service,with years of experience,submitted a declaration claiming that the change in the definition of net acreage could have an adverse impact on the environment.specifically,the special agent listed a variety of birds that frequented the area affected by the gpa,such as the ruddy ground dove,nuttall woodpecker,and bewick wren,and expressed concern that the diverse birdlife would be adversely affected by increased domestic water usage in the area,because increased residential density would lower ground water levels,reduce open space,and degrade surface waters.
chuck thistlewaite,planning director for the county,told the board in january that a strict interpretation of the general plan definition of net acreage could have countywide implications and virtually place a moratorium on development in every area of the county.
the foregoing evidence showed there were months when water flowing to areas affected by the gpa was very low over the years,the water table had dropped from approximately three feet to approximately five feet a lower water table resulted in a change in plant life,from grass to sagebrush a variety of birds lived in the area affected by the gpa and a strict interpretation of the general plan would not permit most of the building authorized under the gpa.
reasonable assumptions made from these facts were allowing greater residential density might have an adverse impact on water resources strained water resources might adversely affect plant life and bird life and subdivisions and residential building that would not be authorized under the general plan might be permitted under the gpa.
based upon the foregoing evidence and related reasonable assumptions,we conclude that the record contains substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the gpa may have a significant effect on the environment,in particular on water,flora,and fauna.accordingly,we conclude that the county abused its discretion when it determined that there was no substantial evidence that the gpa might have a significant effect on the environment.in other words,the county should have prepared an eir,rather than a negative declaration.
the county contends there is not substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the gpa may have a significant effect on the environment,because the gpa was meant to clarify the net acreage requirement to be interpreted in conformance with inyo county practices.essentially,the county asserts that the definition of net acreage set forth in the gpa is the same definition used in the county general plan however,when the county general plan was published,the definition of net acreage became confusing.the county asserts that it is simply trying to clarify that it still intends to use the definition of net acreage.further,the county contends that since it always intended to use the definition of net acreage,the clarification of this policy would not have a significant environmental impact beyond that already anticipated by the general plan.
the county argument fails because a strict interpretation of the general plan definition of net acreage would not authorize the residential building that may be permitted under the gpa definition of net acreage.accordingly,it is not reasonable to contend that the residential building permitted by the gpa definition of net acreage was always anticipated within the general plan.for example,thistlethwaite told the board that a strict interpretation of the definition of net acreage could have countywide implications and virtually place a moratorium on development in every area of the county.
moreover,on an october,board agenda request form,signed by leslie klusmire,planning director for the county,various options were set forth for the definition of net acreage,such as whether or not to include private driveway easements within the definition.consequently,it does not appear from the record that the change in the definition of net acreage was merely a clarification of existing policies,because the definition was debated and different options were discussed.in sum,the county argument is unpersuasive.
cumulative impact 
icbp contends the negative declaration is deficient because it does not analyze the cumulative impacts to the environment that will result from the gpa.we elect not to discuss this contention because we have concluded ante,that the county should have prepared an eir,rather than a negative declaration.
deficient negative declaration 
icbp contends the county negative declaration was deficient because it did not accurately describe the project,characterizing it as a clarification of existing policy,rather than recognizing the potential impacts for greater residential density it only analyzed the modified definition of net acreage in regard to two zoning des
