opinion on rehearing 
in santa clarita organization for planning the environment county of los angeles th,d scope i,we held that the water service portion of an environmental impact report eir must analyze the actual amount of water that will be available for a project.in scope i,the eir for the west creek residential subdivision did not comply with the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et it relied on contractual entitlements to water.because this water is not of the wet variety,it has been called paper water.
after remand,the county of los angeles county revised and recertified the west creek eir.santa clarita organization for planning the environment scope again challenges the water services portion of the eir.this time,scope focuses on the eir analysis of a water transfer agreement and remediation costs for perchlorate contamination of water wells.the trial court denied scope petition for writ of administrative mandate.
after the trial court denied scope petition,our supreme court decided vineyard area citizens for responsible growth,city of rancho cordova cal th,d,vineyard.vineyard states four principles governing the analysis of the water services portion of an eir.we conclude the west creek eir satisfies all four principles.
background 
in the,the legislature and the voters approved the state water project swp.it was designed to deliver million of water annually.it is managed by the department of water resources dwr.
the dwr contracted to deliver water to water agencies throughout the state.the contracts entitle the agencies to specified amounts of water calculated on the designed capacity of the swp.only half of the swp was constructed.the completion of the swp was an expectation that has not grown beyond a hope.there is no reasonable expectation that the original plan will ever be completed.this leaves a vast difference between the amount of water to which the local agencies are entitled,and the amount of water the swp can actually deliver.
a drought in the highlighted the disparity between water entitlements and actual water.agricultural and urban agencies disputed how shortfalls in water delivery would be allocated.the interested parties met in monterey,and produced the monterey agreement.
under the monterey agreement,the dwr and the contracting water agencies agreed to a statement of principles.one principle provided for the permanent sale of water among agencies.the castaic lake water agency castaic purchased per year afy from the kern county water agency.castaic serves the santa clarita valley area,and the afy constitutes over percent of the afy available to castaic.
the monterey agreement scuttled the term entitlement to describe the amount of water the swp has contracted to deliver to local water agencies.instead,the agreement uses the term table a amount.table a of the agreement lists the contracting agencies and the amount of water the swp has contracted to deliver.the change is not substantive.
in planning conservation league department of water resources th,d pcl,the court ordered the eir for the monterey agreement decertified.the court determined that the eir was prepared by the wrong lead agency,a water agency instead of the dwr,and failed to consider the no project alternative.because the eir for the afy transfer was tiered on the monterey agreement eir,the eir for the transfer was also ordered decertified.friends of santa clara river castaic lake water agency th,d friends.although the eirs for the monterey agreement and the transfer were decertified,the projects were not enjoined.the agreements remain in effect to this day.
on july,the parties to the pcl litigation that decertified the monterey agreement eir entered into a settlement agreement approved by the sacramento county superior court.the settlement agreement requires the dwr as the lead agency to prepare a new eir for the monterey agreement.the settlement agreement acknowledges that certain water transfers listed in attachment e to the settlement agreement are final,and the parties agree not to challenge those transfers.the transfer is not listed in attachment instead,the settlement agreement provides 
acknowledgement and agreement regarding transfer.with respect to the transfer,the parties recognize that such water transfer is subject to pending litigation in the los angeles county superior court following remand from the second district court of appeal see friends of the santa clara river castaic lake water agency,th,d review denied april.the parties agree that jurisdiction with respect to that litigation should remain in that court and that nothing in this settlement agreement is intended to predispose the remedies or other actions that may occur in that pending litigation.
in,castaic certified a revised eir for the transfer.this eir is not tiered on the monterey agreement eir.scope opening brief states that castaic eir is being challenged in los angeles county superior court by environmental groups.
west creek 
west creek is a proposed mixed residential and commercial development in the santa clarita valley area of northern los angeles county.the project includes housing units,square feet of commercial retail space and acres of community facilities.the county served as the lead agency in preparing the eir for the project.the project developers are the newhall land and farming company and valencia corporation hereafter collectively newhall.
scope challenges the county certification of the west creek eir.the trial court denied scope petition for a writ of administrative mandate.we reversed on the ground that the eir evaluation of the availability of the water supply was inadequate.scope i,supra,th,d.the eir relied on water entitlements instead of actual water in analyzing water availability.ibid.
the county revised the water supply analysis,and recertified the eir.scope challenges the water supply analysis in the recertified eir.this time it opposes the afy water transfer.
the recertified eir states that castaic total maximum swp water allocation is afy.the transfer accounts for afy of that.the eir acknowledges that the eir for the monterey agreement and the original eir for the transfer were decertified.
with regard to the status of the transfer,the eir states 
the transfer of swp table a amount was the type of water transfer that fell within the provisions of the monterey agreement.as stated above,under the monterey agreement,certain swp agricultural contractors agreed that af of their table a amount could be transferred to urban contractors.the castaic acquisition was a part of the af of swp table a amount,which has been transferred under the monterey agreement.
the monterey agreement provides for those transfers by the participating swp contractors,thus facilitating transfers of table a amounts from agricultural to urban swp contractors.as stated above,the environmental documentation for the monterey agreement has been decertified.however,the legal proceedings planning and conservation league department of water resources th,d pcl litigation did not invalidate the monterey agreement or enjoin either the monterey agreement or further implementation of the monterey agreement.
in addition,the subsequent settlement agreement in the pcl litigation did not invalidate or otherwise enjoin the monterey agreement.
even in the absence of the monterey agreement,castaic permanent acquisition of an additional af of swp table a amount could occur under existing swp water supply contract provisions,subject to appropriate environmental review.
nothing in the existing swp water supply contracts,or applicable law,prohibit such water transfers with or without the monterey agreement.the monterey agreement simply provides a specific vehicle for accomplishing transfers of swp table a amounts from agricultural to urban swp contractors the amendments under the monterey agreement are not the exclusive means by which that amount may be transferred.in support of that fact,in almost years before the monterey agreement,the entire swp table a amount of the hacienda water district was permanently transferred to the tulare lake basin water storage district,pursuant to an agreement approved by dwr.
the acquisition could proceed as a water transfer under existing law.see,water code,authority for transferring surplus water and water code,et authority for transferring water.the kern county water agency has reaffirmed its willingness to allow transfers of up to af of swp table a amounts under agreement conditions under the terms of the settlement agreement 
finally,castaic is not a party to the pending monterey agreement litigation planning conservation league department of water resources th,d.although not a party,an adverse final judgment invalidating the monterey agreement could affect castaic completed acquisition of the af,which could in turn impair castaic supply of swp water through its contracts with dwr and other swp contractors.nevertheless,castaic believes that an adverse outcome in the monterey agreement litigation is not likely to adversely affect castaic water supplies over the because a castaic believes that such a result is unlikely to unwind executed and completed agreements with respect to the permanent transfer of swp water amounts b existing swp water supply contract provisions allow such transfers without the need for the monterey agreement and c existing law enables castaic to enter into contracts outside the context of the monterey agreement.
the eir also discloses that there is perchlorate contamination in six water wells that will comprise part of the water service for west creek.the eir identifies remediation measures,but does not identify any source of funding for those measures.
discussion 
newhall contends the doctrine of law of the case bars scope transfer arguments.
where an appellate court states in its opinion a principle or rule of law necessary to its decision,that principle or rule becomes the law of the case.clemente state of california cal d.the law of the case must be adhered to both in the lower court and upon subsequent appeal.ibid.this is true even if the court that issued the opinion becomes convinced in a subsequent consideration that the former opinion is erroneous.ibid.
but our former opinion in this case scope i stated no principle or rule of law bearing on the adequacy of the west creek eir discussion of the transfer.newhall attempts to turn silence into positive effect by citing section,subdivision c.the subdivision requires that our opinion discuss all the alleged grounds for noncompliance with ceqa.newhall concludes that because we did not discuss the transfer in scope i,we approved the transfer.
newhall cites no authority,however,for the proposition that not discussing an issue as required by section,subdivision c,transforms that issue into law of the case.in friends,supra,th at page,d,on which newhall relies,after finding one of appellant contentions meritorious,the court expressly stated it considered all of appellant other contentions and found them without merit.ibid.friends does not discuss the effect of a failure to consider an issue,and does not even mention the doctrine of law of the case.if newhall believed we failed to discuss an issue raised in scope i,its remedy was a timely petition for rehearing.cal.rules of court,rule formerly cited as rule.the time for such a petition has long since passed.
moreover,we discussed all issues raised in scope scope mentioned the transfer in its opening brief,but scope did not raise the transfer as an issue.in fact,newhall argued that we could not consider friends,the decision that decertified the transfer eir,because it occurred after the county approved the west creek project.newhall pointed out that once a project is approved,new information does not require reopening the approval.scope i,supra,th at,d.scope replied that it cited friends only to show that swp entitlements can not be taken at face value.ibid.thus,at newhall urging,we did not consider in scope i the issues scope now raises.they arose after the county initial approval of the project.newhall cites no authority that prevents us from considering issues that arose prior to the recertification of the eir 
newhall contends scope waived its perchlorate contamination arguments by failing to appeal them.newhall argues scope claim is waived because it is essentially identical to that denied by the trial court in the first challenge to the project eir.
but scope first challenge to the project eir concerned disclosure of the extent of perchlorate contamination of local water wells.scope did not appeal the trial court denial of that challenge.here scope is not challenging the eir disclosure of the extent of perchlorate contamination.instead,it is challenging the mitigation measures suggested by the eir.that issue is not substantially identical to the issue raised in the first challenge.there has been no waiver.
we now consider scope challenge to the west creek eir.an eir approved by the appropriate governmental agency is presumed adequate,and the party challenging the eir has the burden of showing otherwise.barthelemy chino basin mun.water dist.th,d barthelemy.a party may challenge an eir by showing the agency has abused its discretion either by reaching factual conclusions unsupported by substantial evidence or by failing to proceed in the manner ceqa provides.vineyard,supra,cal th at,d.
in evaluating an eir for ceqa compliance,we must adjust our scrutiny to the nature of the alleged defect.vineyard,supra,cal th at,d.where the alleged defect is that the agency conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence,we must accord deference to the agency factual conclusions.ibid.we may not weigh conflicting evidence to determine who has the better argument.ibid.thus we may not set aside an agency approval of an eir on the ground that an opposite conclusion would have been equally or more reasonable.ibid.
where the alleged defect is that the agency has failed to proceed in a manner provided by ceqa,our review is de novo.vineyard,supra,cal th at,d.an agency that fails to require an applicant to disclose information mandated by ceqa and to include that information in the eir,fails to proceed in a manner prescribed by ceqa.ibid.where a party challenges an eir because it fails to disclose evidence that conflicts with its conclusions,the party must show that the failure to disclose the conflicting evidence precludes informed decision making or informed public participation.barthelemy,supra,th at,d.
scope challenges the adequacy of the eir water supply analysis as it relates to the transfer.
recently,our supreme court in vineyard articulated four principles for analysis of future water supplies under ceqa 
first,ceqa informational purposes are not satisfied by an eir that simply ignores or assumes a solution to the problem of supplying water to a proposed land use project.decision makers must,under the law,be presented with sufficient facts to evaluate the pros and cons of supplying the amount of water that the project will need.citation.vineyard,supra,cal th at,d.
second,an adequate environmental impact analysis for a large project,to be built and occupied over a number of years,can not be limited to the water supply for the first stage or the first few years.while proper tiering of environmental review allows an agency to defer analysis of certain details of later phases of linked or complex projects until those phases are up for approval,ceqa demand for meaningful information is not satisfied by simply stating information will be provided in the future.citation.vineyard,supra,cal th at,d.
third,the future water supplies identified and analyzed must bear a likelihood of actually proving available speculative sources and unrealistic allocations paper water are insufficient bases for decisionmaking under ceqa.citation.an eir for a land use project must address the impacts of likely future water sources,and the eir discussion must include a reasoned analysis of the circumstances affecting the likelihood of the water availability.citation.vineyard,supra,cal th at,d.
finally,where,despite a full discussion,it is impossible to confidently determine that anticipated future water sources will be available,ceqa requires some discussion of possible replacemen
