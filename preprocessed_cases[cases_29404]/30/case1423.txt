before the court are petitions for review of two final rules promulgated by the environmental protection agency regarding the emission of hazardous air pollutants haps from electric utility steam generating units egus.the first rule removes coal and egus from the list of sources whose emissions are regulated under section of the clean air act caa.revision of december regulatory finding delisting rule.the second rule sets performance standards pursuant to section,for new egus and establishes total mercury emissions limits for states and certain tribal areas,along with a voluntary program for new and existing egus.standards of performance for new and existing stationary sources electric utility steam generating units camr.may.
petitioners contend that the delisting rule is contrary to the plain text and structure of section.in response,epa and certain intervenors rely on section n,which sets special conditions before egus can be regulated under section,to justify the rule.we hold that the delisting was unlawful.section requires epa to regulate emissions of haps.section n requires epa to regulate egus under section when it concludes that doing so is appropriate and necessary.in december,epa concluded that it was appropriate and necessary to regulate mercury emissions from coal and power plants under section and listed these egus as sources of haps regulated under that section.in,after reconsidering its previous determination,epa purported to remove these egus from the section list.thereafter it promulgated camr under section.epa removal of these egus from the section list violates the caa because section c requires epa to make specific findings before removing a source listed under section epa concedes it never made such findings.because egus are listed sources under section,regulation of existing egus mercury emissions under section is prohibited,effectively invalidating camr regulatory approach.accordingly,the court grants the petitions and vacates both rules.
in,congress added section to the caa,a,stat.in its original form,section required epa to list haps that should be regulated because they could cause,or contribute to,an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible or incapacitating reversible illness.id.a.over the next eighteen years,however,epa listed only eight haps,established standards for only seven of these and as to these seven addressed only a limited selection of possible pollution sources.see mining ass epa,comm.on env t pub.works,clean air act amendments of,at,reprinted in.
in,congress,concerned about the slow pace of epa regulation of haps,altered section by eliminating much of epa discretion in the process.see,lime ass epa.three aspects of the amendments are relevant here.
first,congress required epa to regulate more than one hundred specific haps,including mercury and nickel compounds.caa b.further,epa was required to list and to regulate,on a prioritized schedule,id.e,all categories and subcategories of major sources and areas sources that emit one or more haps,id.c.in seeking to ensure that regulation of haps reflects the maximum reduction in emissions which can be achieved by application of the best available control technology,at,reprinted in at see,caa g a,congress imposed specific,strict pollution control requirements on both new and existing sources of haps.congress specified that new sources must adopt at minimum the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source,as determined by the administrator.id.d.existing sources with certain exceptions must adopt emission controls equal to the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing percent of the existing sources.id.d a.
second,congress restricted the opportunities for epa and others to intervene in the regulation of hap sources.for haps that result in health effects other than cancer,as is true of mercury,congress directed that the administrator may delete any source category from the section c list only after determining that emissions from no source in the category or subcategory concerned exceed a level which is adequate to protect public health with an ample margin of safety and no adverse environmental effect will result from emissions from any source.id.c.third parties may not challenge the administrator decision to add a pollutant to the list under section b or a source category or subcategory to the list under section c until the administrator issues emission standards for such pollutant or category.id.e.
third,congress required the administrator to evaluate regulatory options with care and to meet certain conditions before listing egus as an hap source under section c.specifically 
t he administrator shall perform a study of the hazards to public health reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of emissions by egus of pollutants listed under subsection b of this section after imposition of the requirements of this chapter.the administrator shall report the results of this study to the congress within years after november.the administrator shall develop and describe in the administrator report to congress alternative control strategies for emissions which may warrant regulation under this section.the administrator shall regulate egus under this section,if the administrator finds such regulation is appropriate and necessary after considering the results of the study required by this subparagraph.
id.n a emphasis added.
the study of public health hazards required by section n a was finally completed in.this study found a plausible link between anthropogenic releases of mercury from industrial and combustion sources in the united states and methylmercury in fish and that mercury emissions from egus may add to the existing environmental burden.epa,office of air quality planning and standards,study of hazardous air pollutant emissions from util.steam generating report to cong.on december,the administrator light of the study mandated by section n a,as well as subsequent information and consideration of alternative feasible control it was appropriate and necessary to regulate coal and egus under section because,as relevant,mercury emissions from egus,which are the largest domestic source of mercury emissions,present significant hazards to public health and the environment.regulatory finding on the emissions of hazardous air pollutants from electric utility steam generating units,determination.as a result the source category for coal and egus was added to the list of source categories under section c on december.national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants revision of source category list under section of the clean air act notice of listing.
in early,epa proposed two regulatory alternatives to control emissions from coal and egus.the first was similar to epa proposal in under section through issuance of maximum achievable control technology standards,see,caa g a,or implementation of a system.the second proposed removing egus from the list of hap sources prepared pursuant to section c and instead regulating their emissions under section proposed national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants and,in the alternative,proposed standards of performance for new and existing stationary sources electric utility steam generating units.after receiving public comment,epa chose the second alternative,announcing in march that it was removing egus from the section c list,delisting rule.at,and regulating mercury emissions from egus under section,camr.at.
epa justified its decision to delist egus by explaining that it reasonably interprets section n a as providing authority to remove coal and units from the section c list at any time that it makes a negative appropriate and necessary finding under the section.delisting rule.at.it based this interpretation on the entirely different structure and predicate for assessing whether egus should be listed for regulation under section as set forth in section n a,and on the absence of a temporal deadline for deciding whether regulation of egus was appropriate and necessary under section,id.at.it also interpreted section c delisting criteria not to a
