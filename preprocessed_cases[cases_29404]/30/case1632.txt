introduction 
in this matter we must determine whether a nonstandard excess third party liability policy issued by ace property casualty insurance company ace to the county of san diego county affords indemnity coverage for expenses incurred by the county in responding to an administrative agency order requiring it to remediate environmental contamination,and for sums expended by the county to settle related third party property damage claims outside the context of a lawsuit.
in certain underwriters at lloyd of london superior court cal th,d,powerine i,we held that under the wording of the standard primary comprehensive general liability cgl policy,the term damages limits the insurer indemnification obligation to money ordered by a court,a money judgment entered against the insured in a third party suit for damages.id.at,d.we went on to conclude that the duty to indemnify does not extend to the costs of complying with a governmental agency environmental cleanup and abatement orders because such administratively imposed liabilities do not constitute money ordered by a court.id.at,d.
the central insuring provision in the policy at issue here likewise obligates ace to indemnify the county for all sums the insured becomes obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law for damages resulting from the destruction or loss of use of tangible property.the trial court concluded that the term damages is controlling and limits the indemnification obligation in the policy to money judgments in the same way this court concluded the term circumscribes the scope of coverage under the standard primary cgl policy examined in powerine i.the court of appeal agreed with the trial court reasoning and affirmed its judgment.for reasons to follow,we agree with the lower courts interpretation of the operative term damages in ace nonstandard policy.accordingly,we shall affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
we reach a contrary conclusion in another decision also filed oil company,superior court central national insurance company of omaha,cal th,d,powerine ii because the literal insuring language of the policies at issue in that case is materially different from the insuring language in the ace excess policy and the standard primary cgl policy considered in powerine 
factual and procedural background 
the county as appealed from a judgment entered against it after the trial court granted the summary adjudication and summary judgment motions of ace the county contended that the trial court misinterpreted ace nonstandard excess third party liability policy as not providing coverage for the county settlements of nonlitigated claims,including an administrative order to remediate groundwater contamination and third party property damage claims arising from the contamination.specifically,the county asserted that the trial court erred by applying powerine i,supra,cal th,d,in which this court held that the term damages in the insuring clause of the standard cgl policy is limited to money ordered by a court.id.at,d.
the ace policy here in issue is commonly referred to in insurance industry parlance as a nonstandard or manuscript form policy.see croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group.it was in effect from through.the policy requires ace to indemnify the county for all sums which the insured is obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law or assumed under contract or agreement,arising from damages caused by personal injuries or the destruction or loss of use of tangible property.additional pertinent policy provisions are set forth and discussed in detail below.
the following factual background was set forth in the opinion of the court of appeal.in the county began operating a solid waste facility known as the ramona landfill.the ramona landfill overlies potable groundwater,and in the regional water quality control board regional water board imposed operational requirements on the county.
in march,the regional water board issued a cleanup and abatement order to the county,requiring it to investigate,monitor and remediate groundwater contamination caused by the ramona landfill.the county waived a hearing before the board to challenge imposition of the remedial cleanup order.
in june,the owners of property the sossamans near the ramona landfill complained to the county that groundwater contamination would affect the property marketability and their physical and mental health.the sossamans requested that the county purchase their property without the necessity of litigation.the county believed it more likely than not that the sossamans property was contaminated.it had the property appraised and preliminary negotiations including the preparation of necessary transfer documentation were initiated.the atkinsons,also property owners near the ramona landfill,filed a similar claim in.
in november,the county settled the sossamans claims by paying them for the acquisition of their property and relocation benefits.in december,the county settled the atkinsons claims by paying them for the acquisition of their property and relocation benefits.
in may,the county began seeking indemnification from ace for costs of complying with the remedial cleanup order.ace reserved its right to deny coverage on numerous grounds,including the absence of any third party lawsuit.in september,the county began seeking indemnification from ace for the sossaman and atkinson claims.regarding these claims,none of the correspondence between the county and ace is included in the appellate record.ace never indemnified the county for any of the settlements.
the county then filed a against ace in a declaratory relief action brought against the county by another of its insurers,pacific indemnity company the county first amended included causes of action for declaratory relief,express indemnity,breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.in the breach of contract cause of action,the county alleged ace breached its duty to indemnify the county for losses it incurred in complying with the regional water board remedial cleanup order and in settling the sossaman and atkinson claims.in its cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,the county alleged,among other things,that ace failed to attempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt,fair and equitable settlement of the county claims for indemnification although liability had become reasonably clear and failed to pay indemnification benefits to the county pursuant to said claims.
in an affirmative defense to the,ace alleged it had no duty to indemnify the county for costs incurred in complying with the remedial cleanup order or settling the sossaman and atkinson claims because the controlling term damages in the insuring clause of the policy limited coverage to money judgments imposed against the insured in a court of law.the county moved for summary adjudication on this affirmative defense.the trial court initially granted the county motion,determining that the language of the policy suggests a reasonable interpretation that the county need not suffer a judgment before ace duty to indemnify takes effect.
ace moved for reconsideration of the ruling on the county motion for summary adjudication,based on the decision in powerine i,supra,cal th,d.on the same ground,ace also moved for summary adjudication of its duty to indemnify the county for its costs and expenses of complying with the regional water board remedial cleanup order.on reconsideration,the trial court reversed its ruling and denied the county motion for summary adjudication.the court then granted ace motion for summary adjudication of its duty to indemnify the county for the costs and expenses of complying with the remedial cleanup order.the court determined that despite the nonstandard nature of the ace policy,under powerine i,supra,cal th,d,ace duty of indemnity was limited to damages imposed in a court suit,money ordered by a court.id.at,d.
the county in turn moved for reconsideration of the trial court order granting ace motion for summary adjudication.ace countered with a motion for summary judgment on the question whether it had a duty to indemnify the county for the costs of the sossaman and atkinson settlements.the trial court denied the county motion for reconsideration and granted ace summary judgment motion,explaining t here is no duty to indemnify the county for the private property expenses purchase and moving expenses because they were not money ordered by a court.judgment was entered for ace in july.
the court of appeal affirmed the trial court judgment,determining that the motions for summary adjudication and summary judgment were properly granted in the insurer favor.the court held that under this court decision in powerine i,supra,cal th,d,the term damages in the insuring provisions of ace policy limits the duty to indemnify to money judgments ordered by a court,and that although certain other policy terms make reference to the settlement of claims,the policy language read as a whole does not extend the indemnification obligation to the costs and expenses of settlement of claims.
we granted the county petition for review.amicus curiae briefs in support of the county have been filed by the california state association of counties,united policyholders,and the california cast metals association.amicus curiae briefs in support of ace have been filed by the complex insurance claims litigation association and the london market insurers.
discussion 
standard of review and rules of insurance policy interpretation 
the issue before both the trial court and court of appeal was one of law the interpretation of the indemnification obligation under the nonstandard policy language of the policy issued to the county by ace.when determining whether a particular policy provides a potential for coverage,we are guided by the principle that interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.aiu ins.superior court cal d.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.
as explained in powerine ii,supra,cal th at pages,d,
the insurer is entitled to summary adjudication that no potential for indemnity exists if the evidence establishes as a matter of law that there is no coverage.citation.we apply a de novo standard of review to an order granting summary judgment when,on undisputed facts,the order is based on the interpretation or application of the terms of an insurance policy.smith kandal real estate continental casualty th,d see powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.
in reviewing de novo a superior court summary adjudication order in a dispute over the interpretation of the provisions of a policy of insurance,the reviewing court applies settled rules governing the interpretation of insurance contracts.we reiterated those rules in our decision in national union fire ins.cal th,d,
while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.bank of the west superior court cal th,d,see aiu ins.superior court cal d at.the fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.aiu,supra,cal d at.if contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d,supra,cal th at,d.
a policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th at,d,bay cities paving grading,lawyers mutual ins.cal th,d.the fact that a term is not defined in the policies does not make it ambiguous.bay cities paving grading,lawyers mutual ins,supra,cal th at,d,bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d,castro fireman fund american life ins.d.nor does d isagreement concerning the meaning of a phrase,or the fact that a word or phrase isolated from its context is susceptible of more than one meaning.castro fireman fund american life ins,supra,d at.l anguage in a contract must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole,and in the circumstances of that case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted.if an asserted ambiguity is not eliminated by the language and context of the policy,courts then invoke the principle that ambiguities are generally construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist,the insurer in order to protect the insured reasonable expectation of coverage.la jolla beach tennis club,industrial indemnity cal th,d,supra,cal th at,d.powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d.
the ace policy language and this court decisions in,powerine i,and powerine ii 
the county argued in the court of appeal that the trial court erred in determining,under this court holding in powerine i,supra,cal th,d,that the term damages in the insuring agreement of the ace policy limits indemnity coverage to money judgments against the insured 
as noted,in powerine i we held that the insurer duty to indemnify the insured for all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages under the standard cgl insurance policy is limited to money ordered by a court.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.we based this conclusion in part on what we termed syllogism.ibid.several years earlier,in,supra,cal th,d,this court held that the insurer duty to defend the insured in a suit seeking damages under the wording of the same standard cgl policy is likewise limited to civil suits prosecuted in court.id.at,d.in the analysis that followed in powerine i,we explained that the insurer obligation to indemnify for damages is limited to money ordered by a court,in part because the provisions in the standard cgl policy imposing both a duty to defend and a duty to indemnify on the insurer each link damages to a suit,a civil action prosecuted in a court.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.
here,however,the ace nonstandard third party liability policy is an excess policy providing the county as the insured with excess liability coverage over and above its program or a retention arrangement for any part of the underlying limits of liability.ace nonstandard excess policy does not contain a duty to defend suits.accordingly,the syllogism is not directly implicated in this case.
however,the scope of the indemnification obligation under this policy remains governed by our holding in powerine i.the central insuring language of the ace policy obligates ace to indemnify the county for all sums which the county is obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law or assumed under contract or agreement for damages by reason of injury of any nature sustained by any person or persons and damages because of injury to or destruction of tangible property.italics added.the court of appeal below correctly concluded that the reasoning of our decision in powerine i regarding the limitation the term damages imposes on the scope of indemnity coverage under the standard cgl policy applies perforce to the insuring provisions of this nonstandard excess insurance policy which,like the standard cgl policy considered in powerine i,utilizes damages as the sole term of limitation of the indemnity obligation under the insuring agreement.
as we observed in powerine i,the duty to indemnify entails the payment of money transport indemnity cal th at,d,accord,buss superior court cal th at,d,has as its purpose to resolve liability after liability is established transport indemnity,supra,cal th at,d,italics added,and can arise only after damages are fixed in their amount see transport indemnity,supra,cal th at,d,buss superior court,supra,cal th at,d.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,some italics omitted.
we explained further in powerine i why the term damages in the policy provision imposing the duty to indemnify,both in its legal and commonly understood or ordinary and popular sense,is limited to money ordered by a court separate and apart from the deductive reasoning of syllogism.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.it is limited to money judgments in part because within the legal and broader culture,harm exists traditionally outside of court citations,whereas d amages exist traditionally inside of court.citations.id.at,d.we observed that inclusion of the term damages in the insuring agreement of the standard cgl policy precluded a finding that a broad right to indemnification outside the context of a lawsuit was intended under the policy language o ne would not speak of any sum that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages apart from any order by a court.that is because,as a sum that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay,damages presuppose an institution for their ordering,traditionally a court,albeit no longer exclusively.citations.damages do not constitute a redundancy to a sum that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay,but a limitation thereof.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
the county argues that the definition of ultimate net loss contained in the limits of liability provision of the ace policy,when read together with the central insuring language,creates an independent basis for extending the insurer indemnification obligation under the policy beyond damages to the costs and expenses of responding to administratively issued environmental cleanup orders or settling related third party liability claims outside the context of a lawsuit.
the language on which the county relies is contained in the policy limits of liability provision,which in turn makes reference to a definition of ultimate net loss.the provision reads as follows 
limits of liability liability under this policy shall attach to the company only after the named insured has paid or has been liable to pay,the full amount of its respective ultimate net loss liabilities as follows 
each occurrence 
annual aggregate 
personal injury or property damage or personal injury and property damage combined 
a nd the company shall then be liable to pay only such additional amounts as will provide the insured with a total coverage under the policy whatever portion of coverage is by the named insured,and this policy combined of 
each occurrence combined single limit for personal injury or property damage 
it is hereby agreed that should the named insured utilize a program or a retention arrangement for any part of the underlying limits of liability,then the named insured salaried employees or their designee shall be used as adjusters on behalf of the named insured.it is further agreed that all legal matters concerning claims under this policy in excess of any portion of underlying coverage shall be coordinated through a firm or person mutually agreed upon.italics added.
ultimate net loss in turn is defined in the policy as the sum or sums which the assured shall become legally obligated to pay in settlement or satisfaction of claims,suits or judgments includ ing all expenses from the investigation,negotiation and settlement of claims and shall include legal costs.
a similar argument was raised by the insured in powerine ii,supra,cal th,d.in that decision,we have concluded that the literal wording of the central insuring agreement and incorporated definition of ultimate net loss in nine policies issued to the insured over the course of years did unambiguously extend the indemnification obligation under those policies beyond damages,a money judgment against the insured,to the expenses or liability of administratively imposed environmental response costs outside the context of a court suit.powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d.
the court of appeal that authored the now superseded opinion in powerine ii agreed with the insured reading of the indemnification obligation under the nine standard form policies therein concerned.the court of appeal in this case had before it for consideration the published decision of the court of appeal in powerine ii,as review in that matter had not yet been granted as of the time the court of appeal filed its decision in this case.the court of appeal below expressly considered and distinguished the policy language at issue in powerine ii from the policy language at issue in this case.
there are several key distinctions between the central insuring provision and incorporated definition of ultimate net loss in the standard policies at issue in powerine ii,and the central insuring provision and referenced definition of ultimate net loss found in this nonstandard third party liability policy.
first,the term expenses was expressly contained in the central insuring clause of the policies at issue in powerine ii the company hereby agrees to indemnify the insured for all sums which the insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the insured by law for damages,direct or consequential and expenses,all as more fully defined by the term ultimate net loss on account of property damage caused by or arising out of each occurrence covered hereunder italics added.powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d.in contrast,the term expenses is not found in the central insuring provision of the ace obligation to indemnify extends only to all sums which the insured is obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law or assumed under contract or agreement for damages resulting from personal injuries or the destruction or loss of use of tangible property.
second,the central insuring provision of the standard policies at issue in powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d,expressly purports to more fully define damages,direct or consequential and expenses through incorporation of a definition of ultimate net loss into the insuring clause itself.in contrast,the definition of ultimate net loss here is neither incorporated into,referenced,nor a part of the central insuring clause of the ace policy.instead,as explained,it is referenced in the limits of liability policy provision,the main function of which appears to be the setting forth of limits of excess liability coverage over the insured program or a retention arrangement for any part of the underlying limits of liability.in that specific context,the definition of ultimate net loss merely serves to define the insured total loss that will count toward such policy limits.insurance policies are written in two parts an insuring agreement which defines the type of risks being covered,and exclusions,which remove coverage for certain risks which are initially within the insuring clause.rosen nations title ins.th,d.nothing in the limits of liability provision of the ace policy purports to expand ace indemnification obligation,once triggered,to anything other than damages.
these two distinctions were not lost on the court of appeal below,which court,in the course of rejecting the county argument for an expansive construction of indemnity coverage under the ace policy,distinguished the policy language in powerine ii when observing,in contrast to powerine ii,the ace policy insuring clause does not include the term expenses to broaden the coverage beyond that provided by the word damages.further,the insuring clause does not define the term damages by reference to the ultimate net loss provisions,in which the references to the settlement or satisfaction of claims appears.
finally,the ace policy contains a provision.as the court of appeal below explained,t he ace policy provides that n o action shall lie against the company unless,as a condition precedent thereto,the amount of the insured obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the insured after actual trial or by written agreement of the insured,the claimant and the company.the ace policy also provides that the county shall not,except at its own cost,voluntarily make any payment,assume any obligation or incur any expense other than for such immediate medical and surgical relief to others as shall be imperative at the time of the occurrence.conditions such as these ordinarily appear in policies including the duty to defend,and they are intended to invest the insurer with the right to control the defense and preclude collusion between the insured and the third party claimant.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra.these conditions belie the notion that the term damages in the ace policy extends the indemnity duty to any settlement entered into by the county.
