the southwest center for biological diversity and the sierra club collectively southwest challenge the legality of the department of energy doe sale of elk hills to occidental petroleum occidental.southwest contends the doe violated section of the endangered species act esa,et,by refusing to engage in consultation with the fish wildlife service fws prior to completing the sale of elk hills and by failing to ensure that the sale would not jeopardize the continued existence of threatened and endangered species.in granting summary judgment in favor of the doe and occidental,the district court determined that the completed sale of elk hills mooted the controversy.alternatively,the district court determined that the doe did not violate section of the esa.
we have jurisdiction under.we conclude that the completion of the elk hills sale did not moot the controversy between the parties.we further conclude that congress waived section consultation requirement as to the doe sale of elk hills.see national defense authorization act of,stat.accordingly,we affirm the district court summary judgment by which it concluded that the doe did not violate section of the esa.
elk hills,which is also referred to as national petroleum reserve is a tract of approximately acres of land located miles south of bakersfield,california.it is known to contain at least four endangered species and one endangered plant,and is the seventh largest oil field in the united states.as far back as,congress directed the secretary of energy to explore and develop elk hills at the maximum efficient rate of production see naval petroleum reserves production act of,c.pursuant to that direction and consistent with section of the esa,the doe has consulted with the fws three times since it took over operations at elk hills.these consultations have enabled the fws to evaluate the impact on protected species of the doe operation at elk hills and to suggest ways to minimize incidental takings of these species.
after the most recent consultation,the fws issued a biological opinion letter dated november.the fws concluded that continuing oil and gas development of elk hills at the maximum efficient rate would not likely jeopardize the continued existence of listed species if the doe agreed to various mitigation measures.the doe agreed to these measures,and they became part of the incidental take statement issued by the fws that statement authorized the doe to incidentally kill or harm a specified number of listed species and adversely affect a specified amount of habitat.to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the incidental take statement,section a provides 
prior to the sale of,the department shall initiate and complete a subsequent section consultation as to this federal action and the reasonable and prudent measures and terms and conditions shall be adhered to by the subsequent owner until a section a b permit and cdfg permit are issued for their actions.in addition,as part of the subsequent section consultation,the department shall enter into a conservation agreement with the service if the conservation area has not been established.
on february,congress passed the national defense authorization act of daa,which directed the doe to sell elk hills within two years of the statute effective date.see national defense authorization act of,a,stat.section d of the daa granted special permission for the doe to transfer the incidental take statement in place on the statute effective date if the doe determined such a transfer was necessary to expedite the sale in a manner that maximized the sale value to the united states.the transferred statement would cover the identical activities,and be subject to the same terms and conditions,as apply to the permit at the time of the transfer.id.at d,stat,
a few months later,the fws informed the doe that both section of the esa and the incidental take statement required the doe to reinitiate consultation regarding the proposed sale of elk hills.the doe declined to reinitiate consultation,relying in part on the department of interior regional solicitor opinion that the daa obviated the doe consultation obligations relating to the elk hills sale.
in october,the doe accepted a purchase offer from occidental,which agreed to accept a transfer of the biological opinion and incidental take statement.occidental also acknowledged that the incidental take statement authorization applied only to the extent occidental acted as contemplated in the biological opinion.the sale of elk hills to occidental closed february.
prior to the closing of the sale,southwest and other plaintiffs filed suit against the doe and sought a preliminary injunction to stop the sale.occidental intervened.the district court denied the injunction,and this court denied the plaintiffs request for an emergency stay during the pendency of the appeal.that appeal was later dismissed as moot.
the district court subsequently granted occidental motion for summary judgment.the district court held that the completion of the elk hills sale mooted the plaintiffs claims.alternatively,the district court determined that the doe had not violated its substantive or procedural duties under section of the esa.this appeal of the district court summary judgment followed.
occidental contends the completion of the elk hills sale rendered the plaintiffs complaint moot.mootness,a question of law,is reviewed de novo.see alaska ctr.for the environment united states forest,cir.generally,an action is mooted when the issues presented are no longer live and therefore the parties lack a legally cognizable interest for which the courts can grant a remedy.id.the party asserting mootness has the heavy burden of establishing that there is no effective relief remaining for a court to provide.see united states dist.for the northern dist.of,cir.occidental has failed to carry this heavy burden.
generally,the mere conveyance of property to another does not moot a dispute regarding the legality of the conveyance.see muckleshoot indian tribe united states forest,cir.in muckleshoot,the forest service entered into a land exchange agreement with weyerhaeuser,a private corporation.before the agreement was finalized,an indian tribe filed suit against the forest service,asserting claims under various environmental statutes.the district court denied the plaintiff claims,and the plaintiff failed to seek a stay of the order pending appeal.on appeal,weyerhaeuser argued the dispute was moot because the land exchange,which involved the transfer of patents and deeds,had been completed it had obtained a state logging permit and it had already logged approximately ten percent of the land acquired through the exchange.see id.at.we concluded that the evidence established only that the property transfer had occurred,which was insufficient to establish mootness.id.at.we explained t he fact that weyerhaeuser may have destroyed a portion of the land does not alter the ability of the government to accept a reassignment of the property,if required.id.emphasis added.
in this case,occidental argues the appeal is moot because the status quo can not be restored.occidental contends that the doe lacks the practical means to resume oil and gas operations at elk hills if the sale were rescinded because government,contractor and subcontractor personnel have been replaced by occidental employees.many of these employees have been transferred to elk hills from facilities outside california.moreover,in reliance on the sale,occidental has executed contracts with more than one hundred suppliers and purchasers.additionally,if the court were to order rescission,the doe would have to return the billion purchase price and reinitiate bidding for a contractor who could resume operations at elk hills on behalf of the government.finally,kern county,california has amended its general plan to encompass the use of elk hills for private oil and gas production activities.occidental concludes that rescission of the sale would cause major disruption and turmoil for both occidental and the doe.
occidental relies on american horse protection ass n,watt,cir and dan caputo russian river county sanitation,cir.in american horse,the plaintiffs sought to enjoin an interim wild horse roundup that was scheduled to occur prior to the filing of an environmental impact statement.the district court declined to enter either an injunction or a stay pending appeal.while the appeal was pending,the roundup was completed.we determined that the appeal was moot because the roundup was complete and w e can not order its effects undone.american horse protection ass n,at.in dan caputo,we concluded that the plaintiff attempt to enjoin certain construction was moot because the construction had been completed during the pendency of the appeal.dan caputo,at.
occidental reliance on american horse and dan caputo is misplaced.neither of these cases compel the conclusion that southwest request for relief is moot.unlike the completed construction at issue in dan caputo,a sale of property can generally be undone.in american horse,the harm was the actual roundup of the wild horses.once the roundup was completed,simply releasing the horses would not remedy that harm.by contrast,in the present case,the alleged harm to the environment and protected species could be ameliorated or avoided through a rescission of the contract.
this court retains broad discretion to fashion equitable remedies.see serv.international longshoremen warehousemen union,cir explaining that in deciding a mootness issue,the question is not whether the precise relief sought at the time the application for an injunction was filed is still available,but whether there can be any effective relief.under the administrative procedure act apa,we have the authority to order rescission of the sale if we determine that the doe acted in excess of statutory authority or without observance of the procedures required by law.see.additionally,both parties to the elk hills sale are before the court,which obviates concerns about the fairness of rescission to unrepresented parties.see burbank group goldschmidt,cir finding the group challenge to a completed sale was not moot because all parties to the sale were before the court,which would permit a rescission of the sale see also jones sec.a fter a defendant has been notified of the pendency of a suit seeking an injunction against him,even though a temporary injunction be not granted,he acts at his peril and subject to the power of the court to restore the status,wholly irrespective of the merits as they may be ultimately decided.
although occidental has raised several practical considerations which counsel against rescission,none of these considerations affects the doe ability to accept reassignment of elk hills.see national forest preservation group butz,cir describing as nonsense the defendant argument that the completion of the sale of national forest land during the pendency of the litigation placed the legality of the sale beyond the court jurisdiction.the significant,practical difficulties identified by occidental are more appropriately considered when weighing the equities of any particular remedy.see national wildlife fed espy,cir explaining that when deciding whether to grant injunctive or declaratory relief under the apa,the court must weigh the competing claims of injury and the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.for these reasons,we reject occidental contention and the district court holding that the issues raised by southwest are moot.we next address the merits of these issues.
southwest argues the doe,by failing to reinitiate consultation with the fws prior to the sale of elk hills,violated both the procedural and substantive provisions of section of the esa.the district court rejected this argument and granted summary judgment in favor of the doe and occidental.we review de novo a grant of summary judgment.see harris harris hart,cir.an administrative decision involving the esa will be set aside if the agency action was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law or if the action is found to be without observance of the procedure required by law.see natural resources defense council houston,cir,cert.denied sub nom.lower tule river irrigation dist.natural resources defense council,d.
consultation under section 
federal agencies are required to ensure that any agency action authorized,funded,or carried out by the agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species.see a.negotiating and executing contracts constitute agency action under the esa.see houston,at.an agency action is likely to jeopardize a protected species if the action reasonably would be expected to cause an appreciable reduction in the likelihood of the survival and recovery of a protected species by reducing the reproduction,numbers or distribution of that species.see.
before initiating any agency action in areas containing protected species,the agency must independently determine whether its action may affect a protected species or its habitat or initiate a formal consultation with the service having jurisdiction over the,the fws see houston,at.if the agency determines its proposed action may affect protected species or habitat,the agency is required to initiate formal consultation.see a.an agency may avoid formal consultation only when it has determined the proposed action is unlikely to adversely affect the protected species or habitat and the fws concurs with that determination.see b.
after consultation,the fws issues a biological opinion evaluating the nature and extent of the likely effect on the protected species.if the fws concludes the proposed action is likely to jeopardize a protected species,it must outline reasonable and prudent alternatives which would avoid jeopardy.see b a.the fws then issues an incidental take statement,which specifies the impact of the incidental taking on the species,describes any reasonable measures which are necessary to minimize the impact,and sets forth the terms and conditions that must be complied with by the agency to implement those measures.see id.at b.any subsequent taking of the species that is in compliance with these terms and conditions is not prohibited.although the agency is technically free to disregard the biological opinion,it does so at the risk of incurring civil and criminal penalties,including imprisonment.see bennett spear,d the service itself is,to put it mildly,keenly aware of the virtually determinative effect of its biological opinions.the esa substantive goal of protecting endangered species is served by these explicit procedural requirements.see houston,at.
defense authorization act 
southwest argues the doe violated the procedural provisions of the esa by failing to consult with the fws regarding the elk hills sale.the doe responds that the daa,which permitted the transfer of the doe incidental take statement to occidental,excused the doe from reinitiating consultation with the fws.
repeal of legislation by implication is disfavored.see morton mancari,d t he only permissible justification for a repeal by implication is when the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable.environmental defense ctr.babbitt,cir holding that an appropriations rider which temporarily removed the funds available for the secretary to carry out a statutory duty under the esa did not repeal this statutory duty,but only restricted the secretary ability to comply with the duty.to determine whether congress intended the daa to repeal or modify the doe consultation obligations under the esa,we focus on the language of the statute.id.to the extent this language is ambiguous,we consider the relevant legislative history.id.
the daa requires the secretary of energy secretary to enter into a contract for the sale of elk hills within two years of the statute effective date.see national defense authorization act of,a,stat.to accomplish this directive,the secretary is required to publish,within two months of the effective date,a notice of intent to sell elk hills.see id.at c,stat.within seven months of the effective date,the secretary and the director of the office of management and budget omb must establish a mi
