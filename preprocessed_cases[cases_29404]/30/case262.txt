opinion of the court 
thomas chau chau appeals the sentence imposed by the district court,contending that there was error in the application of several enhancements.we vacate the sentence and remand for a new sentencing.
this case arises out of an ultimately unlawful attempt to deal with a common problem facing many property.in,chau purchased the former drexel school building from the school district of pennsylvania.chau had no idea that the building contained asbestos.the building sat vacant for the next eleven or twelve years.during that time,chau unsuccessfully attempted to sell the property.in the meantime,he apparently suffered financial and physical setbacks that led him to declare bankruptcy.
things looked brighter when,in,chau received an offer for the building from a social service organization that wanted to renovate it into a nursing home for senior citizens.as part of the deal,chau needed to get a zoning permit for the building to permit its use as a nursing home.in late july,in preparation for the zoning inspection,chau asked james fantom,his handyman for fifteen years,to help him clean up the building.fantom referred chau to vincent turner,who agreed to help.turner cleaned up the building by removing insulation that had fallen to the floor or was peeling off the walls,ceiling,and pipes throughout the building.turner placed the refuse in unmarked trash bags.chau would assist turner in loading these trash bags into chau truck and then dumping these bags in a vacant lot in philadelphia.
on or about july,a city inspector for philadelphia air management services ams went to the building to investigate a tip that chau was illegally removing asbestos from the building and that trash bags were on the curb.the inspector found some opened trash bags in front of the building.he observed certain air cell pipes in the bags that he suspected might contain asbestos.the inspector collected samples of the insulation around the air cell pipes the pipe wrap for testing.then,he covered the bags and marked them danger.later that day,the inspector met with chau at a hearing before the philadelphia zoning board and arranged for an inspection to be held on july.the inspector instructed chau that the trash bags had to be removed from the streets because they might contain asbestos.chau complied by placing the bags inside the building.
during the week of july through july,chau continued to ready the building for the zoning inspection by getting turner to sweep and clean up the insulation.because the cleanup was taking too long,chau asked fantom to help.fantom agreed.during the evening,chau,turner,and fantom would load trash bags filled with debris into chau truck and dump them along a roadside in philadelphia.
on july,ams received a tip that asbestos had been illegally removed from the building over the weekend and dumped somewhere in the city.a civil search warrant for the building was obtained and executed by the city inspector.during the search,asbestos contamination was detected near the pipe risers on the first,second and third floors.the inspector posted an asbestos warning on the front door and had the locks changed.
subsequently,on july,the previously scheduled inspection took place.additional asbestos was found in the basement area.chau wife was notified of the asbestos violations and she was informed that only a certified asbestos contractor could clean up and remove the asbestos.chau was instructed to let no one enter the building.the inspector also gave her the keys to the building before he left.on august,chau was personally served with city notices of violations.he was instructed to keep the building sealed.
on september,the city of philadelphia filed a civil complaint and a motion for preliminary injunction against chau seeking an immediate cleanup of any asbestos in the building.on november,the environmental protection agency epa executed a federal search warrant for the property and found that the building was contaminated with asbestos.in december,the epa assigned an coordinator to the building to begin an assessment of whether the property was eligible for superfund relief.that same month chau accepted a proposal from pepper environmental services pepper to stabilize the building for.pepper sealed the basement area to prevent further asbestos exposure to any persons inside or outside the building.later,on january,pepper offered to remove all of the asbestos in the basement for.since he was bankrupt at the time,chau did not accept pepper proposal.
between january,and march,hearings were held on the city civil complaint against chau.after the hearings,the court ordered chau to clean up the building.on march,the epa issued an administrative compliance order outlining the steps that the epa was ordering chau to undertake in cleaning up the remaining asbestos.
after receiving these orders,chau engaged in a desperate and illegal act.he covered his upper and lower body with black trash bags and tied some bags around his feet.then,he put on rubber boots,and donned a clear garbage bag over his chest area,a paint respirator over his mouth and nose,aviator goggles and a bandana over his head.thus equipped,he began stripping pipes and placing pipe wraps in trash bags when the epa investigator arrived.chau made some false statements to the investigator.he was then promptly stopped from cleaning up the building,and the property was locked up.subsequently,the government declared the property a superfund site and had it cleaned up for approximately.the city of philadelphia cleaned up the dump sites for approximately.
in october,chau was indicted for violations of the clean air act with two other related charges.the indictment charged him with polluting the air when he initially cleaned up the building,with fantom and turner help,in,and when he attempted to clean up the building by himself in.shortly before trial was to begin on march,chau attempted to get fantom to change his trial testimony.chau was subsequently charged by information with obstruction of justice.he pleaded guilty to knowingly violating the clean air act as well as to the obstruction of justice charge.he was sentenced to months in jail,the lowest possible sentence after certain enhancements were applied.on appeal,chau argues that the district court erred in applying those enhancements to his sentence.
on review of a sentencing,the district court findings of fact are accepted unless clearly erroneous,and the district court application of the guidelines to the facts must be given due deference.e.in koon united states,d,the court noted that the deference that is due depends upon the nature of the question presented.
whether a enhancement pursuant to b a was warranted.
b imposes a enhancement for a single discharge of a hazardous substance and a enhancement for a continuous or repetitive discharge of the substance.chau argues that the district court erred in imposing this enhancement because the government failed to prove actual contamination or any substantial amount of discharge.
application note for states subsection b assumes a discharge or emission into the environment resulting in actual environmental contamination.the circuits are split on the question whether the government must prove that the discharge caused actual environmental contamination.compare united states cunningham,cir proof of actual contamination not required,united states liebman,cir same,and united states goldfaden,cir same with united states ferrin,cir showing of actual contamination required.however,even under ferrin,the record here supports a enhancement.in ferrin,the court held that proof of environmental contamination does not necessarily require a scientific study.ferrin,at.the court continued we see no reason why in most cases reasonable inferences from available evidence would not suffice to support a conclusion that the illegal acts resulted in contamination.here,there is substantial evidence that chau disturbed the asbestos in the building.there is also evidence that some asbestos became exposed to the air.for example,the city inspector found that some opened garbage bags containing asbestos were le
