facts and procedural history 
section of the endangered species act esa makes it unlawful for any person to take an endangered species of fish or wildlife.a b.fws has extended the take prohibition to include threatened fish and wildlife.d a.the take of a protected species includes harm,which,in turn,includes effects from any significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife.
section of the esa creates an exemption from the esa prohibition on the take of covered species.it grants fws the power to issue permits allowing for the take of listed species that incidently results from lawful activities on private property.a b.to obtain an incidental take permit itp,a party must develop a habitat conservation plan hcp that provides for ongoing mitigation efforts to minimize the project future impact on protected species.a.before issuing an itp,fws must prepare and evaluate a biological opinion to ensure that the project will not jeopardize the continued existence of covered species.a,b a.
in,california passed the natural communities conservation planning act nccpa.cal.stat.codified at cal.fish game code.the purpose of the nccpa is to encourage planning among affected interests for habitat protection of species to avert their listing under the esa.the nccpa authorizes the california department of fish game cdfg to enter agreements with parties to implement a natural communities conservation plan nccp to provide comprehensive management and conservation of multiple wildlife species.cal.fish game code 
in,the city began developing a comprehensive land management plan known as the san diego conservation program mscp plan.the mscp plan encompasses a area in san diego county the county,including the city,portions of the county unincorporated areas,and some coastal and inland cities within the county.the mscp plan became a blueprint for a workable balance between preservation of natural resources and regional growth and economic prosperity.
the mscp plan took more than five years to develop and involved participation and negotiation by stakeholders including federal,state,and local governments wildlife agencies property owners environmental groups and citizens.the member mscp working group represented stakeholders including plaintiff the sierra club,defendants the city and fws,and applicants pardee and the building association of san diego.
the mscp plan established a permanent acre preserve called the planning area the mhpa,which covers about thirty percent of the county total land area.private landowners contributed about percent of the mhpa acreage.under the mscp plan,the city and other municipalities within the plan area are responsible for developing their own subarea plans.the city subarea plan subarea plan encompasses percent of the total mscp plan area.
after development of the mscp plan and the subarea plan collectively,the plans,fws,cdfg,and the city entered into a contractually binding implementation agreement ia.the plans qualify as both an hcp and a nccp,and they are specifically incorporated into the ia.pursuant to the ia and shortly after its execution,fws issued the city an itp city itp covering protected species and incorporating the plans and the ia.the city itp gives the city power for fifty years to confer delegated incidental take authority on projects that comply with all requirements of the ia,the city itp,and the plans.
the ia also grants the city the power to create beneficiaries to the ia,if they meet additional regulatory requirements outlined in the ia and the plans.under paragraph a of the ia,the city confers third party beneficiary status on projects pursuant to its review of the project impacts on biological resources,determination of necessary mitigation measures to compensate for such impacts,and imposition of such mitigation as a condition of development binding on those with third party beneficiary status.the ia allows the city to confer its delegated incidental take authority on third party beneficiaries.the ia also provides assurances that,absent extraordinary circumstances or future listing of species as protected,the city will not impose on third party beneficiaries additional mitigation or protective measures other than those allowed by the ia.
although the broadest of the ia assurances are given to third party beneficiaries,the ia also protects against further mitigation and conservation regulation to projects identified as in the approval process.projects in the approval process are given a category ranking from to,with projects in the last category considered the furthest along in the approval process.according to the ia,proponents of projects in category are considered vested under california law.
vernal pools are freshwater wetlands that form in shallow depressions on mesa tops and valley floors.the depressions fill with rainwater and runoff in the fall and winter,and dry up in the spring.vernal pools are a shrinking environment in california,with an estimated percent of such habitats already destroyed by development.five plant and two shrimp species that inhabit san diego vernal pools are endangered.the city itp lists these species among its covered species.
on december,southwest and thirty local and national environmental groups filed a first amended complaint in district court asserting fourteen claims for relief against defendants.the action alleges defendants did not abide by esa requirements in protecting seven vernal pool species.southwest challenges the formulation,approval,and implementation of the ia,the plans,and the city itp.
southwest claims for relief include claims that challenge the adoption of the city hcp mscp plan,identified in the first amended complaint as including the subarea plan and ia and the issuance of city itp for failing to comply with the procedural requirements of the esa that assert the subarea plan and city itp are illegal based on failures to satisfy substantive standards of the esa for the vernal pool species that fws should have revoked the city itp for the failure to abide provisions implementing monitoring,management,and regulatory protocols specified in the subarea plan and ia as incorporated by the itp and failure of the fws to abide other esa requirements that fws failed to complete a recovery plan for vernal pool species under section f of the esa and that the cousins marketcenter project offends the esa,the clean water act cwa,and the national environmental policy act nepa.
in its prayer for relief,southwest requests the district court,inter alia,to declare the city hcp insufficient under the esa to declare unlawful fws biological opinion biological opinion concerning the seven vernal species conducted before the issuance of the city itp to declare unlawful the procedures by which the city applied for its itp to declare that the city violated its itp to declare null and void and revoke the biological opinion and the city itp to order fws to require mitigation for projects authorized pursuant to the city itp and to order injunctive relief against the cousins marketcenter cousins and torrey surf development torrey surf projects to abate activities that destroy vernal pools.
on june,pardee and the builders,building industry legal defense foundation bildf,national association of home builders nahb,and california building industry association cbia moved for leave to intervene as of right or for permissive intervention on behalf of defendants.with the motion,applicants filed a proposed answer of applicants for intervention to first amended complaint,as required by rule c,along with a supporting memorandum and attached declarations,and later a reply memorandum.southwest opposed the motion on grounds that applicants did not meet the requirements for intervention as of right under rule a or permissive intervention under rule b.the city filed a memorandum in which it took no position,on the motion for intervention,but stated that while the city and applicants shared the same interest in preserving the mscp and itp,the city does not purport to represent the interests of the development community.so far as we can determine from the record,no other defendant filed any memorandum expressly taking a position on intervention.
on august,southwest filed a second amended complaint deleting the claims related to the cousins marketcenter project and later a third amended complaint was filed.on august,the district court issued an order denying applicants motion to intervene as of right and denying permissive intervention.applicants filed a motion for reconsideration under federal rule of civil procedure b with declarations adding documentation of applicants alleged status as beneficiaries and other facts pertinent to intervention.the district court denied applicants motion for reconsideration.
applicants filed a timely appeal of the district court denial of both the motion to intervene and the motion for reconsideration.
discussion 
rule provides for intervention as of right and permissive intervention.applicants sought leave to intervene on both grounds.we review de novo a district court denial of a motion to intervene as of right,with the exception of timeliness,which we review for abuse of discretion.donnelly,at.
where,as here,no federal statute confers an unconditional right to intervene,rule a provides for intervention as of right 
upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant ability to protect that interest,unless the applicant interest is adequately represented by existing parties.
we apply a test under rule a the application for intervention must be timely the applicant must have a significantly protectable interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action the applicant must be so situated that the disposition of the action may,as a practical matter,impair or impede the applicant ability to protect that interest and the applicant interest must not be adequately represented by the existing parties in the lawsuit.northwest forest resource council nfrc glickman,cir.
in general,we construe rule a liberally in favor of potential intervenors.forest conservation council fcc united states forest,cir.in addition to mandating broad construction,our review is guided primarily by practical considerations,not technical distinctions.united states stringfellow,cir,vacated on other grounds sub nom.stringfellow concerned neighbors in action,d.see also donnelly,at reviewing practical and equitable considerations bearing on intervention.
timeliness 
as the parties agree that applicants motion to intervene was timely,we need not address this factor.
ii.proposed intervenors interests 
applicants asserted in the district court and argue here five legally protectable interests in this action they are present certain future intended beneficiaries of the incidental take authority granted pursuant to the city ia,they are relying and intend regularly in the future to rely on incidental take authority and assurances,they have an interest in their property and the regulatory burden of their present and future projects governed by the subarea plan over the next fifty years,they have an interest in how several significant issues raised by southwest claims are resolved and in the potential for an adverse precedential effect,and they have an interest in the plans placed in jeopardy by the action given the truly prodigious amount of resources applicants have invested in their development and adoption.because we conclude that applicants have legally protectable interests based on their ownership of projects that are on the approved negotiated project list for assurances and approval pursuant to the ia,we do not reach their remaining assertions.
applicants argue that they have a legally protectable interest because they are present beneficiaries of the ia and presently rely on the city itp.in rejecting this interest,the district court concluded that applicants failed to demonstrate that they are present beneficiaries of either the ia or the city itp that they have received contracts,project approval,or permits pursuant to either the ia or the city itp that applicants projects relate to the vernal pools or that such projects will be affected by any relief sought in the action.
we have held that w hether an applicant for intervention demonstrates sufficient interest in an action is a practical,threshold inquiry.no specific legal or equitable interest need be established.greene united states,cir citing portland audubon soc y hodel,cir.it is generally enough that the interest asserted is protectable under some law,and that there is a relationship between the legally protected interest and the claims at issue.sierra club united states epa,cir.
an applicant demonstrates a significantly protectable interest when the injunctive relief sought by the plaintiffs will have direct,immediate,and harmful effects upon a third party legally protectable interests.fcc,at.in sierra club,we held that the city of phoenix was entitled to intervene as of right in an action brought by the sierra club against the epa under the cwa.the sierra club sought to have the epa promulgate water quality standards for final pollutant discharge permits that reduce toxics being discharged from each of the arizona point sources.sierra club,at.in practical terms,the sierra club wanted the court to order the epa to change the city water discharge permits.id.at.we held that the city could intervene as of right because the city status as an epa permittee could be affected when the relief sought would require the epa to make the city permits more restrictive.id.at.we stressed that the lawsuit would affect the use of real property owned by the intervenor by requiring the defendant to change the terms of permits it issues to the intervenor,which permits regulate the use of that real property.these interests are squarely in the class of interests traditionally protected by law.id.at.
in sierra club,we distinguished portland audubon,where we had held that timber industry representatives did not have a significant protectable interest to warrant intervention in the audubon society action that sought to compel a federal agency to prepare an environmental impact statement and to enjoin all timber sales pending its preparation.portland audubon,at.sierra club reasoned that the loggers in portland audubon lacked a legally protectable interest because they did not have any existing legal right,contract or permits relating to the future timber sales that the audubon society sought to enjoin.sierra club,at.their economic interest was based upon a bare expectation,and therefore not cognizable for intervention.id.in contrast,in sierra club,the city had already acquired enforceable water discharge permits from the epa under the cwa.id.
applicants first assert that in finding they had no interest,the district court erred by not accepting the allegations and evidence submitted in support of their motion to intervene.we agree.although we have never so held,other circuits have held that a district court is required to accept as true the allegations made in support of an intervention motion.see,reich,cir concluding that a court must accept as true the allegations of a motion to intervene chesapeake bay found.am.recovery,cir reviewing a statutory right to intervention and concluding,s ince plaintiffs complaint and motion to intervene were dismissed at preliminary stages without evidentiary testing,we must accept plaintiffs allegations as true foster gueory,stating that motions to intervene are usually evaluated on the basis of well pleaded matters in the motion,the complaint,and any responses of opponents to intervention mendenhall toyota maru,cir stadin union,cir concluding that all nonconclusory allegations must be taken as true,and that a court may take notice of uncontroverted facts in pleadings and affidavits opposing intervention.this standard has also been endorsed by a leading civil procedure treatise.see charles alan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane,the pleading is construed liberally in favor of the pleader and the court will accept as true the allegations in the pleading.footnotes omitted.
we adopt this standard now.this rule requiring acceptance of the proposed intervenor allegations makes particular sense where,as in this case,the propriety of intervention must be determined before discovery.we join the unanimous precedent of our sister circuits that have considered the issue.
courts are to take all,nonconclusory allegations in the motion to intervene,the proposed complaint or answer in intervention,and declarations supporting the motion as true absent sham,frivolity or other objections.district courts may often be able to determine whether a prima facie case is made out by reference to the proposed intervenor papers alone however,we do not foreclose consideration of the pleadings and affidavits of opponents to intervention,nor do we preclude district courts from holding a hearing when necessary to resolve ambiguities or conflicts.see wright,miller,kane,supra,ed.ordinarily there will be a hearing on the motion,at least if there is objection to the intervention from any party,but a hearing is not required if it is clear from the face of the application that the motion must be denied.
applying this standard here,we conclude that applicants motion for intervention should be granted.with their motion for leave to intervene,applicants submitted a proposed answer,the administrative record,and a number of declarations by builders and leonard frank,senior vice president of pardee.frank declaration states that five ongoing pardee projects,california terraces terraces,otay corporate center north south otay,dennery ranch,and carmel valley,were included in the approved negotiated project list,and that with respect to each of these projects,pardee is a beneficiary of the ia.we understand that in so characterizing its position,pardee is claiming at a minimum that it is a beneficiary of ia approval process as a result of being on the negotiated project necessarily that it has already attained third party beneficiary status under paragraph a of the ia.for our purposes,this distinction is not critical because pardee interests in projects that have been granted assurances under the ia and that are involved in various stages of planning and implementation are sufficient to constitute legally protectable interests.
under the rule we adopt,we accept pardee declaration that these five projects were on the approved negotiated project list.further,the ia indicates that each project has attained at least some level of assurance that its design or mitigation related to the covered species conforms to the mscp plan and the subarea plan.
we conclude that the pardee projects create sufficient legally protectable interests to support intervention as of right.pardee has made a prima facie showing that he has a substantial interest as a beneficiary of the assurances and approval process set out in the ia that could be affected if the ia were invalidated.contract rights are traditionally protectable interests.sierra club,at hook state of arizona,cir holding that intended beneficiaries of an agreement have rights to enforce the contract that grants them beneficiary status.the connection between this interest and the claims in the action is sufficiently clear because the ia is threatened.
in finding legally protected interests,we also disagree with the district court conclusion that applicants can not have legally protectable interests here in projects that do not involve the vernal pool species.as we have explained,the district court was obligated at this stage to accept pardee declaration that some of its projects affected these species.moreover,southwest challenge to the city itp,ia,and the plans potentially affect those projects authorized pursuant to the city itp and the ia even where these projects involve covered species other than the vernal pool species.
there is no doubt that a central goal of this action is the protection of the vernal pool species.nonetheless,the relief sought includes a declaration that the hcp planning process was illegal and that the city itp,which specifically incorporates the plans and ia,should be revoked and the ia nullified.southwest also contends that the city hcp,the subarea plan and the mscp plan does not meet the requirements of the esa.given the scope of the action,applicants projects that are in the pipeline for design and mitigation assurances and approval under the ia may be affected whether or not they impacted the vernal pool species 
we also conclude that the builders have adequately demonstrated that they have legally protectable interests based on declarations submitted with the motion to intervene.declarations of officers of bildf,nahb,and cbia state that several members of each association own land within the city subarea containing vernal pools,and that members have developed land in reliance on the take authority in the city itp granted pursuant to the ia.three of these associations also in submitted declarations state that p ursuant to the city ia,builders members who develop their land in reliance on the incidental take authority provided to the city are express beneficiaries of such authority in the city ia.
the district court did not find a legally protectable interest,reasoning that the builders have failed to identify how much land their members own within the city,whether this land contains vernal pools,whether their members have obtained approvals from the city to develop their projects pursuant to the city itp,and how such projects will be affected by the relief requested by plaintiffs.however,these declarations are sufficient at this procedural stage even without specifying the project developer or intervention by specific developers the builders have legal protectable interests for the same reason as pardee they sufficiently allege that their members have projects that are in the pipeline for approved projects.we conclude that the builders have sufficiently alleged that some of their members are beneficiaries of assurances for projects in the approval process under the ia,and their interests could be affected if the ia were invalidated 
iii.impairment of applicants interests 
because we conclude that applicants have demonstrated a significantly protectable interest,we must determine whether these interests would as a practical matter be impaired or impeded by the disposition of this action.the record is sufficiently developed on this issue for our de novo review.see fcc,at.
we follow the guidance of rule advisory committee notes that state that i f an absentee would be substantially affected in a practical sense by the determination made in an action,he should,as a general rule,be entitled to intervene.advisory committee notes.see also fcc,at.
relief requested by southwest would affect applicants interests here.for the projects on the negotiated list that are in the pipeline for design and mitigation assurances and approval pursuant to the ia,an inva
