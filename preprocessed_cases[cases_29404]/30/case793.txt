we decide whether the united states forest service service travel management plan for parts of the lewis and clark national forest,including the middle fork judith wilderness study area,violates the montana wilderness study act of study act and the national environmental policy act nepa.we hold that nothing in the study act,which requires the service to manage a wilderness study area so as to maintain its wilderness character as it existed in,prohibits the service from exercising its discretion to enhance the wilderness character of a study area.we also hold that nepa does not require the service to prepare a supplemental draft environmental impact statement eis where,as here,the final decision makes only minor changes and is qualitatively within the spectrum of the alternatives discussed in the draft eis.we accordingly reverse the judgment of the district court.
background 
in,the service issued a revised travel management plan governing recreational motorized and nonmotorized use on million acres of the lewis and clark national forest.the area covered by the travel plan encompasses the little belt mountains,the castle mountains,the north half of the crazy mountains and the acre middle fork judith wilderness study area.
the service draft environmental impact statement deis,released in july,considered five summer alternatives and three winter alternatives.the most restrictive summer alternative would have allowed motorized use on miles of roads and trails.the least restrictive summer alternative would have allowed motorized use on miles of roads and trails each of the alternatives also would have permitted motorized vehicles within feet of a road or trail for parking,accessing dispersed campsites,passing or turning around.
the service final plan,issued in october,adopted summer alternative,with several modifications,and winter alternative overall,the plan designated miles for motorized recreational use,including miles of routes open and another miles open seasonally the plan also designated about miles for groomed motorized travel and permitted,motorized travel on acres between december and may.
the final plan dropped the foot dispersed camping rule and instead allowed parking,passing,or turning around within the length of the vehicle and attached trailer about feet,subject to certain conditions designed to ensure safety and protect vegetation,soil and water.the modified dispersed camping rule also permitted travel beyond the vehicle length plus trailer limit to access certain established campsites.
within the middle fork judith wilderness study area,the plan emphasize d recreation,reducing routes designated for motorized recreational use from miles under the previous travel plan to miles under the new plan.the service record of decision explained this choice as follows 
when congress passed the montana wilderness study act,it instructed the agency to maintain the wilderness character of the middle fork of the judith wilderness study act area wsa.managing this area primarily for use best accomplishes this goal until congress decides whether or not the area should be designated as wilderness.presently there is an abundance of motorized use in this area,some of which is necessary to access private land in the middle of the wsa.to balance the need to provide access to private land,the special highlight of the summer trip some of the trails provide for motorized users,with the need to maintain wilderness character,i have eliminated motorized use except for one connected complex of trails approximately miles and the road system that accesses the private land.
nine recreational groups having an interest in motorized recreation subsequently filed suit against the service,seeking to invalidate the travel plan as violating nepa and the study act.the montana wilderness association intervened as a defendant,and the parties filed for summary judgment.
the district court granted the recreational groups motion for summary judgment and denied the service.the court concluded that the service failed to comply with nepa by adopting a final decision that fell outside the range of alternatives considered in the deis and made numerous,significant changes to the deis without preparing a supplemental environmental impact statement as required by c,which states that a gencies s hall prepare supplements to either draft or final environmental impact statements if t he agency makes substantial changes in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns.the court concluded that the final decision departed from the range of alternatives discussed in the deis in four areas 
the chosen decision reduced total mileage open for motorized travel by nearly thirty percent beyond the most restrictive deis alternative.
the final decision closed several trails not specified for closure in the deis.
the final decision reduced the snowmobile season short of any deis alternative.
the final decision scrapped a foot off road travel rule for a much more restrictive vehicle plus trailer length area.
the court also granted summary judgment to the recreational groups on their study act claim.the court concluded that the study act,which directs the service to administer wilderness study areas so as to maintain their presently existing wilderness character,a,stat,requires the service to preserve the wilderness character of a wilderness study area against decline,but prohibits the service from enhancing the wilderness character of the area.the court said that the study act 
directed the forest service to maintain the wilderness character of wilderness study areas as it existed in.to the extent the wilderness character was there in,it was to be maintained.to the extent the wilderness character was lacking in,it was not to be imposed.
noting that the final travel plan reduced overall motorized use in the study area from miles to miles,the court concluded that the travel plan eliminate d roughly of the motorized routes which the court construed as an impermissible attempt at enhancement or creation of wilderness character in the study area.
the court entered judgment setting aside the travel plan in certain respects and remanding to the service for further action.the service and the montana wilderness association separately appealed.we consolidated the two appeals,and,after hearing argument,referred the matter for possible mediation.the parties elected not to pursue mediation.the matter is therefore ripe for decision.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant or denial of summary judgment.lavine blaine sch,cir.the study act and nepa do not contain their own provisions for judicial review.accordingly,our review of the service decision under these statutes is governed by the judicial review provisions of the administrative procedure act apa.see city of sausalito,cir.under the apa,agency decisions may be set aside if arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
discussion 
montana wilderness study act 
the study act requires the service to administer wilderness study areas so as to maintain their presently existing wilderness character and potential for inclusion in the national wilderness preservation system.study act a.this provision imposes two requirements.first,the service must administer study areas so as to maintain their wilderness character as it existed in.second,the service must administer the areas so as to maintain their potential for designation as wilderness areas,as part of the national wilderness preservation system.the dispute here concerns the first of these requirements.
the recreational groups urge,and the district court concluded,that the obligation to administer study areas so as to maintain their presently existing wilderness character prohibits the service not only from degrading the wilderness character of a study area,but also from enhancing it.they argue that the service improperly attempted to enhance the study area wilderness character by reducing overall motorized use miles in the study area beyond levels.the service disputes that interpretation,arguing that the study act creates a floor,not a ceiling,for environmental protection.
the service is correct.the study act plainly mandates preservation of a base level,but does not prohibit enhancing the area wilderness character above that level.webster defines maintain as to keep in a state of repair,efficiency,or validity and as to preserve from failure or decline.webster third new international dictionary.other dictionaries confirm this meaning.see owasso indep.sch.dist.no.i falvo,the ordinary meaning of the word maintain is to keep in existence or continuance preserve retain.quoting random house dictionary of the english language ed american heritage dictionary of the english language ed defining maintain as to keep up or carry on continue,and as to keep in an existing state preserve or retain oxford english dictionary online version june defining maintain to include to keep up,preserve,cause to continue in being a state of things,a condition,an activity,to keep vigorous,effective,or unimpaired to guard from loss or deterioration.in sum,the study act simply requires the service to preserve a study area wilderness character against decline.enhancement of wilderness character is fully consistent with the study act mandate,although the study act does not require it 
this meaning is confirmed by the purposes of the study act.one of the act express aims is to preserve a study area wilderness character throughout the study period.the study act does not define the term wilderness character,but the parties agree that it borrows a definition of wilderness from the wilderness act,stat.codified at c the wilderness act defines wilderness as an area that has,among other things,outstanding opportunities for solitude or a primitive and unconfined type of recreation.greater yellowstone coal.timchak,no.cv e blw,wl,at,applying the wyoming wilderness act of,which contains language identical to the study act quoting c the study act accordingly requires the forest service to administer wilderness study areas to maintain overall wilderness character,including opportunities for solitude or primitive and confined recreation,that existed there in,until the area is either designated as a wilderness area or removed from the study act.id.at see also id.at overturning the service decision permitting increased in the palisades wilderness study area where the service failed to show that increased helicopter use would not diminish current users available opportunities for solitude compared to levels.the service can accomplish this purpose providing current users with opportunities for solitude comparable to those that existed in when the service either preserves against decline or enhances wilderness character.
the study act other express aim is to maintain a study area potential for inclusion in the national wilderness preservation system.study act a.once again,the service acts consistently with this objective when it either preserves against decline or enhances the wilderness protection of the area.preserving motorized recreational uses,by contrast,does nothing to maintain the area potential for wilderness designation.
the study act legislative history also shows that enhancement is permitted.the senate report explains that the study act directs the secretary to administer the proposed study areas so as not to diminish their presently existing wilderness character and potential,at emphasis added see also id.at stating that the study areas are to be managed by the secretary so as not to diminish their presently existing wilderness character and potential emphasis added.the choice of the word diminish reveals that congress intended to protect wilderness character from decline rather than to prevent enhancement.
the recreational groups point out,correctly,that congress appears to have contemplated that existing recreational activities,including motorized uses,could continue during the study period,so long as those activities did not diminish wilderness character,undermine a study area potential for wilderness designation or conflict with the service overall forest management objectives.see,at explaining that the language regarding wilderness character and potential was added by the committee to assure continued enjoyment of the areas by those recreationists whose pursuits will not,in the judgment of the secretary,preclude potential wilderness designation for the areas,at the use of vehicles,while generally prohibited in designated wilderness areas,is entirely appropriate in wilderness study areas.congress did not,however,mandate that motorized recreational levels be maintained and congress made clear that the service was free to reduce motorized use levels when carrying out its general obligations to manage national forests as it has done here.see id.nothing in the study act will prohibit the use of vehicles,unless the normal forest service planning process and travel planning process,which applies to all national forest lands,determines vehicle use to be inappropriate in a given area.
we therefore hold that nothing in the study act prohibits the service from enhancing the wilderness character of a wilderness study area.the district court decision that the travel plan violates the study act is accordingly reversed 
ii.national environmental policy act 
the district court also concluded that the service violated nepa by adopting restrictions on motorized use that fell outside the range of alternatives considered in the deis and by making numerous,significant changes to the deis without preparing a supplemental draft environmental impact statement,as required by c i.the service challenges that ruling on appeal.we ordinarily review the service decision not to prepare a supplemental eis under the arbitrary or capricious standard.friends of the clearwater dombeck,cir applying c ii.we reverse.
nepa requires the government to prepare an eis for any proposed federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.the eis must address,among other things,the environmental impact of the proposed action and any adverse environmental effects which can not be avoided should the proposal be implemented.id.c i ii.effects that may be relevant to the eis include ecological impacts,such as effects on natural resources and on the components,structures,and functioning of affected ecosystems,as well as the aesthetic,historic,cultural,economic,social,or health effects of the proposed action.b.the eis must r igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives.id.a.
an agency can modify a proposed action in light of public comments received in response to a draft eis.see id.a.a gencies must have some flexibility to modify alternatives canvassed in the draft eis to reflect public input.california block,cir.if the final action departs substantially from the alternatives described in the draft eis,however,a supplemental draft eis is required agencies s hall prepare supplements to either draft or final environmental impact statements if t he agency makes substantial changes in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns c emphasis added.
section c does not define the terms substantial changes and relevant to environmental concerns.the council for environmental quality ceq,however,has published guidance on when changes to a proposed action will require preparation of a supplemental eis.the ceq guidance provides that supplementation is not required when two requirements are satisfied the new alternative is a minor variation of one of the alternatives discussed in the draft eis,and the new alternative is qualitatively within the spectrum of alternatives that were discussed in the draft eis.forty most asked questions concerning ceq national environmental policy act regulations hereinafter forty questions,emphasis added.
the first,eighth and tenth circuits have adopted this ceq guidance as a framework for applying c i.see new mexico ex rel.richardson bureau of land,cir in re operation of missouri river,cir dubois dep t of,cir we now join them in doing so.
here,the district court pointed to four changes in the service decision that the court concluded required supplementation of the deis.we address each in turn.
overall motorized use mileage 
the district court concluded that the service was required to prepare a supplemental draft eis because the final decision reduced total mileage open for motorized travel by nearly thirty percent beyond the most restrictive deis alternative.according to the court,the most restrictive alternative considered in the deis summer alternative permitted motorized use on miles,and the least restrictive deis alternative summer alternative permitted motorized use on miles.the court found that the final decision,which allowed motorized use on just miles,fell outside the range of alternatives considered in the deis,summarizing the figures as follows 
the service argues that the deis total mileage figures relied on by the district court are inappropriate for comparison to the mileage figure for the final plan because they double count route miles that are open to several motorized uses.as we have noted,under the travel plan vehicles can use routes designated for vehicles.thus,for example,a route that is open to both motorcycle and atv use is counted twice in the mileage totals relied on by the district court.the service has offered numbers that avoid double counting,and these numbers show that the total motorized route miles permitted in the final decision fall within the range of alternatives discussed in the deis 
the recreational groups offer no credible reason to doubt either the accuracy of the service mileage figures,which are supported by the administrative record,or the service assertion that the numbers relied on by the district court are inappropriate for comparison to the figure because they reflect double counting.we therefore credit the service mileage figures.as a consequence,the overall motorized use miles authorized by the travel plan are within the range of alternatives included in the deis.the district court finding of a nepa violation therefore inadvertently relied on a mistaken premise 
trail closures not specified in the deis 
the district court faulted the service for not preparing a supplemental draft eis because the final decision included several trail closures that were not included in any of the alternatives discussed in the deis.neither the district court nor the recreational groups,however,explain why these modifications were substantial changes relevant to environmental concerns.c i.they appear to have been minor variation s that were qualitatively within the spectrum of alternatives that were discussed in the draft eis.forty questions,supra.at.accordingly,no supplemental draft eis was required.
modification of the end date of the snowmobile season 
the district court concluded that the service was required to prepare a supplemental draft eis because the service changed the end of the snowmobile season from may in the deis to may in the final decision.the service restored the may date during the appeals phase of the administrative proceedings.any continued objection to this change is therefore moot.
modification of the dispersed camping rule 
finally,the district court concluded that the service violated nepa because the final decision included a modified dispersed camping rule that was not discussed in a supplemental draft eis.the deis proposed permitting driving in a foot corridor on either side of roads and trails for parking,passing and turning around.in the final decision,the service dropped that proposal in favor of a plan allowing parking,passing,or turning around within the length of the vehicle and attached trailer,subject to certain conditions.the plan also permitted travel beyond the vehicle length plus trailer limit to access certain established dispersed campsites.the service explained its decision as follows 
several respondents were concerned about the possibility of a foot wide roaded corridor resulting from the foot dispersed camping rule.i did not find specific information in the final eis feis that indicates this was happening on the ground,however,in too many cases,users are developing roads or trails out of dispersed camp sites and extending the area covered by the foot rule.once a trail or road is created,another user may travel on that newly created road or trail and camp feet beyond the newly developed road or trail,allowing the road or trail to continue to grow.my decision will reduce the creation of new trails out of dispersed camp sites by prohibiting travel off designated routes to a campsite,while still allowing access to continue to the majority of existing dispersed campsites.
the service says the district court decision requiring supplementation was wrong for two reasons.we reject the service first argument but agree with its second.
the service argues that it was not required to prepare a supplemental draft eis because the changes to the dispersed camping rule would have only lessened environmental impacts in comparison to the alternatives discussed in the deis the service contends that a change in a proposed action that only lessens environmental impacts is,as a categorical matter,not a change that is relevant to environmental concerns for purposes of c i.we agree with the service up to a point.that a modified alternative only lessens environmental impacts may tend to show that the new alternative is a minor variation of one of the alternatives discussed in the draft eis and is qualitatively within the spectrum of alternatives that were discussed in the draft eis.forty questions,supra.at.see,sierra club van antwerp,cir when the change to the proposed action is a minimizing measure,the agency is not automatically required to redo the entire environmental analysis because a minimizing measure effects on the environment will usually fall within the scope of the original nepa analysis quoting sierra club army corps of eng rs,cir friends of the bow thompson,cir although we are not prepared to say that a reduction in the environmental impact of an action can never trigger a requirement to prepare a supplemental environmental assessment,we believe that a reduction in environmental impact is less likely to be considered a substantial change relevant to environmental concerns than would be an increase in the environmental impact.
a new alternative,however,may lessen environmental impacts and yet fall outside the range of alternatives discussed in a draft eis.supplementation may be required,for example,when modifications to a proposed action,although lessening environmental impacts,also alter the overall analysis of the proposed action.in massachusetts watt,cir breyer,for instance,the court required preparation of a supplemental analysis when the government lowered its estimate of the benefits expected to be gained from granting oil drilling leases in the north atlantic ocean.the court reasoned that additional analysis was required because the adverse environmental consequences of the action although diminished might no longer be justified in light of the drastically reduced expectation of economic benefit.see id.
the service relies on the third circuit decision in south trenton residents against federal highway administration,cir.that case,however,involved a department of transportation dot regulation that expressly omits a duty to prepare a supplemental eis when a new alternative lessens environmental impacts.the dot regulation states that a supplemental eis will not be necessary where t he changes to the proposed action result in a lessening of adverse environmental impacts evaluated in the eis without causing other environmental impacts that are significant and were not evaluated in the eis.b.section c contains no similar language.the government reliance on south trenton residents is therefore misplaced.
although we disagree with the service that modifications that lessen impacts never require supplementation,we nonetheless agree that the modifications to the dispersed camping rule here did not require preparation of a supplemental draft eis.we hold that the final decision was a minor variation and qualitatively within the spectrum of alternatives discussed in the deis.forty questions,supra.at.
we reach this conclusion for sever
