this case arises out of the requirements of three states for water stored in a federal reservoir.the states of alabama and florida appeal the order of the district court approving a settlement agreement between southeastern federal power customers,southeastern,a group of georgia water supply providers water supply providers,the army corps of engineers the corps,and the state of georgia.the agreement provides for a ten or twenty year temporary reallocation of over twenty percent of the water storage in the lake lanier reservoir,which is located in the state of georgia and operated by the corps.alabama and florida contend that the agreement violates the water supply act wsa,d,the flood control act fca,and the national environmental protection act nepa,et.we need address only one of the statutory challenges.under the wsa,the corps must obtain prior congressional approval before undertaking major operational changes.d,d.because the agreement reallocation of lake lanier storage space constitutes a major operational change on its face and has not been authorized by congress,we reverse the district court approval of the agreement.
the setting for this case is lake sidney lanier,a federally owned reservoir operated by the corps and located in georgia.it was created by the construction of the buford dam on the chattahoochee river,approximately fifty miles northeast of the city of atlanta.to the south of the buford dam,the chattahoochee joins the flint river and the two become the apalachicola river,which flows through northern florida and eventually into the gulf of mexico.the three river systems make up the river basin acf basin,which includes counties in alabama.
congress authorized the corps to design and build buford dam in,and the project was completed in the.beginning in the,the corps entered into a series of renewable contracts that allowed some of lake lanier to be used for storage of local water supply.see se.fed.power customers,harvey.the last of the local water storage contracts expired in,but the corps has permitted the withdrawal of water,in increasing amounts,under the terms of the expired contracts.id.
in,before the expiration of the last temporary local water storage contract,the corps transmitted a report to congress recommending that of storage in lake lanier be reallocated from hydropower to local consumption,noting that this might require congressional approval.usace,post authorization change notification report for the reallocation of storage from hydropower to water supply at lake lanier,georgia pac report.in response,alabama sued the corps in the federal district court in the northern district of alabama,seeking to enjoin reallocation of lake lanier storage space to water supply.this litigation resulted in a stay order,alabama usace,no,and no permanent water storage reallocation was undertaken despite the recommendations of the pac report.in,alabama,florida,georgia and the corps entered into a memorandum of agreement allowing existing withdrawals to continue or increase in response to reasonable demand in,the same three states and congress approved the river basin compact compact to facilitate water storage allocation,planning and dispute resolution in the acf basin,stat.the compact,which did not assign rights to any quantity of water,id.at,terminated on august,without resulting in an agreement on the allocation of water storage resources.
in,southeastern sued the corps in the federal district court in the district of columbia,challenging the corps statutory authority to divert water from lake lanier to the detriment of hydropower users and alleging economic injury stemming from increased withdrawals of water from lake lanier,which allegedly compromised use of lake lanier water for power generation.georgia thereafter petitioned the assistant secretary of the army for civil works to formally reallocate reservoir storage space for local requesting a threefold increase in the amount of space devoted to local water supply.in,not having received a response to its request,georgia sued the corps in the federal district court in the northern district of georgia.in,georgia request was denied.by letter of april,the acting assistant secretary of the army for civil works explained that because t his request involves substantial withdrawals from lake lanier and accommodating it would affect authorized project purposes the matter had been referred to the office of the army general counsel,and t hat office has concluded that it can not be accommodated without additional congressional authorization.letter from brownlee,to roy barnes,governor of georgia,citing memorandum of earl stockdale,deputy counsel,dep t of the army,regarding georgia request for water supply from lake lanier,army legal memorandum.the georgia lawsuit is currently abated.georgia usace.
meanwhile,in march,the district court referred the parties to mediation,where they were eventually joined by georgia and the water supply providers.the parties negotiated the agreement at issue and signed it in january.the agreement specifies that lake lanier storage space is.it requires the corps to allocate between and of lake lanier water storage to local municipal and industrial uses for a period of ten years the exact amount of space allocated depends on whether gwinnett county chooses to purchase all of the storage space to which it is entitled.if,under the agreement,all of the storage space that may be officially dedicated to local consumption is,then the reallocation constitutes more than percent of the total storage space in lake lanier and approximately nine percent more of the total storage space than was being allocated for local use in.compare agreement at,and army legal memorandum at,with agreement at.the interim leases will become permanent if congress approves the change in use or a final court judgment holds that such approval is not necessary,agreement at,and the corps commits to recommending that congress formally make the storage covered by the interim contracts available on a permanent basis,id.at.the agreement also provides hydropower generators with payments in the form of credit to be reflected in hydropower rates,based on revenues paid into the united states treasury under contracts based on the agreement,to compensate for lost opportunities related to its reallocation of water storage rights.id.at.
in october,after the agreement was signed,the district court allowed alabama and florida to intervene and denied the motions to transfer the case to the georgia district court alabama and florida also resuscitated the alabama lawsuit that was filed in.on october,the alabama district court entered a preliminary injunction,preventing the agreement from being implemented.the district court approved the agreement on february,contingent upon the dissolution of the alabama district court injunction.se.fed.power customers caldera,d.the district court rejected alabama and florida argument that the agreement exceeded the authority conferred on the corps by congress,including applicable provisions of the wsa,the fca and nepa.id.at.it also concluded that while the agreement would affect hydropower generation,an original purpose of lake lanier,the assent of the hydropower generators meant that congressional approval for the allocation of storage space was not required.id.at.the district court quoted the wsa operational change provision,but did not explicitly address this issue.see id.
this court dismissed the initial appeal filed by alabama and florida for lack of a final order,in view of the conditional nature of the district court approval of the agreement.se.fed.power,at.following the dissolution of the alabama district court injunction,alabama usace,cir,the district court,on march,entered a final judgment that is the basis for this appeal by alabama and florida.
alabama and florida contend that the agreement should be set aside because it violates the wsa,the fca,and nepa.they maintain that the reallocation in the agreement requires congressional approval under the wsa because it both constitutes a major operational change and seriously affects project purposes.they also contend that the agreement violates the fca because it allows only the sale of surplus water,whereas the agreement is a transaction involving water that is not surplus because the fca prohibits negatively affecting existing uses of affected water and because the agreement is contrary to the corps internal fca contracting guidelines.finally,they contend that the agreement violates nepa by irrevocably committ ing the corps to executing the agreement at the completion of its nepa analysis,appellants br.at,effectively bypassing the statute 
the court reviews the fairness of a settlement agreement for abuse of discretion.moore ass of sec.dealers.although there are few precedents on review of a settlement agreement for compliance with statutory requirements,the district court could hardly approve a settlement agreement that violates a statute,see,sierra club,controls design,cir,and this court owes the district court no deference in its legal interpretations.our statutory review then is de novo,although this is largely a matter of semantics a district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law,koon united states,d see also donovan robbins,cir.in considering the corps interpretation of its statutory authority to enter into the agreement,the court applies the familiar analysis under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.
where congress has directly spoken to the issue that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.
section of the wsa,addresses the development of water supplies for domestic,municipal,industrial,and other purposes,specifically acknowledging that primary responsibility for their development is lodged in states and localities.id.a,a.it authorizes storage in any reservoir project surveyed,planned,constructed or to be planned by the corps of engineers or the bureau of reclamation so long as the costs of construction or modification are adequately shared by the beneficiaries.id.b,b.the wsa provides,however,that 
modifications of a reservoir project heretofore authorized,surveyed,planned,or constructed to include storage as provided in subsection b of this section which would seriously affect the purposes for which the project was authorized,surveyed,planned,or constructed,or which would involve major structural or operational changes shall be made only upon the approval of congress as now provided by law.
d,d emphasis added.
alabama and florida contend that the agreement reallocation of up to of storage space to the water supply providers constitutes a major operational change and thus requires congressional approval.they point to previous analyses prepared by the corps and the office of the army general counsel indicating that operational changes on a similar scale would require congressional approval.see,pac report at army legal memorandum at.appellees offer that the agreement merely leaves in place t he status quo of incremental increases in withdrawal amounts by the water supply providers as those increases are permitted by georgia,appellees br.at,and thus does not constitute an operational change.they would distinguish the army legal memorandum on the basis that georgia request involved a larger percentage of lake lanier than the storage allocated by the agreement and included projections that were thirty as opposed to ten years in the future.appellees further offer that the agreement provides for compensation payments to hydropower producers,thus retaining the hydropower benefit and adding the water benefit,id.at.finally,appellees offer that the reallocation is temporary rather than permanent,and thus does not require congressional approval.
as a threshold matter,we hold that alabama and florida have standing to challenge the agreement insofar at it constitutes a major operational change to the lake lanier reservoir they credibly claim to fear that the proposed reallocation of water storage will result in diminish ed flow of water reaching the downstream states.appellants br.at.the agreement does potentially reduce the amount of water flowing downstream,agreement at alabama,at,and the acf basin would thereby be affected by changes to the quantity of water in the chattahoochee river for as long as twenty years,see,agreement at georgia usace,cir.as the acf basin includes parts of both alabama and florida,they would be directly impacted by the agreement proposed changes to water storage uses in its complaint,florida alleged various negative environmental impacts from reduced water flow.in addition,the states interests entitles them to special solicitude in standing analysis.see massachusetts epa,d.to the extent the agreement provides that entering into the storage contracts described in this agreement potentially gives rise to certain obligations under nepa,agreement at,any attendant delay due to the corps compliance with nepa does not affect the imminence of the claimed injury.the agreement commits the corps to use its best efforts to complete any applicable requirements of nepa as expeditiously as practicable.massachusetts.at.in addition,the agreement states that its nepa compliance provision does not apply to the supplement to relocation contract between the corps and the city of gainsville allowing removal of water from lake lanier from the date of settlement,agreement at.
alabama and florida thus show both the imminence of and its causation,and reversing the approval of the agreement would provide redress to their injury.see generally lujan defenders of wildlife,d.alabama and florida prudential standing is likewise established because they come within the zone of interests that congress could reasonably have intended to protect.see clarke sec.indus.ass n,d.
section of the wsa plainly states that a major operational change to a project falling within its scope requires prior congressional approval consistent with this plain text,the corps has long recognized that its discretion to alter a project operations without congressional approval is limited to matters.it acknowledged in the pac report,at,that congressional approval might be required for reallocation of,or approximately twenty percent of lake lanier total current storage as specified in the agreement.in,on the basis of a legal opinion from the office of the army general counsel,the corps rejected georgia request that,approximately percent of lake lanier total storage,be reallocated to local use.that legal opinion concluded that georgia request was of a magnitude that would involve substantial effects on project purposes and major operational changes and therefore required prior congressional approval.army legal memorandum at see also id.at.this conclusion was based on a comprehensive analysis the army legal memorandum identified the specifically authorized purposes of lake lanier as navigation,hydropower generation,and flood water supply as an incidental benefit,id.at reviewed relevant congressional authorizations,beginning with the rivers and harbor acts of,noting that,according to engineers reports,water supply was an incidental benefit of the dam and cited statutory limitations on the corps authority to modify any existing project under the wsa,id.at,referencing a house subcommittee report contrasting the corps authority to make minor modifications as distinct from major changes in a project and observing that t he corps view of its discretionary authority in this area comports with that of congress,id.at quoting house comm.on public works,subcomm.to study civil works,report on the civil functions program of the corps of engineers,congress at.the corps legal defense of water withdrawals was limited to a footnote,without citation to authority,which stated that the agency does have the discretionary authority to meet the current water supply needs of the municipalities surrounding the reservoir,id.at.
on its face,then,reallocating more than percent,approximately acre feet of lake lanier storage capacity to local consumption uses,see agreement at,constitutes the type of major operational change referenced by the wsa the reallocation limitation to a temporary period of twenty years does not change this fact.even a nine percent,approximately acre feet increase over levels for twenty years is significant.appellees contrary arguments are unpersuasive.
first,appellees maintain that the agreement simply reflects the status quo of gradual water storage reallocation,and consequently does not constitute a major operational change.but the appropriate baseline for measuring the impact of the agreement reallocation of water storage is zero,which was the amount allocated to storage space for water supply when the lake began operation.otherwise,under appellees logic,even if the agreement had simply kept in place a series of interim agreements that allocated all of lake lanier to storage for local consumption,no major operational change would have chain of logic that would effectively bypass section d of the wsa,d even taking the status quo as the consumption level in,the reallocation of approximately nine percent,approximately acre feet of storage space for a period is still significant.as the corps acknowledged during oral argument,the change from current local usage storage to the storage levels envisioned by the agreement would be the largest reallocation ever undertaken by the corps without prior congressional approval.oral arg.tape,at.
second,appellees maintain both that the amount of storage space reallocated by the agreement is too limited to qualify as a major operational change,and that the agreement compensation of hydropower users prevents the reallocation from constituting a major operational change.but in defending the agreement,appellees provide no rational reason to explain why a reallocation of approximately percent of total storage,taking into account thirty years of future local needs,constitutes a major operational change,see army legal memorandum at,agreement at,whereas a reallocation of more than of total storage,taking into account twenty years of future local needs,does not.see agreement at.in suggesting that the agreement compensation for the loss of hydropower uses is meaningfully different from georgia reallocation request in,appellees ignore the fact that even if compensation provides hydropower producers the full financial benefit they would have received from use of lake lanier in the absence of the water storage reallocation,a major operational change still occurs because there is less flow through as a result of increased water storage for local use.
third,appellees maintain that the absence of a permanent reallocation under the agreement removes the need for prior congressional approval.but it is unreasonable to believe that congress intended to deny the corps authority to make major operational changes without its assent,yet meant for the corps to be able to use a loophole to allow these changes as long as they are limited to specific time frames,which could theoretically span an infinite period.appellees attempt to respond by suggesting a time period of years might cause a serious impact,appellees br.at quoting counsel for the corps during oral argument before the district court,transcript of oral argument,at,se.fed.power customers caldera,d,fails to explain why a twenty year term would not cause the same serious impact.
in other circumstances it is conceivable that the difference between a minor and a major operational change might be an ambiguous matter of degree,where the court would consider whether an agency authoritative interpretation should be accorded deference under chevron step two in defining the term major operational change,concurring op.at.but the agreement reallocation of over percent of lake lanier storage space does not present that situation.it is large enough to unambiguously constitute the type of major operational change for which section d of the wsa,d,requires prior congressional approval.this conclusion is reinforced by the corps prior consideration of reallocation proposals,see pac report at army legal memorandum at.the same conclusion applies to a reallocation of approximately nine percent of lake lanier storage space,for it too presents no ambiguity.this is illustrated by the corps acknowledgment of the reallocation unprecedented scale,oral arg.tape,at.vaguely committing to request congressional approval of the reallocation at some future date,see,agreement at oral arg.tape,at,does not accord with the plain text of the wsa.
the corps may understandably be of the view that it faces a difficult situation,oral arg.tape,at,and is attempting to balance multiple interests and achieve a creative solution,id.at.however,congress envisioned that changed circumstances or difficult situations might arise and specified that any solution involving major operational changes required its prior authorization.wsa d,d.we therefore need not reach the other contentions of alabama and florida.the agreement reallocation of lake lanier storage capacity to local consumption is a major operational change that under section d of the wsa,d,may not occur without congress prior authorization.accordingly,because no authorization has been obtained,we hold that the district court erred in approving the agreement and reverse.
i agree with the majority conclusion that,notwithstanding our limited scope of review of a district court approval of a settlement agreement,we are obliged to reject this one.i write separately to discuss issues appellants raise which i think should be disposed should be rejected so as not to complicate any further possible to disagree with my colleagues on one important point.
appellants argued that the agreement violated the flood control act fca,as well as the water supply act wsa.i think that alternative claim is quite weak.the relevant provision of the fca states 
sale of surplus waters for domestic and industrial uses disposition of secretary of the army is authorized to make contracts with states,municipalities,private concerns,or individuals,at such prices and on such terms as he may deem reasonable,for domestic and industrial uses for surplus water that may be available at any reservoir under the control of the department of the army provided,that no contracts for such water shall adversely affect then existing lawful uses of such water 
by its plain terms,this provision sets the conditions under which the secretary may sell surplus water.however,the corps does not contend that the settlement agreement disposes of surplus water.the agreement does reallocate a certain amount of reservoir capacity to water storage,but reallocations are governed by the water supply act,not the flood control act.section d of the wsa requires congressional approval of m odifications of a reservoir project which would involve major structural or operational changes d.it is abundantly clear,then,that the water supply act,not the flood control act,is the statute that governs the corps actions in this case,and i would accordingly explicitly reject the appellants fca claims.
turning to the wsa,appellants,it was their main the agreement was unlawful under that statute,not just because it constituted a major operational change,but also because it was inconsistent with the project authorized purposes.d.the buford dam was constructed to improve navigation,generate hydroelectric power,and control flooding.alabama army corps of engineers,cir.for many years,the corps has maintained that an incidental benefit of the project was to provide metropolitan atlanta with water supply.id.one of the project primary purposes,thus,was to provide hydroelectric power to downstream users.the agreement,it is contended by alabama and florida,will reduce the amount of water released from the reservoir which will,in turn,reduce the water available for alabama and florida power requirements.appellees responded that the agreement compensation mechanisms met the hydroelectric purposes of the project.
under those mechanisms,the water supply providers will pay substantially higher rates for water storage,and the resulting
