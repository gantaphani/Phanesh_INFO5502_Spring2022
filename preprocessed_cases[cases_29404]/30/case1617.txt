the south coast air quality management district district is charged with regulating nonvehicular air pollution emissions in a large area that encompasses much of los angeles and other parts of southern california,regions that have some of the worst air pollution in the country.this case concerns the district amendments to its rule,which limits certain substances in paints and coatings.the american coatings association association,formerly known as the national paint and coatings association,challenged the amendments on the ground that they exceeded the district regulatory authority under statutes requiring the use of best available retrofit control technology.according to the association,the district failed to show that technology necessary to meet the emissions limits set by the amendments was available within the meaning of the relevant statutes.
the association adopts the position of the court of appeal below that a technology can not be considered available unless it already exists or is ready to be assembled at the time a pollution standard is promulgated.the district contends that the relevant statute,which defines best available retrofit control technology by reference to achievable emissions reductions,authorizes pollution standards that are.on the district view,if new or developing technology will enable industry to meet a pollution standard by the compliance deadline,that standard is achievable and,under the statute,the technology is available even if the technology does not exist at the time the standard is promulgated.the regulations at issue here were originally proposed in and amended in,and they required full compliance by july.
the association also contends that the paint and coating categories employed by rule were too broad and heterogeneous,and that the district emissions limits were not achievable for many products and applications within a given category.thus,the association argues,the district did not adequately demonstrate that the technology needed to meet the standards for such products were available under the statute.the district contends that the categories were reasonably drawn and that it need not show that the technology to achieve the emissions limit for each category is available for every paint or coating application within that category.on this issue,the court of appeal agreed with the district.
we conclude that the relevant statutes give the district the authority to promulgate pollution standards based on technologies that do not currently exist but are reasonably anticipated to exist by the compliance deadline.in addition,we conclude that the district sufficiently demonstrated that its challenged emissions limits were achievable in each category and that the categories were reasonably drawn.we therefore reverse in part the judgment of the court of appeal.
air pollution is regulated by federal,state,regional,and local governmental entities.the federal clean air act mandates that the environmental protection agency epa set national ambient air quality standards.a.states have primary responsibility for meeting these standards,and the clean air act requires states to formulate and enforce implementation plans designed to meet national standards within their borders,a.state implementation plans are subject to epa approval,k.if the epa determines that a state plan is inadequate to meet federal standards or that the requirements of an approved plan are not being met,it may adopt a federal implementation plan and impose sanctions on the state,c m.
under california law,the california air resources board board is charged with developing the state implementation plan and overseeing its enforcement.health,all statutory references hereafter are to this code unless otherwise indicated.the board establishes ambient air quality standards to protect public health for each air basin in the state,subd.a.while the board is responsible for regulating vehicular pollution throughout the state,regulation of nonvehicular emissions is assigned to local and regional air pollution control districts.the legislature has created five regional districts,and the south coast air quality management district is one.manaster selmi,cal.environmental law and land use practice,manaster selmi.
all districts are required to adopt and enforce rules and regulations to achieve and maintain the state and federal ambient air quality standards in all areas affected by emission sources under their jurisdiction,and shall enforce all applicable provisions of state and federal law,subd.a.the board monitors district compliance with air quality standards and,in the case of ozone and carbon monoxide pollution,classifies districts as in attainment of those standards or in moderate,serious,severe,or extreme nonattainment.the nonattainment classifications trigger increasingly stringent requirements on air quality districts to control pollution.
the south coast air quality management district is california largest air pollution control district.its jurisdiction,the south coast air basin basin,covers all of orange county and the urban portions of los angeles,riverside,and san bernardino counties,and has some of the worst smog in the united states.the district was created in by the lewis presley air quality management act et,which observed in its findings that the south coast air basin is a geographical entity not reflected by political boundaries and that the basin has critical air pollution problems.stats,ch,subds.a,b.the act required the district to adopt an air quality management plan to achieve and maintain the state and federal air quality standards by and to regularly review and revise the plan thereafter,subd.a.the district plan constitutes the federally required state implementation plan for the south coast air basin,subd.d.
as originally enacted,section required the district to adopt rules and regulations by the end of that are not in conflict with federal and state laws and rules and regulations and reflect the best available technology and administrative practices.stats,ch.in,section was amended to provide in subdivision b that the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to subdivision a shall require the use of best available control technology for new and modified sources and the use of best available retrofit control technology for existing sources.stats,ch,italics added.the meaning of those terms,and particularly the latter term,is at the heart of this case.
in order to adopt,amend,or repeal a regulation,a district must hold at least one noticed public hearing.during such hearings,a district shall provide for the submission of statements,arguments,or contentions,either oral,written,or both following consideration of all relevant matter presented,a district board may adopt,amend,or repeal a rule or regulation,unless the board makes changes in the text originally made available to the public that are so substantial as to significantly affect the meaning of the proposed rule or regulation.before adopting or amending a regulation,a district must make several findings,including a finding of necessity,subd.a.
the statutory scheme also authorizes districts to grant variances under certain conditions when compliance with a regulation would result in either a an arbitrary or unreasonable taking of property,or b the practical closing and elimination of a lawful business,subd.a,subd.a.
the district regulates stationary sources of ozone.ozone forms when volatile organic compounds vocs react with oxides of nitrogen in the presence of sunlight.ozone irritates the respiratory system,aggravates asthma,and leads to irreversible reductions in lung function.see epa,air quality designations,cfr,see also allied local regional mfrs.epa,fn.these respiratory effects are particularly severe in children and the elderly.see epa,air quality designations,cfr,see also dunn edwards south coast air quality management dist.th,fn,d.
the basin has historically suffered,and continues to suffer,from the worst ozone pollution in the united states.epa,latest findings on national air quality status and trends through.as a result,the basin is in extreme nonattainment with state air quality standards for ozone and in severe nonattainment with the federal ozone standard.epa,air quality designations,california ozone,cfr.according to a recent study,the economic cost of the health impacts from ozone pollution in the basin exceeds million annually.hall et,the benefits of meeting federal clean air standards in the south coast and san joaquin valley air basins.
the vocs that cause ozone pollution come from many sources.in addition to motor vehicles,a significant source of vocs is architectural coatings.according to a board report in the record,these are coatings applied to stationary structures and their appurtenances at the site of installation,to portable buildings at the site of installation,to pavements,or to curbs.to be classified as an architectural coating,a coating must be applied in the field,at the site of installation,rather than in a shop or factory where pollution control equipment may be installed architectural coatings include,but are not limited to paints,varnishes,stains,industrial maintenance coatings,and traffic coatings.
according to the district,emissions from architectural coatings are greater than the emissions from the entire refinery community,the furniture manufacturing industry,printing industry,and aerospace industry combined,multiplied by a factor of two.architectural coatings are the single largest source of vocs that the district can regulate.as of,these coatings emitted approximately tons of ozone per day in the basin,an amount equal to what million motor vehicles produce in a day.according to a board report,voc emissions from architectural coatings represent about percent of stationary source voc emissions statewide and percent of total statewide emissions.
architectural coatings consist of pigments that give paint its ability to hide the underlying surface,binders or resins that disperse pigment particles and bind pigments to the painted surface,solvents that keep paint in a liquid state during application,and chemical additives that are needed for other coating characteristics.solvents are the primary source of vocs in architectural coatings vocs are emitted when solvents evaporate during the drying process.the voc content of a coating is generally expressed as grams of voc per liter of coating.
curtailing pollutants from architectural coatings is difficult because coatings typically are not applied within an enclosure vented to an air pollution control device.the principal method to control voc emissions from architectural coatings is to reduce their voc content by reformulating coating products.in general,coating manufacturers will meet the voc limits by replacing some of the solvents with water or other exempt compounds,or by increasing the amount of resins,pigments,or other solids.because the substitution of water for solvents can lead to inferior performance by the coating,various additives or resins must be devised for waterborne coatings in order to upgrade their performance.
the district rule,originally enacted in and amended a number of times thereafter,limits concentrations of vocs in architectural coatings.see rule.rule establishes voc limits for coatings in categories and prohibits the manufacture and use of noncompliant coatings,subject to certain qualifications.
the district air quality management plan was in effect when it adopted the amendments to rule at issue here amendments.according to the plan,major reductions in voc emissions are necessary to attain air quality standards for ozone and various particulates.a district staff report in the record observes that as emissions from facilities and vehicles decrease,widespread area wide sources such as architectural coatings become a greater proportion of voc emissions and need to be reduced in order to make further progress toward reducing ozone pollution.the district estimated that if left unchecked,architectural coating emissions alone would account for more than to percent of allowed voc emissions by.the plan called for a percent reduction in voc emissions from coatings by.after the plan adoption,the board and the epa approved it.see epa,approval and promulgation of state implementation plans,coast,cfr.these approvals made the plan binding on the district.see general motors,d.
in,the district amended rule as part of its effort to implement the plan.the amendments established interim voc limits for categories of coatings,effective july,with final limits effective july.the amendments were adopted after industry input through various meetings and workshops.the district also received and responded to written public comments.some of the comments came from public agencies,which claimed that coatings at the level prescribed by the regulation were not available or feasible.in response to these comments,the district proposed to modify the amendments to exempt what it termed essential public services.this proposal was submitted less than two weeks before the may,hearing where the amendments were adopted.
the association challenged the regulation on substantive and procedural grounds.without reaching the merits,the court of appeal held in an unpublished opinion that the district violated procedures set forth in sections and by adding the public agency exemption and other substantial changes to the proposed amendments without giving days notice prior to the may,hearing.the court of appeal directed the trial court to issue a writ of mandate vacating the district adoption of the amendments.
but the amendments were never vacated.before the writ could issue,the district largely readopted the amendments in december,this time following the proper procedures and incorporating numerous revisions in response to a new round of comments by industry and others.the amendments the subject of the present proceeding in this court establish interim voc limits that became effective january,or july,for the industrial maintenance coatings category and final limits that became effective july.proposed amendments to rule.
in formulating the rule,the district concluded in several staff reports included in the record that compliant coatings were becoming increasingly available in all the categories affected by the amendments.while earlier versions of coatings had shown problems with stability,rheology flow characteristics,water immersion,loss of gloss,rusting,lack of corrosion resistance,loss of drying capacity,and bacterial degradation,new additives and resin emulsions developed in the upgraded the performance of coatings and significantly reduced or eliminated these problems.
the district conclusion about the availability of,coatings was based in part on a survey of product data sheets prepared by coatings manufacturers.the district also relied on several studies by outside consultants conducted under the supervision of a technical advisory committee formed by the district and comprised of representatives of the paint industry,academia,and regulatory bodies.in one study,top coatings,primers,sealers,undercoaters,and industrial maintenance coatings were tested and evaluated according to various performance criteria,such as drying time,application properties,corrosion resistance,and adhesion to substrates.the study showed that and coatings equaled or surpassed coatings on many performance characteristics.
the district had also contracted for a,exposure study of exterior coatings and coating systems.at the end of the outdoor test,the district reported,the results continue to show that coatings are similar in weathering and durability characteristics,and in many cases have outperformed their higher counterparts,corroborating the conclusions reached by the laboratory weathering and accelerated outdoor weathering studies.in addition,the district had conducted surveys of construction sites and facilities,and found that across a wide variety of applications,the vast majority of coatings used on these sites complied with the interim limits and that many coatings complied with the final limits.
in response to coating industry comments,the district acknowledged that new products will need to be formulated to comply with future lower voc content limits.industry input during development of the amendments to rule indicated that research and development of new coatings where the resin technology is currently available takes approximately three to five years.further,industry has indicated that if a resin technology is not currently available,research and development of new coatings takes approximately five to seven years.based on this industry input,the final compliance dates specified in the amendments to rule allowed at least seven years for the development of new products.because the may amendments to rule have already been in effect for more than three years,the expectation is that coating manufacturers have made progress in their research and development efforts of new formulations that comply with future voc limits.the district further stated that based on current availability of low and coatings for a wide range of applications,it is anticipated that even more complying coatings will be available by the and compliance dates.the district relied in part on a study it had commissioned concluding that in light of the published results and availability of low voc resins,coatings,and processing capabilities,the industry should witness major progress over the next to years.
the amendments to rule also incorporated several measures designed to give manufacturers and users flexibility in achieving the rule voc limits.these included a provision whereby any coating manufactured before the effective date of the applicable rule limit with a voc content above that limit but not above the applicable limit on the date of manufacture may be sold,supplied,offered for sale,or applied for up to three years after the specified effective date.rule c.the amendments also provided for an averaging compliance option for many coating categories,whereby manufacturers may average designated coatings such that their actual cumulative emissions from the averaged coatings are less than or equal to the cumulative emissions that would have been allowed under those limits over a compliance period not to exceed one year.rule c.
before adopting the amendments,the district received and responded to several critical comments,mostly from the coating industry.in some cases,industry comments caused the district to modify the amendments,for example,by delaying the effective date of the interim industrial maintenance coatings limits to july,and by creating additional coating categories with higher limits.on the other hand,the district disagreed with industry comments that coatings in particular categories were inferior to coatings with respect to various performance characteristics and that the district relied too heavily on product data sheets in determining whether the amended limits were feasible.
in january,the association filed a petition for writ of mandate in orange county superior court pursuant to code of civil procedure section seeking to set aside the amendments.the petition claimed,among other things,that the new emissions limitations amounted to arbitrary and capricious rulemaking because they establish technically infeasible standards that would allegedly eliminate percent of currently available coatings.the petition also alleged that the district violated the california environmental quality act ceqa and that it violated sections and by inadequately analyzing the socioeconomic impact of the amendments.
the superior court bifurcated the case into a first phase addressing the district authority to adopt the rule and a second phase addressing other claims.in the first phase,the court examined the technological feasibility of the regulations and,after a trial,held that the rule was within the district authority.before the trial court issued a decision in the second phase,the association dismissed the remainder of its claims.in its statement of decision in the first phase,the trial court rejected the association argument that the voc limits were not achievable within the time limits provided.thus,the court concluded,the amendments did not violate section,subdivision b requirement that emissions limits be based upon the best available retrofit control technology.the trial court noted that substantial evidence supported the district findings that numerous coatings were already available,that coating technology was improving,and that anticipated improvements would address industry concerns.
the association appealed but did not seek a provisional stay of the rule.accordingly,the interim limits were in effect from january,to july,and the final limits have been in effect since then.
the court of appeal reversed in part.as discussed in greater depth below,the court concluded that the statutory phrase best available retrofit control technology means technology that was commercially available or capable of being readily assembled when the amendments were promulgated.the court of appeal reasoned that because the record revealed no already compliant products in two categories,quick dry enamels and rust preventive coatings,the limits for those categories exceeded the district authority.rather than invalidate the regulations,the court remanded the matter to the superior court to determine whether technology,as of was sufficient to comply with the district final voc limits.
the court of appeal rejected the association additional claim that while compliant paints and coatings may exist in various categories,there is no evidence in the administrative record that the compliant paintings and coatings are suitable for all applications or uses of those paints.noting that the relevant statutes regulate sources rather than applications,the court concluded that the district did not need to show that the limits could be met for all applications with each category.
we granted review.
in issuing and amending rule,the district exercised its power pursuant to statute to issue generally applicable regulations to achieve its own and the state air pollution objectives.see.as we stated in yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,yamaha,rules represent an authentic form of substantive lawmaking within its jurisdiction,the agency has been delegated the legislature lawmaking power.citations.because agencies granted such substantive rulemaking power are truly making law,their rules have the dignity of statutes.when a court assesses the validity of such rules,the scope of its review is narrow.if satisfied that the rule in question lay within the lawmaking authority delegated by the legislature,and that it is reasonably necessary to implement the purpose of the statute,judicial review is at an end.

with these principles in mind,we turn to the issues at hand.
we first address whether the statutory term best available retrofit control technology encompasses only technology that is readily available when a regulation is promulgated or instead encompasses technology that is projected to become available at some future date.
to address this issue,we begin with the relevant statutes.section,subdivision b provides that the rules and regulations the district adopts to implement its air quality management plan shall r equire the use of best available control technology for new and modified sources and the use of best available retrofit control technology for existing sources.these two statutory terms best available control technology and best available retrofit control technology lie at the core of the instant dispute.the two terms differ by only a single word.but despite their textual similarity,a careful examination of the statutory scheme reveals that they have significantly different meanings.
the term best available control technology bact is defined in section.section,which applies to new and modified sources of emissions,states a as used in this chapter,best available control technology means an emission limitation that will achieve the lowest achievable emission rate for the source to which it is applied l owest achievable emission rate,as used in this section,means the more stringent of the following the most stringent emission limitation that is contained in the state implementation plan for the particular class or category of source,unless the owner or operator of the source demonstrates that the limitation is not achievable.the most stringent emission limitation that is achieved in practice by that class or category or source.paragraphing omitted.
the term best available retrofit control technology barct is defined in section.section,which applies to existing sources of emissions,states as used in this chapter,best available retrofit control technology means an emission limitation that is based on the maximum degree of reduction achievable,taking into account environmental,energy,and economic impacts by each class or category of source.the parties do not dispute that the architectural coatings at issue in this case are existing sources subject to the best available retrofit control technology standard.
sections and define bact and barct,respectively,in terms of an achievable emissions limitation or reduction,terms that do not describe any particular type of technology.because these statutes define a technological standard,however,an achievable emissions limitation or reduction means one that is technologically achievable,taking into account the various impacts and factors specified in the statutes.
importantly,the statutes define best available control technology and best available retrofit control technology differently.as noted,section defines bact in terms of the lowest achievable emission rate,which in turn refers to an emission limitation that is achieved in practice,subd.a,italics added.by contrast,section defines barct as an emission limitation that is based on the maximum degree of reduction achievable,taking into account environmental,energy,and economic impacts by each class or category of source,italics added.section does not further specify that an achievable emissions reduction means a reduction that has been achieved in practice.when the legislature uses materially different language in statutory provisions addressing the same subject or related subjects,the normal inference is that the legislature intended a difference in meaning.people ex rel.lockyer reynolds tobacco cal th,d.
thus,section,unlike section,does not define what is achievable by reference to what is achieved in practice and does not otherwise define the term achievable.in common usage,achievable means capable of being achieved.webster new internat.dict.ed.oxford english dict.ed.although the fact that a task has been achieved is obviously evidence that the task is achievable,the word is not limited to that meaning.achievable also describes a potentiality to be fulfilled or a goal to be achieved at some future date.see,toyota sees market share percent,reutersnews,toyota says goal of selling million cars and trucks in the by is achievable stieghorst,caribbean seeks business business leaders of haiti extoll nation vigor,south florida sun sentinal,wnlr,haiti goal of adding jobs in years achievable but difficult.here,the emissions limits set forth in the amendments and originally promulgated in slightly different form in did not go into effect in final form until july.thus,an emissions reduction that is achievable in this context is readily understood as a reduction that,from the vantage point of or,was capable of being achieved by.contrary to its position in this court,the association accepted this straightforward reading of the statute in the court of appeal below,acknowledging in its opening brief in that court that the district,in requiring the use of best available retrofit control technology,may force companies to implement technology if there is a showing that implementation is achievable by the effective date of the regulation.
any doubts about the differences between the bact and barct standards is dispelled by comparing two provisions of the amendments to the lewis presley act section and section both of which address the of air pollution regulations.see stats,ch.section instructs the district on how to assess when setting a bact standard.subdivision c of section provides that p rior to revising the best available control technology guideline for a source category to establish an emission limit that is more stringent than the existing best available control technology guideline for that source category,the south coast district shall do all of the following identify one or more potential control alternatives that may constitute the best available control technology,as defined in section.determine that the proposed emission limitation has been met by production equipment,control equipment,or a process that is commercially available for sale,and has achieved the best available control technology in practice on a comparable commercial operation for at least one year or longer under certain circumstances.review the information developed to assess the of each potential control alternative calculate the incremental for each potential control option italics added,paragraphing omitted.
whereas section applies to bact,section instructs districts on how to assess when setting a barct standard.subdivision a of section provides that before adopting rules or regulations for best available retrofit control technology in a nonattainment area,districts shall identify one or more potential control options which achieves the emission reduction objectives for the regulation.review the information developed to assess the of the potential control option calculate the incremental for the potential control options identified in paragraph paragraphing omitted.subdivision b provides that a district may establish its own best available retrofit control technology requirement based upon consideration of the factors specified in subdivision a and section if the requirement complies with pertinent state and federal laws.
like section,section requires a district to c alculate the incremental of each potential control option.compare,subd.c with,subd.a.however,section has no provision comparable to,subdivision c,which requires the district,as part of assessing the of a bact standard,to d etermine that the proposed emission limitation has been met by production equipment,control equipment,or a process that is commercially available for sale,and has achieved the best available control technology in practice italics added.instead,section gives air pollution control districts considerable discretion in developing their own barct requirements and conspicuously refrains from limiting districts to what has already been achieved.as the concurrent enactment of section,subdivision c demonstrates,the legislature knew how to write such a limitation when it enacted section,but it chose not to do so.
moreover,section appears in the chapter of the air pollution statutes that categorizes air quality districts according to the severity of their pollution and imposes more stringent requirements on districts according to that severity.the legislature has mandated barct standards only for districts in serious,severe,or extreme nonattainment of state air quality standards.see manaster selmi,supra,subd.a,see also,subd.a requiring barct for moderate nonattainment districts under certain conditions.in so doing,the legislature recognized that such districts must set emissions limits not only for new or modified sources but also for existing sources of air pollution in order to meet state standards.moreover,by authorizing districts to establish their own barct requirements instead of a uniform requirement,section enables districts with more serious air quality problems to require greater control efforts from existing sources.as noted earlier,the district is in extreme nonattainment with the state air quality standards for ozone.see ante,d at,at.under section,the district has discretion to determine the stringency of the barct standard in order to meet environmental and public health goals imposed by state and federal law,as long as the district reasonably considers the various factors prescribed by the barct statutes.
barct is therefore a standard designed to compel the development of new technologies to meet public health goals.the character of barct reflects the approach of federal air pollution control legislation.as the high court has observed,the landmark amendments to the clean air act,which first set national air pollution standards,were a drastic remedy to what was perceived as a serious and otherwise uncheckable problem of air pollution.the amendments place the primary responsibility for formulating pollution control strategies on the states,but nonetheless subject the states to strict minimum compliance requirements.these requirements are of a character,citation,and are expressly designed to force regulated sources to develop pollution control devices that might at the time appear to be economically or technologically infeasible.union electric epa,d.
a standard that is need not ignore considerations of practicality.section provides an apt example it defines barct as an emission limitation that is based on the maximum degree of reduction achievable,taking into account environmental,energy,and economic impacts by each class or category of source.italics added.but the principle of is based on the premise that because pollution is a negative externality,industry generally has insufficient incentive to develop or adopt new pollution control technology in the absence of regulation.see sherwin williams south coast air quality management,supra,th at,d a ppellants can not convince us that,left to itself,industry will take steps to safeguard the public health and public welfare by using less polluting but possibly more expensive technology.fields fields,environmental economics an introduction ed.unregulated markets generally do not provide adequate incentives to constrain external pollution costs esty,revitalizing environmental federalism,same.
barct character is also consistent with the legislative history behind the enactment of the barct standard.as one committee report stated in recent months,the south coast air quality management district has come under severe criticism from federal,state and local officials for not taking sufficient action to control and reduce air pollution.this bill is intended to encourage more aggressive improvements in air quality and to give the district new authority to implement such improvements.see rules,ofc.of floor analyses,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.the barct standard was therefore part of a legislative enactment designed to augment rather than restrain the district regulatory power.
the court of appeal rejected the district position that the barct standard was,concluding that best available retrofit control technology refers only to technology that is currently available in its final form or capable of being readily assembled.in so concluding,the court relied on the language of statutes governing the use of best available control technology by new sources,despite the clear statutory differentiation between bact and barct.in particular,the court of appeal cited section,enacted in stats,ch,which provides in subdivision b upon the request of any owner or operator of equipment that is subject to best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate requirements,the district shall review whether the applicable requirements have been achieved and whether the requirements should be required for the source category or source while acknowledging that section applies to bact and not to barct,the court reasoned that i t would be highly anomalous for the legislature to build in a protection for the operators of equipment subject to rules governing new sources of pollution,namely that the operator could request review as to whether the requirements had been achieved past tense if the legislature intended that rules governing existing sources of pollution could be based on technology beyond state of the art.if anything,one would expect the reverse if the legislature wanted to give the district authority to make rules requiring something beyond state of the art technology,it would presumably want to give that authority first as regards any new sources of pollution,where,after all,the most recent conceivable technologies would be more likely to be devised,then attempted.
the district argues convincingly,however,that it would not be anomalous for the legislature to have established more rigorous standards for existing sources than for new or modified sources.as the district points out,bact determinations are made as part of the district construction permit program they are decided on a basis for new and modified pollution sources.under district rule a,t he executive officer or designee shall deny the permit to construct for any relocation or for any new or modified source which results in an emission increase of any nonattainment air contaminant,any ozone depleting compound,or ammonia,unless bact is employed for the new or relocated source or for the actual modification to an existing source.see manaster selmi,supra,to security environmental systems,south coast air quality management dist.d.noting that bact determination is part of the process for obtaining permits to construct hazardous waste incinerator.best available control technology is limited to extant technology because bact is a standard that defines what technology must be used when industry seeks permission for imminent new construction.barct standards,by contrast,are generally applicable rules that require full compliance at some future date,usually several years after a rule is adopted.see manaster selmi,supra,d.barct standards are designed to achieve emission reductions by existing sources over a period of time,during which it is reasonable for a district to predict and require ongoing innovation in pollution control technology.these differing regulatory contexts and timeframes illuminate why the legislature made barct standards more than bact standards.
noting that the federal clean air act imposes national standards on emissions from new and modified sources but not on emissions from existing sources see,c,the association contends that congress,and by implication our legislature as well,intended to impose more stringent standards on new and modified sources,and that barct therefore must be no more than bact.as the district points out,however,the decision to set national standards for new source pollution was an effort to prevent states from engaging in a race to the bottom by lowering new source standards to attract industry,sess,reprinted in cong.admin.news.on the other hand,congress decided to delegate to the states the task of regulating existing sources,so that more stringent existing source standards would apply in more polluted areas of the country.id.at,fn.california statutory scheme mirrors the federal scheme in imposing barct requirements only in nonattainment districts and in allowing districts with more severe pollution problems to impose more stringent barct requirements.see ante,d at,at.
the court of appeal also concluded that section supports the position that barct calls for existing,as distinct from conceivable,technology.section provides in adopting any regulation,the district shall consider,pursuant to section,and make available to the public,its findings related to the cost effectiveness of a control measure,as well as the basis for the findings and the considerations involved.a district shall make reasonable efforts,to the extent feasible within existing budget constraints,to make specific reference to the direct costs expected to be incurred by regulated parties,including businesses and individuals.the court of appeal reasoned that c ost effectiveness is a factor which necessarily demands the hard data direct costs associated with existing technology.conceivable technology that is only likely to meet a regulatory requirement given a hypothesized trend line is generally not amenable to cost accounting.
but the court of appeal posited a false dichotomy between existing technology and merely conceivable technology.regulatory agencies often have to make predictions about technological progress in setting environmental regulations,and such predictions are subject to the restraints of reasonableness.natural resources defense council,epa,see id.at upholding regulations limiting diesel vehicle emissions of particulate matter on the ground that the epa determination of the likely sequence of further technological development within the regulatory timeframe was reasonable.we find no basis to conclude that reasonably predictable technological advances are not amenable to cost analysis.in the present case,for example,the district engaged in such analysis using cost estimates from resin suppliers and coating manufacturers.although coating manufacturers were reluctant to provide cost data,the district estimated on the basis of the information available,including a number of studies by coatings manufacturers and industrial users,that the proposed limits would result in price increases for future coatings compliant with the interim limits to increase by up to and those compliant with the final limits to increase by up to.these price increases reflect not only any increased raw material costs but also other manufacturing costs to be recouped by the coatings manufacturers,such as research and development r d,testing,marketing,labeling,in addition,consistent with section instruction to make specific reference to the direct costs expected to be incurred by regulated parties,including businesses and individuals,the district estimated the specific costs of the proposed limits to paint contractors,consumers,small businesses,and small paint manufacturers.moreover,as section directs,the district calculated cost effectiveness in terms of the cost,in dollars,of the potential control option divided by emission reduction potential,in tons,of the potential control option,subd.a and estimated total to be per ton over the years to.although the association asserts that it seems difficult,if not outright impossible,for the district to be able to determine the cost effectiveness of unavailable technology,the association has not challenged or alleged any shortcoming in the district cost analysis of the amendments to rule.
finally,even if there were ambiguity in the statutory scheme,we would accord great weight and respect to the administrative construction because here the legal text to be interpreted is technical,complex,and entwined with issues of fact,policy,and discretion.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d.this is an area where the agency has expertise and technical knowledge.ibid.accordingly,were we in doubt as to the correct interpretation of the barct requirement,we would defer to the district reasonable construction.
in sum,we conclude that best available retrofit control technology is not limited to technology that already exists at the time a regulation is promulgated.barct also encompasses potential or developing technology that will enable compliance with emissions limits by the effective date of the regulation.under section and related statutes,air pollution control districts may take continuing technological progress into account in determining what emissions reductions are achievable when setting barct standards to meet their public health goals.
in light of this holding,we express no view on the district additional argument that barct sets only a floor and not a ceiling on the district regulatory authority.
because the district has properly construed its statutory authority to set barct standards,we will not vacate the amendments to rule unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or entirely lacking in evidentiary support.here,the court of appeal concluded that there was no evidence in the record of any compliant coatings in two categories quick dry enamels and rust preventive coatings and remanded the matter to the superior court to determine whether any technology enabled manufacturers to comply with the emissions limits.
as the district observes,the court of appeal appears to have misread the record when it concluded that no compliant quick dry enamels or rust preventive coatings existed when the amendments were adopted.although the court of appeal did not specify the source for its conclusion,it was apparently relying on a table summarizing a study by the board that showed zero available compliant coatings for quick dry enamels and rust preventive coatings.however,footnotes d and f to this table indicate that numerous coatings meeting the definition of quick dry enamels and rust preventive coatings were not included in those categories and instead appear in alternative categories.the district staff report on the original amendments affirmed that o ver the past years,several coating manufacturers have developed and marketed acrylic formulations that achieve the high gloss and dry time requirements to be classified as quick dry enamels.the report further states that district staff has conducted extensive searches for rust preventative primers and topcoats that meet the proposed voc limits and has found numerous manufacturers that have finishes that meet the limits.the record also shows that there were additional coatings compliant with either interim or final limits when the amendments were adopted.
furthermore,the court of appeal erred insofar as it discounted the relevance of anticipated technological progress that would produce more compliant coatings by.the appearance of additional compliant coatings in these two categories between and underscores the district findings,based on a number of sources discussed above,that breakthroughs in resin technology and other coating technologies made possible further product innovation in numerous coating categories.moreover,the district relied in part on the industry own assessment to find that development of new products within the window provided by the rule amendments was feasible.the association does not explain why innovations within this time period for quick dry enamels and rust preventive coatings were beyond the capacity of its members.on a proper interpretation of the barct standard,the district was entitled to take into account evidence of reasonably foreseeable technological innovation in setting emissions limits for these categories of coatings.
given the record evidence of as well as reasonably foreseeable technology when the district adopted the challenged emissions limits for quick dry enamels and rust preventive coatings in,the district determination that those limits were achievable is not arbitrary,capricious,or entirely lacking in evidentiary support.we therefore conclude that the court of appeal erred in remanding that portion of rule.
finally,we turn to the issue the association raised in the lower courts and in its answer to the petition for review where an emissions limitation promulgated by the air pollution control district applies to a category of products,and where the record demonstrates that the limit is not achievable with available technology for all products within the category,has the district complied with the requirement to utilize best available retrofit control technology 
the association contends that the categories used by the district to set emissions limits are impermissibly broad the breadth of the regulatory categories in rule results in the fact that technology for certain classes or categories of coatings may not be available to meet a proposed emissions standard,even though others within the regulatory category are available.for example,it may not be possible to develop a chemical storage tank coating that will perform acceptably at an emission level proposed for industrial maintenance coatings,but there is technology to develop a bridge coating at that level.in this case,section requires a finding that the technology is not available for the chemical storage tank coating subcategory,even though it is available for the bridge coating.these coatings should not be subject to the same standard simply because the district has placed the two coatings in the same industrial maintenance category for regulatory purposes.clearly,chemical storage tank coatings and bridge coatings are not the same class or category of source.
in federal litigation,the association similarly argued that section requires the district to adopt control measures that are technologically feasible for all applications within a regulated category stains.national paint coatings,south coast air quality management dist.d,national paint.finding that argument untenable,the court explained first,the application by application interpretation runs contrary to the plain meaning of barct is defined as an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction achievable for each class or category of source.emphasis added.the oxford english dictionary defines class as a number of individuals persons or things possessing common attributes,and grouped together under a general or class name a kind,sort,division.ed.similarly,the term category is defined as a class,or division,in any general scheme of classification.id.thus,the plain meaning of the statute suggests that a barct control measure need only be shown achievable for a group or division of applications.
moreover,the district argument that the association proffered feasibility standard would be effectively impossible to meet is persuasive.the district contends that,under the association interpretation,the district would have to demonstrate for all its air rules feasibility for every conceivable application.a n interpretation of barct that would undermine the district authority to such an extent is inconsistent with legislative intent.national paint,supra,d at,fns.omitted.
for the reasons stated by the federal district court,we agree that an application by application construction of section is unworkable and not what the legislature could have intended.see western oil gas ass air resources board cal d,rejecting construction of a statute that would paralyze the agency by imposing an enormous regulatory burden.
before this court,the association disavows a strict construction of barct,stating that it never suggested the burden is on the district to define every possible subcategory of coatings subject to the proposed rule based on every conceivable object to which the coatings might be applied.the association position has been,and remains,that when a district proposes a rule that requires the use of technology across a broad and heterogeneous category of products and substantial evidence shows that the technology is not available for discrete classes or categories within the regulatory category,the district needs to adjust the technology requirement for those subcategories in which the technology is available and the standard is achievable.the association notes that as of only a small percentage of coatings in some categories met rule final limits for example,only percent of coatings and percent of industrial maintenance coatings.based on these data,the association contends that many products within each category have distinct functions and applications,and that the compliance of a small percentage of coatings within a given category does not demonstrate overall achievability within that category.
the association analogizes its rule that a district needs to readjust its categories if substantial evidence shows that the technology is not available for discrete classes or categories within the regulatory category to the fair argument standard used in ceqa.under ceqa,an environmental impact report eir must be prepared whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that a project may have significant environmental impact.no oil city of los angeles cal d,see also friends of b street city of hayward d.we adopted this low threshold to ensure the effectiveness of the statutory scheme because the preparation of an eir is the key to environmental protection under ceqa.no oil,supra,at.
the association does not explain how its proposed rule similarly advances the objectives of the statute here.such a rule might be plausible if the primary purpose of barct were to rein in overzealous air pollution control districts,but as discussed above see ante,d at,at,section had the contrary purpose of requiring districts to pursue more aggressive regulation.nor does the assoc
