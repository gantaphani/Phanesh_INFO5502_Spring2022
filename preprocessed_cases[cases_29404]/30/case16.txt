in massachusetts epa,this court held that the clean air act authorizes federal regulation of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases,and that the environmental protection agency epa had misread that act when it denied a rulemaking petition seeking controls on greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles.in response,epa commenced a rulemaking under of the act,to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new,modified,and existing fired power plants.pursuant to a settlement finalized in march,epa has committed to issuing a final rule by may.
the lawsuits considered here began well before epa initiated efforts to regulate greenhouse gases.two groups of plaintiffs,respondents here,filed separate complaints in a federal district court against the same five major electric power companies,petitioners here.one group of plaintiffs included eight states and new york city the second joined three nonprofit land trusts.according to the complaint,the defendants are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the nation.by contributing to global warming,the plaintiffs asserted,the defendants emissions substantially and unreasonably interfered with public rights,in violation of the federal common law of interstate nuisance,or,in the alternative,of state tort law.all plaintiffs ask for a decree setting emissions for each defendant at an initial cap,to be further reduced annually.
the district court dismissed both suits as presenting nonjusticiable political questions,but the second circuit reversed.on the threshold questions,the circuit held that the suits were not barred by the political question doctrine and that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged article iii standing.on the merits,the court held that the plaintiffs had stated a claim under the federal common law of nuisance,relying on this court decisions holding that states may maintain suits to abate air and water pollution produced by other states or by industry,see,illinois milwaukee,milwaukee i.the court further determined that the clean air act did not displace federal common law.
the second circuit exercise of jurisdiction is affirmed by an equally divided court.
the clean air act and the epa action the act authorizes displace any federal right to seek abatement of emissions from fired power plants.
a since erie tompkins,recognized that there is no federal general common law,a new federal common law has emerged for subjects of national concern.when dealing with air and water in their ambient or interstate aspects,there is a federal common law.milwaukee i,at.decisions of this court predating erie,but compatible with the emerging distinction between general common law and the new federal common law,have approved federal suits brought by one state to abate pollution emanating from another state.see,missouri illinois.the plaintiffs contend that their right to maintain this suit follows from such cases.but recognition that a subject is meet for federal law governance does not necessarily mean that federal courts should create the controlling law.the court need not address the question whether,absent the clean air act and the epa actions it authorizes,the plaintiffs could state a federal claim for curtailment of greenhouse gas emissions because of their contribution to global warming.any such claim would be displaced by the federal legislation authorizing epa to regulate emissions.
b w hen congress addresses a question previously governed by a decision rested on federal common law the need for such an unusual exercise of by federal courts disappears.milwaukee illinois,milwaukee ii.legislative displacement of federal common law does not require the same sort of evidence of a clear and manifest congressional purpose demanded for preemption of state law,at.rather,the test is simply whether the statute speak s directly to the question at issue.mobil oil higginbotham.here,massachusetts made plain that emissions of carbon dioxide qualify as air pollution subject to regulation under the clean air act,at.and it is equally plain that the act speaks directly to emissions of carbon dioxide from the defendants plants.the act directs epa to establish emissions standards for categories of stationary sources that,in the administrator judgment,caus e,or contribut e significantly to,air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.b a.once epa lists a category,it must establish performance standards for emission of pollutants from new or modified sources within that category,b b,and,most relevant here,must regulate existing sources within the same category,d.the act also provides multiple avenues for enforcement.if epa does not set emissions limits for a particular pollutant or source of pollution,states and private parties may petition for a rulemaking on the matter,and epa response will be reviewable in federal court.see b.the act itself thus provides a means to seek limits on emissions of carbon dioxide from domestic power plants the same relief the plaintiffs seek by invoking federal common law.there is no room for a parallel track.
c the court rejects the plaintiffs argument,and the second circuit holding,that federal common law is not displaced until epa actually exercises its regulatory authority by setting emissions standards for the defendants plants.the relevant question for displacement purposes is whether the field has been occupied,not whether it has been occupied in a particular manner.milwaukee ii,at.the clean air act is no less an exercise of the legislature considered judgment concerning air pollution regulation because it permits emissions until epa acts.the critical point is that congress delegated to epa the decision whether and how to regulate emissions from power plants the delegation displaces federal common law.if the plaintiffs in this case are dissatisfied with the outcome of epa forthcoming rulemaking,their recourse is to seek court of appeals review,and,ultimately,to petition for certiorari.
the act prescribed order of decisionmaking first by the expert agency,and then by federal judges is yet another reason to resist setting emissions standards by judicial decree under federal tort law.the appropriate amount of regulation in a particular greenhouse sector requires informed assessment of competing interests.the clean air act entrusts such complex balancing to epa in the first instance,in combination with state regulators.the expert agency is surely better equipped to do the job than federal judges,who lack the scientific,economic,and technological resources an agency can utilize in coping with issues of this order.the plaintiffs proposal to have federal judges determine,in the first instance,what amount of emissions is unreasonable and what level of reduction is necessary can not be reconciled with congress scheme.
d the plaintiffs also sought relief under state nuisance law.the second circuit did not reach those claims because it held that federal common law governed.in light of the holding here that the clean air act displaces federal common law,the availability vel non of a state lawsuit depends,inter alia,on the preemptive effect of the federal act.because none of the parties have briefed preemption or otherwise addressed the availability of a claim under state nuisance law,the matter is left for consideration on remand.

we address in this opinion the question whether the plaintiffs several states,the city of new york,and three private land trusts can maintain federal common law public nuisance claims against emitters four private power companies and the federal tennessee valley authority.as relief,the plaintiffs ask for a decree setting emissions for each defendant at an initial cap,to be further reduced annually.the clean air act and the environmental protection agency action the act authorizes,we hold,displace the claims the plaintiffs seek to pursue.
in massachusetts epa,this court held that the clean air act,et,authorizes federal regulation of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.n aturally present in the atmosphere and also emitted by human activities,greenhouse gases are so named because they trap heat that would otherwise escape from the earth atmosphere,and thus form the greenhouse effect that helps keep the earth warm enough for life.fed.reg.massachusetts held that the environmental protection agency epa had misread the clean air act when it denied a rulemaking petition seeking controls on greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles,at.greenhouse gases,we determined,qualify as air pollutant s within the meaning of the governing clean air act provision,at quoting g they are therefore within epa regulatory ken.because epa had authority to set greenhouse gas emission standards and had offered no reasoned explanation for failing to do so,we concluded that the agency had not acted in accordance with law when it denied the requested rulemaking,at quoting d a.
responding to our decision in massachusetts,epa greenhouse gas regulation.in december,the agency concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles cause,or contribute to,air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,the act regulatory trigger.a fed.reg.the agency observed that atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are now at elevated and essentially unprecedented levels,almost entirely due to anthropogenic emissions,at mean global temperatures,the agency continued,demonstrate an unambiguous warming trend over the last years,and particularly over the past years,ibid.acknowledging that not all scientists agreed on the causes and consequences of the rise in global temperatures,at,epa concluded that compelling evidence supported the attribution of observed climate change to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases,at.consequent dangers of greenhouse gas emissions,epa determined,included increases in deaths coastal inundation and erosion caused by melting icecaps and rising sea levels more frequent and intense hurricanes,floods,and other extreme weather events that cause death and destroy infrastructure drought due to reductions in mountain snowpack and shifting precipitation patterns destruction of ecosystems supporting animals and plants and potentially significant disruptions of food production,at 
epa and the department of transportation subsequently issued a joint final rule regulating emissions from vehicles,see fed.reg,and initiated a joint rulemaking covering medium and vehicles,see,at.epa also began phasing in requirements that new or modified m ajor greenhouse gas emitting facilities use the best available control technology.a fed.reg,epa commenced a rulemaking under of the act,to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new,modified,and existing fired power plants.pursuant to a settlement finalized in march,epa has committed to issuing a proposed rule by july,and a final rule by may.see fed.reg.reply brief for tennessee valley authority.
the lawsuits we consider here began well before epa initiated the efforts to regulate greenhouse gases just described.in july,two groups of plaintiffs filed separate complaints in the southern district of new york against the same five major electric power companies.the first group of plaintiffs included eight and new york city,the second joined three nonprofit land both groups are respondents here.the defendants,now petitioners,are four private and the tennessee valley authority,a federally owned corporation that operates fired power plants in several states.according to the complaints,the defendants are the five largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the united states.app.their collective annual emissions of million tons constitute percent of emissions from the domestic electric power sector,percent of emissions from all domestic human activities,and percent of all anthropogenic emissions worldwide,app.to pet.for cert.
by contributing to global warming,the plaintiffs asserted,the defendants emissions created a substantial and unreasonable interference with public rights,in violation of the federal common law of interstate nuisance,or,in the alternative,of state tort law.app.the states and new york city alleged that public lands,infrastructure,and health were at risk from climate change.app.the trusts urged that climate change would destroy habitats for animals and rare species of trees and plants on land the trusts owned and conserved.app.all plaintiffs sought injunctive relief requiring each defendant to cap 
its carbon dioxide emissions and then reduce them by a specified percentage each year for at least a decade.app.
the district court dismissed both suits as presenting political questions,citing baker carr,but the second circuit reversed.on the threshold questions,the court of appeals held that the suits were not barred by the political question doctrine,at,and that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged article iii standing,at.
turning to the merits,the second circuit held that all plaintiffs had stated a claim under the federal common law of nuisance.at.for this determination,the court relied dominantly on a series of this court decisions holding that states may maintain suits to abate air and water pollution produced by other states or by industry,at see,illinois milwaukee,milwaukee i recognizing right of illinois to sue in federal district court to abate discharge of sewage into lake michigan.
the court of appeals further determined that the clean air act did not displace federal common law.in milwaukee illinois,milwaukee ii,this court held that congress had displaced the federal common law right of action recognized in milwaukee i by adopting amendments to the clean water act,et.that legislation installed an regulatory program,supervised by an expert administrative agency,to deal comprehensively with interstate water pollution.the legislation itself prohibited the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the united states without a permit from a proper permitting authority.milwaukee ii,at citing.at the time of the second circuit decision,by contrast,epa had not yet promulgated any rule regulating greenhouse gases,a fact the court thought dispositive,at.until epa completes the rulemaking process,the court reasoned,we can not speculate as to whether the hypothetical regulation of greenhouse gases under the clean air act would in fact spea k directly to the particular issue raised here by plaintiffs.at.
we granted certiorari.
the petitioners contend that the federal courts lack to adjudicate this case.four members of the court would hold that at least some plaintiffs have article iii standing under massachusetts,which permitted a state to challenge epa refusal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions,at and,further,that no other threshold obstacle bars review four members of the court,adhering to a dissenting opinion in massachusetts,at,or regarding that decision as distinguishable,would hold that none of the plaintiffs have article iii standing.we therefore affirm,by an equally divided court,the second circuit exercise of jurisdiction and proceed to the merits.see nye united states.
there is no federal general common law,erie tompkins,famously recognized.in the wake of erie,however,a keener understanding developed.see generally friendly,in praise of erie and of the new federal common law.erie le ft to the states what ought be left to them,at,and thus required federal courts to follow state decisions on matters of substantive law appropriately cognizable by the states,at.erie also sparked the emergence of a federal decisional law in areas of national concern.at.the new federal common law addresses subjects within national legislative power where congress has so directed or where the basic scheme of the constitution so demands,at.environmental protection is undoubtedly an area within national legislative power,one in which federal courts may fill in statutory interstices,and,if necessary,even fashion federal law.at.as the court stated in milwaukee i when we deal with air and water in their ambient or interstate aspects,there is a federal common law.at.
decisions of this court predating erie,but compatible with the distinction emerging from that decision between general common law and specialized federal common law,friendly,supra,at,have approved federal common law suits brought by one state to abate pollution emanating from another state.see,missouri illinois,permitting suit by missouri to enjoin chicago from discharging untreated sewage into interstate waters new jersey city of new york,ordering new york city to stop dumping garbage off new jersey coast georgia tennessee copper,ordering private copper companies to curtail discharges in tennessee that caused harm in georgia.see also milwaukee i,at decision upholding suit by illinois to abate sewage discharges into lake michigan.the plaintiffs contend that their right to maintain this suit follows inexorably from that line of decisions.
recognition that a subject is meet for federal law governance,however,does not necessarily mean that federal courts should create the controlling law.absent a demonstrated need for a federal rule of decision,the court has taken the prudent course of adopt ing the readymade body of state law as the federal rule of decision until congress strikes a different accommodation.united states kimbell foods,see bank of america nat.trust sav.parnell.and where,as here,borrowing the law of a particular state would be inappropriate,the court remains mindful that it does not have creative power akin to that vested in congress.see missouri illinois,fact that this court must decide does not mean,of course,that it takes the place of a legislature united states standard oil of,holding that federal law determines whether government could secure indemnity from a company whose truck injured a united states soldier,but declining to impose such an indemnity absent action by congress,the primary and most often the exclusive arbiter of federal fiscal affairs 
in the cases on which the plaintiffs heavily rely,states were permitted to sue to challenge activity harmful to their citizens health and welfare.we have not yet decided whether private citizens here,the land trusts or political subdivisions new york city of a state may invoke the federal common law of nuisance to abate pollution.nor have we ever held that a state may sue to abate any and all manner of pollution originating outside its borders.
the defendants argue that considerations of scale and complexity distinguish global warming from the more bounded pollution giving rise to past federal nuisance suits.greenhouse gases once emitted become well mixed in the atmosphere,fed.reg.emissions in new jersey may contribute no more to flooding in new york than emissions in china.brief for petitioners.the plaintiffs,on the other hand,contend that an equitable remedy against the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the united states is in order and not beyond judicial competence.see brief for respondents open space et.and we have recognized that public nuisance law,like common law generally,adapts to changing scientific and factual circumstances.missouri,at adjudicating claim though it did not concern nuisance of the simple kind that was known to the older common law see also,duhme fdic,jackson,concurring federal courts are free to apply the traditional technique of decision when fashioning federal common law.
we need not address the parties dispute in this regard.for it is an academic question whether,in the absence of the clean air act and the epa actions the act authorizes,the plaintiffs could state a federal common law claim for curtailment of greenhouse gas emissions because of their contribution to global warming.any such claim would be displaced by the federal legislation authorizing epa to regulate emissions.
w hen congress addresses a question previously governed by a decision rested on federal common law,the court has explained,the need for such an unusual exercise of by federal courts disappears.milwaukee ii,at holding that amendments to the clean water act displaced the nuisance claim recognized in milwaukee i.legislative displacement of federal common law does not require the same sort of evidence of a clear and manifest congressional purpose demanded for preemption of state law,at.d ue regard for the presuppositions of our embracing federal system as a promoter of democracy,at quoting san diego building trades council garmon,does not enter the calculus,for it is primarily the office of congress,not the federal courts,to prescribe national policy in areas of special federal interest.tva hill.the test for whether congressional legislation excludes the declaration of federal common law is simply whether the statute speak s directly to the question at issue.mobil oil higginbotham,see milwaukee ii,at county of oneida oneida indian nation of.
we hold that the clean air act and the epa actions it authorizes displace any federal common law right to seek abatement of emissions from fired power plants.massachusetts made plain that emissions of carbon dioxide qualify as air pollution subject to regulation under the act,at.and we think it equally plain that the act speaks directly to emissions of carbon dioxide from the defendants plants.
section of the act directs the epa administrator to list categories of stationary sources that in her judgment caus e,or contribut e significantly to,air which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.b a.once epa lists a category,the agency must establish standards of performance for emission of pollutants from new or modified sources within that category.b b see also a.and,most relevant here,d then requires regulation of existing sources within the same category for existing sources,epa issues emissions guidelines,see,in compliance with those guidelines and subject to federal oversight,the states then issue performance standards for stationary sources within their jurisdiction,d.
the act provides multiple avenues for enforcement.see county of oneida,at reach of remedial provisions is important to determination whether statute displaces federal common law.epa may delegate and enforcement authority to the states,c,d,but the agency retains the power to and monitor regulated sources,to impose administrative penalties for noncompliance,and to commence civil actions against polluters in federal court.c,d.in specified circumstances,the act criminal penalties on any person who knowingly violates emissions standards issued under.see c.and the act provides for private enforcement.if states or epa fail to enforce emissions limits against regulated sources,the act permits any person to bring a civil enforcement action in federal court.a.
if epa does not set emissions limits for a particular or source of pollution,states and private parties may petition for a rulemaking on the matter,and epa response will be reviewable in federal court.see b massachusetts,at.as earlier noted,see supra,at,epa is currently engaged in a rulemaking to set standards for greenhouse gas emissions from fired power plants.to settle litigation brought under b by a group that included the majority of the plaintiffs in this very case,the agency agreed to complete that rulemaking by may.fed.reg.the act itself thus provides a means to seek limits on emissions of carbon dioxide from domestic power plants the same relief the plaintiffs seek by invoking federal common law.we see no room for a parallel track.
the plaintiffs argue,as the second circuit held,that federal common law is not displaced until epa actually exercises its regulatory authority,until it sets standards governing emissions from the defendants plants.we disagree.
the sewage discharges at issue in milwaukee ii,we do not overlook,were subject to effluent limits set by epa under the displacing statute,e very point source discharge of water pollution was prohibited unless covered by a permit.at emphasis deleted.as milwaukee ii made clea
