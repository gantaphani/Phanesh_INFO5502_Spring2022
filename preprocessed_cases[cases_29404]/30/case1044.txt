alfredo kuba demonstrates on behalf of animal rights at the cow palace the palace every year,when the circus or the rodeo is playing there.the palace,a performance facility,located just south of san francisco,is owned by the state of california and operated by district agricultural association the association.
in,the board of directors of the association adopted a first amendment expression policy the policy,which prohibits individuals from demonstrating outside the palace except in designated free expression zones,none of which is near an entrance to the building.kuba maintains that these free expression zones do not allow demonstrators access to patrons of the palace adequate to allow engaging in conversation or handing out leaflets.he challenged the policy in federal district court,both facially and as applied to him,as violative of the first amendment,the equal protection and due process clauses of the federal constitution,and the free speech,equal protection,and due process protections of the california constitution.
both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court held the policy a permissible time,place and manner regulation,dismissed kuba motion for summary judgment,granted the association motion,and dismissed kuba complaint with prejudice.kuba timely appealed.we reverse.
factual background 
the district agricultural association is a governmental entity created by the state of california to hold fairs and exhibitions and to manage recreational and cultural facilities.cal.food agric.code.the association organizes and produces the grand national rodeo and stock show at the cow palace and rents out the arena to private promoters for other events,such as the ringling brothers barnum and bailey circus.
the association adopted its first amendment expression policy in,amending it in and this policy defines demonstration as 
individual or group display of signs other than specifically allowed herein,picketing,leafleting,collection of signatures or marching and any group activity involving the communication of expression,either orally or by conduct of views grievances,and which has the effect and intent or propensity to express that view or grievance to others.demonstration does not include voluntary discussions,with the exception of oral advocacy within feet from any point along the front entrance in the fire zones or individuals wearing small buttons less than in diameter or symbolic clothing,which clothing does not include pictures or lettering.
the policy also provides for the creation of free expression zones onsite for purposes of demonstrations.such a zone is defined as a designated area located onsite as established by the association board of directors,at which members of the public shall have reasonable access to visitors to the cow palace for purposes of conducting demonstrations.
oddly enough,the policy never explicitly prohibits demonstrating outside the designated free speech areas however,for a number of reasons,we construe the policy as if it contained such an outright prohibition.the policy does state that no one utilizing the free expression zone shall leave said zone for purposes of demonstrating or continuing any activities originated in the free expression zone emphasis added.also,the association findings with respect to demonstrations,which are included in the policy,indicate that the purpose of the policy is to permit individuals to demonstrate only in free expression zones.if individuals were free to demonstrate anywhere regardless of the designated free expression zones,those zones would hardly accomplish the goals of balanc ing the interest of the demonstrators in being given access to the patrons of the cow palace,and the safety of the patrons and prevention of accidents or congestion that could lead to injury,and balanc ing the interests of those who wish to engage in activities under the first amendment versus the patrons of various events who may no t wish to receive or participate in that message.in its brief to this court,the association describes the policy as restricting first amendment activities to free expression zones.therefore,in effect,if not in so many words,the policy does prohibit demonstration outside of the free expression zones.
in implementing the policy,the association created three free expression zones.these zones lie on the perimeter of what is called the preferred parking lot,the lot located directly in front of the main doors of the arena.two zones are by feet and one is by feet.the zones are between and feet away from the main entrance doors to the arena 
zone is located near the main automobile entrance to the cow palace from geneva avenue.signs and banners displayed in zone are visible to people riding in vehicles that enter from geneva avenue.this zone is also along the pathway of those who enter the cow palace on foot,including individuals who take public transportation to the palace.according to kuba declaration,this zone provides reasonable opportunity to communicate with patrons who do come on foot,but the number of people walking in from geneva avenue is very small.
zone is located at the bottom of a stairway leading to a raised walkway and,eventually,the upper parking lot.while this location places demonstrators in the path of those patrons walking to the arena from the upper lot,kuba represents that,because the zone is at the bottom of the stairway,these patrons do not see him until they are right next to him that before he can speak or hand them a leaflet they have already walked past him and that it is therefore very difficult to communicate with patrons from this zone.
zone occupies a parking space at the southernmost end of the preferred lot.this zone is also situated across a from parking section a.according to kuba,only a few of the people who park in parking section a actually pass by zone,and those who do are separated from the demonstrators by barricades and moving cars,making communication virtually impossible.
the policy further states that o rganizations or individuals desiring to demonstrate,within the grounds or parking lot of the cow palace,but excluding the main arena and other enclosed facilities should register with the association.furthermore,r egistration will be granted on a,basis.
finally,under the policy,anyone wishing to demonstrate within the enclosed facility,the cow palace arena and any other enclosed or building or structure on the site may rent an exhibit space.however,t he association maintains the right to assign space within its enclosed facilities on a seniority basis and providing first preference to those exhibitors who by subject matter are related to the overall theme or subject of the association sponsored or controlled event.
the policy does not mention any practice of renting parking spaces to exhibitors.the declaration and deposition of michael wegher,chief executive officer of the cow palace,state,however,that parking spaces in the preferred lot are available for rent on the same basis as exhibit spaces within the arena.accordingly,as for exhibit spaces,the association can give first preference to those vendors wishing to rent parking spaces who are related to the show,offer products and services which are consistent with the nature of the event.when asked whether the association would rent a parking space to someone intending to sell reading,boycott the rodeo,wegher responded,certainly it would be in our best interest to do that,would it i do think we would allow them to have show merchandise that would do that,neither would we allow them to have offensive,politically incorrect bumper stickers 
in november,kuba was prohibited from demonstrating in the walkway to the entrance of the arena.according to kuba,on the very same day,a radio station representative was allowed to hand out leaflets advertising the radio station directly in front of the arena entrance.
ii.analysis 
eleventh amendment immunity and federal jurisdiction 
the association claims,in passing,that it is immune from suit under the eleventh amendment.itsi tv productions,agricultural ass ns,cir,holds otherwise.that case held that california agricultural associations were not arms of the state,and thus were not immune from suit under the eleventh amendment.id.at.as appellee is an agricultural association,it is not immune from suit 
we also conclude that the district court properly asserted supplemental jurisdiction over kuba claim under the liberty of speech clause of the california constitution nonfederal claims are part of the same case as federal claims when they derive from a common nucleus of operative fact and are such that a plaintiff would ordinarily be expected to try them in one judicial proceeding.trs.of the constr.indus.laborers health welfare desert valley landscape,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,the california constitutional claims challenge exactly the same actions as the federal claims.the district court did not err in exerting its supplemental jurisdiction over kuba claims under the california constitution.
first amendment and california liberty of speech clause challenges 
kuba appeals both the grant of summary judgment in favor of the association and the denial of summary judgment in kuba favor.we have jurisdiction with regard to both determinations and review both de novo.padfield aig life ins,cir.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.delta sav.bank united states,cir.
in his complaint,kuba challenged,both as it applies to him and on its face,the association policy of restricting all demonstration at the palace to the designated free expression zones.a facial challenge alleges that any enforcement of the ordinance creates an unacceptable risk of the suppression of ideas.foti city of menlo park,cir.an challenge alleges that the restriction on speech is unconstitutional as applied to the litigant particular speech activity,even though the law may be capable of valid application to others.id.we begin by addressing kuba facial challenge.
kuba facial challenge under the california constitution 
initially,we must determine if the california constitution provides independent support for kuba claim.carreras city of anaheim,cir.if so,we will be able to avoid the determination of any federal constitutional issues and thus abide by the doctrine that federal courts should not decide federal constitutional issues when alternative grounds yielding the same relief are available.id.
the california constitution provides protections for speakers in some respects broader than provided by the first amendment of the federal constitution see,los angeles alliance for survival city of los angeles,cal th,d.the standard under the california constitution for whether a particular area is a public forum is one aspect of constitutional law in which the california constitution varies from its federal cousin.under either foundational document,however,p ermissible restrictions on expression in public fora must be,be narrowly tailored to serve an important government interest,and leave open ample alternative channels for the communication of the message.galvin hay,cir.
public forum 
under california liberty of speech clause 
the public forum doctrine is not limited to traditional public forums such as streets,sidewalks,and parks or to sites dedicated to communicative activity such as municipal theaters.rather,the test under california law is whether the communicative activity is basically incompatible with the normal activity of a particular place at a particular time.
carreras,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in carreras this court held that the parking areas and pedestrian walkways outside anaheim stadium and the exterior walkways of the nearby convention center were public fora.at.in that case,the communicative activity that had been restricted was solicitation of donations by the international society for krishna consciousness of laguna beach,iskcon.id.at.we held that the city had offered no evidence that iskcon solicitation interfered with the success of the stadium as a business enterprise,and that the mere annoyance to patrons of having to respond to iskcon attempts to solicit donations did not establish incompatibility.id.at.the exterior of the anaheim stadium including its parking lots and pedestrian and the convention center walkways were therefore public fora under the california constitution.
carreras dictates our conclusion here regarding whether the area in question is a public forum.as in the areas involved in carreras,the public is free to come and go in the parking lots and on the walkways around the cow palace,as people travel over the parking lot and walkways to attend events or exhibitions.id.at.also,t he purposes of the locations are very facilitation of parking and the free flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.id.
further,like the city in carreras,the association has provided no evidence that kuba protest activity or protest activity generally is a threat to the financial success of the palace,or is in any other respect more than a mere annoyance to cow palace patrons.annoyance and inconvenience,however,are a small price to pay for preservation of our most cherished right.id.at quoting wirta costa transit,cal d.we hold that protest activity is not inherently incompatible with the activity to which the parking lots and outside the cow palace are dedicated,and that those areas are therefore public fora for purposes of california liberty of speech clause analysis.
this holding,however,does not give demonstrators free rein in the cow palace.the association may impose reasonable time,place,and manner restrictions on demonstrators activities,so long as these restrictions also pass constitutional muster.california formulation of the time,place,and manner test was fashioned from a long line of united states supreme court cases.los angeles alliance for survival,d,at,internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore apply federal time,place and manner standards.see savage trammell crow,d,see also ward rock against racism,d our cases make clear that even in a public forum the government may impose reasonable restrictions on the time,place,or manner of protected speech heffron int l soc y for krishna consciousness,d t he activities of iskcon,like those of others protected by the first amendment,are subject to reasonable time,place,and manner restrictions.
time,place,and manner restrictions 
restrictions on the time,place,or manner of speech are reasonable provided the restrictions are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,and that they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.ward,at.quoting clark cmty.for creative,d.the failure to satisfy any single prong of this test invalidates the requirement.grossman city of portland,cir.
kuba does not argue that the policy is,and,at least on its face,it is not.we therefore begin our inquiry by looking at whether the association proved its policy was narrowly tailored to achieve a significant governmental interest.
significant governmental interest 
the association asserts that it has a significant governmental interest in preventing traffic congestion and ensuring the safety of pedestrians and drivers alike.these interests are indeed significant,as many cases have recognized.see,heffron,at.because the fair attracts large crowds,it is apparent that the state interest in the orderly movement and control of such an assembly of persons is a substantial consideration.foti,at reiterating that the and state interests of promoting traffic and pedestrian safety are substantial weinberg city of chicago,cir there is no doubt the city has a legitimate interest in protecting its citizens and ensuring that its streets and are safe for everyone.its interest in maintaining the flow of pedestrian traffic is intertwined with the concern for public safety.citation omitted.we follow this long line of cases and hold that the association interests in pedestrian and traffic safety,as well as in preventing traffic congestion,are significant 
as the seventh circuit stressed in analyzing a challenge to a restriction on speech outside a public entertainment facility,merely invoking interests in regulating traffic around an exhibit or performance facility is insufficient.weinberg,at.the government must also show that the proposed communicative activity endangers those interests.id.at.
in weinberg,the seventh circuit faced a city ordinance banning peddling within feet of the united center,a sports arena.like the association,the city of chicago justified its ban as necessary to protect its citizens and ensur e that its streets and sidewalks are safe for everyone.at.the court recognized that such an interest was substantial.id.at.it held,nonetheless,that the city ha d not appropriately demonstrated that weinberg or any other peddler creates the problems the city asserts they cause.id.specifically 
the city of chicago has provided no objective evidence that traffic flow on the sidewalk or street is disrupted when weinberg sells his book.the city offered no empirical studies,no police records,no reported injuries,nor evidence of any lawsuits filed.the city also fails to explain why there were no disturbances or problems when weinberg was selling his book during the period prior to enforcement of the ordinance or after the lower court granted the temporary restraining order.using a speech restrictive blanket with little or no factual justification flies in the face of preserving one of our most cherished rights.as weinberg notes,the only evidence the city offered was based on speculation as to what might happen if booksellers could sell their books and the cumulative effect this might have on pedestrian traffic.
id.at.because,i n the context of a first amendment challenge under the narrowly tailored test,the government has the burden of showing that there is evidence supporting its proffered justification,id.at,the court held the ordinance unconstitutional.see also lim city of long beach,cir traditionally and logically,the party seeking to restrict protected speech has the burden of justifying that restriction.
the association here similarly failed to meet its burden of proving that demonstrators handing out leaflets and carrying signs on the parking lots and walkways outside the cow palace would cause the congestion and danger to safety the association alleges.in his deposition,wegher stated that,other than during the rodeo and the circus,there are only one or two days a year in which even a single demonstrator shows up at the cow palace.during the rodeo and circus,wegher estimated that there was at least one demonstrator for only three or four days of the rodeo and two or three days of the circus.thus,although the validity of this regulation need not be judged solely by reference to kuba demonstration,clark cmty.for creative,d,the actual experience at the cow palace indicating how many protesters have shown up in the past is pertinent to judging the likely impact of allowing communication activity in the future.
where,as here,the governmental entity has no basis in the record for expecting more than a handful of protestors to show up,the significance of the state interest in the congestion and safety issues is questionable.absent some reason to suppose that even a few protestors present these dangers,the association necessarily has difficulty meeting its burden regarding the significance of its asserted interest.also bringing into question the significance of the state interest in limiting protestors is the evidence showing that radio stations have given out buttons or promotional material on the walkway and that individuals often sell programs and concessions outside the ticket office.there is no record of harm or safety concerns caused by such activity in the supposedly congested areas.this void in the record belies the association claim that a demonstrator handing out leaflets would contribute to the harm alleged.
the association,via wegher declaration,does assert what could be considered a first hand account,as opposed to mere speculation,of the problem of congestion.wegher states that 
there is simply no space in the fire lanes or the concrete apron in which it would be safe to place a zone or series of demonstrators who would remain for any length of time.as mentioned above,the vestibule is used for persons buying tickets,picking up tickets,meeting friends,smoking outside,waiting for rides,being dropped off from rides,or just watching the proceedings.some shows have both afternoon and evening performances.there are occasions when the afternoon crowd is exiting the facility while the evening crowd is arriving.this entire area including the fire lane and concrete apron can become extremely congested as people rapidly move in and out of the facility.
although this declaration supports a conclusion that congestion is already a problem in some outdoor areas surrounding the arena,it does not prove that the addition of a handful of individuals in any of the outdoor areas other than the designated zones would substantially exacerbate the problem.
wegher also states that the association once allowed demonstrators to form a line along the edge of the preferred parking lot at the border of parking lot a.we did note that a large number of persons entering from parking lot a in large part tried to avoid the demonstrators,and there was some increased congestion and impediment to persons trying to reach the front doors because of its activity.this very general statement does not show that some increased congestion and impediment was anything more than a minor annoyance.obviously,if there are four more people in an area than there would be otherwise,the area is to that degree more crowded and the passersby are to that degree more impeded,in that they ca stand where the protestors are standing.wegher statement concerning some increase in congestion is thus a tautology.without more,we can not say that the evidence establishes a significant governmental interest in avoiding congestion and protecting the public safety.yet,there is nothing more.like the city in weinberg,the association offers no studies or evidence of actual traffic flow and density.at.
in sum,we doubt the association has demonstrated with sufficient precision how kuba and the handful of other demonstrators would contribute significantly to the congestion and traffic danger if allowed to demonstrate in any area other than the designated free expression zones.after all,kuba is not asking to protest in an area that he would otherwise be unable to access had kuba attended the rodeo as a spectator rather than a protestor his mere presence also would have contributed somewhat to the congestion and impediment of the other patrons.
we do not mean to suggest,of course,that the association could not prevent demonstrations that do prevent patrons of the cow palace from entering or leaving the facility,or that interfere with drivers circling the lot for a parking space.common sense tells us that demonstrators walking in front of moving cars could present a safety problem,as could demonstrators blocking patrons paths.but ordinary traffic regulation,including prohibiting demonstrators as well as others from blocking cars or impeding pedestrians,responds to those concerns.the undeniable need for traffic regulations,and for enforcement of those regulations,does not demonstrate that there is a significant state interest in banning the protestors entirely except in a few small zones 
ii.narrow tailoring 
even if we assume the association did provide sufficient support for its asserted interest in congestion and traffic safety,the association free expression zones policy is not adequately narrowly tailored.a regulation of the time,place,or manner of protected speech must be narrowly tailored to serve the government legitimate,interests,but it need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of doing so.ward,at.nevertheless,the restriction must promote a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation,and must not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government legitimate
