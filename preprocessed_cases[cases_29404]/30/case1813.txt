in this case we decide that the california fish and game commission the commission erred in rejecting at the threshold a petition to add the california tiger salamander to the commission list of endangered species,under the california endangered species act cesa.fish,et under cesa a petition for listing must be accepted for consideration if it is supported by sufficient information to lead a reasonable person to conclude there is a substantial possibility the requested listing could occur.natural resources defense council fish game com.th,d natural resources defense council.the information in the administrative record shows the salamander species does not breed prolifically,is vulnerable to several significant threats,has lost most of its original habitat,and has been displaced by a hybrid from a significant portion of its range.the commission criticism of parts of this showing is not sufficient to support its finding that a reasonable person would conclude there is no substantial possibility that listing could occur.
the petition was brought by the center for biological diversity the center.the commission rejected the petition,finding it does not provide sufficient information to indicate that any cesa listing may be warranted.the trial court granted the center request for a writ of mandate,overturning the rejection decision and directing the commission to enter a new decision accepting the species as a candidate for listing pursuant to section,subdivision a.the commission appeals from the judgment,contending the trial court erred in overturning its rejection of the petition.finding no prejudicial error,we shall affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
when a petition for listing a species as endangered or threatened is submitted under the cesa,it must be referred to the department of fish and game the department.the department evaluates the petition and other relevant information and submits its written evaluation report to the commission,with a recommendation on whether the petition should be accepted for consideration or summarily rejected.our account of the information concerning the petition and the department recommendations is taken from the department written evaluation report hereafter the department report,supplemented by the transcript of the hearing and written submissions.
information adduced concerning the petitioned listing 
the california tiger salamander species occurs only in california.the species is a member of the mole salamander family with six genetically distinct units in california.the species occurred historically in or near vernal pools in the central valley and foothills of the sierra nevada and coast range from colusa county south to tulare and santa barbara counties.to avoid drying out,salamanders spend most of their life in the occupied or recently deserted burrows of small mammals,california ground squirrels,valley pocket gophers,and voles.although the species still occurs within many areas of its historic range,natural breeding wetland and adjacent dry land habitat within the historical range has been significantly reduced and fragmented.vernal pool complexes are the most important type of habitat for breeding.approximately to percent of historical vernal pool landscapes statewide have been lost.salamander populations largely remain only in the areas at the margin of their ecological requirements,because much of the valley habitat has been eliminated.
until the fall rains begin,adult salamanders reside underground in small mammal burrows.the start of the fall rains,usually between october and november,initiates the onset of nocturnal migrations to pools to breed.salamanders will generally not move to ponds to breed if weather conditions are unfavorable,drought,atypical timing of rainfall.larval salamanders eat aquatic invertebrates,snails and tadpoles.juvenile and adult salamanders feed on aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates.both natural and artificial ponds,stock ponds are used by salamanders for breeding.however,many artificial ponds contain introduced fishes and bullfrogs.thus,salamanders are generally restricted to large vernal pools as the most important breeding habitat.
at the commission hearing,brad shaffer gave two additional reasons why vernal pools are by far and away the best breeding sites.first,they are very stable terrain features,with lifetimes of hundreds of thousands of years.and second,they support a better,higher quality prey base,a community of invertebrates that salamanders evolved with.
after adults breed,they return to the dry land habitat.when the pools begin to dry,metamorphosed juveniles migrate to the dry land habitat to live and to estivate,the summer analog of hibernation.most,percent,of the adults disperse to within feet,and percent of subadults to within approximately feet,of the breeding pond.
at the commission hearing,shaffer said this degree of dispersal demonstrated the need for significant areas of terrestrial habitat.he said that,in order to protect a healthy intact breeding population,it was necessary to preserve hundreds of acres of terrestrial habitat around each breeding site.he said that one study,reported in a reputable scientific journal,had conducted a computer simulation about the effects of the size of terrestrial habitat surrounding a vernal pool,of which there are not too many left,on the stability of the salamander population.the simulation used all the known breeding biology information about salamanders.it found that as surrounding habitat was reduced,the population became smaller and more at risk.at feet,roughly a quarter of a mile,the population would eventually dwindle to breeding females.at feet,the number is one breeding female.at feet,the number is zero.
the department report concluded the primary threat to salamanders is destruction and modification of habitat due to a variety of causes.a lesser threat is competition for food from,and predation by,nonnative animals,including the nonnative bullfrog and nonnative predatory fishes,especially in ponds that persist for more than two years,stock ponds.unless introductions of these nonnative species are curtailed and existing populations are actively removed,their continued presence likely precludes salamander use of these habitats.
another serious threat is hybridization with the nonnative waterdog,an eastern tiger salamander formerly imported into california as live fish bait and now established as wild populations in various locations hybrid or pure nonnative tiger salamanders are widespread among known localities of salamanders in the central coast and bay area populations.acreages of potentially suitable habitat in these two populations threatened by hybridization constitute percent of the potentially suitable habitat.at the commission hearing,shaffer said that in one of the two big blocks of habitat clara,monterey,san benito,to northern san luis obispo counties for all intents and purposes,every salamander is a hybrid.lesser threats may also include diseases,contaminants,and agricultural practices.
limited scientific data is available on the abundance of individual populations of salamanders,and there is no comprehensive,population estimate the difficulty of estimating total population size has been documented by several researchers.counts of adults appearing at breeding ponds each year do not necessarily reflect true variation in actual adult population size of salamanders.salamanders may skip breeding in unfavorable years or switch breeding sites regularly.these factors led the department to the conclusion that,absent monitoring data produced by a scientifically designed study,attempting to estimate the total population size is not appropriate.the department does not believe the number of salamanders can be accurately estimated,or that such estimates are essential to a determination that they may be in serious danger of extinction.
the central california tiger salamander coalition the coalition,an opponent of the petition,opined that data shows that there are over adult salamanders and noted that the number of known locations for salamanders has increased in recent years.the department report replied that earlier studies indicated that the average number of salamanders was nearer to per site,resulting in an estimate of less than individuals statewide.
malcolm sproul,with the environmental planning consulting firm of lsa associates,lsa,explained the coalition population claim at the commission hearing.lsa estimated that each known salamander location has an average of over salamanders by counting as an adult every salamander after metamorphosis from the larval stage.multiplied by the known salamander locations,this definition results in a population as high as to.
shaffer responded to the coalition population claim at the commission hearing,as follows.from a demographic perspective,the important population number is the number of breeding females applying a demographer statistic called the harmonic mean to a very representative sample of ponds,studied over a period,produces a figure of females per active breeding pond.the figure that sproul used for known salamander locations,ponds,is a mix of healthy,breeding ponds and also locations where one dead salamander was found on a road and recorded as an observation.the department had estimated that of the sites,or to,are healthy breeding ponds.about a quarter of these are nonnative hybrid salamander sites.with these discounts,shaffer estimated the number of breeding female salamanders is.
given the lack of both historical and current data about abundance,that salamanders spend most of their life underground,and that only a fraction migrate to breed every year,the department report recommends that existing trend studies should be used to assess the status of the species.some to percent of historical vernal pool habitat has been lost,and at the current rate of loss,the amount would shrink to percent of the historical total by the year.as of,based on both verified museum records and verified sighting data,numerous populations of salamanders have been extirpated,no longer exist in a specific location.
for amphibians,local population dynamics and connectivity of populations are the foundation of the species conservation.maintenance of connected local populations is critical because amphibian populations vary widely in size,have episodic recruitment,are subject to local extinction,and depend on recolonization.dispersal,connectivity of salamanders is impeded where barriers like roads and urban development occur.
isolation of habitats reduces the ability of a single population to recover from a catastrophic extinction event by recolonization from a nearby population.due to the dynamic nature of amphibian populations,dispersal is an important factor in maintaining viable populations across large areas.pond isolation is significant to population persistence within landscapes fragmented by barriers to dispersal such as roads,railroads,and croplands.less than half of the individual salamanders return to breed a second time,so recolonization potential seems less than that of other amphibians with high reproductive output.habitat fragmentation can also impact gene flow among remaining interbreeding populations,putting the genetic vigor and therefore viability of the entire species ultimately at risk.the department report concludes there is evidence of significant loss and fragmentation of known salamander habitat.
human population growth is a threat because salamander habitat destruction and fragmentation results from housing,business,agriculture and associated infrastructure.the petition documents human population growth forecasts of percent and higher for the counties within the salamanders range.however,it does not indicate where this growth will occur within each county relative to known salamander habitat.the department produced its own maps showing where projected growth will occur based on county general plans relative to salamander occurrence and remaining habitat.based on these maps,the department report concludes that effects from growth will be significant primarily in the western portion of the bay area and central valley populations,northern portion of the central valley population,and northeastern portion of the southern san joaquin population.
the coalition representatives argued that the center had not shown that the habitat loss had been severe enough to warrant listing salamanders as an endangered species.they conceded that the discovery of additional known salamander sites did not indicate a growing population.however,they argued that it shows that salamanders are more pervasive in the potential habitat,thus more secure,than previously thought.
they asserted that information on potential future development from general plans for cities and counties contained within the salamanders range shows urbanization really is not a threat of extinction.over percent of the salamanders remaining potential habitat,million acres,and percent of the known salamander locations,are not threatened by planned urban development.approximately of the locations are preserved in public ownership or by other restrictions,a mitigation bank,owned by a conservation organization or protected by a conservation easement.approximately other known locations are designated for nonurban use,primarily grazing land the majority of the anticipated losses are going to be around the existing urban areas.moreover,as to the locations threatened,review under the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et,local land use planning,federal wetlands,and federal endangered species restrictions would require some mitigation.
the petition states that the federal endangered species act of fesa et is inadequate to protect populations of salamanders even when they inhabit waters with species,and that preservation of aquatic habitat does not address the dry land habitat that salamanders require however,the department report notes that subsequent to submission of the petition,all populations of salamanders have been federally listed.despite this observation,the department report does not address whether the federal listing of salamanders could suffice to prevent endangerment.it only comments that the department agrees that existing federally listed species do not provide adequate protection to the salamanders upland habitat.
at the hearing the department spokesperson was asked to address the effect of federal listing.she replied as follows.at present there were jointly listed species.joint listing brings more creativity and resources,including funding,to bear on solutions to recovery and conservation actions.state standards like full mitigation are,in some instances,more restrictive than fesa.the department has biologists in the field actually more available to work with people than typically the federal government is.
robert uram,on behalf of the coalition,asserted that the federal listing of salamanders eliminated the need for state listing.he said that the protection under the federal act provides greater emphasis on habitat protection than cesa.
the commission decision and findings 
the commission voted three to two to reject the petition on the ground that it provides insufficient information to indicate that listing may be warranted.on december,the commission adopted a statement of findings explaining its decision.the findings,in the main,consist of criticisms of the sufficiency of the petition and supporting information.a summary of the commission findings follows.
there is insufficient information on population trends for salamanders.studies finding a dramatic decline in population surveyed only a very limited portion of the total range or used questionable sampling methods,providing a species population status report that is potentially inaccurate and misleading.the best available data for status assessment is the coalition information,which provides credible evidence that the salamander population trend is not necessarily declining.the increase in identified localities or sites may reflect a larger than expected population,or an increase in the population.
reliance on loss of native wetland habitat is unpersuasive because the petition fails to provide credible information that salamanders presently or historically occupy much of this hypothetical or presumptive habitat.little or no evidence was presented by the center actually correlating salamanders within the actual habitat allegedly being impacted.
the petition provides no actual data on population abundance.instead,the petition relies on an inference that the massive documented decrease in the potential habitat has caused overall population decline.it also states that there are difficulties involved in estimating population numbers.anecdotal information can not be used to accurately establish abundance or population trends.absent an accurate assessment of the historic or current population of a species,any determination of threat to the species would be speculation.
the center claims the species can not now be found in much of its hypothetical range and appears pushed into narrow bands of habitat.however,without an accurate assessment of the current population abundance,it is difficult,if not impossible,to establish population trends for that species,and any determination of threat to the species is purely guesswork.
historical data in particular is unavailable for many species.gaps in information are not necessarily fatal to a petition to list a species,provided the commission at this point in the process can discern,despite the factual uncertainties,a substantial possibility that the species is in serious danger of extinction.but the information about habitat loss was not compelling enough to overcome the other deficiencies in the data and analysis presented by the center.
section provides that petitions shall include information regarding the degree and immediacy of threat,and the impact of existing management efforts the petition lacks sufficient information on both of these components.
the federal listing,other federally listed species with overlapping critical habitat,recently approved habitat conservation plans,the federal clean water act,california act and ceqa have the effect of reducing threats to salamanders.although there may be some reason for concern,the petition provides insufficient evidence to persuade the commission that the petitioned action may be warranted.this ends our summary of the commission findings.
proceedings in the trial court 
on february,the center filed the petition for writ of mandate in the superior court initiating this action.on september,the matter came on for hearing and was submitted.on december,the trial court issued a detailed ruling explaining its view that the administrative record lacked sufficient evidence to support the commission decision rejecting the petition.a summary of the trial court ruling follows.
the commission findings discounting the petition allegations of a declining trend in the salamander population misstate the objective of the shaffer study,which was an examination of the extent of the salamanders range,and disregard the other studies discussed in the petition and the department report,which find a decline in population.the united states fish and wildlife service usfws regulatory listing of salamander populations in the administrative record was based on scientific studies and analyses concluding that salamander populations and habitat have declined.nothing in the record suggests that these scientific studies,analyses and conclusions are scientifically flawed.
the commission findings discounting the petition allegations of salamander habitat loss to development activities mischaracterize or omit relevant evidence and analysis.research cited in the petition documents the destruction and fragmentation of habitat relative to urban development.figures in the department report represent this research graphically,showing the relationship between known locations or occurrences to existing urban areas,locations of identified future planned growth,and locations of existing intensive agriculture.
the commission finding that threat to survival can not be found without accurate population abundance data ignores the department analysis that negative salamander population trends can be and have been reliably estimated from locality records without historical or current population abundance estimates.scientific literature indicates that information about past distribution from historical occurrence data can be used to infer a decline in distributions from historical and projected loss of habitat.the usfws used similar analytical methodology based on threats to habitat associated with known salamander occurrences to determine population decline and threat to survival.
the commission findings relied upon the coalition population abundance data without regard to the significant doubts about the data scientific value raised in the department report.the commission found that the coalition population data provided credible evidence that the salamander population is not endangered throughout all or a significant portion of its range.the commission took no account of criticisms of this information by the department and the usfws and credited it over analyses of population decline.
the commission findings related to the degree and immediacy of threat to salamander survival ignore the considerable evidence in the administrative record of threats posed to salamander survival by hybridization with nonnative salamanders imported into california as fish bait and the threat to survival from nonnative predator species such as bullfrogs and mosquito fish.
the commission findings regarding the reduction of threats to salamander survival by existing regulatory mechanisms do not take into account the information and analysis in the administrative record of inadequacies in the protections afforded to the salamander and its habitat by the regulatory mechanisms.state policy is advanced by the joint efforts and resources of the department and the usfws in developing and implementing actions for the recovery of the species.this ends the summary of the trial court ruling.
the commission appeals from the ensuing judgment issuing a peremptory writ directing the commission to grant the center petition to list salamanders as a candidate species.
discussion 
the commission contends that the trial court erred in various respects in its ruling and in criticizing the commission administrative findings and supporting reasoning.the commission argues that some of the trial court criticism is unfair,unwarranted,or immaterial and shows the trial court mistook the standard of review.the center argues the trial court criticism of the commission findings is warranted and that evidence in favor of listing salamanders as endangered is overwhelming.
the question is whether the commission decision is supported by substantial evidence.the trial court was governed by that test.as we must answer the same question as the trial court,we focus on the findings of the commission rather than the ruling of the trial court.see cal.admin.mandamus ed.the commission made various subordinate findings,identifying perceived deficiencies in the showing in favor of accepting the petition and endorsing the showing in opposition.however,the critical question is not whether these subordinate findings have any merit.it is rather,whether they warrant the ultimate,statutory finding required to reject the petition.
the standard for accepting a petition for consideration is sufficient information to indicate that the petitioned action may be warranted,subd.a.as we explained in natural resources defense council,supra,th at page,d,the term sufficient information in section means that amount of information,when considered with the department written report and the comments received,that would lead a reasonable person to conclude the petitioned action may be warranted.the phrase may be warranted is appropriately characterized as a substantial possibility that listing could occur.natural resources defense council,supra,at,d.substantial possibility,in turn,means something more than the reasonable possibility test for an environmental impact report but does not require that listing be more likely than not.ibid.
here,the petition was rejected at the for consideration threshold.the commission c
