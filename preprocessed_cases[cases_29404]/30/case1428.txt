the american bird conservancy and forest conservation council petition for review of an order by the commission denying in part and dismissing in part their petition seeking protection of migratory birds from collisions with communications towers in the gulf coast region.in re petition by forest conservation council,american bird conservancy and friends of the earth for national environmental policy act compliance order.their petition claimed that commission rules and procedures for approving new towers failed to comport with the national environmental policy act nepa,et,the endangered species act esa,et,and the migratory bird treaty act mbta,et.we vacate the order because the commission failed to apply the proper nepa standard,to provide a reasoned explanation on consultation under the esa,and to provide meaningful notice of pending tower applications.
concerned about the effect of tower kill on migratory birds in the gulf coast region of the united states,petitioners,on august,formally requested that the commission,among other things,i prepare an environmental impact statement eis under nepa analyzing the effects of all past,present,and reasonably foreseeable tower registrations on migratory birds in the gulf coast region ii initiate formal consultation with the united states fish and wildlife service fws pursuant to the esa regarding the gulf coast towers impact on various bird species and iii take steps in accordance with the mbta to reduce bird mortality at gulf coast tower sites.petitioners also requested that they be provided notice of and an opportunity to comment on proposed gulf coast tower registration applications before they are granted.
while the gulf coast petition was pending,the commission commenced a nationwide proceeding in a new docket.on august,it issued a notice of inquiry to gather evidence regarding communications towers impact on migratory birds throughout the united states,and to determine whether to change its current rules and processes to better protect migratory birds.see in re effects of communications towers on migratory birds,notice of inquiry.in response,the commission received more than comments expressing divergent views on the law and the facts,including the frequency of fatal collisions and the overall effect on migratory bird populations.environmental groups claimed that towers kill million to million birds per year,see,american bird conservancy comments at,wt docket,while industry groups claimed that such claims are overstated,see,cellular telecommunications internet association and national association of broadcasters comments at,wt docket.
in april,seeking to compel the commission to act on the gulf coast petition,petitioners filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in this court.five days after oral argument,the commission issued the order denying in part,dismissing in part,and deferring in part the gulf coast petition.in dismissing the gulf coast petition,the commission stated that it would address aspects of the migratory bird issue as part of a separate docket examining the issue on a nationwide basis.order,at.the court thereafter dismissed the mandamus case as moot.see in re am.bird conservancy.docket.
in november,the commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in the nationwide proceeding in which it sought further comment on the factual,legal,and policy issues regarding the impact of communications towers on migratory birds.in re effects of communications towers on migratory birds,notice of proposed rulemaking nprm.the commission asked generally whether the impact warrants commission action under the environmental statutes,id.at,and expressed uncertainty about the underlying facts,seeking further comment supported by evidence regarding the number of migratory birds killed annually by communications towers,id.at.it also sought comments on the legal framework governing the commission obligations in this area,id.at,and on how to define significant environmental effects in this context.additionally,the commission invited comment on whether it should amend its environmental rules or take action to reduce the number of instances in which migratory birds collide with communications towers.id.at.the commission tentatively proposed that communications towers use medium intensity white strobe lights rather than red lights that may present a higher risk of tower kill.id.at.the comment period in the nationwide rulemaking proceeding closed in may,but the commission has yet to take final action.
meanwhile,in may,petitioners sought review of the order.see a.petitioners have standing,for members of these organizations engage in recreational birdwatching and research on birds in the gulf coast region,see lujan defenders of wildlife,d,and we proceed to review the order to determine whether it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a 
petitioners contend that the mbta,nepa,and esa require changes to the commission rules and procedures regarding communications towers in the gulf coast region.see part.
the mbta provides,with certain exceptions,that it shall be unlawful to pursue,hunt,take,capture,or kill any migratory bird.the court has held that the mbta applies to federal agencies.humane soc y of the united states glickman.petitioners contend that the commission unlawfully takes migratory birds when birds die in collisions with towers and sought to have the commission comply with the mbta by taking steps to reduce or eliminate intentional or unintentional takes of migratory birds.gulf coast petition at.
the commission stated in the order that it was analyzing the mbta issue in the ongoing nationwide proceeding and would therefore defer consideration of the mbta issue to that docket.collisions of birds and towers occur throughout the united states and the nationwide proceeding was designed to obtain additional relevant information.we thus conclude that the commission acted reasonably in deferring consideration of this issue.see mobil oil exploration producing se.united distrib,d see also fcc schreiber,d.
nepa does not impose substantive environmental mandates,but it does require federal agencies to establish procedures to account for the environmental effects of certain proposed actions.see dep t of transp.pub.citizen,d.in particular,for major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,agencies must prepare an eis that examines,among other things,the adverse environmental effects of a proposed action and potential alternatives.c.petitioners contend that nepa requires the commission to prepare a programmatic eis to assess the environmental impact of towers in the gulf coast region.
the regulations issued by the council on environmental quality ceq to implement nepa include as a major federal action approvals by executive branch agencies of specific projects by permit or other regulatory decision.b.the regulations allow agencies to divide their actions into three categories those that ordinarily require an eis those that require an initial,less rigorous environmental assessment ea but not necessarily an eis and those that are categorically excluded and require neither an eis nor an ea.id.b.agencies implementing categorical exclusions shall provide for extraordinary circumstances in which a normally excluded action may have a significant environmental effect.id,b.ceq regulations also provide that an agency should prepare a programmatic eis if actions are connected,cumulative,or similar,such that their environmental effects are best considered in a single impact statement.id.a see also kleppe sierra club,d nevada dep t of energy.
the commission regulations implementing nepa categorically exclude communications towers from environmental processing because towers are deemed individually and cumulatively to have no significant effect on the quality of the human environment.a.however,a party may still allege that a particular action,otherwise categorically excluded,will have a significant environmental effect and can file a petition setting forth in detail the reasons justifying or circumstances necessitating environmental considerations in the process.id.c.if the commission determines that the proposed action may have a significant environmental impact,then it will require the applicant for a tower license to prepare an ea,and also may obtain additional information,id.b.upon analysis of the ea,the commission must do one of two things if the commission determines that the proposed action would not have a significant impact,it will make a finding of no significant impact fonsi,id.d if the ea indicates that the proposed action will have a significant effect upon the environment,the commission must prepare an eis,id.a see also stating that the term a ffecting in nepa means will or may have an effect on.
the commission gave two reasons for dismissing the request for a programmatic eis the lack of specific evidence concerning the impact of towers on the human environment,and the lack of consensus among scientists regarding the impact of communications towers on migratory birds.order,at.neither reason is sufficient to sustain the commission refusal to take action pursuant to nepa,and together they demonstrate an apparent misunderstanding of the nature of the obligation imposed by the statute.
most simply,the order fails to follow the commission own regulations implementing nepa.under c,interested persons can request analysis under nepa of actions that are otherwise categorically excluded.such persons shall submit to the bureau responsible for processing that action a written petition setting forth in detail the reasons justifying or circumstances necessitating environmental consideration in the process.id.the commission bureau must then review the petition and consider the environmental concerns that have been raised.id.if the bureau determines that the action may have a significant environmental impact,the bureau will require the applicant to prepare an ea,which will serve as the basis for the determination to proceed with or terminate environmental processing.id.
the reasons stated in the order can not,in light of the petition under review,sustain the commission refusal to prepare an eis without at least first requiring the preparation of an ea.the commission acknowledges that c applies to the petition,see appellee br.at,and that the regulation requires an ea when an action may have a significant environmental effect,see nprm,at stating that an ea shall be required pursuant to section c or d if the bureau processing an otherwise categorically excluded action finds,in response to a petition or on its own motion,that the proposed construction may have a significant environmental impact.the order demand for definitive evidence of significant petitioners failure to make a scientific showing that the population of any specific bird species has decreased as a result of collisions plainly contravenes the may standard.order,at.similarly,the order suggestion that scientific consensus is a precondition to nepa action is inconsistent with both the commission regulation and with the statute.as the court has admonished,i t must be remembered that the basic thrust of the agency responsibilities under nepa is to predict the environmental effects of a proposed action before the action is taken and those effects fully known.scientists inst.for pub,atomic energy comm n.a precondition of certainty before initiating nepa procedures would jeopardize nepa purpose to ensure that agencies consider environmental impacts before they act rather than wait until it is too late.
based on the record before the court,there is no real dispute that towers may have significant environmental impact,and thus that the c threshold has been met.indeed,the order emphasis on conflicting studies and sharply divergent views regarding the number of birds killed confirms,rather than refutes,that towers may have the requisite effect.order,at.under such circumstances,the commission regulations mandate at least the completion of an ea before the commission may refuse to prepare a programmatic eis.although petitioners seek a programmatic eis,and not an ea,the commission regulations allow it to pursue an ea as an interim step,and such an ea will determine what subsequent action nepa requires.the agency may issue a fonsi pursuant to and d i f on the basis of the ea the agency finds that the proposed action will produce no significant impact on the environment.sierra club peterson,see also,audubon soc y hester,sierra club dep t of,cabinet mountains peak grizzly bears peterson.but if any significant environmental impacts might result from the proposed agency action,then an eis must be prepared before the action is taken.sierra club,at emphasis in original see also,town of cave creek,faa,grand canyon trust faa,blue mountains biodiversity project blackwood,cir north carolina faa,cir citizen advocates for responsible expansion,dole,cir.
we vacate the nepa part of the order.on remand the commission shall address petitioners request that it conduct a programmatic eis based on a threshold for nepa analysis that is less stringent than the order reflects.conflicting data points do not forestall nepa mandate.pursuant to its own regulations,the commission may commence such analysis through the preparation of an ea.
section of the esa requires federal agencies to ensure that any action they authorize,fund,or carry out is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species,or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitats.a.regulations promulgated by the endangered species committee which is comprised of several federal agencies define action to mean all activities or programs of any kind,including the granting of licenses.they also provide that each federal agency shall confer with the fws on any action which is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any proposed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.id.see also a.if an agency determines that an action may affect endangered or threatened species or critical habitats,the agency must initiate formal consultation with the fws,at least unless preparation of a biological assessment or participation in informal consultation indicates that a proposed action is not likely to have an adverse affect.a b.petitioners requested that the commission formally consult with the fws regarding the cumulative effects of towers on endangered and threatened species.
the commission declined to consult with the fws,stating that there is no evidence of any synergies among towers that would cause them cumulatively to have significant environmental impacts that they do not have individually.order,at.the commission reliance on a lack of synergies was not further explained in the order.this explanation was inadequate.the commission has not described what kind of showing in the esa context could demonstrate sufficient environmental effects to justify the programmatic consultation that petitioners seek.short of petitioners conducting a programmatic eis themselves,it is unclear how petitioners could produce sufficient evidence to meet this standard.
we vacate the esa part of the order and remand that issue.
the ceq regulations require agencies to make diligent efforts to involve the public in preparing and implementing their nepa procedures.a.commission regulations permit parties to file petitions for eas to be conducted for the otherwise categorically excluded tower applications.c.petitioners requested that the commission provide adequate public notice of proposed individual tower applications so that they may seek environmental review before the commission acts.
the for the interested parties who wish to file such a petition is that the commission provides public notice of individual tower applications only after approving them.although the commission enjoys wide discretion in fashioning its own procedures,city of angels broadcasting,fcc,it can not evade its duty to comply with the ceq regulations and its own regulations allowing challenges to tower applications by providing the public with a hollow opportunity to participate in nepa procedures.interested persons can not request an ea for
