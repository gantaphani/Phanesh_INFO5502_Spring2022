defendant chemetco,pleaded guilty to violating the clean water act,a.accordingly,the district court sentenced chemetco to pay a fine that was based on the number of days that it violated the clean water act.chemetco now appeals its sentence,arguing that the district court misinterpreted the clean water act and that the district court findings violated the rule set forth in apprendi new jersey,d.
section of the clean water act cwa provides that it is unlawful for any person to discharge a pollutant unless in compliance with the cwa.see a.a person achieves such compliance by obtaining a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit from the united states environmental protection agency or from a qualified state agency.see id.at.
chemetco smelts scrap metal at a foundry located near hartford,illinois in order to recover copper and other valuable products.on september,the illinois environmental protection agency illinois epa issued chemetco a permit allowing construction and operation of a stormwater runoff control system.later that month,contract laborers hired by chemetco installed this system,and pursuant to chemetco instructions,also installed a secret pipe on chemetco property running to an unnamed ditch tributary.the contract laborers then covered exposed sections of this secret pipe with straw.this secret pipe did not appear in any blueprint or drawing kept by chemetco,and chemetco did not have a permit allowing it to discharge pollutants via this pipe.chemetco used this secret pipe to discharge water containing toxic metals such as lead and cadmium until september,when and illinois epa agents witnessed the secret pipe discharging polluted water.
chemetco and six of its managers were indicted in the united states district court for the southern district of illinois on april.count i of the indictment charged chemetco and various managers with conspiring to violate the cwa.count ii charged chemetco and various managers with knowingly violating section of the cwa f rom on or about september to on or about september.finally,counts iii and iv of the indictment charged chemetco and various managers with making false statements to government officials.
on january,chemetco pleaded guilty to counts i and ii and nolo contendere to counts iii and iv.chemetco also stipulated to the facts underlying the plea and waived its right to a jury trial.in the plea agreement,chemetco acknowledged discharging pollutants via the secret pipe during at least some of the time period alleged in the indictment.chemetco also acknowledged that the government would recommend the imposition of a fine for count ii based on the number of days that the violation occurred.section c establishes criminal penalties for knowing violations of section of the cwa any person who knowingly violates section shall be punished by a fine of not less than nor more than per day of violation,or by imprisonment for not more than years,or by both.c b the district court then referred the matter to the probation office for investigation and asked counsel to prepare sentencing memoranda.
chemetco filed its sentencing memorandum on february,in which it averred that both parties agreed that under section of the cwa,chemetco was liable for a fine of to per day of violation before february,and for a fine of to per day of violation thereafter.chemetco then noted that the only disputed issue was the number of days that the violation occurred,and that the district court would resolve this issue at a hearing on march.chemetco claimed that at this hearing,the government would have to prove the number of days that the violation occurred by clear and convincing evidence.chemetco attached tables showing rainfall statistics and explained that the amount of rainfall would affect the number of days on which the secret pipe discharged polluted water.these tables also calculated possible fine ranges based on the rainfall statistics.the tables indicated that there had been days of rain between september,and september.however,chemetco stated that i t may be impossible to determine on how many days an actual discharge occurred.
the government also filed its sentencing memorandum on february.the government recommended fining chemetco for days of days when it rained plus one day,september,when although it did not rain,and illinois epa agents witnessed the secret pipe discharging polluted water.
on march and,the district court held a hearing to determine the violation days.the government maintained that the secret pipe discharged polluted water on the days indicated in its sentencing memorandum.chemetco countered that there were fewer days of violation because the secret pipe did not discharge polluted water on every day that it rained.in support of this contention,chemetco expert witness,kim fock,presented two alternative methodologies for calculating the number of days that the secret pipe discharged polluted water.further,chemetco employees testified that the secret pipe could not have discharged polluted water on every day that it rained because on certain occasions during the period charged in the indictment,the valve to the secret pipe was closed.
with the district court leave,chemetco filed a supplemental sentencing memorandum on march,in which it argued that there were days of violation,yielding a fine range of to.on may,the probation office issued its presentence report psr,in which it discounted chemetco calculation and concluded that there were days of violation,yielding a fine range of to.chemetco filed its first objection to the psr on june,disputing the methodology that the probation office used to calculate the number of days of violation.the probation office responded by filing an addendum to the psr on june,in which it concluded that there were days of violation,yielding a fine range of to.
on august,chemetco filed a second objection to the psr.citing the supreme court recent decision in apprendi,at,chemetco claimed that it had to be charged in the indictment with each day of violation and that the number of days of violation had to be proven by the government beyond a reasonable doubt.in an order dated october,the district court rejected chemetco apprendi objection.the district court found that the indictment,which charged chemetco with violating the cwa f rom on or about september to on or about september,was sufficient given that it informed chemetco of the charges and put chemetco on notice of the potential maximum penalty that the cwa would allow if chemetco discharged pollutants every day during the period that the indictment identified.further,the district court found that apprendi did not apply to this case and,therefore,the number of days of violation under the cwa was a sentencing factor that the court could find by a preponderance of the evidence.
the district court held a sentencing hearing on october.at that hearing,the district court found,by a preponderance of the evidence,that there were days of violation,resulting in a fine range of to.the district court sentenced chemetco to a fine of on count ii,and chemetco now appeals this sentence.
ii.analysis 
the issue in this case is whether the number of days that chemetco violated the cwa is an element of a cwa offense or a sentencing factor.due process requires that the government prove each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt.see apprendi,at.after the government has met this burden and an offender is found guilty of a crime,however,courts can apply sentencing factors based on a preponderance of the evidence in order to increase the offender punishment.see united states,d.thus,whether the number of days that chemetco violated the cwa is an element of a crime or a sentencing factor is important because if the number of violation days belongs in the former category,then it was reversible error for the district court to calculate it based on a preponderance of the evidence.see apprendi,at.
the supreme court has ruled that,within certain constitutional limits,congress can identify which factors are elements of a crime and which are sentencing factors.see id.at.therefore,our first inquiry is in drafting the cwa,co
