on april,kane county initiated this action by filing a complaint against the united states under the quiet title act,seeking to quiet title to two roads,mill creek road and bald knoll road,both of which are located in western kane county,approximately miles northeast of kanab,utah,and cross portions of federal public land the complaint alleged that under a law known as revised statute,kane county had accepted for these two roads on public lands not reserved for public uses.app.at.more specifically,the complaint alleged that kane county had designated both roads as public highways and had expend ed public funds to construct and maintain these roads prior to the october,repeal of.id.in addition,the complaint alleged that both roads had been continuous ly use d as public thoroughfares for a period in excess of ten years prior to the repeal of.id.at.the first claim alleged in the complaint sought to quiet title to kane county purported public highway for the mill creek r oad,includ ing a width of feet id.at.the second claim alleged in the complaint sought,in similar fashion,to quiet title to kane county purported public highway for bald knoll road,includ ing a width of feet id.at.
on july,the united states filed an answer asserting six specific defenses to the two claims alleged in kane county complaint the district court lack ed jurisdiction over the subject matter of th e action due to kane county failure to satisfy the particularity requirement of the quiet title act and thereby invoke a waiver of the united states sovereign immunity under the act,id.at the district court lack ed jurisdiction over the subject matter of th e action due to kane county failure to allege facts sufficient to show that it c ould satisfy the statute of limitations set forth in the quiet title act,the district court lack ed jurisdiction over the subject matter of th e action due to kane county failure to allege a justiciable case or controversy between the parties,kane county failed to state a claim upon which relief c ould be granted,kane county failed to join indispensable parties under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure with respect to the claimed that cross private land,id.at and kane county claims are barred by the statute of limitations in the quiet title act.id.
on september,kane county moved for leave to file an amended complaint.attached to the motion was a proposed amended complaint asserting seven additional claims to quiet title to ten additional roads skutumpah,swallow wash,north swag and nipple lake roads in western kane county and sand dune,hancock,and four cave lakes roads in southwestern kane county.id.at.the united states did not oppose the motion.on october,the district court granted kane county motion.id.at.kane county amended complaint was subsequently filed on november.
on november,suwa moved for leave to intervene as of right as a defendant in th e action pursuant to.a.id.at.in the alternative,suwa request ed leave to permissively intervene pursuant to.b.id.both kane county and the united states opposed suwa motion to intervene.
on april,the district court issued a memorandum decision and order denying suwa motion to intervene.after outlining the requirements for intervention as of right under rule a,the district court noted that kane county and the united states disputed only the issues of whether suwa,as a practical matter,ha d an interest that m ight be impaired or impeded and whether suwa interest wa s adequately represented by the existing parties.id.at.with respect to the first of these issues,the district court concluded 
as is evident from the complaint,the only issue in this case is whether kane county can establish that it holds title to the roads at issue.how the lands adjacent to the roads will be managed and whether the roads themselves will be open to the public once title is determined are not issues that are relevant to the determination of the quiet title action.in this case,it is evident that suwa does not have a legal interest in the usual understanding of that word in a title context.while suwa obviously has an interest in the sense that it cares deeply about the outcome of the decision,it does not claim title to the roads at issue.this conclusion was evident by suwa concession at oral argument that,were the united states and kane county to resolve all of the title issues as to the roads without suwa consent or participation,suwa would have no right to continue with the action and the action would be dismissed.
based on the specific facts in this case and the differences between the issues raised by kane county and those in san juan county,the court finds that suwa has not established the element of having an impaired interest in the litigation.the issues raised in this case do not include the same factual underpinnings of continuing controversy over roads into areas that have been protected by the national park service as did the roads at issue in san juan county.
id.at emphasis added.the district court further concluded that suwa had failed to show that its interests in th e case we re not adequately represented by the united states,id.at 
the only issue to be resolved,as suwa conceded at oral argument,is whether the united states or kane county holds title.whether kane county can establish the requirements to show that it holds title to the roads based on will turn entirely on the historic use of these roads by the public for the period required under utah law prior to.in neither its briefing nor at a sic oral argument was suwa able to proffer any evidence to which it would have access about the historical use of the roads that is not available to the united states.moreover,suwa does not present evidence that it has any special expertise,experience or knowledge with respect to the historic use of the roads that would not be available to the united states.
indeed,the primary focus of suwa briefing in support of its motion is its long history of advocating to preserve the wilderness characteristics of the lands and the risks that opening the roads to the public may have on preserving such wilderness areas.none of these facts is relevant to the determination of whether kane county holds title.in san juan county,the court reminded that nothing we have said would contravene the holding that rule a does not require intervention as of right for the purpose of presenting only irrelevant argument or evidence.the only arguments that suwa appears to be prepared to make in this case would not be made by the united states are those relating to the management of the land,which would be irrelevant and not admissible in evidence.
the united states argues that it has been and will be vigorous in defending its claim to legitimate title to the roads.the record does not compel a different conclusion.absent evidence showing that the united states will not vigorously defend this position,there is no basis to allow intervention by suwa.
id.at emphasis added.lastly,the district court rejected suwa request for permissive intervention,concluding there wa s nothing in the briefing nor the arguments to suggest that suwa would offer any additional defenses or claims relevant to the issues to be decided that would not already be fully and co
