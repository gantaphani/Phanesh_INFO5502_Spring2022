since scientists split the atom in,nuclear technology has proliferated into many areas of society.no longer limited to the defense of our nation,nuclear technology is used in energy production,medical diagnosis and treatment,food processing and agriculture and sterilization of consumer goods.for all of the advances it has brought,however,those advances have come at a waste that is the inevitable byproduct.
what to do with the waste has plagued scientists and policymakers for decades.as a result of scientific,political and regulatory consultation and comment,the consensus is that the waste should be stored in an underground repository to be located at yucca mountain,nevada yucca.the state of nevada nevada,concerned about the storage of nuclear waste within its borders,has vigorously opposed the construction of a nuclear repository at yucca and,after failing in the political and regulatory arenas,has attacked the statutory and regulatory scheme governing the construction and operation of the yucca repository.see nuclear energy,epa.
in this petition for review,nevada asks us to review both the final environmental impact statement feis and that portion of the record of decision rod the department of energy doe or department issued governing the transportation of nuclear waste from the production sources to yucca.nevada alleges the feis is procedurally flawed and therefore violates the national environmental policy act nepa,et.it challenges the rod under the administrative procedure act,et.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that some of nevada claims are unripe for review and the remaining claims are without merit.accordingly,we deny nevada petition for review.
the nuclear waste policy act of nwpa,et,establishes the process for locating,constructing,operating and closing any repository for spent nuclear fuel snf and radioactive waste hlw.under the statutory scheme,the doe is responsible for the development and operation of the repository once the nuclear regulatory commission nrc issues a license for the project under the atomic energy act,et.
pursuant to the nwpa,the doe secretary recommended yucca to the president for development as the nation underground nuclear waste repository.following the nwpa procedures,the president then recommended yucca to the congress.see nuclear energy,at.nevada objected to the proposed site and submitted a notice of disapproval,to which the congress responded by passing the yucca mountain development act,stat,a joint resolution approving the development of a repository at yucca.
on february,the doe issued an feis for its repository site selection decision.although much of the feis concentrated on the yucca site,it also analyzed alternatives for,and the potential environmental consequences of,transporting nuclear waste from the many production sources throughout the country to the repository at yucca.see department of energy,final environmental impact statement for a geologic repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste at yucca mountain,nye county,nevada february,feis joint appendix ja.the feis analyzed two interstate transportation proposals the mostly truck alternative and the alternative.the feis also evaluated intrastate transportation alternatives under the scenario to transport waste from one of nevada mainline railroads to yucca because there is currently no direct rail access to yucca.
under the mostly truck scenario,virtually all snf and hlw would be placed in casks at the production sources and the casks then shipped by truck directly to yucca.see feis ja.each truck together with each cask would meet requirements.the mostly truck option would transport approximately shipments over years.feis ja.
the scenario,by contrast,would provide for the shipment of snf and hlw primarily by rail.feis ja.there are commercial production sources and five doe generator sources of nuclear waste nationwide.id.of the commercial production sources and the five doe generator sources have the capacity to load the waste into rail shipping casks.of the production sources also have direct rail access and would place the casks directly on the rail line while the sources able to load the casks but without rail access would ship the waste by barge via navigable waterways or trucks via highways to the nearest rail line id.from there the waste would travel by rail to one of nevada mainline railroads.under the scenario some waste would have to be shipped by trucks because at least six production sources can not accommodate rail casks.id.waste hauled by truck would proceed directly from the production sources to yucca,just as it would under the mostly truck scenario.under the scenario,about rail shipments and truck shipments would occur over years.feis ja.the feis designated the scenario as the doe preferred alternative.feis ja.
as noted earlier,because none of nevada mainline railroads connects to yucca,the feis also considered alternatives for transporting the waste from a mainline railroad to yucca.the first option was to construct an intermodal transfer station at a point on a mainline railroad,where the rail casks would be transferred from the rail cars to trucks.the trucks would then haul the waste to yucca on one of nevada five existing highways to yucca.the second option was to build a branch rail line from a mainline railroad to yucca.the doe identified five alternative rail corridors each approximately mile which to build a branch rail line.while the feis analyzed the environmental impact of building a rail line somewhere within each corridor,it did not analyze the impact of specific alternative track locations within each corridor.the doe did not indicate a preference among the five rail corridors in the feis but it subsequently announced the caliente corridor as its preferred one.see notice of preferred nevada rail corridor,the department is now announcing the caliente rail corridor as its preferred corridor in which to construct a rail line in nevada,and carlin as a secondary preference.
on april,the doe issued a rod for transporting snf and hlw to yucca.see record of decision on mode of transportation and nevada rail corridor for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste at yucca mountain,nye county,nv.april,rod.the rod identified the option as the doe choice for the national transportation plan.id.at.the department also decided to construct a branch rail line from one of nevada existing mainline railroads to the repository at yucca and selected the caliente corridor for any branch rail line it might decide to build.see id.in addition,the department has decided to select the caliente rail corridor in which to examine potential alignments within which to construct that rail line.should the department select an alignment within that corridor,it will obtain all necessary regulatory approvals before beginning construction.footnote omitted.
the rod further noted that if the repository at yucca became operational before a branch line could be completed,the doe could nonetheless begin shipment of waste.under this contingency,the waste would be shipped on truck casks placed on rail cars which,once they arrived in nevada,would be transferred to trucks at an intermodal transfer station and then continue by truck to yucca.the doe did not supplement the feis notwithstanding this contingency,noted in the rod,that it might transport waste in truck casks via rail.the rod alluded to a march,supplemental analysis sa the doe had prepared,concluding that no supplemental environmental impact statement seis was necessary because the feis analysis of the mostly truck and scenarios comprehended the environmental impact of an interim use of truck casks by rail.id.at.
nevada then filed its petition for review of the feis and the rod.nevada argues that the doe violated nepa in several ways,that it exceeded its authority in selecting the caliente corridor and that its conditional decision to ship waste in truck casks by rail,should the repository at yucca be operational before completion of a branch rail line,was arbitrary and capricious.
under the ripeness doctrine,an article iii court can not entertain the claims of a litigant unless they are constitutionally and prudentially ripe.outdoor council forest,quoting.envtl.action network browner.in our review of agency action,the ripeness doctrine takes into account questions regarding the institutional capacities of,and the relationship between,courts and agencies,epa.the questions include the agency interest in crystallizing its policy before that policy is subjected to judicial review,the court interests in avoiding unnecessary adjudication and in deciding issues in a concrete setting and the petitioner interest in prompt consideration of allegedly unlawful agency action.id.in abbott laboratories gardner,d,the united states supreme court announced the test for ripeness that balances these interests.a court is to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.id.at.the supreme court has more recently elaborated on ripeness,concluding that a court must consider whether delayed review would cause hardship to the plaintiffs whether judicial intervention would inappropriately interfere with further administrative action and whether the courts would benefit from further factual development of the issues presented.ohio forestry ass n,sierra club,d.
nevada claims that the doe adoption of what nevada calls the interim transportation plan building an intermodal capability at a rail line in nevada to take truck casks from rail cars and transport them the rest of the way to the repository via highway,should the rail system be unavailable at the time of the opening of the repository,rod.at the doe to prepare an seis.the doe is required to prepare an seis if,inter alia,it makes substantial changes in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns.a see also c.because the feis did not evaluate the interim transportation plan,further nepa analysis might be required.see c i.this issue,however,is not yet ripe for our review.
the doe discussion of the interim transportation plan in the rod does not represent its final determination regarding the plan.as outlined in the rod,the plan might be implemented at some future time but the doe language is replete with conditional phrases.see rod.at the department would use truck transport where necessary,depending on certain factors such as the timing of the completion of the rail line proposed to be constructed in nevada.this could include building an intermodal capability at a rail line in nevada to take truck casks from rail cars and transport them the rest of the way to the repository via highway,should the rail system be unavailable at the time of the opening of the repository.emphases added.the doe uncertainty makes it plainly premature for us to review an interim transportation plan that may never materialize.until and unless the nrc issues a permit for a nuclear repository at precondition of its construction and is possible,if not probable,that the branch rail line will be constructed before the repository becomes operational.moreover,even if it becomes operational before the branch rail line is completed,the rod recites only that the doe could implement the plan in that event.id.only when the doe plan has sufficiently crystallized and the feis is used to support a concrete decision will nevada challenge to the doe failure to prepare an seis be ripe.see ohio forestry ass n,at.withholding consideration of forest management plan because of uncertainty whether and to what extent plan would be used to support future logging decisions.nor do we foresee hardship to nevada by our withholding judicial review.see id.at.requiring party to participate in further administrative or judicial proceedings is not sufficient hardship fcc,same.

the rod makes clear that the department could implement the plan,not that it will,and,in any event,that it will do so only where necessary,depending on certain factors.rod.at.a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated,or indeed may not occur at all.texas united states,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in fourth branch associates ferc,ferc issued a notice of its intent to initiate surrender proceedings used for the implied surrender of a joint license to operate a hydroelectric plan and fourth branch associates petitioned for review.we dismissed the petition,observing t here is nothing definitive in an agency intending to do something.id.at.so too here.the rod,in relevant part,does nothing more than announce the doe intent to do something if certain conditions obtain.the interim transportation plan rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated,or indeed may not occur at all.texas,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.it is not fit for judicial review because further administrative action is needed to clarify the agency position.treasury employees union chertoff,quoting action alliance of senior citizens of greater phila.heckler.
nor will nevada suffer any hardship from delaying review.the rod discussion of the interim transportation plan results in no adverse effects of a strictly legal kind it do es not command anyone to do anything,or to refrain from doing anything it does not grant,withhold,or modify any formal legal license,power,or authority it does not subject anyone to any civil or criminal liability and it creates no legal rights or obligations.ohio forestry ass n,at.the plan is nothing more than a possible course of action the doe may take given a possible turn of events.any injury to nevada will not occur until the doe makes a concrete decision.see toilet goods ass gardner,d no hardship where regulation merely state d that the commissioner may authorize inspectors to examine certain processes or formulae because regulation did not affect petitioner primary conduct.nor does hardship flow from the uncertainty of the doe implementation of the plan,park hospitality ass dep t of interior,d rejecting notion that mere uncertainty as to the validity of a legal rule constitutes a hardship for purposes of the ripeness analysis,nor from the fact that nevada may have to participate in additional administrative or judicial proceedings,see nuclear energy,at r equiring a party to participate in further administrative or judicial proceedings is not a hardship sufficient to outweigh a determination that an issue is unfit for review.
nevada next claims that the doe selected the caliente corridor in which to build the branch rail line without the approval of the surface transportation board stb and thus invaded the latter exclusive jurisdiction over common carrier rail lines.under the apa,we must hold unlawful and set aside agency action found to be not in accordance with law or in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations.c.the stb has exclusive jurisdiction over transportation by rail carrier,a,and a rail carrier is defined as a person providing common carrier railroad transportation for compensation.the stb has determined that a railroad is a common carrier railroad if it purports to hold itself out as a common carrier for hire and if there is an ostensible and actual movement of traffic for the public for hire.the principal test is whether there is a bona fide holding out coupled with the ability to carry for hire.hanson natural res.carrier.for a declaratory order,finance docket,wl,decision served.
this challenge is also unripe because it is speculative.the stb jurisdiction comes into play only if the doe decides to operate the branch rail line as a common carrier.see a.nevada claims that the branch rail line construction and operation as a common carrier is a fait accompli.pet r br.that decision,however,has not been made.further,the doe has declared that s hould the department select an alignment within the caliente corridor,it will obtain all necessary regulatory approvals before beginning construction.rod.at.nevada threatened harm,therefore,is speculative and thus not fit for judicial review.see texas,at.a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated,or indeed may not occur at all.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.moreover,we can see no hardship to nevada in delaying review because the threatened of the branch rail line as a common carrier without stb occur only if the doe determines to operate the branch rail line as a common carrier.see nuclear energy,at nevada may raise its substantive claims against the feis if and when nrc or doe makes such a final decision.our decision to postpone consideration of nevada claims therefore works no hardship on nevada sufficient to render its claims ripe.
we now turn to the state five remaining claims,all of which are brought under nepa.nepa mandate is essentially procedural.yankee nuclear power nrdc,d the statute requires each agency to assess the environmental consequences of major f ederal actions by following certain procedures during the process,c see citizens against burlington,busey.before approving a project,an agency must prepare a detailed statement on the environmental impact of the proposed action,any adverse environmental effects which can not be avoided should the proposal be implemented,and alternatives to the proposed action.c i iii.guiding the doe nepa analysis are regulations promulgated by the council on environmental quality ceq,as well as the doe own regulations,which track the ceq regulations at the heart of the environmental impact statement is the requirement that an agency rigorously explore and objectively evaluate the projected environmental impacts of all reasonable alternatives to the proposed action.
again,we apply the apa arbitrary and capricious standard to a nepa challenge.see,olmsted falls faa.we apply this standard to review both the agency procedural compliance with nepa and the adequacy of an eis.see id.citing marsh or.natural res.council,d.under nepa,the role of the courts is simply to ensure that the agency has adequately considered and disclosed the environmental impact of its actions and that its decision is not arbitrary or capricious.id.citing balt.gas nrdc,d.
before the issuance of an eis,the responsible official shall consult with and obtain the comments of any federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved.c see a same.furthermore,the ceq regulations require an agency with jurisdiction by law or special expertise to comment on statements within its jurisdiction,expertise,or authority.jurisdiction by law is defined as agency authority to approve,veto,or finance all or part of the proposal,and special expertise is defined as statutory responsibility,agency mission,or related program experience.
nevada contends that the doe violated c and a by failing to consult with the stb regarding the doe branch rail line proposal.we do not reach the merits of nevada claim,however,because it has waived the argument by failing to raise it at the administrative level.as the supreme court has long admonished,p ersons challenging an agency compliance with nepa must structure their participation so that it alerts the agency to the parties position and contentions,in order to allow the agency to give the issue meaningful consideration.dep t of transp.pub.citizen,d citing.yankee,at.alterations in original nebraska epa,appalachian power epa,omnipoint fcc,tex tin epa.the court also cautioned that 
administrative proceedings should not be a game or a forum to engage in unjustified obstructionism by making cryptic and obscure references to matters that ought to be considered and then,after failing to do more to bring the matter to the agency attention,seeking to have that agency determination vacated on the ground that the agency failed to consider matters forcefully presented.
applying these principles to nevada petition for review,we believe nevada comments nowhere alerted the doe to nevada contention that the doe was obligated to consult with the stb.although judicial review may be had if an issue was raised at the administrative level by a party other than the petitioner,see cellnet commc n,fcc,consideration of the issue by the agency at the behest of another party is enough to preserve it.see also ne.waste disposal auth.epa,per curiam reytblatt nuclear regulatory comm n,here the voluminous administrative record contains only one lone comment regarding the stb jurisdiction.eureka county,nevada noted that it is not clear whether construction and operation of proposed rail corridors would require a pproval by the surface transportation board.ja.this bare comment alerted the doe,at most,that it might need to obtain the stb approval to build and operate a branch rail line it did not touch on what nevada argues here,that is,that the doe had a duty to consult with the stb.accordingly,we conclude that nevada has waived this argument.
nevada next contends that the doe violated nepa by failing to consult with the nevada state engineer.under nepa,an agency duty to obtain the comments of state and local agencies differs from its duty with respect to federal agencies.nepa imposes a duty on the agency to consult with and obtain written comments from the appropriate federal agencies.see c warm springs dam task force gribble,cir t he statute imposes on the agency a duty to obtain written comments.and the ceq regulations implementing nepa not only require the proposing agency to obtain the comments of federal agencies with jurisdiction expertise,see a,but also affirmatively require those agencies to comment,see.see warm springs dam task force,at.
by contrast,nepa itself is silent regarding an agency duty to obtain comments from state and local agencies.the ceq regulations,however,require the proposing agency to r equest the comments of a ppropriate state and local agencies which are authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards.a i.while under both nepa and the ceq regulations,a proposing agency must obtain the comments of certain federal agencies,see c,a,it must only r equest the comments of a ppropriate state and local agencies,a.if the agency makes a request for comments and receives none,it has met its obligation under a.if,after requesting comment,the agency receives comment,nepa then requires that c opies of the comments and views of the appropriate federal,state,and local agencies shall be made available to the president,the council on environmental quality and to the public.c.
here,the doe submitted a copy of the draft eis,with a cover letter inviting comment,to michael turnipseed,the nevada state engineer.thus,it request ed the comments of the a ppropriate state agenc y.see a.the state engineer did not individually submit any comment to the doe.nevada,however,submitted comments on the draft eis deis to the doe,acknowledging the contribution of,inter alia,the nevada division of water,the state agency headed by the state engineer.the doe made copies of nevada comments available to the president,the ceq and the public and thus complied with a and c.
