jolene lemmon appeals from the district court dismissal with prejudice of her complaint alleging false claims against the government.see.the district court dismissed under rules a,b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure.she contends that the district court overlooked her of false claims theory and erred in rejecting her theory.our jurisdiction arises under and we reverse.
background 
brought under the false claims act fca,a and,this suit involves qui tam claims against envirocare of utah,envirocare by one of its former and two former employees of an envirocare subcontractor plaintiffs.at.the suit arises from envirocare contracts with the federal government government.id.at.plaintiffs allege that,between june and june,envirocare repeatedly violated its contractual and regulatory obligations by improperly disposing of the waste.id.at.in spite of these violations,plaintiffs contend,envirocare falsely represented to the government that it had fulfilled its obligations and,based on its false representations,improperly received payment from the government.id.at.
specifically,plaintiffs claims allege that they observed the direction of envirocare in envirocare improper disposal of waste.id.at.plaintiffs allege that envirocare government contracts required it to receive and dispose of the contaminated materials in accordance with all applicable,relevant and appropriate federal,state and local regulations id.at.the contracts further obligated envirocare to,inter alia,periodically submit written reports detailing its receipt and disposal of waste,submit reports detailing any problems encountered,maintain records sufficient to allow the government to confirm compliance with the contractual provisions,report all contractual violations to the government,and provide and maintain an inspection system for government review.id.at.
plaintiffs assert that envirocare breached its obligations by,inter alia,ignoring its reporting,recording,regulatory,and maintenance requirements,violating the contractual and regulatory disposal requirements pertaining to location and size of buried debris,violating the contractual and regulatory disposal requirements pertaining to exposed waste materials,failing to remediate and report waste spills,disposing of waste without proper work orders,violating disposal requirements regarding the construction and maintenance of cells,and failing to report the improper mixing of waste.id.at.
according to plaintiffs,envirocare expressly and impliedly certified fulfillment of its obligations by submitting payment requests to the government.id.at.these requests,which the government paid in full,form the basis of plaintiffs third amended complaint.
that complaint was filed after three complaints were dismissed without prejudice and with leave to file an amended complaint.in the last of these preceding dismissals,the district court provided an extensive analysis of the deficiencies of plaintiffs second amended complaint and gave guidance for filing legally sufficient claims.see.at.
responding to the district court analysis,plaintiffs filed the third amended complaint.at pages,it was more than pages shorter and contained over fewer averments than the second.compare.third amended complaint with.second amended complaint.it contained only a handful of opposed to added substantial factual allegations.it also omitted the a claim,which the district court had dismissed for failure to state a claim.see id.at.
nonetheless,the district court dismissed the third amended complaint with prejudice in a order.the order stated that the dismissal was f or substantially the same reasons set forth in the prior opinion and order dismissing the second amended complaint.id.in relying on its prior opinion,the district court did not note the obvious and critical differences between the third and second amended complaints.see id.most notably,the court made no mention of the replacement of the a claim with claims under a.id.indeed,the claims appear to have gone unnoticed.id.instead,the court stated that plaintiffs may well have pleaded various regulatory violations,but because plaintiffs did not allege that the regulations require complete regulatory compliance before certification for payment,plaintiffs failed to tie those allegations to an identifiable,plausible false claim within the meaning of the false claims act.id.at.
discussion 
we review the district court dismissal under rule b de novo.united states ex rel.conner salina reg l health,cir.under b,we review for plausibility,specifically whether enough facts have been pled to state a plausible claim.bell atl.twombly.concerning the failure to plead fraud with particularity under rule b,we also review a dismissal de novo.united states ex rel.gagne city of worcester,cir de novo standard applies to claims under a or.finally,rule a dismissals are reviewed for an abuse of discretion,but to overcome a motion to dismiss,a plaintiff allegations must move from conceivable to plausible.see ashcroft iqbal,nasious two unknown agents,cir.
before turning to the sufficiency of plaintiffs allegations,we review the statutory basis of their claims.
implied and express false certification claims 
plaintiffs third amended complaint asserts claims under a and of the false claims act the fca covers all fraudulent attempts to cause the government to pay out sums of money.conner,at quoting united states ex rel.boothe sun healthcare,cir.its qui tam provisions allow an individual to sue on behalf of the government.b.though the government may intervene and take over a private plaintiff case,id.b and c,it often declines to do so.in such instances,the private plaintiff,termed a relator,conducts the litigation and shares any recovery with the government.id.d.
section a imposes civil liability when a person knowingly presents,or causes to be presented to the government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval section a renders a party liable for knowingly mak ing,us ing,or caus ing to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government violation of these provisions subjects a party to treble damages and civil penalties.id.a.
under a,liability can attach when a government payee submits either a legally or factually false request for payment.claims arising from factually false requests generally require a showing that the payee has submitted an incorrect description of goods or services provided or a request for reimbursement for goods or services never provided.conner,at quoting mikes straus,cir.claims arising from legally false requests,on the other hand,generally require knowingly false certification of compliance with a regulation or contractual provision as a condition of payment.see id.
plaintiffs suit rests on allegations of legal envirocare falsely certified compliance with,inter alia,the terms of its government contracts in seeking payment.plaintiffs allege both that envirocare violated a variety of state and federal regulations and that,in doing so,it violated its contractual obligations to the government see.at.
plaintiffs assert claims under the fca based on both implied and express theories.see.at see conner,at shaw aaa eng g drafting,cir recognizing that,in light of the fca language,structure and legislative history,a authorizes claims for false certification of compliance with a government contract under both implied and express theories.
claims under an theory arise when a payee falsely certifies compliance with a particular statute,regulation or contractual term,where compliance is a prerequisite to payment.conner,at quoting mikes,f d at.the payee certification need not be a literal certification,but can be any false statement that relates to a claim.see.united states ex rel.hendow of phoenix,cir so long as the statement in question is knowingly false when made,it matters not whether it is a certification,assertion,statement,or secret handshake false claims liability can attach.
while claims may presumably arise under any subsection of a,we have held that claims can arise under a but not under a.shaw,at.in so finding,we recognized that a requires
