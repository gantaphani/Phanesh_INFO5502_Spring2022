ii.background 
a.the northern rocky mountain wolf recovery plan 
the esa is designed to protect and conserve endangered and threatened species and the ecosystems upon which they may be conserved.b.to accomplish this,the esa authorizes fws,acting as proxy for the secretary of the interior,to identify endangered or threatened species and issue regulations to conserve such species.id.a,d.the esa also authorizes the designation of nonessential,experimental populations of threatened species and the promulgation of rules concerning the management of such populations.id.j.farm bureau fed babbitt,cir.
the gray wolf has been listed as an endangered species in the lower states,except minnesota,since.farm bureau,at.in,the secretary of the interior adopted an updated recovery plan which called for the annual reintroduction of fifteen gray wolves in yellowstone national park and central idaho,two nonessential,experimental population areas.farm bureau,at.the department of the interior also adopted regulations to manage these populations.these regulations authorize fws to designate as problem wolves those animals that attack livestock once within a calendar year or attack domestic animals twice within a calendar year and to take such wolves.id.i vii.authorized takes include aversive tactics,nonlethal control,relocation,and lethal control.id.
reintroduced wolves on the diamond g ranch 
in,two reintroduced wolves and their five pups,a pack known as the washakie pack,traveled to the diamond g in the dunoir valley.on october and,the diamond g reported potential wolf depredation of cattle to wyoming game and fish personnel.none of the kills were confirmed as wolf kills.while no wolf depredation had been confirmed,fws personnel joined wyoming wildlife services ws personnel to assist in controlling the washakie pack on october because the adult male wolf had been observed chasing diamond g cattle.fws decided to try to trap the pack and move them to a pen in yellowstone national park.fws and ws personnel also monitored and harassed the wolves in an attempt to deter them from diamond g cattle.on october,another calf killing was discovered,and it was determined that wolves were responsible.fws decided to kill the adult male wolf after observing it actively hunting cattle and determining that it had been involved in prior depredations in montana.fws also recommended,however,to observe the adult female wolf and the pups before making a decision regarding further control actions.
the adult female wolf and her pups remained together and were reportedly chasing cattle in november.no new depredations were reported and the cattle were moved to a lower elevation for winter.fws continued to monitor the adult female wolf and the pups throughout the winter of.
in a letter to fws dated march,gordon attorney expressed his client concern regarding the management of wolves on the diamond jaime rappaport clark clark,director of fws,responded in a letter dated april,clark letter.in this letter,clark described the objectives of the recovery plan and fws efforts in minimizing wolf depredation of livestock summarized the wolf depredation that occurred on the diamond g in october described compensation plans and described future plans for wolf management on the diamond 
the diamond g ranch manager reported that a guard dog was attacked in april.this attack was not confirmed as a wolf attack.two other dogs,however,were confirmed to have been killed by a wolf in late april.gordon and diamond g filed this action on june.
three cattle kills were reported in june,one of which was confirmed as a wolf kill and the other two were determined to be highly probable wolf kills.fws decided to take further action to control the washakie pack and on june killed the adult female wolf and one yearling pup.the diamond g ranch manager reported additional cattle losses in july and august.no investigation occurred,however,because the carcasses were not reported for several days after they were found.by august,the remaining wolf pups moved to the yellowstone national park about miles from diamond 
after the remaining wolves of the washakie pack dispersed,other wolves moved into the area near diamond g.it is expected that these wolves may also depredate on diamond g livestock.
iii.analysis 
takings claims 
this court reviews de novo the district court decision that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs takings claims.see madsen united states ex rel.united states army corps of eng rs,cir.
the takings clause of the fifth amendment provides that private property shall not be taken for public use,without just compensation.const.amend.v.it is clear from this text that governmental interference with private property rights is not limited per se.first english evangelical lutheran church county of los angeles,d.rather,the takings clause is understood only to require compensation for a proper interference amounting to a taking.id.at.accordingly,equitable relief is not available to enjoin a lawful taking when a property owner can subsequently sue the government for compensation.ruckelshaus monsanto,d.
generally,compensation for a taking may be obtained under the tucker act,which confers jurisdiction on the united states court of claims.preseault interstate commerce comm n,d.thus,if a tucker act remedy is available,plaintiffs must first avail themselves of the process provided by the tucker act and file suit in the court of claims for compensation.preseault,at.enters.apfel,d.a remedy is available under the tucker act unless congress expresses an unambiguous intention to withdraw the tucker act remedy.preseault,at.the esa contains no language to indicate a congressional intention to withdraw a tucker act remedy.accordingly,the court of claims retains jurisdiction over takings claims that arise under the esa.see id.
plaintiffs argue,however,that the district court has jurisdiction over a takings claim when a plaintiff alleges irreparable harm from a continuing violation and seeks only equitable relief.plaintiffs argue that the united states supreme court decision in eastern enterprises is dispositive of this issue.in eastern enterprises,the supreme court addressed the constitutionality of the coal industry retiree health benefit act of coal act,which mandated the contribution of money to a benefit fund established for retirees and their dependents.at.seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,the claimant company in eastern enterprises filed a complaint in a federal district court alleging due process and takings claims.id.at.a majority of the court held that the coal act was unconstitutional.id.at.plurality opinion id.at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part.a different majority,however,concluded that the takings clause was not implicated by the coal act and that,instead,the controlling question was whether the coal act violated the substantive component of the due process clause.see id.at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part id.at.breyer,dissenting.accordingly,plaintiffs argument that eastern enterprises is dispositive of their takings claims is unavailing 
moreover,plaintiffs takings claims fail even under the plurality analysis in eastern enterprises.the plurality in eastern enterprises noted that a claim for compensation under the takings clause must be brought first in the court of claims unless congress expresses a clear intention to withdraw the tucker act grant of jurisdiction.
