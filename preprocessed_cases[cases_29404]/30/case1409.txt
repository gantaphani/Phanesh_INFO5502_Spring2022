the clean air act assigns any of the other states and not the federal environmental protection primary role in setting limits on emissions from engines.an example of a engine is a truck transportation refrigeration unit,which keeps perishable goods at the proper temperature.under the act,each of the other states may adopt a rule identical to california.otherwise,however,the other states are prohibited from adopting any regulation of emissions from engines.epa only role is to review california proposed rules under a narrowly defined set of statutory criteria.
in,california enacted a rule that regulates the emissions from transportation refrigeration units in trucks.epa authorized california rule after reviewing it under the relevant statutory criteria.the american trucking associations plural,not a typo has challenged epa decision,arguing that epa misinterpreted and unreasonably applied the statutory criteria when approving the california rule.we disagree,and we therefore deny the petition for review.
under the clean air act,both the federal government and the states exercise responsibility for maintaining and improving air quality.
when it comes to regulating emissions from stationary pollution sources like waste incinerators and power plants,epa sets national ambient air quality standards,and the individual states develop and implement plans to achieve those standards.
as to regulating emissions from mobile pollution sources like automobile engines,epa and the states also share responsibility depending on the kind of engine at issue.from a regulatory perspective,and oversimplifying a bit for present purposes,mobile engines fall into one of four categories i new,ii new,iii,and iv.
this case concerns the fourth engines.congress has given california the primary role in regulating emissions from those engines.id.e a.each of the other states has the choice either i to follow california lead and adopt a rule identical to california or ii to adopt no regulation at all with respect to emissions from engines.id.e see engine mfrs.ass epa.
under this statutory scheme,epa applies three criteria in reviewing california proposed engine rules.epa must approve a proposed california regulation unless epa finds that california unreasonably determined that its rule is at least as protective of public health and welfare as the relevant federal standards epa concludes that california does not need the proposed standard to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions in california or epa finds that california standards are not consistent with.e a i iii.that third consistency epa to assess whether the california rule prevents other states from deciding to adopt and enforce the california rule.air pollution control preemption of state regulation for nonroad engine and vehicle standards,july.the third criterion also dictates that epa consider the cost of compliance with the regulation.id.
in,acting under that statutory scheme,the california air resources board devised a plan to reduce diesel particulate matter emissions and associated cancer risks in california by by and by.the board promulgated emissions standards for certain particular,for transportation refrigeration units or trus powered by diesel engines.trus are used to control the temperature of trailers carrying perishable goods.for any tru operating in california that was manufactured before december,california rule required compliance by december.thereafter,the rule requirements are phased in by model year.
the california rule requires all trus carried on vehicles operating in just those carried on vehicles based in comply with california emissions standards.regs.tit,b.the rule means,in other words,that trus carried on vehicles based primarily in another state must comply with the california rule if and when those vehicles operate in california.
the rule affords tru owners several compliance options replace the old tru with a compliant engine show that the tru meets the necessary standards retrofit the tru with a device that will reduce diesel particulate matter emissions to a compliant level or choose an alternative technological option for transporting perishable goods.id.e a.
in,as required by the federal statute,california requested epa authorization of the tru rule.epa approved the rule and explained its reasoning in a lengthy decision.in applying the first statutory criterion,epa concluded that california reasonably determined that the tru rule would be at least as protective of public health and welfare as federal regulations.as to the second criterion,epa found that california had reasonably shown it needed the rule to address compelling and extraordinary conditions in the california air pollution problems.as to the third criterion,epa addressed whether the tru rule conflicted with the statute adopt and enforce provision that gives other states the choice of either following california lead or declining to regulate emissions from engines at all.epa concluded that the tru rule satisfied that criterion because it applied only to trus operating in california.also under the third criterion,epa found that the cost of complying with the tru rule was not unreasonable.
the american trucking associations is a national trade association representing the trucking industry.it challenges epa authorization of the california tru rule.our narrow task is to determine whether epa decision was arbitrary and capricious.a.that standard is deferential.see fcc fox television stations,d motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.
under the relevant provisions of the clean air act,epa was required to approve california proposed tru rule unless epa concluded that i california unreasonably determined that its rule is at least as protective of public health and welfare as federal standards,ii california does not need its rule to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions in the state,or iii california rule precludes other states from choosing not to regulate trus or imposes excessive costs.e a i iii see air pollution control preemption of state regulation for nonroad engine and vehicle standards,july.ata does not challenge epa decision under the first criterion.ata contends that epa erred in applying the second and third criteria.
ata argues that epa erred in applying the second criterion.in particular,ata argues that epa erroneously found that california need s the specific tru rule at issue to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions in california.e a ii.in advancing this argument,ata challenges epa interpretation of the statute and contends that epa applied the statutory standard in an arbitrary and capricious manner.
with respect to the statutory language,epa concluded that compelling and extraordinary conditions refers to the factors that tend to cause geographical and climatic conditions that,when combined with large numbers and high concentrations of automobiles,create serious air pollution problems.the expansive statutory language gives california and in turn epa a good deal of flexibility in assessing california regulatory needs.we therefore find no basis to disturb epa reasonable interpretation of the second criterion.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
ata relatedly argues that epa unreasonably determined that california needs the tru rule.but epa explained that california continues to suffer from some of the worst air quality in the nation.for purposes of our deferential arbitrary and capricious review,epa analysis of this second criterion was reasonable and reasonably explained.
ata also contends that epa erred in applying the third statutory criterion,which requires that california proposed rule not be inconsistent with the rest of the governing sections of the statute.as relevant here,the third criterion requires epa to consider the california rule impact on the other states ability to follow or to decline to follow california lead.the third criterion also mandates consideration of the costs associated with the california rule.
section e b allows other states to adopt and enforce engine standards that are identical to california standards.e b see engine mfrs.ass epa.a state may decline to f
