the secretary of the interior has interpreted the phrase valid existing rights in the surface mining control and reclamation act to foreclose surface mining operations in sensitive areas.the national mining association challenges this reading of the statute,but we conclude that we must defer to the secretary reasonable interpretation of this ambiguous phrase.
in,congress enacted the surface mining control and reclamation act smcra,et,to protect society and the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations,id.a.section b of the smcra authorizes the secretary of the interior secretary to prohibit surface coal mining operations on federal lands if he determines them to be unsuitable for that purpose.id.b.section e bans outright surface mining in statutorily designated areas id.e.in this appeal,we are asked to determine how congress intended that ban to work.the relevant text of e provides after august,and subject to valid existing rights no surface coal mining operations except those which exist on august,shall be permitted in the statutorily designated areas.id.emphasis added.
because one must show valid existing rights ver to start a surface mining operation in a e area,the meaning of the phrase is critical.for decades,the secretary and the courts have wrestled with how best to understand ver and determine what it protects.we need not recount this history.suffice it to say that ver has occasioned a spectrum of agency interpretations,ranging from a relaxed ownership and authority standard,which required only that the miner show a property right in the coal,to a more exacting all permits standard,which called for a showing that surface mining licenses had been issued prior to the date e took effect.see valid existing rights,recounting secretary prior definitions of ver.
in,the secretary and the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement promulgated a rule through procedures offering yet another interpretation of ver.id.at codified at.this rule,as we will call it,was a setback for parties hoping to conduct new surface mining operations in e areas.under the rule,a miner claiming ver protection must satisfy two conditions.first,he must produce a legally binding document that vested him with the right to mine the land at the time it came under e.second,he must either prove that the owner of the land,by the time it came under e,had made a good faith effort to obtain all necessary permits for the mining,or else prove that the coal is immediately adjacent to a surface mining operation in existence on august,and is needed to ensure the economic viability of the mining operation as a whole.the secretary prefaced this interpretation of ver with a preamble describing the agency long relationship with the phrase,explaining the rationale for the latest interpretation,and responding to objections raised during the period.significantly,the preamble acknowledges that the chosen ver interpretation protects more acres than the least restrictive alternative and predicts that few persons will qualify for ver under this standard.valid existing rights.
the national mining association nma,an industry trade association with standing to bring suit on behalf of its members under hunt washington state apple advertising commission,d,challenged the rule pursuant to a in the united states district court for the district of columbia.the nma argued that the rule interpretation of ver was too narrow and shielded more land from surface mining than congress intended.on for summary judgment,the district court found the statute ambiguous,deferred to the secretary interpretation as reasonable,and entered judgment for the secretary.mining ass scarlett,wl,may,citing chevron natural res.def.council,d.the nma appeals.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court judgment.
this case begins with an unusual question created by a mistake in the language of the jurisdictional grant.we have an independent obligation to determine whether jurisdiction exists,arbaugh y h,d,which we must discharge before ruling on the merits,sinochem int l malay.int l shipping,d citing steel citizens for a better env t,d.
the district court claimed jurisdiction under a,which renders a ny action by the secretary promulgating national rules or regulations subject to judicial review in the united states district court for the district of columbia circuit.but there is no such court within the federal judiciary.the judgment the nma has asked us to review comes from a court called the united states district court for the district of columbia.see act of june,ch,stat,codified at,a see also in re permanent surface mining regulation,noting a error in re surface mining regulation,same.because the inferior federal courts are creatures of statute,bath county amy,wall,we must pay careful attention to the legislative texts by which we are given authority.the district court did not address the mistake in the statute,so the task falls to us.
c ourts will not give independent meaning to a word where it is apparent from the context of the act that the word is surplusage,am.radio relay league,fcc,citation and quotation marks omitted,so we will excise the word circuit from the text of a.we have no qualms about this erasure,for both congress intent and the error impeding it are plain to see.see norman singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction ed.a majority of the cases permit the elimination or disregarding of words in a statute in order to carry out the legislative intent or meaning.henry hart,albert sacks,the legal process william eskridge,philip frickey,courts on occasion can correct mistakes when it is completely clear from the context that a mistake has been made.in a,congress subjected the secretary behavior to judicial review in various district courts.it would be absurd to assume that congress intended to shield the secretary national rules against judicial review by granting jurisdiction to a nonexistent court.ethyl epa,en banc leventhal,concurring congress has been willing to delegate its legislative powers broadly and courts have upheld such delegation because there is court review to assure that the agency exercises the delegated power within statutory limits.we read a as granting jurisdiction to the united states district court for the district of columbia in the present case,notwithstanding congress erroneous inclusion of the word circuit.our jurisdiction to review the final decision of that court comes from.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.mining ass fowler.because congress has charged the secretary with implementing the smcra,we review the agency interpretation of the statutory phrase valid existing rights under chevron natural resources defense council,d.see citizens coal council norton,applying chevron to secretary interpretation of the smcra.where the statute is ambiguous,we defer to the agency reasonable interpretation of its meaning.by contrast,a clear expression of congressional intent will bind agency and court alike.chevron,at.
the nma urges that congress inserted ver in e to protect mineral owners property rights.as the nma tells it,ver allows surface mining by those with a property right to mine coal.were this true,the secretary restrictive interpretation of ver in the rule would violate a congressional directive,and we would be required to set it aside.but we do not read the statute so narrowly.since,ver has been interpreted by five different administrations,each of which has found within its borders the room to establish a preferred policy.the nma takes this history to mean that the agency current policy is entitled to less deference because it has changed over time,but the opposite is true.that congress presented so wide a range of plausible interpretations to an agency with rulemaking authority shows a delegation to the executive branch of the power to make reasonable adjustments to the nation surface mining policy.
our chevron analysis begins with asking whether congress has delegated authority to an agency by leaving a statutory gap for the agency to fill.at.citing morton ruiz,d.our reading of the smcra la
