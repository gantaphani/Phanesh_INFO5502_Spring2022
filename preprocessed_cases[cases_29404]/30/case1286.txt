plaintiffs park lake resources park lake and park county mining association a corporation whose purpose is to assist miners and mining companies appeal the dismissal by the district court of their suit against several government agencies and some of their officials.this is not the first time plaintiffs have brought suit over what is in essence the same issue.we affirm because doctrine bars plaintiffs from contending that their claims are ripe for review.
on august,plaintiffs filed their first complaint in the district of colorado against the department of agriculture,the forest service,the secretary of agriculture,the chief of the forest service,and the regional forester for region ii which we will call collectively the forest service.the complaint challenged the designation of a parcel of national forest land as a research natural area rna under,and alleged that the designation precluded park lake from developing its recorded mining claims in the area.the district court upheld the designation.park lake,dep t of,park lake i.on appeal we vacated the judgment for lack of jurisdiction because the claim was not yet ripe for review.park lake,dep t of,cir park lake ii.
two years later plaintiffs filed the present complaint against the forest service and several new department of the interior,the secretary of the interior,and the assistant secretary of the we shall refer to collectively as the department of the interior doi.plaintiffs complaint as amended,while continuing to challenge the rna designation,additionally alleges that as a direct result of the rna designation,the doi issued public land order,which withdraws the rna from mineral exploration,thereby barring from the area all exploration for the purpose of staking new claims.this prohibition on exploration is a different injury from the injury alleged in the initial litigation.but the legal basis of the claim is unchanged.the only respect in which the land order is alleged to be unlawful is that it was based on an unlawful rna.moreover,this additional injury was readily knowable when the complaint was filed in the initial litigation,because the land order had been issued more than two months earlier,on may.see.
we exercise appellate jurisdiction under and hold that our dismissal of the earlier action for lack of ripeness requires dismissal of this action as well.plaintiffs can overcome the previous dismissal only by showing satisfaction of the conditions for ripeness set forth in park lake ii.having failed to do so,plaintiffs can not proceed with their claim.
background 
administrative proceedings 
acting under the authority of,the forest service designated acres in the arapaho national forest and the pike san isabel national forests as an rna the hoosier ridge rna on december.the regulation provides 
w hen appropriate,the chief of the forest service shall establish a series of research natural areas,sufficient in number and size to illustrate adequately or typify for research or educational purposes,the important forest and range types in each forest region,as well as other plant communities that have special or unique characteristics of scientific interest and importance.
shortly thereafter,plaintiffs appealed the designation to the forest service,but were denied their appeal on march.although it was still possible for park lake to engage in work in the rna by filing a proposed plan of operations ppo with the forest service to obtain permission to conduct mining activities on its recorded claims in the rna,see,it did not do so.
on may,the doi issued public land order,granting the forest service request that it withdraw the hoosier ridge rna from mineral entry and location.the order was authorized by of the federal land policy and management act,codified at.see public land order.may.the stated purpose of the withdrawal was to protect the unique alpine ecosystem and associated plant life within the rna,preserving the rna for the purpose for which it had been designated.id.
prior litigation 
on august,plaintiffs filed their first complaint against the forest service,challenging the designation of the hoosier ridge rna as arbitrary,capricious,and contrary to law,in violation of the administrative procedure act apa,et.park lake i.at.the district court ruled against plaintiffs on the merits,holding that the forest service designation of the rna was reasonable and in accordance with the law.park lake i.at.plaintiffs appealed the district court ruling.
on appeal the government argued for the first time that the claim was not ripe for review because plaintiffs ha d failed to show any present injury caused by the rna designation.park lake ii,at.we agreed,and on november,vacated the judgment below and dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction.id.at.we noted that park lake had not yet submitted a ppo to the forest service,and consequently,the forest service had not affirmatively denied it permission to exploit its mining claims in the area.id.at.the claim could,however,become ripe as a result of future actions.we said that park lake may seek review of this issue at a later date after i it submits a mining plan to the forest service,ii the forest service reviews the plan,and iii the forest service requests or requires any restrictions upon its mining activities.id.at.
present litigation 
in this new suit plaintiffs reassert the claim they brought in park lake i against the forest service for designating the hoosier ridge rna.plaintiffs also challenge order,in which the doi honored the forest service request to withdraw the rna from mineral entry and location.plaintiffs complain that the withdrawal is based solely on the unlawful designation of the rna.at,and that the withdrawal prevents park lake from locating new mining claims in the rna.
the district court dismissed on ripeness grounds both i the claim against the forest service for designating the rna,and ii the claim against the doi for the withdrawal under order.the claim against the forest service was unripe,it said,because p laintiffs ha d not filed a proposed plan of operations,or a notice of intent.id.at.it held that the claim against the doi was unripe because p laintiffs ha d not presented any evidence that this issue wa s ripe for review.id.
ii.discussion 
ripeness is a jurisdictional issue.park lake ii,at.we review the district court dismissal on ripeness grounds de novo and its findings of jurisdictional fact for clear error.coalition for sustainable,united states forest,cir.we need not consider the ripeness of plaintiffs claims anew,however,because principles of res judicata bar the action until plaintiffs take steps to cure the deficiencies pointed out to them in park lake ii.
res judicata is central to the purpose for which civil courts have been established,namely the conclusive resolution of disputes within their jurisdictions.montana united states,d.a party who has had a full opportunity to present a contention in court ordinarily should be denied permission to assert it on some subsequent occasion.geoffrey hazard,res nova in res judicata,cal.this bar protects against the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits,conserves judicial resources,and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions.montana,at.
res judicata doctrine encompasses two distinct barriers to repeat litigation claim preclusion and issue preclusion.see baker by thomas general motors,d charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure at ed.claim preclusion bars a party from relitigating a claim or cause of action on which final judgment has been rendered.see restatement second of judgments.under claim preclusion,a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action,sfhc,cir quoting allen mccurry,d.
this appeal concerns the other branch of preclusion preclusion.in contrast to claim preclusion,issue preclusion bars a party from relitigating an issue once it has suffered an adverse determination on the issue,even if the issue arises when the party is pursuing or defending against a
