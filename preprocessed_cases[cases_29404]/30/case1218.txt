background 
when the missouri pacific railroad company merged with the railroad company mkt in,it acquired from the mkt a lot in oklahoma city.the missouri pacific,and the mkt before it,leased the lot to the double eagle refining company and double eagle lubricants,which used the property to waste oil.aplees.to.these operations contaminated the double eagle site with various hazardous substances.aplees.in,the united states environmental protection agency added the site to its national priorities list.between and,the epa and the oklahoma department of environmental quality spent more than million cleaning up the groundwater and surface waste at the site.
the union pacific railroad company acquired the double eagle superfund site in,as part of its merger with the missouri pacific railroad company.aplees.in,the united states and the state of oklahoma collectively,the government sued union pacific for unreimbursed cleanup costs and natural resources damages related to the double eagle site under cercla damages provisions,a.aplees.to.the government sought to hold union pacific jointly and severally liable for the entire damages.aplees.to.that action is pending.
in the action underlying this appeal,the government sued,some other potentially responsible parties prps,for the entire cleanup costs and natural resources damages at the double eagle site.to.although the limitations period on the government friendly suit had already run,the government lodged a consent decree less than a week later.to corrected at.to.the consent decree memorialized a settlement agreement that the defendants would enjoy immunity from contribution actions or claims for the double eagle site,as provided by f of cercla,f.the settling defendants would collectively pay nearly million,ranging from to per defendant.to.the consent decree provided for a notice and comment period.to.the united states published the notice in the federal register.july.union pacific timely submitted the sole comments opposing the consent decree.at to.
on october,union pacific filed a motion to intervene as of right in the underlying action pursuant to.a,and cercla i,i.to.alternatively,union pacific asked the district court to allow permissive intervention under.b a.union pacific pointed to its potential contribution rights against the settling defendants and argued that it is entitled to protect those legally cognizable interests.according to union pacific,because the government claims against the settling defendants are already,the primary purpose and effect of the consent decree is for the settling defendants to obtain immunity from union pacific cercla contribution claims.both the government and the settling defendants opposed union pacific motion to intervene.to.
on december,the district court denied union pacific motion,concluding that union pacific did not have a legally sufficient interest to justify intervention as of right.the district court also denied permissive intervention because permitting union pacific to intervene at this stage would unduly delay the settlement and would prejudice the rights of plaintiffs and defendants.union pacific appealed the denial.
discussion 
we review the denial of a motion to intervene as of right de novo and denial of a motion for permissive intervention for an abuse of discretion.dejulius new england health care employees pension fund,cir citing city of stilwell ozarks rural coop,cir.the government suggests that we review a motion to intervene as of right for abuse of discretion because san juan county united states,cir en banc,adopted a more practical,approach to the interest requirement for such motions.fed.state aplees.br.gov t br.at.we can not agree we have consistently reviewed denials of motions to intervene as of right using a de novo standard.san juan county,at no party has suggested that our review is other than de novo wildearth guardians,at our review of these factors is de novo.
because union pacific claims that cercla establishes its interest in the underlying suit,we begin with that statute recovery and contribution provisions.cercla provides two means for private parties to recover costs associated with cleaning up hazardous substances.first,of cercla authorizes private parties as well as state and federal governments to recover the costs of a cleanup from potentially responsible parties prps.a.the government brought suits against union pacific and the settling defendants under this provision.the second provision,of cercla,is the one at the center of this appeal.f.section f provides a limited right for one responsible or potentially responsible party to seek contribution from other responsible or potentially responsible parties.union pacific contribution right is created by f,which provides 
any person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section a of this title,during or following any civil action under section of this title or under section a of this title.such claims shall be brought in accordance with this section and the federal rules of civil procedure,and shall be governed by federal law.in resolving contribution claims,the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under section of this title or section of this title.
id.f.section f limits that contribution right,cutting it off against prps who settle with the government 
a person who has resolved its liability to the united states or a state in an administrative or judicially approved settlement shall not be liable for claims for contribution regarding matters addressed in the settlement.such settlement does not discharge any of the other potentially liable persons unless its terms so provide,but it reduces the potential liability of the others by the amount of the settlement.
id.f.no one disputes that the consent decree with the settling defendants would trigger f and eliminate union pacific contribution right as to the settling defendants.for that reason,union pacific seeks to intervene in the underlying suit.
intervention as of right 
union pacific sought intervention as of right under both federal rule of civil procedure a and cercla.rule a provides intervention as of right to anyone who,o n timely motion,claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action,and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant ability to protect its interest,unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.we have summarized the requirements for intervention as of right as the application is timely the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action the applicant interest may as a practical matter be impaired or impeded and the applicant interest is not adequately represented by existing parties.utah ass of counties clinton,cir alteration in original quoting coalition of mexico counties dep t of interior,cir.
section i of cercla sets out a nearly identical intervention as of right.
in any action commenced under this chapter cercla in a court of the united states,any person may intervene as a matter of right when such person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action may,as a practical matter,impair or impede the person ability to protect that interest,unless the president or the state shows that the person interest is adequately represented by existing parties.
i.the only difference between cercla intervention provision and rule intervention as of right is that cercla places the burden of demonstrating that the existing parties adequately represent the potential intervenor interests on the government instead of the movant.united states union,cir united states pitney bowes,cir.
because both rule a and cercla require the same elements for intervention as of right,we examine each element in turn.
timeliness 
the appellees do not dispute that union pacific motion to intervene was timely.as noted by the district court,union pacific filed its motion shortly after the action was filed in the district court and before any scheduling order.to.
sufficient interest 
the central dispute in this case is whether union pacific contribution right is an interest legally sufficient for intervention as of right.the district court determined that union pacific interest in its contribution right was not legally sufficient.although the district court noted that the consent decree would extinguish union pacific contribution right,it declined to follow the eighth circuit holding that a prp contribution right under cercla is sufficient for intervention.discussing union,at.instead,the district court adopted the reasoning used by the central district of california in united states acorn engineering.according to the district court,the acorn engineering court deemed i ambiguous and thus consideration of the legislative history is appropriate.the district court continued,upon consideration,that legislative history demonstrates that prps seeking intervention in order to undermine the consent decree and protect their contribution interests were specifically intended to be exempted from the coverage provided by section i.quoting acorn eng g,at.the court added that intervention in this case would skew cercla early settlement incentives because it would delay the government settlement with these defendants.that union pacific was unable to reach a settlement does not now create a right to interfere in the settlement reached by the other parties.
we recently reconsidered what interests are legally sufficient for intervention as of right.in san juan county,the en banc court said that the interest requirement is not a mechanical rule.it requires courts to exercise judgment based on the specific circumstances of the case.at.at minimum,t he applicant must have an interest that could be adversely affected by the litigation.but practical judgment must be applied in determining whether the strength of the interest and the potential risk of injury to that interest justify intervention.id.
subsequently,we applied san juan county practical standard to economic interests.wildearth guardians,at.in wildearth guardians,a mine owner sought intervention as of right in an environmental group suit opposing the forest service plans to vent methane gas from the owner mine.id.at.this court reversed the district court denial of intervention,based on the mine owner economic stake in the litigation.if wildearth is successful in this litigation,operation of the west elk mine will be impaired,or even halted.id.at.we explained that t he threat of economic injury from the outcome of litigation undoubtedly gives a petitioner the requisite interest.id.at quoting utahns for better transp.dep t of,cir.
union pacific argues that its statutory right to contribution under cercla is a sufficient interest for intervention as of right.as noted,if the district court approves the settlement,f of cercla would eliminate the settling defendants contribution liability to union pacific.f.in the government separate suit against union pacific,it seeks to hold union pacific jointly and severally liable for the entire million in damages,offset by the nearly million in damages in the consent decree in this matter.aplt.br.at.if the court enters the consent decree,union pacific will not have an opportunity to seek contribution from the settling defendants.
this court has never decided whether a prp contribution right under cercla is a legally sufficient interest for intervention in a consent decree with other settling defendants.however,union pacific points to another circuit that has considered this question.aplt.br.at.in united states union electric,the eighth circuit held that a prp contribution interest is substantial and legally protectable.at.the eighth circuit concluded that these situations warrant intervention precisely because f would cut off the interest established by f id.at.that potential harm creates a direct and immediate interest on the part of the prps in the subject matter of the litigation.id.at.further,the eighth circuit rejected the argument put forth by the government and the settling prps that a prp contribution interest was too contingent on a chain of events.id.rather,the interest is present and not dependent on any future events n o finding of liability is required,nor assessment of excessive liability,before the contribution interest arises.only the recovery on a contribution claim must await the outcome of this or further litigation,not the right to bring such a claim.id.the potential intervenor needs only to be identified as a prp to support intervention.id.
the government and the settling defendants offer four main arguments why this court should find that union pacific interest in its cercla contribution right is not legally sufficient for intervention as of right.
first,the government argues that contribution under f is a qualified right that the statute makes unavailable against the settling defendants.gov t br.at.the government argues that one must read subsections and of f as a whole for a complete understanding of the contribution right.gov t br.at.because cercla itself circumscribes the contribution right that it creates,the government claims,union pacific contribution right has always been impaired.gov t br.at.a district court has applied this reasoning to find that cercla contribution right is not a direct,substantial,legally protectable interest.united states indus.chem,dist.lexis,at.the government correspondingly argues that union electric was wrongly decided because the eighth circuit in that case did not consider whether limits the contribution right.gov t br.at.
we read f as a whole and find that a contribution right exists until settlement with the government eliminates that right.that the statute,rather than the settlement,impairs the right upon a certain event does not mean that union pacific never has an interest in the underlying litigation.if anything,the fact of statutory impairment means that approval of the consent decree will certainly impair the right.
the government also applies its qualified right interpretation to claim that a subsequent eighth circuit decision undermines union electric because the court held that f is at all times limited by f.gov t br.at quoting united states bp amoco,cir.bp amoco in no way amended union electric holding that a prp has a sufficient interest for intervention as of right.in bp amoco,a party that had already intervened claimed that f contribution bar constituted an unconstitutional taking.bp amoco,at.but bp amoco considered a very different question whether a vested property interest existed.id.the court found that the party lacked a vested property interest given the limitation of f.id.these tests are distinct.of course,one claiming an economic interest may lack a present,vested property interest for the purposes of challenging a taking but still have a legally sufficient interest for intervention as of right.bp amoco presents that very situation the district court allowed a prp to intervene in a proposed consent decree between the government and settling prps.id.at.while the intervenor had a sufficient economic interest to intervene,his contribution right had not vested into a property interest for the government to take.id.at.
second,the government and the settling defendants,like the district court,argue that i is ambiguous and
