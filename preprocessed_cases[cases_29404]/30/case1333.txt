for centuries,a broad,shallow sheet of fresh water that covered most of south florida flowed south from lake okeechobee to the florida bay.this phenomenon was the river of grass or everglades,which supported unique and fragile flora and fauna.as so often happens with natural treasures,people sought to control and manipulate the everglades for their own ends.after the state of florida efforts to tame the everglades failed,in the army corps of engineers got involved.
the corps undertook the central southern florida flood project,which it hoped would control flooding,divert water away from developing areas,provide a source for irrigating crops,facilitate recreation,and enhance wildlife.see miccosukee tribe of indians united states.in order to bend the water to its will,the corps created thousands of miles of canals and levees supported by scores of pumps,gates,and dams.this massive plumbing project drained the northern portion of the original everglades for agricultural use and diverted water into distinct,deeper water conservation areas for controlled release into the southern part of the original area,which became everglades national park.there followed what the government artfully calls unplanned environmental consequences.this case involves one of those consequences,which pits a sparrow against a hawk.
the cape sable seaside sparrow,which we will refer to as simply the sparrow,lives primarily in and around everglades national park.it was listed as endangered in and received critical habitat designation in.the fragility of the sparrow as a species stems from two of its attributes.it has a short lifespan,and its nesting success depends on specific kinds of vegetation and water levels.if it is to survive,this species must have favorable breeding conditions without long periods of interruption.the sparrow exists in six subpopulations,all of which live in or around the everglades.one of them is located apart from the others,which might provide the species with a measure of protection against extinction if some calamity were to wipe out the other five subpopulations.this important outlying group,called subpopulation a,lives directly south of the of the bird designated critical it decreased from more than birds in to birds in.the corps method of releasing water into the everglades,specifically at its gates,has been blamed for that decline.
the everglade snail kite,a type of hawk,lives in the marshes of florida and cuba.like the sparrow,the kite was also listed as endangered in and received critical habitat designation in.and like the sparrow,the kite survival depends on specific water levels.kites feed primarily on apple snails,which require periods of inundation to reproduce,but the birds nest in woody vegetation that dies off if that inundation lasts too long or if the water level goes too high.it is,in that respect,a goldilocks kind of bird when it comes to water too low,not too high.during a period of regional drought,florida total kite population declined from birds in to in,but it appears to have stabilized since then.the kite designated critical habitat includes more than acres,of which just over a third are directly north of the gates in water conservation area.
the problem,then,is that the kites prefer steady and moderate to low water levels above the gates,while the sparrows prefer low water below the gates both birds are protected by the endangered species act of.the act outlaws the take of any endangered species and it defines take to include harm,which in turn includes significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns,including breeding,feeding,or sheltering.
section a requires every federal agency to ensure that its actions will not jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species.a.to coordinate their efforts to comply with section a,the agencies involved,here the army corps of engineers and the fish wildlife service,consult with each other.when a proposed agency action may adversely affect an endangered species or its critical habitat,the service creates a biological opinion determining whether the action would jeopardize the species.if the proposed action would not jeopardize the species but still might result in incidental harm to it,the service attaches to the biological opinion an incidental take statement establishing the terms and conditions under which the incidental take may occur.i.
in the early congress authorized a restructuring of the corps water management system in order to restore wildlife in the everglades.someone decided that the best way to figure out how to correct the unplanned environmental consequences was to undertake a series of tests,each lasting several years.during each test,water would be released from various gates in varying amounts.under one of these,test,the corps began releasing large amounts of water through the gates.those gates are located just to the north of the everglades between the habitats of the endangered kites and the endangered sparrows.test,which began in,was scheduled to continue until.
in the service and the corps,whose eyes were on the sparrow,began to modify their water releases in response to a dramatic decline in the sparrow population below the gates.to avoid flooding the little bird into extinction,the corps created an interim structural and operational plan that altered test by closing the gates during sparrow breeding season.in the service issued a biological opinion concluding that continued flooding through would lead to the extinction of the sparrow but also warning that stacking high water above might adversely impact the kite.
between and,the corps and the service consulted and developed the interim operational plan for the protection of the cape sable seaside sparrow interim plan.during the same period,a regional drought cut the number of kites statewide in half,from to birds.the service issued a second biological opinion in,this time analyzing the interim plan and concluding it would not jeopardize the kite or adversely modify its habitat.the corps then implemented the interim plan,which changed the water release schedule to create at least sixty continuous days each year,during sparrow breeding season,in which water below the gates would remain under feet above sea level.water began to back up north of the the kites critical habitat and on miccosukee tribal land.birds can not sue,but a tribe can and this one did 
in november the miccosukee tribe filed a lawsuit against the fish wildlife service,challenging its approval of the interim plan.meanwhile,in a separate case involving the same area that was filed under the national environmental policy act,the district court ordered the service to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement based on the interim plan.miccosukee tribe of indians united states,d.the service and the corps then consulted again to assess the impacts of continuing the interim plan.in november the service issued another biological opinion,this time including the supplemental environmental impact statement,but it still found that the kite would not be jeopardized by allowing the interim plan to continue until or for the good of the sparrow.
the miccosukee tribe,whose eye was on the kite and on tribal lands in,believed that the kite and the lands were jeopardized by the service actions.as a result,the tribe filed a second amended complaint in february,claiming that the service biological opinion violated the act and that the service consultation with the corps was deficient under section of the act.the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment,and the district court granted the government motion.this is the tribe appeal.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment and use the same standard of review utilized by the district court.sierra club leavitt,cir.biological opinions are final agency actions subject to judicial review under the administrative procedure act,a.bennett spear,d.specifically,the standard is whether the biological opinion is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a fund for animals,rice,cir on appeal,this court,in reviewing the administrative record,applies the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.
the arbitrary and capricious standard is exceedingly deferential.sierra club van antwerp,cir quotation marks omitted.we are not authorized to substitute our judgment for the agency as long as its conclusions are rational.id.we may,however,find an agency action 
arbitrary and capricious where the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.
rivers coal.kempthorne,cir citing motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.the supreme court has instructed us that when an agency is making predictions,within its area of special expertise,at the frontiers of science as opposed to simple findings of fact,a reviewing court must generally be at its most deferential.balt.gas natural res.def.council,d.
the miccosukee tribe launches a assault on the biological opinion and the incidental take statement.the tribe first contention is that the biological opinion is not in accordance with law because it fails to follow proper procedures,which require using the best available scientific data,giving the benefit of the doubt to the species,analyzing the environmental baseline and cumulative effects,and issuing a proper incidental take statement.see a.the tribe second contention is that the biological opinion is arbitrary and capricious because it arrives at conclusions that are counter to the scientific data in the record or that are so implausible they go beyond an acceptable difference of expert opinion.see,at.the tribe third contention is that the incidental take statement is deficient because it improperly quantifies incidental take in terms of habitat markers and fails to provide a meaningful trigger for.
the endangered species act requires the fish wildlife service,in preparing its biological opinions,to use the best scientific and commercial data available.a g.the general view is that the agency decides which data and studies are the best available because that decision is itself a scientific determination deserving deference.see marsh or.natural res.council,d when specialists express conflicting views,an agency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable opinions of its own qualified experts even if,as an original matter,the court might find contrary views more persuasive.balt.gas,at.at san luis badgley,d,explaining that under the endangered species act,a n agency has wide latitude to determine what is the best scientific and commercial data available quotation marks omitted.in deciding what is best available the service is required to seek out and consider all existing scientific data.heartwood,forest,cir.
the tribe argues that we should not afford the usual deference to the service decision about whether the kite is jeopardized because in reaching that decision it irrationally excluded certain scientific data from consideration.the tribe argues that the service ignored a number of studies and scientists statements that show alarming and dramatic declines in the kite population.but the tribe arguments do not hold water.
first,the tribe argues that the service ignored the snail kite demography reports for,and that were created by wiley kitchens and julien martin.however,as the tribe concedes,the report was used,and indeed,the biological opinion cites it repeatedly.because each year report is cumulative and includes all the data from the previous years,the report encompasses the others.
second,the tribe argues that the service ignored a population viability analysis performed by kitchens that contained a sharp warning about snail kites vanishing from florida.however,far from ignoring that report,the service sent it for peer review,where other scientists questioned it because of its failure to disclose its methodology or model inputs.one reviewer commented in that the report had a very high ratio of speculation to actual data,i think the highest i have ever seen because that peer review came two years before the biological opinion was issued in,it was not,as the tribe charges,a post hoc rationalization for excluding the report from the opinion.in fact,despite the negative peer reviews,some of the report factual findings were included in the biological opinion among them was the report estimate that the kite population had dropped by fifty percent between and.
the rest of the tribe arguments that the service did not use the best scientific and commercial data available all stem from the exclusion of specific numerical details,or even specific words,from the biological opinion.for instance,the tribe plays up the failure of the opinion to mention the kite report statement that did not support a single successful kite fledgling in.however,the biological opinion does note poor reproduction years,and it includes charts showing the low survival rate for all kite fledglings,regardless of location,from through.nor is the biological opinion statement that southern continues to support large numbers of snail kites and snail kite nesting inconsistent with no known fledglings surviving in one particular year.what makes the two facts consistent is that during successful breeding years can produce hundreds of fledgling kites.
similarly,the tribe complains that the service did not analyze a statement made by phil darby to the effect that more high water above the gates would lead to continued low densities of the apple snails that kites eat.the biological opinion,however,does cite darby statement,and it also specifies that apple snail density declined percent between and.
the tribe argues that the service failed to consider a analysis,performed by martin,that indicates degradation of the kite habitat and notes the breeding season.although the service did not use martin preliminary conclusions,it did use his data and in fact reproduced two tables directly from his report.
the tribe submits that the service failed to analyze another recent kitchens and martin study concluding that kites do not move to other areas in search of food as readily as was previously believed.the tribe admits,however,that the biological opinion mentions this issue.consistent with the new report,the biological opinion concludes that kites do move less frequently between isolated wetlands than scientists once believed.
finally,the tribe grouses that the service ignored an from kitchens in which he described the habitat degradation as rapid and the kites nesting failure in as alarming.the biological opinion,however,contains all of the relevant data upon which kitchens conclusions were based.all that seems to be missing is the word alarming.
while the biological opinion predictions do differ from those of some scientists who have studied the kite,the basic data is not in dispute and was taken into account by the service when it drafted the opinion.that is all the endangered species act requires the service to do with the best scientific and commercial data available.a marsh,at.at.
the tribe contends that the legislative history of the endangered species act demonstrates that congress generally wished to give the benefit of the doubt to the species,at conf,reprinted in.the tribe argues that those nine words from the joint explanatory statement of the conference committee,quoted in the house conference report,require a presumption in favor of the species if the evidence is balanced between likely jeopardy and no jeopardy.
to begin with,we are reluctant to read into the words that congress has enacted as law words that it did not enact as law.see miedema maytag,cir harris garner,cir en banc cbs,echostar comm ns,cir.
putting that reluctance aside for the time being,the context of the benefit of the doubt language in the conference report suggests only that agencies,including the service,can not hide behind uncertain scientific data to shirk their duties under the act.the report states 
if the biological opinion is rendered on the basis of inadequate information then the federal agency has a continuing obligation to make a reasonable effort to develop that information.
this language continues to give the benefit of the doubt to the species,and it would continue to place the burden on the action agency to demonstrate to the consulting agency that its action will not violate section a.furthermore the language will not absolve federal agencies from developing adequate information on which to base a biological opinion.
at,reprinted in at.the ninth circuit is the only court of appeals that has analyzed this benefit of the doubt language.in conner burford,cir,that court stated 
in light of the esa requirement that the agencies use the best scientific and commercial data available to insure that protected species are not jeopardized,a,the fws can not ignore available biological information or fail to develop projections of oil and gas activities which may indicate potential conflicts between development and the preservation of protected species.we hold that the fws violated the esa by failing to use the best information available to prepare comprehensive biological opinions to hold otherwise would eviscerate congress intent to give the benefit of the doubt to the species.
at.the conner opinion does not suggest that there is any presumption in favor of the species if,as in this case,there is abundant data.in conner the service violated the act by issuing a biological opinion without using the best available data.because that is not the case here,the tribe reliance on conner is misplaced.
the tribe also relies on natural resources defense council kempthorne,d,but in that case the court used the benefit of the doubt language only to force the agency to perform its obligation,not to dictate the conclusions it should reach.the court stated that an agency can not abdicate its responsibility to evaluate the impacts of an action on a species by labeling available information uncertain,because doing so violates congress intent that agencies give the benefit of the doubt to the species.id.
one district court,however,seems to have taken the position the tribe advocates.see rock creek alliance fish wildlife,d,a tie in the evidence should go to the species.the conclusion in rock creek was based in part on significant scientific blunders by the service.those blunders included using a study designed for a population of to bears to determine acceptable mortality rates for a population of to,against the explicit advice of the study author.id.at.the record reveals no similar mistakes in the service use of scientific data or studies in the present case.even if we were to adopt the rock creek position that a tie in the evidence goes to the species,there is no tie here.the scientific data before the service does not compel the conclusion that the evidentiary needle points straight up.
in any event,no court decision has ever relied solely on the conference report benefit of the doubt language to find that a biological opinion was arbitrary and capricious.the need to give a species the benefit of the doubt can not stand alone as a challenge to a biological opinion.
under section a of the endangered species act,the fish wildlife service consultation process must e valuate the effects of the action and cumulative effects on the listed species or critical habitat.g.that requires the service to define an environmental baseline.that,in turn,requires a description of the past and present impacts of all federal,state,or private actions and other human activities in the action area,the anticipated impacts of all proposed federal projects in the action area and the impact of state or private actions which are contemporaneous with the consultation in progress.
there are two current state projects within the acres of the kites critical habitat.these initiatives,called,are intended to assist the federal plan of restoring the everglades.the projects are not mentioned in the service biological opinion,and the tribe argues that this omission means that the service failed to meet its obligation to create a complete environmental baseline for the kite.the service responds that it relied on its own scientific conclusions,reached during the clean water act permitting process for,to support its biological opinion finding that the projects would not adversely impact the kite.those conclusions,memorialized in letters,were not part of the administrative record in this case and were struck by the district court,though the court did consider the service belief that the projects would have no adverse impact on the kite.
the tribe argument that the environmental baseline is inadequate fails.the regulations do require the biological opinion to include the impacts of any past or present state projects on the species.it does not follow,however,that the regulations require each biological opinion to thoroughly discuss state actions that the service in other consultations has already analyzed and determined do not impact the species.the tribe is unable to show that the two projects located within the acres of the kites critical habitat have any adverse impact on the kite,or that anyone believes that they do.in august and december the service determined that does not adversely impact the kite and recorded that decision in letters that are a matter of public record.the tribe argument that an environmental baseline requiring a discussion of impacts must rehash an earlier explanation of why a project has no impacts is not convincing.
the tribe urges that the entire environmental baseline analysis in the biological opinion is inadequate because it fails to analyze the cumulative impact of all past and present actions on the kite.the tribe argues that the biological opinion does not consider the effect on the kite of the nine years of sparrow protection undertaken between and,and that it does not analyze aggregate impacts on the kite from problems in other parts of its more than range.to the contrary,pages to of the biological opinion discuss the history of the kite population through,with significant focus on the population crash between and.further,at pages to,the opinion discusses the effects of environmental problems in lake okeechobee and in the kissimmee chain of lakes,which are the other parts of kite territory.
finally,the tribe argues that the biological opinion contains an insufficient cumulative effects analysis under and.a proper cumulative effects analysis must take into account future state or private activities,not involving federal activities,that are reasonably certain to occur in the action area.federal actions,and those involving federal agencies,are excluded from cumulative effects analysis because they are subject to their own consultation process.interagency cooperation regulations for department of the interior,june.this matters because state and private projects in the affected area fall within the jurisdiction of the army corps of engineers and thereby involve a federal agency.therefore,the actions would be exempt from consideration in the current cumulative effects analysis.even so,the biological opinion briefly considers the possibility of there being some development outside of the corps control.it concludes that based on the status of the species discussed previously and the status of the species in the action area,we believe that this is not expected to affect the recovery or survival of the wood stork or snail kite.that is enough analysis.
because the tribe has not demonstrated that the service failed to consider any major scientific work or any material fact when it rendered the biological opinion,we reject its procedural attack on that opinion.we turn now to the tribe challenge to the conclusions that the service drew from the scientific works and material facts.
the tribe contends that the conclusions contained in the biological opinion are arbitrary and capricious.see generally,at noting that it is arbitrary and capricious for an agency to offer an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.
the biological opinion concedes that the interim plan will continue to harm the kite habitat by flooding it.it acknowledges that water levels higher than feet above sea level degrade kite habitat and that water levels have exceeded feet in ten of the past thirteen years,compared with only four times during the forty years before any sparrow protection was undertaken.the service expects acres,which amounts to twenty percent of the kites critical habitat,to be flooded to feet each year that the interim plan continues.
the biological opinion acknowledges that the interim plan may also cause water levels to decline rapidly in kite habitat during the spring,threatening kite nests.that problem is addressed in the incidental take statement.the opinion also explains,however,that in most years,the nest failure rate within is expected to be less than what would occur with the maximum allowable water drop discussed in the incidental take statement.finally,the opinion notes that under some hydrological conditions the operation of the interim plan may actually be favorable to kite nesting conditions,though it does not specify what conditions or how.the opinion concludes 
continued interim plan operations are expected to result in continued habitat degradation within,which has been one of the most significant areas of kite habitat within the past years.in addition,interim plan operations are expected to result in reduced nest success of kites within,reduced foraging habitat suitability,and reduced abundance of the kite primary prey.these impacts are expected to limit population growth in and possibly cause further reductions in the overall kite population.however,because snail kites are,have high rates of adult survival,and continue to successfully nest in other portions of their range in southern florida,these impacts are not anticipated to appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the species in the wild.
degradation of designated critical habitat within is expected to continue under the interim plan,but this is reversible with improved hydrologic conditions.no permanent loss of critical habitat is expected.
in other words,despite all of the harm that it will cause the kite and kite habitat,the service believes that interim plan closings during sparrow breeding season will not jeopardize the continued existence of the kite or adversely modify its critical habitat within the meaning of the act.see generally a federal agency action must not be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of the critical habitat of such species.evidently the service is under the impression that flooding twenty percent of the kites critical habitat to a depth that kills the woody vegetation the bird likes to perch on,that drives off the apple snails it likes to eat,and that reduces its nesting success is not adverse modification of critical habitat within the meaning of the act.the service asserts that no permanent loss of critical habitat is expected.emphasis added but the service does not cite,and we are unable to find,any decision holding that negative impacts on a species critical habitat must be permanent to amount to adverse modification.nor did the service rely on its own regulation defining adverse modification,to reach that conclusion,which is understandable since that regulation has been invalidated by two federal courts of appeals.gifford pinchot task force fish wildlife,cir striking down the adverse modification definition contained in sierra club fish wildlife,cir same.
whether impacts on critical habitat amount to adverse modification depends to a large extent on the life cycle of the species.some species may be eradicated if their habitats are negatively affected even for a relatively short time.restoration of a habitat can not resurrect the dead.in pacific coast federation of fishermen ass ns united states bureau of reclamation,cir,the national marine fisheries service suggested a project to restore adequate water flow to the endangered coho salmon.the problem was that the coho had only a life cycle,and under the agency plan eight years would pass before water flows were restored to meet the coho need.id.understandably,the court noted that all the water in the world in and will not protect the coho,for there will be none left to protect.it is not sufficient for the agency to impose these flows without explaining how the flows will protect critical habitat and ensure that sufficient water is in the main stem for coho to survive during these first five generations.see also pac.coast fed of fishermen ass ns marine fisheries,cir given the importance of the period on the listed species survival it is difficult to justify the agency choice not to assess degradation over a time frame that takes into account the actual behavior of the species in danger.
the point of the two pacific coast decisions is that adverse modification must be measured by taking into account the life cycle and behavioral pattern of the endangered species in question.any biological opinion that plans to allow habitat,as part of a plan that anticipates the species future carefully consider the life cycles and behavioral patterns of the species to avoid crippling that recovery.it is not enough that the habitat will recover in the future if there is a serious risk that when that future arrives the species will be history.
that principle,however,is not fatal to the biological opinion conclusion.the opinion does not focus solely on whether the loss of critical habitat will be permanent it also determines effect on the species by taking into account the kite life cycle and behavior.the opinion states,and the tribe does not dispute,that the kite is a bird with a high adult survival rate and an enormous range covering than square designated critical habitat.nor does the tribe contend that the kite will be extinct after several more years of high water covering twenty percent of this critical habitat.indeed,closings have occurred since,and the kite population,though also afflicted by a drought between and,appears to have stabilized since.so far the kite has survived the adverse impact of the gate closings,making this case distinguishable from the pacific coast cases.see pacific coast,at observing that no coho salmon could possibly survive to enjoy their restored habitat after five generations without enough water.
moreover,as we pointed out earlier,we do owe a high level of deference to the service scientific determinations.the deference owed the biological opinion is especially strong because the agency had to predict future hydrologic conditions and estimate the likelihood,extent,and duration of injury to a species.balt.gas,at.at noting that when an agency is making predictions,within its area of special expertise,at the frontiers of science as opposed to simple findings of fact,a reviewing court must generally be at its most deferential.
we limit our conclusion,of course,to the facts of this case.those facts involve a program for restoring the everglades natural flow in a way that would cause temporary flooding of twenty percent of the critical habitat of a species of kite with a high adult survival rate and a wide range.the flooding is being done in an effort to avoid the extinction of an endangered sparrow in the area.the aim is to eventually restore the natural flow of the everglades,a restoration which hopefully will benefit both endangered birds.in light of these facts,the service determination in its biological opinion that the action will not jeopardize the kite or adversely modify its habitat within the meaning of the endangered species act is not arbitrary and capricious.
the tribe last contention is that the fish wildlife service incidental take statement is defective because it fails to specify,in numbers of birds,how much take is permissible.an incidental take statement may lawfully authorize harm to an endangered species as long as the statement sets a
