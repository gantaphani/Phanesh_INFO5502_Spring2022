appellants hereinafter citizens,a coalition of environmental groups,appeal the district court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of the united states department of agriculture and the united states forest service collectively the usda.asserting that the usda failed to comply with procedural requirements of the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act before promulgating its new national forest management policy the plan development rule,citizens sought injunctive relief to preclude implementation of the plan development rule until the usda complied with the statutory requirements.the district court held it did not have jurisdiction over this action because i citizens failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the rule threatened their concrete interests as their complaint was directed to neither a project nor a particular forest plan,and thus they lack standing and ii citizens failed to show any imminent injury and thus their claims are not ripe.because citizens alleges procedural injury,however,we hold that citizens established both standing and ripeness,and reverse and remand to the district court to determine whether injunctive relief is appropriate.
background 
historical overview 
national forests and grasslands are managed by the united states forest service,an agency within the united states department of agriculture.this agency utilizes a approach to forest management,prescribed by the forest and rangeland renewable resources planning act of and the national forest management act of nfma both statutes codified as amended at.
national uniform regulations promulgated by the secretary of agriculture constitute the highest tier of regulatory oversight of the forest management system and govern the development and revision of the regional and local plans.g.these regulations mandate the compliance of plans with the national environmental policy act of,nepa,specifically setting forth the circumstances that require preparation of an environmental impact statement eis.g.in addition,they set broad guidelines to be followed when preparing regional and plans regarding plant and animal species conservation,timber management,and water management.id.g.it is this type of regulation hereinafter referred to as a plan development rule that is at issue.
the next tier of regulatory oversight comprises regional land and resource management plans lrmps for large units in the national forest and grassland system.a.these plans operate like zoning ordinances,defining broadly the uses allowed in various forest regions,setting goals and limits on various uses from logging to road construction,but do not directly compel specific actions,such as cutting of trees in a particular area or construction of a specific road.see ohio forestry ass n,sierra club,d.the content and promulgation of these plans must comply with the plan development rule.
at the lowest tier of forest rules are the plans,which are prepared to effect specific,actions these plans must be consistent with both sets of rules.i.
the usda promulgated the first national plan development rule in,accompanied by a full eis analyzing the environmental impact of the regulation.see national forest system land and resource management planning.forest,dep t of agric,creating pt.plan development rule.this rule was,and was substantially revised in.see national forest system land and resource management planning.forest,dep t of agric,amending pt.plan development rule.when initially published in the federal register as a draft rule,the plan development rule was accompanied by a brief environmental assessment ea,but not a full eis see,app.a at.
the plan development rule set out a comprehensive approach to forest management,implementing the statutory directive.see.at revising a.this rule required that f ish and wildlife habitat shall be managed to maintain viable populations thereof,further defining a viable population as one which has the estimated numbers and distribution of reproductive individuals to insure its continued existence is well distributed in the relevant area.see id.at creating emphasis added.in addition,the rule required the development of regional guides,which provide d standards and guidelines for addressing major issues and management concerns which need to be considered at the regional level to facilitate forest planning.see id.at revising.furthermore,the rule contained minimum specific management requirements,setting forth mandatory directives which all regional lrmps must follow,and specific,quantifiable baselines below which no lrmp or plan can fall.see id.at creating.these requirements included,inter alia,establishment of buffers around bodies of water and specific limits on.see id.
although not put in place through the same rulemaking notice as the rule,procedures for the public to appeal certain decisions relating to lrmps existed prior to the rule.these procedures were modified several times between the early and the later rule.see pt.previous codification at.the pre appeal rule permitted members of the public to file a notice of appeal within days of the date specified in the published legal notice for land and resource management plan approvals,significant amendments,or revisions,id.a,within days after a final decision is made.
b.the plan development rule 
the rule was the subject of the usda unsuccessful effort at amendment,culminating in with a draft rule that was never finalized.subsequently,the secretary of agriculture convened a scientist committee under h,to offer recommendations for revising the plan development rules.after conducting a number of public meetings and conferences,the usda published a proposed rule in late,soliciting further public comment.see.the public comment period ran from october,through february.see.
unlike the previous draft plan development rules,the proposed rule did not include any analysis of its environmental impact and did not specifically solicit comments on this matter.the usda did,however,state that it would complete an environmental review at some point before the adoption of a final rule.at.it claims that it complied with this promise,preparing an environmental assessment ea and finding of no significant impact fonsi dated july,over five months after the close of the comment period for the proposed rule,although these documents were never published in the federal register.they were,however,apparently available on the forest service website.the usda never completed any biological assessment of the rule impact on endangered species under the endangered species act esa nor did it engage in formal consultation with the secretaries of the interior or commerce 
the final version of the plan development rule was published on november.national forest system land and resource management planning.forest,dep t of agric.the published version was not accompanied by any environmental or analysis,although it did note the existence of the ea and fonsi,thus the usda did not entertain comments regarding the rule environmental impact.id.at.
this rule substantially modified the rule in a number of ways.first,it relaxed the species viability requirement by providing that p lan decisions affecting species diversity must provide for ecological conditions that provide a high likelihood that those conditions are capable of supporting over time the viability of species well distributed throughout their ranges within the plan area.id.at amending b emphasis added.the rule had more stringently required that the usda insure continued species existence.at.the rule also eliminated the requirement of developing and issuing regional guides to maintain regional consistency in forest management.see.at.it further eliminated many of the minimum specific management requirements.for example,in comments submitted in response to the draft rule,the environmental protection agency epa observed that while the rule contain s specific limits on clear cutting of trees,the proposed rule would require only that individual forest plans provide standards and guidelines for timber harvest and regeneration methods,and asked h ow will the proposed rule ensure requirements necessary for sustainability 
finally,the plan development rule eliminated the appeal process of pt,and replaced it with a objection process.at removing pt.id.at creating.under this new process,members of the public wishing to object to an amendment or revision of an lrmp have days from the date an eis is made available to do so.see id.thus,this process can occur before the finalization of the planned amendment if the eis is published more than days before the amended lrmp becomes final.
the rule contained a transitional provision designed to facilitate the move from the requirements of the rule usda officials were permitted to comply with either the rule or the rule for plans that were under revision at the time and for which final or draft eiss would be completed by may.see id.at creating b.a technical amendment issued a few weeks later,clarifying that the choice to comply with either rule included the choice to comply with either the old appeal rules or the new objection process,creating b app.a.
district court proceedings 
citizens filed suit in the northern district of california on february,challenging both the substance of the rule under nfma,as well as procedural violations of nepa and the esa in its promulgation.
shortly thereafter,usda announced that it was considering revising the rule,noting serious concerns that have arisen regarding some of the provisions of the rule,including specifically the revised rule impact on ecological sustainability and species viability.see.may.the usda announcement noted the existence of this lawsuit as one of the reasons behind its decision.id.the announcement also modified the rule transitional provision,extending until may,the period within which usda officials could choose to follow either the rule or the rule.see id.at amending b.
soon thereafter,usda definitively announced that it was developing a new rule to replace the plan development rule,planning to have it in place before the expiration of the revised transitional provision in.see.when it became clear that the usda could not meet this timetable,it again amended the transitional provision to allow usda officials to choose between the and rules u ntil the department of agriculture promulgates the revised final planning regulations announced on december,may,amending b.
citizens and the usda thereafter stipulated to stay the portion of this action challenging the merits of the rule pending the rule revision.the parties did not agree to stay the procedural challenge to the rule.citizens moved for partial summary judgment on its procedural claims,seeking to enjoin any further implementation of the rule until the procedural violations had been cured.the usda filed a for summary judgment,asserting that citizens lacked standing to challenge the rule and that its claims were not ripe for review.
on february,the district court granted the usda motion for partial summary judgment and denied citizens motion for partial summary judgment,holding that the suit was not justiciable for lack of standing and ripeness.upon citizens filing of motions for reconsideration and clarification,the district court reaffirmed its order,making clear that its ruling also constituted a denial of citizens request for injunctive relief.

iii.standing 
to satisfy article iii standing requirements,a plaintiff must show it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
injury in fact 
to satisfy the injury in fact requirement,a plaintiff asserting a procedural injury must show that the procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of his that is the ultimate basis of his standing.public citizen dep t of,cir quoting cantrell city of long beach,cir.furthermore,he or she need s to establish the reasonable probability of the challenged action threat to his or her concrete interest.hall norton,cir quoting churchill county babbitt,cir.thus,to show a cognizable injury in fact,citizens must allege and on summary judgment adduce sufficient facts to show that the usda violated certain procedural rules these rules protect citizens concrete interests and it is reasonably probable that the challenged action will threaten their concrete interests.
procedural violation 
citizens were deprived of the opportunity to comment on the usda ea and fonsi at all points in the rulemaking process.this deprivation violated their rights under the regulations implementing nepa.see b the agency shall involve the public,to the extent practicable,in preparing eas id.agencies shall m ake diligent efforts to involve the public in preparing and implementing their nepa procedures,p rovide public notice of the availability of environmental documents so as to inform those persons who may be interested or affected,and s olicit appropriate information from the public.but pogliani united states army corps of eng rs,cir per curiam holding that environmental plaintiffs have no right to see and comment on before they issue,unless e applies.
we reject the usda dismissal of these regulatory requirements as hortatory.although it is true that a n ea need not conform to all the requirements of an eis,or.citizens against toxic sprays,clark,cir,this requirement does not mean that b and are without substance.we have previously interpreted these regulations to mean that t he public must be given an opportunity to comment on draft eas and eiss.anderson evans,cir.the second circuit has held that is satisfied when the agency conducted public hearings and received written comments on every draft environmental assessment and circulated for comment its preliminary analysis of the environmental assessment,even though it did not circulate for public comment a independent analysis it prepared in response to public comments.town of rye skinner,cir per curiam see also hanly kleindienst,cir b efore a preliminary or threshold determination of significance is made the responsible agency must give notice to the public of the proposed major federal action and an opportunity to submit relevant facts which might bear upon the agency threshold decision.
although we have not established a minimum level of public comment and participation required by the regulations governing the ea and fonsi process,we clearly have held that the regulations at issue must mean something.hart mclucas,cir i n the construction of administrative regulations,it is presumed that every phrase serves a legitimate purpose.it is evident,therefore,that a complete failure to involve or even inform the public about an agency preparation of an ea and a fonsi,as was the case here,violates these regulations.this wholesale neglect of the regulations mandatory inclusion of the public in the process results in a procedural injury moreover,it undermines the very purpose of nepa,which is to ensure that federal agencies are informed of environmental consequences before making decisions and that the information is available to the public.okanogan highlands alliance williams,cir.
standing may properly hinge on this type of injury.we have determined that an environmental plaintiff was surely harmed when agency action precluded the kind of public comment and participation nepa requires in the eis process,and that this type of procedural injury is tied to a substantive harm to the environment the harm consists of added risk to the environment that takes place when governmental decisionmakers make up their minds without having before them an analysis with public comment of the likely effects of their decision on the environment.nepa object is to minimize that risk,the risk of uninformed choice west sec y of dep t of,cir quoting sierra club marsh,cir.the same can be said for failure to allow any public input in the process,which is,after all,the threshold step for determining whether to prepare an eis in the first place.
citizens also allege that the usda failed to comply with the procedural consultation and requirements of the esa before promulgating the plan development rule.this type of procedural injury is also cognizable for standing purposes.see envtl.prot.info.ctr.simpson timber,cir 
concrete interests 
in nepa cases,we have described the concrete interest test as requiring a geographic nexus between the individual asserting the claim and the location suffering an environmental impact.public citizen,at quoting cantrell,at that is,environmental plaintiffs must allege that they will suffer harm by virtue of their geographic proximity to and use of areas that will be affected by the usda policy.
citizens have done just that.they have properly alleged,and supported with numerous affidavits covering a vast range of national forests around the country,that their members use and enjoy national forests,where they observe nature and wildlife.the supreme court has held that environmental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened by the challenged activity.laidlaw.at quoting sierra club morton,d.
citizens need not assert that any specific injury will occur in any specific national forest that their members visit.the asserted injury is that environmental consequences might be overlooked as a result of deficiencies in the government analysis under environmental statutes.salmon river concerned citizens robertson,cir.were we to agree with the district court that a nepa plaintiff standing depends on proof that the challenged federal project will have particular environmental effects,we would in essence be requiring that the plaintiff conduct the same environmental investigation that he seeks in his suit to compel the agency to undertake.city of davis coleman,cir.
reasonable probability 
environmental plaintiffs seeking to enforce a procedural requirement the disregard of which could impair a separate concrete interest of theirs,can establish standing without meeting all the normal standards for immediacy.hall,at quoting defenders of wildlife,at.rather,they need only establish the reasonable probability of the challenged action threat to their concrete interest.id.at quoting churchill county,at.
citizens correctly assert that the plan development rule decreases substantive environmental requirements thus injuring their concrete interest in enjoying the national forests as compared to the plan development rule the rule decreased the species viability requirement from one in which the usda must insure that forest conditions support the viability of existing species,to one in which the usda must only guarantee a high likelihood of supporting their viability.compare.at amending b rule,with.at creating rule.
the rule also eliminated many of the minimum specific management requirements that were part of the rule.at creating.for example,the epa observed in its comments on the draft rule that while the rule contain s specific limits on clear cutting of trees,the proposed rule would require only that individual forest plans provide standards and guidelines for timber harvest and regeneration methods,and asked h ow will the proposed rule ensure requirements necessary for sustainability 
finally,the plan development rule eliminated the appeal process of pt,and replaced it with a objection process.at removing pt.id.at creating.under the rule,members of the public wishing to object to an amendment or revision of an lrmp have days from the date an eis is made available to do so,see,while under the procedures it replaced,they had days from the notice of the final rule to do so,a.citizens aver that this change has harmed them and will continue to harm them because the period is insufficient for comprehensive review of proposed agency actions and thus impairs their ability to file any objections.
the plan development rule in fact does not result in any direct environmental effects.its environmental impact is indirect because the rule controls the development of lrmps and plans,it is through these that it poses an actual,physical effect on the environment in national forests and grasslands the usda argues that the indirect effect that any changes to a plan development rule poses to the physical by the fact that any lrmps created pursuant to the plan development rule would be subject to the requirements of a finding that there is an insufficient connection between the asserted procedural injury and the concrete interests at stake.
our precedent compels us to conclude otherwise.we have rejected the reasoning urged upon us by the usda in at least three cases.see resources robertson,cir salmon river concerned citizens,at idaho conservation league,at.in idaho conservation,environmental plaintiffs challenged an lrmp for the idaho panhandle forest,claiming its substantive provisions violated the nfma,and that its accompanying environmental analysis violated nepa.at.we acknowledged that d irect implementation of the lrmp occurs at a second stage,when individual projects are proposed and assessed,and that these projects entailed further nepa analysis.id.at.we went on to reject the forest service argument that the effect of the challenged action is too remote to sustain standing,id.at,reasoning 
notwithstanding the fact that the lrmp concrete effect might be seriously mitigated at the level,it represent s an important decision.this becomes particularly clear if we bear in mind the statutory source that defines appellants right and imposes appellees duty.the standing examination,in other words,must focus on the likelihood that the defendants action will injure the plaintiff in the sense contemplated by congress.
viewed in this light,and whether or not it is irrevocable,the forest service decision is harmful for standing purposes.the plaintiff complaint is that the faulty eis had made possible development that wilderness designation would have prevented.pursuant to nepa and the nfma,these are injuries that we must deem immediate,not speculative.indeed,short of assuming that congress imposed useless procedural safeguards,and that wilderness designation is a superfluous step,we must conclude that the lrmp plays some,if not a critical,part in subsequent decisions.
more importantly perhaps,if the agency action only could be challenged at the development stage,the underlying programmatic authorization would forever escape review.to the extent that the plan the future,it represents a concrete injury that plaintiffs must,at some point,have standing to challenge.
id.at emphases in original.
in salmon river,plaintiffs challenged the forest service vegetation management policy for the pacific southwest region and the accompanying eis as violating nepa.at.the policy permitted for the first time the use of herbicides in certain circumstances in regional forests,but delegat ed to district foresters,for the most part,the discretion to apply herbicides at the project level.id.at.we held that the plaintiffs had standing to sue 
u nfettered use of herbicides in this region in the absence of nepa compliance will cause harm to visitors recreational use and enjoyment,if not to their health.speculation that the application of herbicides might not occur is irrelevant.the asserted injury is that environmental consequences might be overlooked,as a result of deficiencies in the government analysis under environmental statutes.
