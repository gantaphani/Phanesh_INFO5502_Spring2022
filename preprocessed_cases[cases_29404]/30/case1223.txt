introduction 
this is an appeal from a judgment in favor of the united states in a cost recovery action under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla.at trial,the parties disputed the degree to which each is liable for trichloro ethylene tce contamination near hangar and hangar at public in herington,kansas.the united states army used the airfield from to.raytheon aircraft company is a successor to beech aircraft corporation,which operated the airfield during the.the united states and raytheon agree they are the only two potentially liable parties.
raytheon appeals the district court finding that it is solely liable for contamination at hangar,as well as the court decision to award the united states costs associated with its attempts to list the site on the national priorities list npl.exercising jurisdiction pursuant to,this court affirms the district court decision.
ii.background 
the army operated herington field from to for processing military aircraft during world war ii.raytheon predecessor,beech,operated the airfield during the.the airfield four hangars were located adjacent to the tarmac and ran north to south with hangar at the northernmost position.
in the,tce contamination was discovered immediately to the north of hangar and surrounding hangar.the kansas department of health and the environment kdhe confirmed the groundwater beneath the site was contaminated with tce and its degradation compounds.the kdhe prepared a report of its findings,which it forwarded to the environmental protection agency epa.the epa then sought information from the army corps of engineers and raytheon regarding the use of tce at the site.raytheon admitted it utilized tce in two vapor degreasers,one in hangar and another in hangar,and stored tce in drums in a building to the northwest of hangar.the army corps of engineers denied the army ever used tce at the site.
the epa conducted an expanded site inspection esi and remedial investigation at herington field to determine the nature and extent of the contamination.the investigation culminated in a final report concluding the tce contamination stemmed from beech use of vapor degreasers at various locations identified as the primary sources of contamination.the epa also used the esi in support of its proposal to list the site on the npl,the list,compiled by epa pursuant to cercla section,of uncontrolled hazardous substance releases in the united states that are priorities for remedial evaluation and response.the site was never listed on the npl,however,because the state of kansas withheld its consent.
at the direction of the epa and kdhe,raytheon undertook various cleanup efforts at the site,including the excavation of a large area north of hangar.raytheon contended,however,that the army did use tce at the site during its world war ii operations and was responsible for the costs incurred in cleaning up the site.ultimately,raytheon brought an action against the united states for cost recovery under a of cercla and for contribution under a and f.the united states counterclaimed for cost recovery under a and a a and for contribution under f.
the district court conducted a bench trial.the evidence at trial is summarized as follows.herington field was constructed in and was activated in early as the military expanded to meet wartime needs.beginning in may,bombers began to arrive at herington field.the program was a high priority because the bomber was capable of reaching the japanese mainland without needing to refuel.
tce is a colorless solvent used to remove oil and grease from metal parts.tce was the army preferred degreasing agent during wwii.one method of degreasing aircraft parts was to use a vapor degreaser in which the metal part is suspended above a boiling vat of tce.the tce vapors rise and cool,condensing on the metal part.as the tce drips back into the vat,it removes the oil and grease.the district court determined if a vapor degreaser had been used at herington field,it would have employed tce.
expert testimony indicated the army received the tce it needed during world war ii,though the parties experts disagreed as to how much tce was actually needed.raytheon expert,doherty,is an environmental engineer who has studied the use of tce in the united states.he testified the army enjoyed adequate supplies,and at times a surplus,of tce during the war.on the other hand,brigham,a historical expert for the united states whom the court deemed highly credible,testified the government regulated the distribution of many chemicals,including tce,so manufacturing products could be properly apportioned for the war effort.according to brigham,the vast majority of tce was allocated to defense contractors for the production of airplanes,tanks,and guns.for instance,in,the war production board anticipated that over of tce would be allocated for this use,while the army itself would only receive a small amount.apportionment of tce continued throughout the war.
due to this apportionment of tce,the army itself had to internally regulate how its share of tce would be used.thus,a november army technical order limited the use of tce vapor degreasing to depots and such stations as are specifically authorized to employ this method of cleaning.depots performed maintenance,which is the highest and most sophisticated level,including complete engine overhauls and restoration of damaged aircraft.herington field was classified as a subdepot,and a number of war veterans,who worked at herington field and were deemed highly credible,testified herington field performed only maintenance maintenance occurred at tinker field in oklahoma city,oklahoma.
consequently,herington field was not permitted to use the vapor degreasing method without special authorization,and no direct evidence of any such authorization was produced.raytheon pointed out an additional,but unavailable,technical order was issued in april,and raytheon suggested it may have lifted constraints on tce use.the nature of the order,however,was never confirmed.
the parties also presented testimony from war veterans who worked at herington field.some of these witnesses stated the at herington field were typically new and needed little maintenance.there was also testimony the could be cleaned with soap and water or else simply wiped with a rag.this description of the cleaning process was consistent with the november technical order which advocated the use of soft soap when practical,and other cleaners,such as kerosene,when soap was not effective.
raytheon presented evidence that even new needed thorough cleaning due to their tendency to leak oil and argued tce was likely used because of the high priority given to the program.raytheon also presented evidence that aircraft were cleaned in the area north of hangar where heavy tce contamination was found.likewise,spark plugs were cleaned in a building near the same location.according to raytheon,the focus of the army degreasing operations in the exact area where the contamination occurred establishes the army use of tce.
raytheon sought to bolster its claim the army used tce by presenting evidence that tce was often used as a winterizer in fire extinguishers.raytheon,however,could not provide evidence the fire extinguishers at herington field ever required winterization or were actually winterized.
raytheon also presented testimony from veterans as direct evidence of tce use.colonel bickerstaff,who worked at herington field during world war ii,remembered a vapor degreaser being used to clean spark plugs.the district court,however,ultimately found that colonel bickerstaff lacked credibility on this issue because he candidly noted he worked at many bases during his years of service and did a lot of things and kind of lost track of what he did do.additionally,colonel bickerstaff description of the degreaser included the presence of an agitator,a glass enclosure,and a glass top.the expert testimony established an agitator mechanism would not have been used on a vapor degreaser,and no expert knew of a vapor degreaser with a glass top or enclosure.further doubt was cast on colonel bickerstaff account because the spark plug building was equipped with fans and a blower system,which suggests the army used a flammable solvent to clean spark plugs rather than tce,a solvent.
raytheon also offered the deposition testimony of another veteran,rosendale,who initially stated tce was used at herington field.the court ultimately disregarded his testimony as lacking credibility because rosendale appeared to be a highly suggestible witness.further undermining his testimony on this point was rosendale later clarification on,i do know if it was tce,but it was a cleaning solvent but tce,i do remember it actually being used as,you know,the solvent.that too many years ago.
aside from colonel bickerstaff and rosendale testimony,no other veteran directly remembered the use of tce at herington field.they instead described a solvent like kerosene,which the united states experts testified was probably stoddard solvent rather than tce.
beech,on the other hand,undisputably used tce in two large vapor degreasers while operating the airfield.though it admitted this fact,raytheon argued the nature of beech use of tce made it unlikely beech was the party responsible for the contamination immediately to the north of hangar.for instance,one of beech vapor degreasers was located in the southwest corner of hangar and any spills would have drained to the south where no tce was located.beech other vapor degreaser was located in hangar.raytheon also presented evidence that from to,it used only phenols at the north end of hangar.those phenols did not contain tce and,in any case,initially drained to a collecting pond north of hangar in an area where no tce was found.the drain was later to three imhoff tanks,again where no tce contamination was present.moreover,while phenols did travel the entire length of the drain,no tce was detected there,which raytheon claims indicates tce was never disposed of through the drain at all.
additionally,no tce contamination was located in the storage area to the northwest of hangar where beech stored its tce.because tce contamination north of hangar was concentrated near army degreasing operations rather than beech tce operations,raytheon argued the contamination must have been caused by the army.
raytheon next offered testimony from its expert,mesard,regarding the contaminant plume in an attempt to show the tce must have been in the soil long before beech used the airfield.specifically,the leading edge of the plume contains only tce.the rest of the plume contains a mixture of tce and its degradation products,dce,and vinyl chloride vc.as mesard explained,this is significant because tce degrades into dce and vc when a significant carbon source,such as the phenols beech used from to,is present in an environment without oxygen.tce,dce,and vc all adhere to organic carbon sources and tend to move at a slower rate than the flow of groundwater.tce is undeniably the slowest moving of the three,such that if all were introduced into the soil at the same time,vc would lead the plume,followed by dce,then tce.but because tce leads the plume at herington field,mesard opined tce must have been introduced prior to phenol,meaning the army introduced at least some,if not all,of the tce.
the united states expert,robertson,offered a different explanation as to why tce led the plume.robertson noted the area north of hangar sits on a thick layer of overburden,which contains clay.the overburden also sits on bedrock.the area around hangar,on the other hand,has a thin layer of overburden,which is nonexistent in some of the contamination hot spots.thus,the layer of bedrock at hangar is more permeable.consequently,he opined contaminants released at hangar likely migrated to the aquifers below the bedrock much more quickly than the contaminants at hangar.once the tce reached the aquifers under hangar,it traveled north and contaminated the area below hangar before the tce released at hangar reached the area.as a result,robertson concluded the tce leading the contaminant plume originated at hangar and was able to bypass the contaminants released at hangar.because this tce never interacted with the phenol,he claimed it did not degrade in the same manner as the tce released at hangar.
in another attempt to persuade the court beech did not release the tce contaminants,raytheon presented testimony that beech recycled its tce waste and therefore would not have released it into the ground.this testimony came from a former beech chemist,xury hole,who worked at herington field.however,hole admitted the degreasers were cleaned during the evenings or on weekends when he was not working.though he believed the waste was removed and placed into drums for recycling,he never actually witnessed this process.he also admitted he would have no way of knowing whether the tce waste was ever dumped or otherwise disposed of onsite.
in considering all of this evidence,the court found the united states experts credible and found raytheon had not met its burden of establishing the army ever used tce at all.because it was undisputed beech did use tce,the court found any contamination must have come from beech operations.as a result,the district court held raytheon wholly liable for the contamination.accordingly,raytheon was ordered to pay a total of for the epa response costs.
iii.discussion 
a.the district court findings 
raytheon argues the district court erred in finding raytheon solely liable for the tce contamination to the north of hangar this court reviews the district court factual findings for clear error,giving the district court credibility determinations great deference.creative consumer concepts,kreisler,cir.if the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.id.quoting anderson city of bessemer city,d.
raytheon claims the district court ignored much of the evidence presented and made inconsistent rulings to support its findings.primarily,raytheon argues it established the army was at least partially liable for the contamination because the army operations were focused in the exact areas where tce contamination was later located,while beech use of tce in hangar was limited to the southwest corner.raytheon claims this evidence,coupled with herington field important task of maintaining the,the highest priority aircraft during the war,makes it clear the army would have used tce,its preferred solvent,to clean these aircraft before sending them into battle.
while this circumstantial evidence could certainly support an inference that the army did use tce at the site,it does not compel such a finding.the most important consideration before the district court was whether the army actually used tce at herington field,which raytheon was unable to conclusively establish.the evidence presented from the government historical expert established the army placed restrictions on the availability of tce and apportioned its use primarily to defense contractors for the manufacture of wartime goods.as part of this apportionment,the military itself limited the use of tce in vapor degreasers to depots,but herington field was only a subdepot.while special authorization could have permitted herington field use of tce for vapor degreasing,raytheon was unable to establish such authorization was ever given.the court also found credible the testimony of various war veterans who stated soap and water were in fact used to clean the new,which they testified did not need much cleaning.
raytheon challenges the district court reliance on military rationing in light of evidence the army stockpiled tce and had all it needed during the war.raytheon contends it is more likely herington field did have special authorization to use tce because other subdepots were undisputably using vapor degreasers even though those subdepots did not process the indispensable.while this evidence certainly supports raytheon case,it merely establishes the army could have used tce at herington field had it obtained the proper authorizatio
