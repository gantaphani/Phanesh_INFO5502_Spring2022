several mining industry groups and mine operators petition for review of three mine safety and health administration msha rules that regulate diesel particulate matter dpm in underground metal and mines.petitioners contend that msha did not have sufficient evidence that dpm presents a risk to miners health,that msha unreasonably chose to regulate other substances as surrogates for dpm,and that the dpm exposure limits in the new rules can not feasibly be achieved by mine operators.petitioners also assert that msha unlawfully granted medical evaluation and transfer rights to workers who are required to wear respirators,and that msha final implementation timetable was not a logical outgrowth of the proposed rules.we find these arguments to be without merit,and we deny the petitions for review.
diesel exhaust is comprised of both gasses and particulate matter.the challenged rules regulate only the particulate components of diesel exhaust.other provisions of msha rules,not at issue in this case,regulate exposure to diesel exhaust gasses.see.
on january,msha promulgated rules setting concentration limits for diesel particulate matter in underground metal and mines diesel particulate matter exposure.rules.first,msha conducted a risk assessment for dpm.the agency determined that miners were exposed to very high levels of dpm,and that this exposure can cause numerous adverse health effects,including eye irritation,respiratory problems,and lung cancer.id.at.msha concluded that it was necessary to regulate dpm exposure to protect miners from these risks.id.at.second,the agency determined that there was no reliable way to measure dpm directly for compliance purposes.id.at.therefore,msha chose to regulate total carbon tc as a surrogate for dpm.id.at.total carbon was deemed to be a reliable surrogate because there was evidence in the record that tc makes up approximately of dpm,and that this is a consistent relationship.id.in the rules,msha set concentration limits of micrograms of tc effective july and micrograms of tc effective january id.at.during the rulemaking,several commenters argued that tc was an unreliable surrogate for dpm because it was susceptible to interference from other organic carbon compounds,such as tobacco smoke and oil mist.however,msha concluded that it could avoid these problems by collecting samples a sufficient distance away from possible sources of interference.id.at.lastly,in its rules,msha determined that mine operators could feasibly comply with the new dpm exposure limits.id.at.the agency identified numerous control technologies that could be used to reduce dpm emissions,including exhaust filters,environmental cabs,engines,improved ventilation systems,low sulfur fuels,and better training and maintenance.id.at.
several parties petitioned for review of the rules.msha conceded that there were problems with the regarding the use of tc as a surrogate for agreed to conduct further research to address the problem of interference with tc sampling.after a study of mines,msha,the miners unions,and the industry groups agreed to several changes to the rules.the effective date for the tc interim limit was postponed until july.diesel particulate matter exposure.also,msha concluded that tc was an unreliable proxy for dpm in certain circumstances,and promised to initiate an expedited rulemaking to change the dpm surrogate from total carbon to elemental carbon ec.id.
in a rulemaking completed in june,msha made several changes to its rules.diesel particulate matter exposure.rules.most importantly,msha converted the interim dpm limit from tc to ec,based on a conversion factor of to.id.at.this conversion factor was calculated based on data from samples in the study.id.the agency expressed confidence that this sampling and conversion methodology produces a reasonable estimate of tc without interferences.id.however,the agency did not convert the final limit from ec to kept that limit at tc,pending further rulemaking.id.at.in the rules,msha also made two key changes with respect to feasibility.first,the rules state that mine operators must require miners to wear respirators if controls do not reduce a miner exposure to the dpm limit,controls are infeasible,or controls do not produce significant reductions in dpm exposures.id.at.second,msha permitted mine operators to seek a renewable extension of the compliance deadline if they could show that they were unable to meet the dpm exposure limits.id.at.
in september,msha sought comments on several more proposed changes to the dpm rules.diesel particulate matter exposure.proposed rules.the agency noted that mine operators were having some difficulties with new filter and engine technologies,and thus proposed extending the effective date for the final limit of tc to with a graduated period.id.at.it also proposed adding medical evaluation and transfer rights for miners who would be forced to wear respirators because their employers were not in compliance with the dpm exposure limits.id.at.
in may,msha once again amended the dpm rules.diesel particulate matter exposure.rules.the rules departed from msha proposal by postponing the effective date for the tc final limit for only two years to may.they also set a new interim limit of tc,effective january.id.at.msha promised to initiate a separate rulemaking to convert these final limits from tc to the more reliable ec.id.at.with respect to feasibility,the agency determined that several types of dpm control technologies were becoming more readily available,and that mine operators could use these technologies to meet the dpm exposure limits.id.at.the rules also adopted the agency proposal to grant medical evaluation and transfer rights to miners who must wear respirators because the mines in which they work are not in compliance with the dpm exposure limits.id.at.
the national mine association,the national stone,sand gravel association,and several mine operators petitioned for review of msha,and rules,alleging that the rules are arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law.the united steelworkers union intervened on behalf of msha in defense of the dpm rules.
petitioners first challenge msha risk assessment for diesel particulate matter.in particular,they argue that msha failed to demonstrate that dpm presents a substantial risk to miners health msha failed to consider whether regulations on diesel exhaust gasses are sufficient to protect miners from the risks of dpm and msha disregarded the fact that newer engines might increase the number of harmful nanoparticles in mines.we review msha risk assessment under the administrative procedure act,which states that reviewing courts shall hold unlawful and set aside any agency action that is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.under the arbitrary and capricious test,we must ensure that the agency has examine d the relevant data and articulate d a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the mine act states that msha shall develop,promulgate,and revise as may be appropriate,improved mandatory health or safety standards for the protection of life and prevention of injuries in coal or other mines.a.moreover,the act states 
the secretary,in promulgating mandatory standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents under this subsection,shall set standards which most adequately assure on the basis of the best available evidence that no miner will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such miner has regular exposure to the hazards dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life.development of mandatory standards under this subsection shall be based upon research,demonstrations,experiments,and such other information as may be appropriate.
id.a a.thus,before promulgating a health or safety standard under the mine act,msha must show that the substance being regulated presents a risk of material impairment of health or functional capacity for miners who are regularly exposed to the substance.under the applicable standard,courts extend deference to msha determinations as to which substances present such a risk.in a case involving msha regulation of oxygen levels in mines,we noted that a t most the agency was required to identify a significant risk associated with having no oxygen standard at all.mining ass msha.moreover,we emphasized that the secretary was entitled to err on the side of overprotection by setting a fully adequate margin of safety.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
here,msha has adequately demonstrated that dpm presents a significant risk to the health and safety of miners.in the rules,msha conducted an exhaustive risk assessment that was based upon an analysis of the relevant data and scientific literature.at.first,the agency cited several studies that showed that miners were exposed to dpm at much higher levels than workers in other occupations.id.at.more specifically,msha determined that median dpm concentrations observed in some underground mines are up to times as high as mean environmental exposures in the most heavily polluted urban areas,and up to times as high as median exposures estimated for the most heavily exposed workers in other occupational groups.id.at.
next,msha determined that numerous adverse health effects are causally related to heightened dpm exposure.id.at.the agency identified several studies that found links between dpm exposure and acute health effects,such as eye irritation,decreases in pulmonary function,and bronchial inflammation.id.at.more significantly,msha concluded that miners who are regularly exposed to dpm will face a heightened risk of developing lung cancer.in reaching this conclusion,msha analyzed epidemiological studies from to as well as two that aggregated the data from the earlier studies.id.at.some degree of association between occupational dpm exposure and an excess prevalence of lung cancer was reported in of the studies reviewed by msha.id.at.moreover,the agency reasonably explained why it discounted the findings of the six studies that did not find a causal link between dpm exposure and lung cancer risk.three of these studies did not allow for a sufficiently long latency period between exposure and evaluation,and a fourth study used too small of a cohort.id.at.and five of the six negative studies did not have statistically significant results,whereas of the positive studies did find a statistically significant link between dpm exposure and lung cancer risk.id.at.msha concluded that 
although no epidemiologic study is flawless,studies of both cohort and design have quite consistently shown that chronic exposure to diesel exhaust,in a variety of occupational circumstances,is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer with only rare exceptions,involving too few workers observation periods too short to have a good chance of detecting excess cancer risk,the human studies have shown a greater risk of lung cancer among exposed workers than among comparable unexposed workers.
id.at.we hold that msha corralled more than enough evidence in support of its risk assessment,and that the agency reasonably explained why it did not rely on the studies that cut against its conclusions.
petitioners argue that msha risk assessment was flawed because the agency failed to consider whether limitations on diesel exhaust gasses might also provide adequate protection against exposure to diesel particulate matter.however,this argument ignores the fact that dpm presents health risks independent of the risks posed by diesel exhaust gasses.msha risk assessment in the rules focused only on the specific risks caused by exposure to diesel particulate matter.see.at noting that msha risk assessment reviews the various health effects that may be associated with dpm exposures emphasis added.as explained above,the agency reasonably determined that dpm is a toxic material or harmful physical agent that poses a significant risk to the health of miners.accordingly,msha was authorized by the mine act to promulgate exposure limits for dpm independent of the agency rules regulating diesel exhaust gasses.see a.indeed,the agency emphasized that msha will,of course,continue to enforce the limits applicable to diesel gasses,but this enforcement will be separate from the enforcement of the dpm concentration limits under the final dpm rule.rules.at.thus,we hold that msha reasonably chose to promulgate separate rules for diesel particulate matter based upon the agency determination that its own significant risks to the health and safety of miners that are distinct from the health risks posed by diesel exhaust gasses.
petitioners also assert that msha risk analysis was flawed because it failed to take into consideration the effects of confounders such as miners use of tobacco products.however,in the rules,msha specifically identified eighteen published epidemiological studies that controlled for tobacco use,five of which also controlled for asbestos exposure.id.at.even controlling for tobacco use,a ll but one of these studies reported some degree of excess risk associated with occupational exposure to diesel particulate,with statistically significant results reported in eight.id.
finally,petitioners contend that msha risk assessment was arbitrary and capricious because it disregarded the fact that newer,cleaner are often necessary to reduce dpm increase the number of dangerous nanoparticles in mines.we disagree.as explained above,a substantial body of scientific evidence has identified a statistically significant causal connection between dpm exposure and lung cancer risk.in contrast,the risks from nanoparticles are currently speculative at the rulemaking,msha noted that nanoparticles may be more harmful than larger particles,but that much more medical research and diesel emission studies are needed to fully characterize diesel nanoparticles emissions and their impact on human health.id.at.msha actions in the face of this evidence were entirely reasonable.the agency chose to promulgate rules immediately to regulate the known risks from dpm,while conducting further research into the potential health effects of nanoparticles.we can not hold that this course of action was arbitrary and capricious.
under the mine act,msha is given a significant degree of deference in its identification of substances that present significant risks to the health and safety of miners.see mining ass n,at.here,msha conducted an exhaustive survey of the relevant evidence and concluded that exposure to diesel particulate matter may place miners at a heightened risk of developing lung cancer and other health problems.we see no reason to disrupt this conclusion,and thus we deny the petitions for review with respect to msha threshold risk assessment.
in its rulemakings,msha concluded that it did not have a reliable method of measuring dpm directly at low concentration levels.see rules.at.accordingly,the agency chose to regulate total carbon tc and elemental carbon ec as surrogates for dpm.petitioners raise several challenges to msha use of these surrogates.in particular,petitioners argue that tc and ec are flawed proxies for dpm because tc is sensitive to interference from other sources,and because there is no reliable and consistent method for converting dpm to ec and tc.we agree with the petitioners that tc and ec are not perfect substitutes for dpm.but our standard of review under the arbitrary and capricious test is only reasonableness,not perfection.see state farm,at.requiring the agency to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.additionally,we will give an extreme degree of deference to the agency when it is evaluating scientific data within its technical expertise.hüls,browner,quoting int l fabricare inst.epa.on the record before us,we can not hold that msha acted arbitrarily and capriciously by using tc and ec as surrogates for dpm.
at the outset,we note that there is nothing inherently problematic with an agency regulating one substance as a surrogate for another substance.in other areas of environmental law,this court has held that t he epa may use a surrogate to regulate hazardous pollutants if it is reasonable to do so.lime ass epa.for example,we have upheld the epa use of hydrocarbons hc as a surrogate for fine particulate matter pm,explaining that 
epa regulated hc emissions as a means of controlling fine pm emissions and pollution.the agency reasonably determined that regulating hc would control pm pollution both because hc itself contributes to such pollution,and because hc provides a good proxy for regulating fine pm emissions.
bluewater network epa.see also sierra club epa,upholding the epa regulation of particulate matter as a surrogate for hazardous air particles because there were s trong direct correlations between the surrogate and the target substance.
in the instant case,msha reasonably chose to use tc as a surrogate for dpm.based on the results of several studies,msha determined that tc accounts for of the total dpm concentration when low sulfur fuel is used.rules.at.the agency also noted that the niosh method of analysis measures tc with the accuracy,precision,and sensitivity necessary to use in compliance sampling for dpm.id.at noting that samples taken pursuant to the niosh method meet niosh accuracy criterion because they come within percent of the true tc concentration at least percent of the time.given that tc and dpm were tightly correlated,and that msha had a reliable method for determining the amount of tc in a sample,it was not per se unreasonable for msha to use tc as a surrogate for dpm.
however,as msha recognized in its rules,tc is not always a perfect surrogate for dpm because tc measurements can be sensitive to interferences from other sources,such as oil mist and tobacco smoke.id.at.accordingly,in the rules,msha converted one of the interim dpm exposure limits from total carbon to elemental carbon ec,another surrogate for dpm that is less sensitive to interference.see.at noting that using ec would impose fewer restrictions or caveats on sampling strategy locations and durations,would produce a measurement much less subject to questions,and inherently would be more precise.msha reviewed the relevant evidence and concluded that ec was a reliable proxy for dpm because niosh research and msha laboratory tests indicate that dpm,on average,is approximately to elemental carbon.id.also,using the results of the study,msha was able to establish a tc ec conversion factor of.see id.at.msha obtained the conversion factor by taking the median of the ratios observed during sampling.moreover,in making these calculations,the agency only focused on valid omitted samples that were subject to interference.id.at.petitioners assert that the tc ec conversion ratio used by msha is arbitrary and capricious because the correlation between tc and ec varies in a statistically significant manner.however,after analyzing over samples from various mines,msha found that measuring tc directly or measuring ec and multiplying by the conversion factor of made no difference to finding compliance with the tc limit in of the samples.id.at.obviously,the conversion factor is not perfect,and there is still some variability in the tc ec ratio.however,msha decision to use the median ratio from valid samples in the study as the conversion factor was well within the scope of the agency discretion.and msha sampling confirms that the conversion not a relatively accurate way of converting ec to tc.we can not hold that it was arbitrary and capricious for the agency to use ec as a surrogate for dpm.
finally,petitioners assert that the current interim limit of tc and the final limit of tc are arbitrary and capricious because msha did not convert these limits from tc to ec,even though the agency had acknowledged that tc can be an unreliable measure of dpm.we disagree.although msha has recognized that tc is sensitive to interferences,the agency has not entirely written off tc as a proxy for dpm.indeed,msha has clearly stated in its rules that tc can still serve as a consistent and reliable surrogate for dpm as long as samples are taken in areas away from tobacco smoke and oil mist.see rules.at noting that cigarette smoke is under the control of mine operators,and therefore it can be prohibited during sampling periods id.at noting that samples should be taken upwind of drilling that produces oil mist.moreover,msha has stated that it will initiate a new rulemaking to convert the final limits from tc to ec rule.at.in sum,msha has concluded that ec is a better proxy for dpm than tc,but this does not automatically render the use of tc to be arbitrary and capricious.even though tc sampling is more difficult than ec sampling,msha has reasonably determined that tc can still be a reliable proxy for dpm as long as samples are taken in the proper manner.in any event,msha rulemaking suggests that it has no intention of using tc as a stand alone proxy.
although total carbon and elemental carbon are not perfect surrogates for dpm,msha reasonably concluded based on evidence in the record that tc and ec are sufficiently with dpm that they can serve as reliable proxies.these determinations are given an extreme degree of deference given that they involve complex judgments about sampling methodology and data analysis that are within the agency technical expertise.hüls,at.accordingly,we deny the petitions for review with respect to the use of total carbon and elemental carbon as surrogates for diesel particulate matter.
petitioners argue that the dpm exposure limits violate the mine act because they can not feasibly be achieved by mine operators within the time period established by msha rules.petitioners also contend that msha was too optimistic about the efficacy of various dpm control technologies,and that the agency changed its feasibility determinations without a reasoned explanation.we find these arguments to be without merit.
under the mine act,msha shall set standards which most adequately assure on the basis of the best available evidence that no miner will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such miner has regular exposure to the hazards dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life.a a.moreover,the act states 
in addition to the attainment of the highest degree of health and safety protection for the miner,other considerations shall be the latest available scientific data in the field,the feasibility of the standards,and experience gained under this and other health and safety laws.
id.this court has not yet analyzed the precise role of feasibility in a mine act rulemaking.however,many other environmental and worker protection statutes contain feasibility requirements,and we can look to cases interpreting those statutes to inform our analysis.see,b occupational safety and health act stating that the secretary of labor shall set the standard which most adequately assures,to the extent feasible,on the basis of the best available evidence,that no employee will suffer material impairment of health.
the supreme court has interpreted feasible in the osh act as meaning capable of being done,executed,or effected,both technologically and economically.am.textile mfrs.inst.donovan,d.in order for its rules to be deemed feasible,an agency must establish a reasonable possibility that the typical firm will be able to develop and install engineering and work practice controls that can meet the permissible exposure limit in most of its operations.am.iron steel inst.osha,aisi citation omitted.given that feasibility determinations involve complex judgments about science and technology,our standard of review is deferential the agency is not obliged to provide detailed solutions to every engineering problem,but only to give plausible reasons for its belief that the industry will be able to solve those problems in the time remaining.petrochemical refiners ass epa.the fact that a few isolated operations within an industry will not be able to comply with the standard does not undermine a showing that the standard is generally feasible.aisi,at.moreover,msha has emphasized that its dpm rules are intended to be technology forcing,and the industry petitioners have conceded in their brief that msha has authority to promulgate rules.see proposed rules.at when we established the final limit,we were expecting some mine operators to encounter difficulties implementing control technology because the rule was technology forcing.reply br.of petitioners at.when a statute is,the agency can impose a standard which only the most technologically advanced plants in an industry have been able to if only in some of their operations some of the time.united steelworkers of am.marshall,quoting aisi osha,cir.
petitioners assert that the implementation timetable established by the rules is not feasible,and that many mine operators will be unable to meet the final exposure limits.to the contrary,msha provided more than enough evidence to justify its conclusion that the timetable is feasible.see rules.at summarizing evidence in support of feasibility determinations.in the rules,msha determined that several types of dpm control technologies were more widely available than the agency had previously thought.for example,the agency noted that by,several mines were using biodiesel fuel,which reduces dpm emissions from diesel engines.id.at.similarly,msha acknowledged that mine operators had problems using filters in the past,but the agency emphasized that filters are a highly effective tool for controlling dpm if they are properly selected,installed,and maintained.id.at.msha extensively discussed the pros and cons of all filtering technologies,and it determined that several newer models of filters are not subject to many of the difficult implementation issues that have slowed the adoption of some dpm controls.id.at.moreover,msha stated that it will continue to provide extensive information to mine operators about the proper procedures for selecting,installing,and maintaining their filtration systems.id.at.in sum,the agency concluded that the mining industry as a whole can reduce dpm levels to the final limit of tc by may.id.at.msha offered an abundance of evidence in support of its feasibility determinations,and we can not hold that the agency conclusions were arbitrary and capricious.
petitioners also challenge msha findings about several specific types of control technologies,especially environmental cabs and improved mine ventilation.they argue that these control technologies should not have been considered in msha feasibility analysis because they have important limitations or are only useful in certain types of mines.these arguments misinterpret the meaning of feasibility.for its rules to be upheld,msha does not need to show that every technology can be used in every mine.the agency must only demonstrate a reasonable possibility that a typical firm can meet the permissible exposure limits in most of its operations.aisi,at.in the rules,msha explained that 
as we have maintained throughout this rulemaking,mine operators should determine the control or combination of controls that will be best suited to their circumstances and conditions,and that controls need to be evaluated,selected,and implemented on a and basis.
at.thus,the fact that some of the specific control technologies identified by msha can not be used in every mine does not undermine the overall reasonableness of the agency feasibility determinations.this also undercuts petitioners argument that msha should have engaged in a feasibility analysis for each specific type of mine.msha has never suggested that there is a approach for every mine to meet the dpm exposure limits.rather,the agency has reasonably concluded that many different technologies can be effective in reducing dpm exposure,and it is up to each individual mine operator to choose the best mix of controls for that particular mine.nothing in the mine act or the apa requires an agency to describe in detail how every single regulated party will be able to comply with the agency rules.see,petrochemical refiners ass n,at noting that an agency must identify the major steps for improvement but need not provide detailed solutions to every engineering problem citation omitted.
msha feasibility determinations are buttressed by the agency statistical findings that many mines are already in compliance with the dpm exposure limits.in the rules,msha provided data from its prior enforcement sampling,which revealed that of samples were in compliance with the ec interim limit,of samples were in compliance with the tc interim limit,and of samples were in compliance with the tc final limit.at.furthermore,the data indicated that of the mines sampled,were in compliance with the ec interim limit,were in compliance with the tc interim limit,and were in compliance with the tc final limit.id.moreover,this sampling focused on mines that were likely to have the highest dpm exposure levels thus,the actual compliance rates are likely to be higher than the compliance rates for these samples.id.focusing upon the percentage of sampled mines in compliance,petitioners contend the data demonstrates that the imposed limits are infeasible.on the contrary,we agree with msha that the data supports the agency conclusion that the limits are feasible.it is not arbitrary or capricious to consider feasible an interim limit with which half of all sampled mines are already in compliance.and given the extended the effective date for the final limit until may,mines that are not yet in compliance will still have almost a year and a half to achieve compliance with the final limits.
additionally,this court has held that a ny risk that the standard may prove to be infeasible in practice is counterbalanced by flexibility in the standard enforcement.aisi,at.here,msha rules allow mine operators to seek an extension of the compliance deadline if they are having difficulty achieving the dpm exposure limits.a mine that requires additional time to come into compliance because of technological or economic constraints may seek a renewable extension of the deadline.c.see also rules.at.we also noted in aisi that an agency burden of proving feasibility is greatly ease d if employers are permitted to require employees to use respirators if the exposure limits can not be met by other means.at.msha rules contain precisely that a mine operator is unable to comply with the dpm exposure limits,it must provide respiratory protection to miners.see d.see also rules.at rules.at.thus,if any mine operators experience difficulty complying with the dpm exposure limits,they will be able to apply for an extension of the deadline and require their employees to wear respirators.this flexibility in the standard enforcement only reinforces our conclusion that msha feasibility determinations were reasonable.see aisi,at.
finally,petitioners contend that msha feasibility determinations are arbitrary and capricious because the agency reversed itself several times without reasoned explanation.contrary to petitioners assertions,however,msha did not change its feasibility determinations between the rulemaking and the rulemaking.after promulgating the rules,msha issued a set of proposed rules that would have changed the effective date for the dpm final limit.see proposed rules.at.in the proposed rules,msha noted that some of its feasibility determinations were being questioned and that some of its assumptions may not have been valid the agency sought comments from the public about these issues.id.at.however,none of these statements can be deemed a reversal of the agency feasibility determinations.indeed,in the same set of proposed rules,msha also stated that the final limit of tc might still be feasible because of mine operators wider use of alternative fuels and filter technology.id.thus,the proposed rules sought new comments from the public about certain feasibility issues,but did not actually change any of the agency feasibility determinations.it can not be said that the agency changed its position on these matters without reasoned explanation.
in sum,we deny the petitions for review with respect to msha feasibility determinations.the agency identified several types of control technologies that are effective at reducing dpm exposure,and it offered evidence that a substan
