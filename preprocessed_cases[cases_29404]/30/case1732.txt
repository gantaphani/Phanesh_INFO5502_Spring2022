in,the board of trustees of the california state university csu certified an environmental impact report eir and approved a project for the expansion of san diego state university sdsu.the project included the construction of new buildings and an increase in sdsu student enrollment from equivalent students ftes to ftes by the academic year.during the pendency of litigation challenging the eir certification and project approval,the california supreme court issued its opinion in city of marina board of trustees of california state university cal th marina,which addressed certain issues involved in the sdsu eir litigation.in response to marina,the trial court in entered judgment against csu and issued a writ of mandate directing it to set aside its certification of the eir and approval of the sdsu expansion project.the court retained jurisdiction of the matter until it determined csu had complied with the california environmental quality act pub.resources code,et ceqa and the views expressed in marina.
in,csu revised its master plan for expansion of sdsu the project and released a draft eir deir for the project.after receiving comments from the general public and governmental agencies,csu prepared a final eir feir,responding to those comments and revising the deir.in november,csu certified the feir and approved the project,finding that because it might not obtain mitigation funding from the legislature and governor,there are no feasible mitigation measures to reduce the project significant traffic impacts to a less than significant level.based in part on its finding that those significant traffic impacts were unavoidable,csu adopted a statement of overriding considerations,concluding the project benefits outweighed its unavoidable significant environmental effects,and then approved the project.
the city of san diego and the redevelopment agency of the city of san diego together city,san diego association of governments sandag,and san diego metropolitan transit system mts filed petitions for writs of mandate challenging csu certification of the feir and approval of the project.after consolidating the cases and hearing arguments of counsel,the trial court denied the petitions and discharged the writ,finding csu had complied with marina.it then entered judgment for csu.
on appeal,city,sandag,and mts contend the trial court erred by concluding csu complied with ceqa and marina by finding payments for mitigation of significant environmental impacts were infeasible because it could not guarantee the legislature and governor would approve the funding,and that the feir was not required to address potential alternative means of paying csu of those mitigation costs concluding they could not raise those issues in the trial court because they did not raise them during the administrative proceedings,they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies denying their request for judicial notice of certain documents pertaining to the issue of whether csu complied with ceqa and marina concluding the feir did not err in calculating the increased vehicle traffic caused by the project increased student enrollment concluding csu did not improperly defer adoption of mitigation measures to reduce vehicle traffic and concluding the feir adequately addressed the project potential impacts on transit and that there is substantial evidence to support csu finding the project will not cause any significant effect on public transit,trolley and bus facilities and service.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude the trial court erred in denying the petitions and the request for judicial notice and in discharging the writ.
factual and procedural background 
the sdsu campus is located in the city of san diego along the southern rim of mission valley.the campus consists of about acres with the following general boundaries montezuma road on the south,east campus drive on the east,street and remington road on the west,and adobe falls road north of interstate on the north.in,csu certified an eir and approved a project for the expansion of sdsu.during the pendency of litigation challenging that eir certification and project approval,the california supreme court issued its opinion in marina.in response to marina,in the trial court entered judgment against csu,issued a writ of mandate directing it to set aside its certification of the eir and approval of the project,and retained jurisdiction of the matter until it determined csu had complied with ceqa and marina.
in february,toward its continuing goal of expanding sdsu enrollment,csu prepared a new notice of preparation and initial study nop and circulated it for public comment.in june,after receiving public comments on the nop,csu prepared the deir.as described in the deir,the project is csu master plan for expansion of sdsu through the academic year by increasing student enrollment from ftes to ftes equal to an actual increase of students and developing six components additional student housing,an additional beds between and condominium townhouse units on the acre adobe falls site for sdsu faculty and staff housing a room hotel on its alvarado road site square feet of new building space on its alvarado road site for academic,research,medical use and a square foot parking structure renovation and expansion of the student union building and a square foot campus conference center for meetings,conferences,office space,and food and retail services.the deir states the proposed increase in student enrollment will require the hiring of additional faculty members and additional staff members.the project will result in a total of additional students,faculty,and staff on the sdsu campus by the academic year the deir discussed the project potential significant environmental impacts and mitigation measures and alternatives that would reduce or avoid those impacts.
csu circulated the deir for public comment from june,through july.csu held multiple community meetings to present the deir and the project,and receive comments.csu received about comment letters on the deir from residents who live in neighborhoods that would be affected by the project other members of the public and federal,state,and local governmental agencies,including city and sandag.csu then prepared the feir,which attached the comment letters,responded to them,and revised the deir.
on november and,csu held a public meeting on the feir.representatives of city,sandag,mts,and the state of california department of transportation caltrans and members of the public expressed concerns regarding the feir and the project.csu then adopted findings of fact findings and the mitigation measures set forth in the mitigation monitoring and reporting program mmrp.in the findings,csu found the feir identified potentially significant effects that could result from implementation of the project,and inclusion of mitigation measures as part of approval of the project would reduce most,but not all,of those effects to less than significant levels.however,as to those significant impacts that are unavoidable even after incorporating all feasible mitigation measures,csu found the benefits of the project outweighed those unavoidable significant impacts.csu expressly found the project would have n o significant impacts on transit systems.csu approved resolutions stating 
a portion of the mitigation measures necessary to reduce traffic impacts to less than significant are the responsibility of and under the authority of the city the city and csu have not come to agreement.csu therefore can not guarantee that certain mitigation measures that are the sole responsibility of the city will be timely implemented.csu therefore finds that certain impacts upon traffic may remain significant and unavoidable if mitigation measures are not implemented,and adopts findings of fact that include specific overriding considerations that outweigh the remaining potential unavoidable significant impacts with respect to traffic and transit that are not under the authority and responsibility of csu.
csu hereby certifies the feir for the project as complete and adequate in that the feir addresses all significant environmental impacts of the project and fully complies with the requirements of ceqa and the ceqa guidelines 
it is necessary,consistent with marina,for csu to pursue mitigation funding from the l egislature to meet its ceqa mitigation obligations.the chancellor is therefore directed to request from the g overnor and the l egislature,through the annual state budget process,the future funds necessary to support costs as determined by csu necessary to fulfill the mitigation requirements of ceqa.
in the event the request for mitigation funds is approved in full,the chancellor is directed to proceed with implementation of the master plan for the project.should the request for funds only be partially approved,the chancellor is directed to proceed with implementation of the p roject,funding identified mitigation measures to the extent of the available funds.in the event the request for funds is not approved,the chancellor is directed to proceed with implementation of the p roject consistent with resolution number below.
because csu can not guarantee that the request to the l egislature for the necessary mitigation funding will be approved,or that the local agencies will fund the measures that are their responsibility,csu finds that the impacts whose sic funding is uncertain remain significant and unavoidable,and that they are necessarily outweighed by the statement of overriding considerations adopted by csu.
csu certified the feir and approved the project.it then issued a notice of determination regarding its findings and actions.
in december,city,sandag and mts filed separate petitions for writs of mandate challenging csu certification of the feir and approval of the project.the trial court subsequently consolidated the cases.csu filed a motion to discharge the writ.in february,the trial court issued a statement of decision rejecting all of the claims asserted by city,sandag and mts.in march,the court entered judgment for csu,denying the petitions for writs of mandate filed against it and discharging the writ.the court found csu had met the requirements of ceqa and marina.city,sandag and mts timely filed notices of appeal challenging the judgment

marina and mitigation of significant environmental impacts 
city,sandag and mts contend the trial court erred by concluding csu complied with ceqa and marina by finding payments by csu for mitigation of the project significant environmental impacts were infeasible because csu could not guarantee the legislature and governor would approve mitigation funding and by concluding the feir was not required to address potential alternative means of paying csu of mitigation costs.
the deir identified and discussed the project potentially significant traffic impacts to certain street intersections,street segments,freeway ramps,and freeway mainline segments.for each of those potentially significant traffic impacts,the deir recommended specific mitigation measures,which primarily consisted of contributions to city of csu fair share of costs of implementing those mitigation measures,improvements to city street intersections and segments.as to each of the traffic mitigation measures,the deir calculated csu respective percentage ranging from percent to percent of the total cost of that mitigation measure.with implementation of the proposed mitigation measures,the deir concluded all of the specific traffic impacts would be reduced to a level below significant,except for four specific impacts that would remain significant and unavoidable.regarding csu mitigation measures,the deir stated mitigation is recommended that would reduce the identified impacts to a level below significant.however,csu funding commitment is necessarily conditioned on requesting and obtaining funds from the california legislature.if the legislature does not provide funding,or if funding is significantly delayed,all identified significant impacts would remain significant and unavoidable.
in a letter dated july,city commented on the deir,restating many of the concerns it raised in its prior letter commenting on the nop.city stated the deir traffic impact analysis was fatally flawed because it does not guarantee the implementation of the traffic mitigation measures it proposes.city disagreed with csu interpretation of marina reflected in a quoted statement from the deir that csu funding commitment is necessarily conditioned up on requesting and obtaining funds from the california legislature.if the legislature does not provide funding,or if funding is significantly delayed,all identified significant impacts would remain significant and unavoidable.underscoring added by city.city quoted language from marina on which csu apparently relied and argued that language was pure dictum.city asserted the deir fails because csu disingenuously attempt s to dodge true responsibility for mitigation of the project significant impacts by relying on dicta in marina.
in the feir,csu responded to comments by city and others criticizing csu interpretation of marina and its interpretation of its obligation under ceqa to discuss and propose measures to mitigate the project significant traffic environmental impacts.the feir stated 
the following are the requisite principles established by marina,relative to the project and feir 
csu is obligated to request funding from the legislature for mitigation,including funds for its local agency mitigation costs.citation.
however,the power of csu to mitigate the p roject effects through voluntary mitigation payments is ultimately subject to legislative control if the legislature does not appropriate the money,the power does not exist.citation.
thus,if the legislature does not fund csu fair share,csu has the authority to adopt a statement of overriding considerations and proceed with the p roject.citation.
citing marina,csu response further stated t he feir proposes a series of mitigation measures that requires csu,subject to funding by the state legislature,to contribute its fair share of the costs required to improve existing infrastructure,as needed.citation.further,the feir determined that impacts related to traffic and circulation would be significant and unavoidable in light of the potential for the legislature to deny csu or caltrans s funding requests,or to grant less funding than requested,or to delay receipt of the funds.csu further stated 
consistent with marina,upon project approval by csu,the csu chancellor will request from the governor and the state legislature,through the annual state budget process,the funds necessary to fulfill the mitigation requirements of ceqa,as determined by csu.
if the legislature approves the csu funding request,or a portion of that request,it is anticipated the appropriated funds will be provided to city and the city of la mesa in annual amounts corresponding to actual annual enrollment growth,provided that each entity identifies a fund or traffic impact fee program assuring that the funds will be expended solely in furtherance of the subject roadway improvements.
because csu can not guarantee that its request to the governor and the legislature for the necessary mitigation funding will be approved,or that caltrans s request for funding will be approved,or that funding will be granted in the amount requested,or that the public agencies will fund the mitigation improvements that are within their responsibility and jurisdiction,if the p roject is approved,csu will find that the impacts whose sic funding is uncertain remain significant and unavoidable,and csu will adopt a statement of overriding considerations pursuant to ceqa.
the feir made certain revisions to the deir,including a statement that its proposed traffic mitigation measures are consistent with marina.as to many,if not most,of the specific traffic mitigation measures,the feir qualified csu obligation to contribute to city its fair share of mitigation costs by including the prefatory language s ubject to funding by the state legislature.the feir also listed its proposed percentage contribution,ranging from percent to percent,toward the cost of each of the specific traffic mitigation measures.although the feir concluded the project would result in significant impacts at various intersections,freeway interchanges and mainline segments and recommended csu pay mitigation to reduce those impacts below a level of significance,it concluded csu funding commitment is necessarily conditioned upon requesting and obtaining funds from the california legislature for those impacts within the jurisdiction of local agencies,and caltrans obtaining funds from the legislature for those impacts within its jurisdiction.if the legislature does not provide funding,or if funding is significantly delayed,all identified significant impacts would remain significant and unavoidable.the feir then cited its response to comments on its interpretation of marina.
csu adopted the findings and the mitigation measures set forth in the mmrp.in the findings,csu found the feir identified potentially significant effects that could result from implementation of the project,but inclusion of mitigation measures as part of approval of the project would reduce most,but not all,of those effects to less than significant levels.however,the findings stated 
because csu request to the governor and the legislature,made pursuant to marina,for the necessary mitigation funding may not be approved in whole or in part,or because any funding request submitted by caltrans may not be approved,and,because the local public agencies may not fund the mitigation improvements that are within their responsibility and jurisdiction,even if state funding is obtained,csu finds there are no feasible mitigation measures that would reduce the identified significant impacts to a level below significant.therefore,these impacts must be considered unavoidably significant even after implementation of all feasible and parking mitigation measures.italics added.
furthermore,as to those significant impacts that are unavoidable even after incorporating all feasible mitigation measures,csu found the benefits of the project outweighed those unavoidable impacts.csu approved resolutions stating that 
a portion of the mitigation measures necessary to reduce traffic impacts to less than significant are the responsibility of and under the authority of the city the city and csu have not come to agreement.csu therefore can not guarantee that certain mitigation measures that are the sole responsibility of the city will be timely implemented.csu therefore finds that certain impacts upon traffic may remain significant and unavoidable if mitigation measures are not implemented,and adopts findings of fact that include specific overriding considerations that outweigh the remaining,potential,unavoidable significant impacts with respect to traffic and transit that are not under the authority and responsibility of csu.
csu hereby certifies the feir for the project as complete and adequate in that the feir addresses all significant environmental impacts of the project and fully complies with the requirements of ceqa and the ceqa guidelines 
it is necessary,consistent with marina,for csu to pursue mitigation funding from the l egislature to meet its ceqa mitigation obligations.the chancellor is therefore directed to request from the g overnor and the l egislature,through the annual state budget process,the future funds necessary to support costs as determined by csu necessary to fulfill the mitigation requirements of ceqa.
in the event the request for mitigation funds is approved in full,the chancellor is directed to proceed with implementation of the master plan for the project.should the request for funds only be partially approved,the chancellor is directed to proceed with implementation of the p roject,funding identified mitigation measures to the extent of the available funds.in the event the request for funds is not approved,the chancellor is directed to proceed with implementation of the p roject consistent with resolution number below.
because csu can not guarantee that the request to the l egislature for the necessary mitigation funding will be approved,or that the local agencies will fund the measures that are their responsibility,csu finds that the impacts whose sic funding is uncertain remain significant and unavoidable,and that they are necessarily outweighed by the statement of overriding considerations adopted by csu.
csu certified the feir and approved the project.
in denying city subsequent petition for writ of mandate and discharging the writ,the trial court issued a statement of decision,stating in part 
marina did not rule out the possibility that a voluntary payment negotiated for the purpose of mitigating specified environmental effects would not satisfy csu ceqa obligations as to such effects.in reliance on this opinion,csu negotiated with the city and caltrans to determine its fair share of the offsite improvements.csu then requested the necessary funds from the legislature and,in doing so,complied with the mandate of marina.
petitioners suggest that csu must discuss other methods to fund mitigation measures,such as funded revenue bonds or reducing the scope of the p roject.marina does not so hold.further,such arguments were not raised in the underlying proceedings and can not be raised now here,petitioners cited to several comment letters h owever,the alternative funding claims were not raised in these comment letters.
the court finds that csu has met the requirements of marina and ceqa.the writ is discharged.
in marina,the california supreme court addressed csu obligations under ceqa to discuss in an eir measures to mitigate the significant environmental impacts of a project involving the expansion of its monterey bay campus csumb on fort ord,a former united states army base,to accommodate an increase in enrollment from students to students by.marina,supra,cal th at.the fort ord reuse authority fora was created by the legislature to manage the transition of the former fort ord base to civilian uses,including residential housing,business,light industry,research and development,recreation,and education.id.at.the legislature gave fora the power and duty to prepare the base infrastructure for development for those civilian uses.id.at.fora capital improvement plans included construction of infrastructure for transportation,roadways,water supply,and wastewater management.ibid.the legislature directed fora to arrange its own financing for those infrastructure improvements,rather than through legislative appropriations.ibid.
in its eir for the expansion of csumb,csu identified many significant environmental effects of the project and adopted specific mitigation measures that would mitigate most of those effects to a level of less than significant.marina,supra,cal th at.however,because full mitigation of certain significant effects,including traffic impacts,would require action by both csu and fora,the eir did not provide for mitigation of those effects.id.at.nevertheless,fora own planning documents included plans for infrastructure improvements that would fully mitigate the remaining effects of csu expansion of csumb.id.at.in so doing,fora assumed csumb would pay its share of the cost of the infrastructure improvements.ibid.however,csu refused to contribute any funds to fora for road and fire protection improvements.ibid.csu certified the eir and approved the project despite the remaining unmitigated effects,finding as marina paraphrases that improvements to roads and fire protection are the responsibility of fora rather than of csu mitigation is infeasible because csu may not legally contribute funds toward these improvements and the planned expansion of csumb offers overriding benefits that outweigh any remaining unmitigated effects on the environment.
fora and the city of marina filed separate petitions for writs of mandate challenging csu certification of the eir,alleging that csu had failed to identify and adopt existing,feasible measures to mitigate significant effects on the environment described in the eir,improperly certified the eir and approved the project despite the availability of feasible mitigation measures,improperly disclaimed responsibility for mitigating csumb environmental effects,and improperly relied on a statement of overriding considerations to justify certifying the eir and approving the project.marina,supra,cal th at.the trial court granted the petitions and issued a writ of mandate directing csu to vacate its actions and set aside the eir statement of overriding considerations.id.at.on appeal,the court of appeal reversed the judgment.id.at.the california supreme court granted fora petition for review.ibid.
in marina,the court defined the question before it as whether csu ha s properly certified the eir for csumb and,on that basis,approved the project.marina,supra,cal th at.fora contended csu certification of the eir must be vacated because three of its underlying findings were based on the erroneous legal assumption that the california constitution precluded it from contributing funds to fora for mitigation of the project environmental effects.ibid.the first two of csu findings were that csu can not feasibly mitigate those significant effects,and mitigation of those effects was not csu responsibility.ibid.those two findings required the third finding that overriding considerations outweighed the remaining unmitigated effects and justified certification of the eir and approval of the project.ibid.the supreme court in marina agreed with fora.ibid.the court stated a n eir that incorrectly disclaims the power and duty to mitigate identified environmental effects based on erroneous legal assumptions is not sufficient as an informative document.id.at.
regarding the first issue,marina rejected csu claim that mitigation of significant effects was infeasible.marina,supra,cal th at.the court held the california constitution did not preclude voluntary mitigation payments by csu because they do not constitute compulsory charges or assessments without legislative authority.id.at.marina stated 
ceqa requires csu to avoid or mitigate,if feasible,the significant environmental effects of their project,subd.b and payments to fora may represent a feasible form of mitigation.to illustrate the point,if campus expansion requires that roads or sewers be improved,csu may do the work itself on campus,but it has no authority to build roads or sewers off campus on land that belongs to others.yet csu is not thereby excused from the duty to mitigate or avoid csumb effects on traffic or wastewater management,because ceqa requires a public agency to mitigate or avoid its projects significant effects not just on the agency own property,but on the environment,subd.b,italics added,with environment defined for these purposes as the physical conditions which exist within the area which will be affected by a proposed project,italics added.thus,if csu can not adequately mitigate or avoid csumb environmental effects by performing acts on campus as by reducing sufficiently the use of automobiles or the volume of sewage,then to pay a third party such as fora to perform the necessary acts off campus may well represent a feasible alternative.a payment made under these circumstances can properly be described neither as compulsory nor,for that reason,as an assessment.marina,supra,cal th at.
marina held n o rule precludes a public entity from sharing with another the cost of improvements benefiting both.furthermore,while education may be csu core function,to avoid or mitigate the environmental effects of its projects is also one of csu functions.this is the plain import of ceqa,in which the legislature has commanded that e ach public agency shall mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects that it carries out or approves whenever it is feasible to do so.marina,supra,cal th at.
marina also held that a payment by csu for mitigation of its project environmental effects would not constitute an unlawful gift of public funds marina,supra,cal th at,italics added because those payments would be used for the public purpose of discharging its duty as a public agency,under the express terms of ceqa,to mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment whenever it is feasible to do so.id.at.
marina also rejected csu assertion that mitigation of its expansion of csumb was infeasible because it could not guarantee that fora would actually implement the proposed infrastructure improvements.marina,supra,cal th at.csu found in its eir that the mitigation measures were not feasible because implementation of those measures was disputed and therefore mitigation of the effects to less than significant levels could not be assured.ibid.marina concluded the presently identified,unavoidable uncertainties affecting the funding and implementation of the infrastructure improvements fora has proposed in its reuse plan do not render voluntary contributions to fora by csu infeasible as a method of mitigating csumb effects.both the ceqa guidelines and judicial decisions recognize that a project proponent may satisfy its duty to mitigate its own portion of a cumulative environmental impact by contributing to a regional mitigation fund c ourts have found mitigation programs for cumulative impacts,based on infrastructure contributions by individual projects,to constitute adequate mitigation measures under ceqa.id.at,italics added.although the court cautioned that a commitment to pay fees without any evidence the mitigation would actually occur would be inadequate,it concluded t here is no reason to doubt that fora will meet its statutory obligation to construct the public capital facilities necessary for civilian development.id.at.ceqa requires only a reasonable plan for mitigation and not a schedule for specific mitigation measures,specific road improvements.ibid.
regarding the second issue,marina rejected csu claim that mitigation was exclusively the responsibility of fora.marina,supra,cal th at.under section,subdivision a,a public agency does not have to undertake identified mitigation measures if it finds those measures are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency and have been,or can and should be,adopted by that other agency.in the circumstances of marina,although fora has responsibility to implement its proposed infrastructure improvements,the fora act contemplates that the costs of those improvements will be borne by those who benefit from them.marina,at.however,marina held the section,subdivision a,finding may be made by a lead agency only when the other agency said to have responsibility has exclusive responsibility.marina,at.marina stated 
as the ceqa guidelines explain,t he finding in subsection a shall not be made if the agency making the finding has concurrent jurisdiction with another agency to deal with identified feasible mitigation measures or alternatives.ceqa guidelines,subd.c.the guidelines logical interpretation of ceqa on this point avoids the problem of agencies deferring to each other,with the result that no agency deals with the problem marina,supra,cal th at.
marina rejected csu argument that it had no responsibility to mitigate environmental effects of its project because it lacked the power to construct infrastructure improvements.id.at.marina held 
ceqa does not limit a public agency obligation to mitigate or avoid significant environmental effects to effects occurring on the agency own property.see,subd.b.ceqa also provides that a ll state agencies shall request in their budgets the funds necessary to protect the environment in relation to problems caused by their activities.thus,as we have also explained,if csu can not adequately mitigate or avoid csumb environmental effects by performing acts on the campus,then to pay a third party such as fora to perform the necessary acts off campus may well represent a feasible alternative.cal th at,italics added.
marina then stated 
to be clear,we do not hold that the duty of a public agency to mitigate or avoid significant environmental effects,subd.b,combined with the duty to ask the legislature for money to do so,will always give a public agency that is undertaking a project with environmental effects shared responsibility for mitigation measures another agency must implement.some mitigation measures can not be purchased,such as permits that another agency has the sole discretion to grant or refuse.moreover,a state agency power to mitigate its project effects through voluntary mitigation payments is ultimately subject to legislative control if the legislature does not appropriate the money,the power does not exist.for the same reason,however,for csu to disclaim responsibility for making such payments before they have complied with their statutory obligation to ask the legislature for the necessary funds is premature,at the very least.the superior court found no evidence csu had asked the legislature for the funds.in its brief to this court,csu acknowledge s it did not budget for payments it assumed would constitute invalid assessments that assumption,as we have explained,is invalid.marina,supra,cal th at,italics added,fn.omitted.
regarding the third issue,statement of overriding considerations,marina stated a statement of overriding considerations is required,and offers a proper basis for approving a project despite the existence of unmitigated environmental effects,only when the measures necessary to mitigate or avoid those effects have properly been found to be infeasible,subd.b.given our conclusion csu has abused its discretion in determining that csumb remaining effects can not feasibly be mitigated,that csu statement of overriding circumstances sic is invalid necessarily follows.ceqa does not authorize an agency to proceed with a project that will have significant,unmitigated effects on the environment,based simply on a weighing of those effects against the project benefits,unless the measures necessary to mitigate those effects are truly infeasible.such a rule,even were it not wholly inconsistent with the relevant statute,subd.b,would tend to displace the fundamental obligation of e ach public agency to mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects that it carries out or approves whenever it is feasible to do so,subd.b.marina,supra,cal th at,italics added.
marina concluded csu must be directed to vacate its certification of the eir and approval of the project and set aside its statement of overriding considerations.marina,supra,cal th at.
city,joined by sandag and mts,contends the trial court erred in interpreting marina to hold that csu does not have to make payments for mitigation of the project significant environmental impacts because csu can not guarantee the legislature and governor will approve the funding and therefore those mitigation measures are infeasible under ceqa city asserts csu and the trial court wrongly relied on dictum in marina that would allow csu to avoid its duty to mitigate under ceqa.city further argues the feir fails as an informational document because it did not discuss potential alternative means of paying csu of mitigation costs.
the language in marina on which csu and the trial court relied is contained in a paragraph after the court held mitigation was not the exclusive responsibility of fora and csu had an obligation under ceqa to mitigate or avoid the project environmental effects by paying a third party,fora to perform those acts if payments were feasible and actions could not adequately mitigate those effects.marina,supra,cal th at.marina then noted csu had not made any request of the legislature for mitigation funding because csu erroneously concluded it did not have any responsibility under ceqa to mitigate the environmental effects of its project.id.at.the court stated f or csu to disclaim responsibility for making such payments before it has complied with its statutory obligation to ask the legislature for the necessary funds is premature,at the very least.ibid.the court also stated a state agency power to mitigate its project effects through voluntary mitigation payments is ultimately subject to legislative control if the legislature does not appropriate the money,the power does not exist,italics added.it is that latter language on which csu and the trial court relied that city asserts is dictum and does not provide persuasive reasoning to limit csu duty under ceqa to make mitigation payments for the project significant effects to merely making a request for such funding from the governor and the legislature.
the language in marina at issue is dictum because it was not necessary for the holding or disposition.only statements necessary to the decision are binding precedents western landscape construction bank of america th.the doctrine of precedent,or stare decisis,extends only to the ratio decidendi of a decision,not to supplementary or explanatory comments which might be included in an opinion.to determine the precedential value of a statement in an opinion,the language of that statement must be compared with the facts of the case and the issues raised.ibid.a decision is authority only for the point actually passed on by the court and directly involved in the case.gomes county of mendocino th.
the ratio decidendi of marina is defined by those issues directly raised by the parties and addressed by the california supreme court that were necessary to its decision.in marina,the court defined the question before it as whether csu ha s properly certified the eir for csumb and,on that basis,approved the project.marina,supra,cal th at.fora contended csu eir certification must be vacated because three of csu underlying findings were based on the erroneous legal assumption that the california constitution precluded it from contributing funds to fora for mitigation of the project environmental effects.ibid.the california supreme court agreed with fora that csu erred in making the first two findings,that csu can not feasibly mitigate those significant effects,and mitigation of those effects was not csu responsibility.ibid.the court then agreed csu erred in making its third finding,its statement of overriding considerations because it was based on erroneous assumptions that it could not feasibly mitigate the significant effects of its project and mitigation was not its responsibility.ibid.marina concluded an eir that incorrectly disclaims the power and duty to mitigate identified environmental effects based on erroneous legal assumptions is not sufficient as an informative document.id.at.
the language in marina on which csu relies in the instant appeal was set forth in marina discussion of whether mitigation of effects was exclusively the responsibility of fora.marina,supra,cal th at.the court concluded csu had a responsibility under ceqa to mitigate the significant effects of its project even though it had no legal power to actually construct the improvements.ibid.marina suggested that if csu could not adequately mitigate significant effects by performing acts,it could feasibly mitigate those effects by paying a third party,fora to perform mitigation,construct infrastructure improvements.id.at.for purposes of stare decisis,that discussion constituted the court reasoning necessary to its decision.contrary to csu assertion,marina s additional statements that csu had not requested funding from the legislature for that mitigation and that if the legislature did not provide such funding,had it been requested,csu would not have the power to mitigate those effects were supplementary or explanatory comments to its ratio decidendi and were dicta.western landscape construction bank of america,supra,th at gogri jack in the box th.we conclude marina statement that if the legislature does not appropriate the money for voluntary payments for mitigation,the power does not exist,marina,at was unnecessary to its disposition of the appeal and is dictum we are not required to follow.western landscape,at gogri,at.
csu argues that,even though that statement in marina may be dictum,we nevertheless should follow it.however,although we generally consider california supreme court dicta to be persuasive hubbard superior court th,the court statement in question did not involve extensive analysis.we agree with the reasoning of marina s preliminary statements that csu has an obligation under ceqa to mitigate or avoid the significant environmental effects of its projects whether those effects are or and,toward fulfilling that obligation,it has a duty to ask the legislature for funding to do so.marina,supra,cal th at.however,the statement in marina that a state agency power to mitigate its project effects through voluntary mitigation payments is ultimately subject to legislative control if the legislature does not appropriate the money,the power does not exist ibid.is not supported by any statute,regulation,case,or other authority.rather,marina merely proceeds from its conclusory statement to note that because csu had not even requested such appropriation from the legislature,csu could not argue it had no obligation under ceqa to make voluntary mitigation payments to a third party for mitigation.ibid.
we believe that had the parties in marina specifically addressed the issue and had the california supreme court extensively addressed or analyzed the issue,marina would have modified or qualified its dictum.as city asserts,neither ceqa nor any provision of the education code or other statute precludes csu or any other state agency from using nonlegislatively appropriated funding for making voluntary payments to third parties for mitigation of the significant environmental effects of its projects.for example,we presume a campus of csu,sdsu may receive revenues or other funds from a myriad of sources,tuition,student fees,revenue bonds,parking fees,and private donations.furthermore,in the context of the instant case,sdsu presumably will receive additional revenues from sources,rent from adobe falls faculty and student housing,revenue from guests of the alvarado hotel,fees charged to residents of the project new dormitories other student housing,revenue from the new campus conference center,and revenue from the expanded and renovated student union.the availability of potential sources of funding other than the legislature for mitigation measures should have been addressed in the deir and feir and all of those potential sources should not be deemed infeasible sources for csu funding of mitigation measures without a comprehensive discussion of those sources and compelling reasons showing those sources can not,as a matter of law,be used to pay for mitigation of the significant environmental effects of the project.
csu did not cite in the deir or feir,or in its trial or appellate briefs,any statute,regulation,or other provision that bars it from using some or all of those revenue or other funding sources to help pay its of the costs to mitigate the significant environmental effects of the project.ceqa expressly provides that a public agency may use its discretionary powers for the purpose of mitigating or avoiding a significant environmental effect of a project except as otherwise provided by law.guidelines,c see also county of san diego grossmont cuyamaca community college dist.cal.app th.under ceqa,a public agency,csu is required to mitigate or avoid the significant environmental effects of a project that it carries out or approves if it is feasible to do so,subd.b marina,supra,cal th at.marina stated ceqa requires csu to avoid or mitigate,if feasible,the significant environmental effects of their project,subd.b and payments to fora may represent a feasible form of mitigation.marina,at.the court stated ceqa does not authorize an agency to proceed with a project that will have significant,unmitigated effects on the environment,based simply on a weighing of those effects against the project benefits,unless the measures necessary to mitigate those effects are truly infeasible.such a rule,even were it not wholly inconsistent with the relevant statute,subd.b,would tend to displace the fundamental obligation of e ach public agency to mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects that it carries out or approves whenever it is feasible to do so,subd.b.id.at,italics added.because of csu duty under ceqa to adopt feasible measures to mitigate or avoid the significant environmental effects of the project whether those effects occur or,it would be illogical to interpret that duty to mitigate as requiring payment for mitigation measures only if,and only to the extent,csu obtains funding for that mitigation from one particular source of its myriad of revenue or other funding sources,a specific appropriation by the legislature for that mitigation to the exclusion of the many other funding sources csu could use to help pay its of the costs to mitigate the effects of the project.were we to accept csu interpretation of marina,it would,in effect,allow csu to avoid its obligation under ceqa to take feasible measures to mitigate or avoid the significant environmental effects of the project and thereby obtain the benefits of the project while leaving city and other public agencies with the entire burden of paying for mitigation of the environmental effects of the project or causing neighboring residents and commuters to suffer the unmitigated adverse impacts of the project.also,to so limit csu duty to mitigate under ceqa would not further the legislature intent that ceqa be interpreted in such manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.friends of mammoth board of supervisors cal d,disapproved on another ground in kowis howard cal th.
because csu erred in relying on the above dictum from marina in preparing the deir,responses to comments,the feir,and the findings,and concluding its payment to city and other public agencies of its of the costs of mitigation measures was not feasible,infeasible,we,like the court in marina,conclude csu erroneous legal assumption invalidates both its finding that measures to mitigate the effects of the project were infeasible and its statement of overriding considerations that can only be adopted when the measures necessary to mitigate those effects are truly infeasible.marina,supra,cal th at,italics added.p ublic agencies should not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such projects.furthermore,an agency can adopt a statement of overriding considerations only after it has first properly found that mitigation measures are truly infeasible.marina,at.marina stated a statement of overriding considerations is required,and offers a proper basis for approving a project despite the existence of unmitigated environmental effects,only when the measures necessary to mitigate or avoid those effects have properly been found to be infeasible,subd.b.given our conclusion csu has abused its discretion in determining that csumb remaining effects can not feasibly be mitigated,that csu statement of overriding circumstances sic is invalid necessarily follows.marina,at,italics added.the court explained ceqa does not authorize an agency to proceed with a project that will have significant,unmitigated effects on the environment,based simply on a weighing of those effects against the project benefits,unless the measures necessary to mitigate those effects are truly infeasible.such a rule,even were it not wholly inconsistent with the relevant statute,subd.b,would tend to displace the fundamental obligation of e ach public agency to mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects that it carries out or approves whenever it is feasible to do so,subd.b.id.at,italics added.
because the deir,the feir,and the findings were based on the erroneous legal assumption that csu could pay its of mitigation costs only if the legislature specifically appropriated such funding,csu improperly found those mitigation measures were infeasible and improperly adopted a statement of overriding considerations for those unavoidable effects of the project,effects for which mitigation was wrongly deemed infeasible.alternatively stated,csu did not proceed in a manner required by law and thereby abused its discretion by certifying the feir and approving the project.vineyard,supra,cal th at.when a public agency does not comply with procedures required by law,its decision must be set aside as presumptively prejudicial.sierra club,supra,cal th at.
to the extent csu continues to assert,as it did in its findings and resolutions,that mitigation of the significant effects of the project is infeasible because csu can not guarantee city or other public agencies,caltrans will fund and implement measures to mitigate those significant effects,marina noted unavoidable uncertainties affecting the funding and implementation of mitigation measures do not make csu voluntary contributions toward mitigation of those effects infeasible.marina,supra,cal th at.furthermore,the deir,the feir,and the findings do not contain any detailed discussion showing city or other public agencies will not take measures to fund and implement mitigation measures within their respective jurisdictions and control.our review of the record shows csu has identified specific mitigation measures for each significant environmental effect of the project,street intersections and segments and freeway onramps and segments and csu has not shown the public agencies with jurisdiction over those mitigation measures had rejected those mitigation measures assuming csu pays its of those mitigation costs 
city also asserts the deir and feir did not discuss alternatives to the project components or other acts that could mitigate the significant environmental effects of the project and thereby reduce or eliminate csu obligation to pay its for mitigation.marina implicitly recognized that ceqa requires csu to consider acts that can mitigate effects,stating i f csu can not adequately mitigate or avoid a project environmental effects by performing acts on the campus,by sufficiently reducing the use of vehicles,then to pay a,city or caltrans to perform the necessary acts off campus may well represent a feasible alternative.marina,supra,cal th at see also guidelines,federation of hillside canyon associations city of los angeles th,fn.based on our review of the deir and feir,we do not believe those documents adequately addressed the possibility of reducing or avoiding the need for certain mitigation measures and csu funding thereof by taking feasible measures to alter certain components of the project or taking other acts on sdsu campus.although the deir and feir extensively discussed specific alternatives to the project,they did not expressly discuss possible feasible modifications to the project or other acts that could reduce or eliminate the need for csu funding of mitigation costs.center for biological diversity county of san bernardino th,save round valley alliance county of inyo th,if an alternative is identified as at least potentially feasible,an discussion is required.association of irritated residents county of madera th,an eir must describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project,or to the location of the project,which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project,and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives.because the deir and feir did not contain an adequate discussion of the possible feasible measures that could reduce or avoid the need for mitigation,they were inadequate informational documents under ceqa.accordingly,csu did not proceed in a manner required by law and thereby abused its discretion by certifying the feir and approving the project.vineyard,supra,cal th at sierra club,supra,cal th at.

exhaustion of administrative remedies 
csu asserts,as it did in the trial court,that city,sandag,and mts are barred by the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies from raising the contentions that csu erred in interpreting marina and improperly found mitigation was infeasible because csu could not guarantee the legislature would appropriate funding for mitigation of the project significant effects.

we conclude the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not bar city,sandag,and mts from raising the contentions that csu wrongly interpreted marina and improperly found payments for mitigation of significant effects were infeasible because csu could not guarantee the legislature would appropriate funding for that mitigation.based on our independent review of the administrative record,there are at least three documents or comments that show those issues were raised in a sufficiently specific manner to allow csu an opportunity to evaluate and address them.first,in a letter to csu from city attorney dated july,city restated its concerns that it raised in its february letter responding to the nop.furthermore,city asserted the deir was fatally flawed because it does not guarantee the implementation of the traffic mitigation measures it proposes.quoting language from the deir stating that csu funding commitment is necessarily conditioned on requesting and obtaining funds from the legislature,city asserted this approach relies on a faulty interpretation of marina.city extensively discussed marina and asserted that it included pure dictum in stating csu did not have the power to mitigate if the legislature does not appropriate funding for mitigation.city argued the deir improperly relies on this dictum to build towards an untenable,that either they will or they will not mitigate significant traffic impacts.city concluded the deir fails because csu disingenuously attempt s to dodge true responsibility by relying on dicta in the same california supreme court case,marina that caused the collapse of the first deir on the project.we conclude city letter was sufficiently specific to apprise csu of the contentions that city asserted in objecting to the deir,that csu wrongly interpreted marina and improperly relied on marina dictum to conclude that payments for mitigation of the project significant effects were infeasible because csu could not guarantee the legislature would appropriate funding for that mitigation.
second,on february,after the nop was issued,csu held a scoping meeting at which it heard comments from the public.at that meeting,anne brunkow,president of the del cerro action council,made the following oral comments transcribed by a reporter and included in the administrative record 
i want to remind csu that marina indicated that public agencies have a requirement to either avoid or mitigate the significant impacts of their projects.so while it is comforting to know that csu is going to request funding for the mitigation requirement,i want to remind csu that not only do you need to request that funding from the l egislature,but you simply need to mitigate.so assuming that the l egislature denies your request for funding,that does not eliminate your responsibility to mitigate the p roject significant environmental effects.italics added.
brunkow comment clearly presented her position that under ceqa and marina csu had a duty to mitigate the significant environmental effects of the project even if the legislature denied csu request for mitigation funding.city,sandag and mts can rely on brunkow comment to refute csu claim that they did not exhaust their administrative remedies.as plaintiffs challenging csu certification of the feir and approval of the project,they may raise in court as a ground of noncompliance any objection that was presented by any person or entity during the administrative proceedings.bakersfield,supra,th at.
third,the administrative record shows that even csu own staff was aware of and considered marina and other options for funding mitigation of the project effects.the written agenda for a january,meeting of csu campus planning staff and its ceqa traffic consultants included a section describing the topics of prior discussion,including.other less technical issues of mitigation concern sources of funding lack thereof legislature,local agencies,csu capital funds general obligation bonds italics added.the agenda then listed topics for discussion at that meeting,including.are there other avenues,particularly with the state legislature,that should be explored as a way of addressing marina implementation italics added.based on that agenda,it is clear csu staff had discussed at a past meeting alternative sources of funding csu mitigation obligation,including csu capital funds or general obligation bonds.it can also be reasonably inferred from the agenda that csu staff discussed other avenues,alternative sources for funding the implementation of its mitigation obligation under marina and ceqa.because csu is charged with the actions and knowledge of its staff in preparing the deir,particularly when that information is contained in the administrative record it is considering,we conclude city,sandag and mts may rely on the above agenda of csu staff to show they exhausted their administrative remedies and csu had an opportunity to consider and address the issue whether there were alternative sources for funding its obligation under ceqa to pay its of mitigation measures.bakersfield,supra,th at petitioner may raise any objection that was presented by any person or entity during the administrative proceedings.
we conclude city,sandag and mts are not barred by the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies from raising the issues that csu wrongly interpreted marina and improperly found payments for mitigation of significant effects were infeasible because csu could not guarantee the legislature would appropriate funding for that mitigation.those issues were adequately raised during the administrative proceedings by sufficiently specific comments to give csu an opportunity to evaluate and respond to them.porterville citizens for responsible hillside development city of porterville,supra,th at.furthermore,the specific issue of alternative,nonlegislative sources of funding for mitigation was raised at least implicitly,if not expressly,in the portions of the administrative record discussed above.city of walnut creek county of contra costa d,cited by csu and relied on by the trial court,is inapposite and does not persuade us to reach a contrary conclusion.therefore,the trial court erred by concluding city,sandag and mts were barred by the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies from raising the contentions regarding funding for mitigation measures 
request for judicial notice 
city contends the trial court erred by denying its request for judicial notice of certain documents pertaining to the issue of whether csu complied with ceqa and marina.
csu moved to discharge the writ,arguing it had complied with marina.in opposition to csu motion to discharge,city filed a request for judicial notice rjn of exhibits exhs.a through w,consisting of about pages.city argued the trial court should take judicial notice of documents contained in certain exhibits exhs.a through l pursuant to evidence code section,subdivision c,because they represented official acts of the executive and legislative offices of the state of california and were not reasonably subject to dispute and documents contained in certain exhibits exhs.m through w pursuant to evidence code section,subdivision h,because they are writings of csu executive offices,evidence of official acts taken by csu,and not reasonably subject to dispute.csu then filed a motion to strike the documents for which city rjn sought judicial notice.csu argued those documents were irrelevant to the issue of whether it had complied with ceqa and had not been considered by csu when it certified the feir and approved the project.city argued the rjn documents should be judicially noticed to show csu had not complied with marina and ceqa by simply requesting mitigation funding from the governor and the legislature.the trial court granted csu motion to strike the rjn documents,stating the court does not concur with city interpretation of marina these documents were not part of the administrative record and were never considered by csu when certifying the feir and approving the project.
on october,city filed a motion to augment the record on appeal with the documents lodged with its rjn,exhs.a through w.on october,we issued an order granting city motion to augment the record on appeal.

because we reverse the judgment on other grounds,we do not address the merits of city contention that the trial court erred by granting csu motion to strike city rjn documents and thereby implicitly denying the rjn.nevertheless,to provide the parties and the trial court with guidance in future proceedings in this matter,we briefly comment on the trial court rationale for not taking judicial notice of,and striking,the rjn documents.the court primary reason for striking the rjn documents was that,given its rejection of city interpretation of marina,those documents were irrelevant to its determination that csu had complied with marina by requesting mitigation funding from the legislature.however,as we concluded above,a mere request by csu that the legislature appropriate funding for mitigation of the project significant effects does not comply with ceqa and,at a minimum,an extensive discussion considering other possible feasible sources for funding mitigation is required.ceqa and marina require that csu adopt feasible measures to mitigate the significant environmental effects of the project.csu must consider and adopt feasible sources of mitigation funding in addition to requesting funding from the governor and the legislature.therefore,to the extent the rjn documents are relevant to csu obligation to take feasible measures to mitigate the significant effects of the project,including considering possible feasible sources for mitigation funding,csu should consider those documents and the trial court in any future proceeding may,in the reasonable exercise of its discretion,grant any future request to take judicial notice of documents relevant to the question of whether csu has proceeded in a manner required by law 
increased vehicle traffic calculations 
sandag and mts contend the trial court erred by concluding csu did not improperly calculate the increased vehicle traffic that will be caused by the project increased student enrollment.they assert csu erred in calculating the average daily vehicle trip adt rates for both the project anticipated new resident students and new nonresident or commuter students 
resident student adt rate.for purposes of analyzing the impact of the project on traffic,the deir considered a new student to be a resident if that student either lived on the sdsu campus or within mile of the campus.the deir assumed the project would result in enrollment of an additional students by the academic year and that percent of those new students would be resident students and the remaining percent of new students would be commuter students.
in estimating the adt rate for the new resident students,the deir relied on prior adt rate calculations for resident students made by city and the university of california san diego ucsd.in a college community redevelopment project eir drafted by city in redevelopment eir,city calculated the adt rate for a resident sdsu student would range from to.in a separate eir,ucsd calculated the adt rate for a resident ucsd student to be.for purposes of analyzing the impact of the project on traffic,the deir assumed the higher adt rate from the redevelopment eir would apply to the project new resident students.
sandag and mts argue the deir erred by using the redevelopment eir adt rate for resident sdsu students because,in so doing,it treated the project new resident students as existing commuter students who relocated to campus housing.they argue the analysis used in the redevelopment eir is inapposite because that eir considered the effect of constructing new student housing near the sdsu campus and the reduction in traffic as the result of the relocation of existing commuter students to housing near the campus and did not consider any increase in sdsu enrollment.however,we are not persuaded by that argument because the relevant issue is whether sandag and mts have shown the redevelopment eir penultimate adt calculation for resident students is not supported by substantial evidence and can not reasonably be relied on by csu in calculating the adt rate for the project new resident students.we conclude they have not carried their burden on appeal to make that showing.
sandag and mts extensively discuss the redevelopment eir methodology in calculating the adt rate for existing commuter students who relocate to housing near the sdsu campus.however,we need only briefly set forth that methodology and its calculations.table of the redevelopment eir specifically cited in the deir began with a vehicle adt rate for commuters of between and per dwelling unit,depending on the type of housing the adt rate was then reduced by adt per dwelling unit to reflect the fact that sdsu commuter students who relocated to the new redevelopment housing near sdsu would no longer need to commute to sdsu by vehicle.the redevelopment eir concluded the relocated,and then resident,sdsu students and faculty and staff would have an adt rate of per dwelling unit.dividing the redevelopment eir adt resident rate by the number of students per dwelling unit,the deir calculated an adt rate of per new resident student should apply in analyzing the traffic impacts of the project.that adt rate per student was then multiplied by the number of the project new resident students,for a total increase of adt,or daily vehicle trips,by the new resident students.
we conclude csu methodology in relying on the redevelopment eir adt calculations for resident students was reasonable.furthermore,the redevelopment eir provided substantial evidence to support the deir adt rate for new resident students.sandag and mts do not carry their burden on appeal to show otherwise.we are not persuaded by their assertion that csu improperly considered the project new resident students to be relocated commuter students by taking a relocation deduction.csu did not consider the project new resident students to be relocated commuter students,but rather relied on,and adopted,the redevelopment eir adt calculation for relocated,and then resident,students.it was the end result of the adt rate calculated for a resident student that the deir adopted from the redevelopment eir and not the redevelopment eir assumption that existing commuters would relocate to housing on or near sdsu campus finally,because the deir assumed the higher adt rate for new resident students applied to the project based on the redevelopment eir calculations,we need not address sandag and mts additional assertion that there was no substantial evidence to support csu reliance on ucsd adt rate for its resident students.csu did not rely on that lower adt rate in analyzing the traffic impacts of the project.
commuter student adt rate.sandag and mts assert csu improperly calculated the increase in adt caused by the project new commuter students because it assumed new and existing commuter students would increasingly use transit,trolley and buses rather than individual vehicles for their trips.they argue csu wrongly assumed that increased transit use would result in a percent reduction in vehicle trips by the academic year.
based on an actual vehicle count conducted during a period in november at sdsu parking lots,csu determined sdsu total adt were and,when divided by the number of commuter students,obtained an adt rate of per commuter student.multiplying that adt rate by the number of new commuter students to be added by the project,a total of new vehicle trips per day would be expected for new commuter students.when that total of adt for new commuter students was added to the adt for new resident students as discussed above,the adt for adobe falls housing residents,and the adt for alvarado hotel guests,a total of adt would be added by the project by based on figures.however,because the adt rate for commuter students was based on vehicle and trolley usage,it did not reflect any anticipated future increase in the rate of trolley usage and resultant decrease in the rate of vehicle usage based on sandag and mts projections that daily boardings at the sdsu trolley station would increase from to by,csu calculated there would be an increase of passengers boarding at the sdsu station over the current number of boardings.after adjusting for boardings,transfers,carpools,and use of other forms of transit,bus,csu determined of the increase in daily boardings at the sdsu station would be trolley boardings.because daily boardings represent only outbound trips,csu multiplied by to obtain the increased number of trolley trips both inbound and outbound by based on sandag and mts projections.because csu assumed that projected increased trolley usage reflected a shift from vehicle usage to trolley usage,csu subtracted that increased trolley usage from the gross total increased number of adt resulting from the project based on figures and obtained a net increase of adt resulting from the project.therefore,csu reduced the initial calculation for the gross increase in the project adt,or average daily vehicle trips,based on its assumption that sdsu students,faculty and staff would increasingly use the trolley by instead of vehicles,resulting in a net increase in adt caused by the project of only by 
sandag and mts argue csu improperly reduced the gross increase in adt by percent to reflect the projected increased usage of the trolley by they argue that percent reduction was improper because it reduced an already reduced adt rate based on trolley use.however,as csu notes,its gross adt commuter rate was based on the rate of trolley usage and did not account for future increases in the rate of trolley usage.accordingly,csu reduced the project total increase in adt caused by new commuter students,new resident students,adobe falls housing residents,and alvarado hotel guests,by percent to reflect the projected increase in the rate of trolley usage and resultant decrease in the rate of vehicle usage.in so doing,we can not conclude that csu acted unreasonably or without substantial evidence for using that methodology.city of long beach los angeles unified school,supra,th at substantial evidence standard of review applies to agency methodology used for studying an impact and the reliability or accuracy of data on which agency relied.
furthermore,we reject sandag and mts assertion that csu essentially assumed all new,faculty,staff and visitors would be vehicle drivers who were somehow magically persuaded to switch to trolley transportation.rather,csu initially calculated the gross increase in adt resulting from the project new students commuters and residents,faculty,staff,and guests,based on rates of trolley usage and then reduced that number to reflect a percent use by.we conclude there is substantial evidence to support csu methodology and calculations in finding the project net increase in adt will be.to the extent sandag and mts argue csu should have used a different methodology,they do not show there is insufficient evidence to support the methodology csu used in calculating the project traffic impact in increasing adt.accordingly,sandag and mts have not carried their burden on appeal to show csu improperly calculated the increase in adt by the project new commuter students based on csu assumption that new and existing commuter students as well as resident students,adobe falls housing residents,and alvarado hotel guests would increasingly use the trolley rather than vehicles.
based on the above arguments challenging csu methodology and calculations regarding the increased number of adt caused by the project,sandag and mts assert csu calculation of its fair share of costs to mitigate the project traffic impacts,is not supported by substantial evidence.however,because we rejected those methodology and calculation arguments above,we conclude sandag and mts have not carried their burden on appeal to show there is insufficient evidence to support csu calculation of its fair share of traffic mitigation costs.
deferral of mitigation of traffic impacts 
sandag and mts contend the trial court erred by concluding csu properly deferred adoption of mitigation measures to reduce vehicle traffic.they assert csu adoption of mitigation measure tcp,requiring csu to consult with them in developing a transportation demand management tdm program with the goal of reducing vehicle trips to sdsu campus in favor of alternate modes of travel,constitutes improper deferral of measures to mitigate the project traffic impacts.
feasible mitigation measures for significant environmental effects must be set forth in an eir for consideration by the lead agency decision makers and the public before certification of the eir and approval of a project.the formulation of mitigation measures generally can not be deferred until after certification of the eir and approval of a project.guidelines,section a b states formulation of mitigation measures should not be deferred until some future time.however,measures may specify performance standards which would mitigate the significant effect of the project and which may be accomplished in more than one specified way.
a study conducted after approval of a project will inevitably have a diminished influence on decisionmaking.even if the study is subject to administrative approval,it is analogous to the sort of post hoc rationalization of agency actions that has been repeatedly condemned in decisions construing ceqa.sundstrom county of mendocino d.r eliance on tentative plans for future mitigation after completion of the ceqa process significantly undermines ceqa goals of full disclosure and informed decisionmaking and,consequently,these mitigation plans have been overturned on judicial review as constituting improper deferral of environmental assessment.communities for a better environment city of richmond th,communities.
deferral of the specifics of mitigation is permissible where the local entity commits itself to mitigation and lists the alternatives to be considered,analyzed and possibly incorporated in the mitigation plan.citation.on the other hand,an agency goes too far when it simply requires a project applicant to obtain a biological or other report and then comply with any recommendations that may be made in the report.defend the bay city of irvine th.if mitigation is feasible but impractical at the time of a general plan or zoning amendment,it is sufficient to articulate specific performance criteria and make further approvals contingent on finding a way to meet them.endangered habitats league,county of orange th.
however,a lead agency adoption of an eir proposed mitigation measure for a significant environmental effect that merely states a generalized goal to mitigate a significant effect without committing to any specific criteria or standard of performance violates ceqa by improperly deferring the formulation and adoption of enforceable mitigation measures.san joaquin raptor rescue center county of merced th,communities,supra,th at eir merely proposes a generalized goal of no net increase in greenhouse gas emissions and then sets out a handful of cursorily described mitigation measures for future consideration that might serve to mitigate the project significant environmental effects.sacramento old city city council d,upheld eir that set forth a range of mitigation measures to offset significant traffic impacts where performance criteria would have to be met,even though further study was needed and eir did not specify which measures had to be adopted by city.
the deir concluded the project would cause significant traffic impacts.in response to comments from sandag and others that csu should take a more balanced approach to mobility and provide mitigation measures supporting alternative modes of travel,csu revised the deir to include mitigation measure tcp in the feir.tcp stated 
sdsu shall develop a campus transportation demand management tdm program to be implemented not later than the commencement of the academic year.the tdm program shall be developed in consultation with sandag and mts and shall facilitate a balanced approach to mobility,with the ultimate goal of reducing vehicle trips to campus in favor of alternate modes of travel.italics added.
in the findings,csu adopted tcp,along with other traffic mitigation measures.csu also adopted the mitigation measures set forth in the mmrp,which included tcp.csu then certified the feir and approved the project.
sandag and mts assert the traffic mitigation measure set forth in tcp constitutes improper deferral of mitigation by csu in violation of ceqa.they argue tcp did not identify any specific future mitigation actions or set any specific goals or performance standards.they argue tcp merely stated a generalized goal and did not commit csu to take any actual or specific mitigation actions,thereby constituting improper deferral of mitigation of the project significant traffic effects.
we agree with sandag and mts assertion that csu adoption of tcp constitutes improper deferral of mitigation of the project significant traffic effects.tcp commits csu only to consult with sandag and mts and then develop a tdm to be implemented by.the tdm shall facilitate a balanced approach to mobility,with the ultimate goal of reducing vehicle trips to campus in favor of alternate modes of travel,but there are no specific mitigation measures to be considered or any specific criteria or performance standards set forth in the tdm.tcp sets only a generalized goal of reducing vehicle trips by,presumably,encouraging alternate modes of travel.this is inadequate.no criteria or alternatives to be considered are set out.rather,the mitigation measure does no more than require a report be prepared and followed,or allow approval by csu without setting any standards.endangered habitats league,county of orange,supra,th at.therefore,the tdm required to be developed by tcp appears to be,at best,an amorphous measure that does not commit csu to take any specific mitigation measures to reduce vehicle trips and does not provide for any objective performance standards by which the success of csu mitigation actions can be measured.accordingly,as in another case,t he only criteria for success of the ultimate mitigation plan adopted is the subjective judgment of csu,which presumably will make its decision outside of any public process after the project has been approved.communities,supra,th at.furthermore,because tcp and the tdm are lacking in specifics,neither csu decision makers nor the public had an opportunity to consider possible specific,concrete mitigation measures to reduce vehicle trips to sdsu.because csu only adopted tcp in response to comments to the deir and thereby apparently deferred studying actual measures that could be taken to reduce vehicle trips,t he solution was not to defer the specification and adoption of mitigation measures until after project approval,but,rather,to defer approval of the project until proposed mitigation measures were fully developed,clearly defined,and made available to the public and interested agencies for review and comment.id.at.sacramento old city city council,supra,d,cited by csu,is inapposite and does not persuade us to reach a contrary conclusion the trial court erred by concluding csu did not improperly defer adoption of mitigation measures to reduce vehicle traffic by adopting tcp.
the project effect on transit 
sandag and mts contend the trial court erred by concluding the feir adequately addressed the project potential impacts on transit and there is substantial evidence to support csu finding that the project will not cause any significant effect on public transit,trolley and bus facilities and service.
an eir must describe,in detail,all the significant effects on the environment of the project.sunnyvale,supra,th at.an eir must include a detailed discussion of a ll significant effects on the environment of the proposed project,subd.b.section states significant effect on the environment means a substantial,or potentially substantial,adverse change in the environment.italics added.section states environment means the physical conditions which exist within the area which will be affected by a proposed project,including land,air,water,minerals,flora,fauna,noise,objects of historic or aesthetic significance.italics added.in evaluating the significance of the environmental effect of a project,the lead agency shall consider direct physical changes in the environment which may be caused by the project and reasonably foreseeable indirect physical changes in the environment which may be caused by the project.guidelines,subd.d.

the deir circulated by csu discussed the potentially significant impacts of the project on the environment.although the deir traffic analysis included a substantial reduction of the project impact on traffic as a result of the projected use as discussed above,the deir did not substantively address whether that increased rate of trolley use,together with the additional trolley trips taken by the new students to be added by the project,would cause a significant effect,whether direct or indirect,on the environment.appendix n traffic technical report to the deir relied on sandag forecast that boardings at the sdsu trolley station would increase from daily boardings in to daily boardings in to conclude,through interpolation,that there would be daily boardings in the academic year.appendix reflected that interpolation of sandag forecasted increase in boardings at the sdsu station.
in response to the deir,sandag sent a letter,dated august,to sdsu stating that the traffic study assumes a high level of transit mode share while failing to address capacity limitations of the transit system to absorb the projected transit trips.consequently,the traffic study understates traffic impacts and does not adequately mitigate for those impacts in the short or long term.it further stated impacts should be mitigated with specific transit,highway,and roadway improvements that are implemented by csu.impacts should be mitigated through a combination of improvements and by participating in the construction funding of regional transportation facilities and services at a level.sandag expressed the specific concern that the deir traffic analysis assume d a high proportion of trips accommodated by transit without addressing the needed capital and operating support necessary to attain that mode split.sandag stated 
the analysis includes an unsupported assumption that of the growth in vehicular trips generated by the campus growth will be handled by transit.this assumption is based on the sandag model estimate of future boarding growth at the sdsu trolley station.the sandag model projects demand for transit travel unconstrained by the limitations of the system capacity.we are skeptical that the projected additional transit trips can be absorbed by the system without infrastructure and operational improvements to the trolley and bus system.while we support any effort to meet sdsu future travel needs with transit,the deir must address the impacts of the demand growth on transit and assess sdsu responsibility to provide improvements to mitigate those impacts.
the master plan and eir should identify mode split targets for and intermediate years,and include specific measures geared toward achieving those targets.the deir should include a plan for capital and operating improvements that mitigate for additional demand and any negative impacts to current transit operations as a result of sdsu plans.for example,the capacity of the trolley infrastructure and services should be evaluated,and mitigation measures should be proposed,such as improvements to track,rolling stock,and station infrastructure,or additional service to address capacity issues.these measures should be identified in consultation with mts.italics added.
the feir included csu responses to various comments by other agencies and the public to the deir,including a specific response to sandag comments.the feir stated 
between march and august,representatives of sdsu and sandag met on numerous occasions to discuss the project.because the deir did not find that the project would result in significant impacts to transit,trolley or bus systems,it is position that no mitigation is required.
sandag,however,contends that sdsu is responsible for transportation improvements,including primarily improvements to transit according to sandag,this per capita cost figure could be used as an initial basis for determining sdsu fair share contribution toward the regional impacts resulting from the p roject.citation.
sandag has provided no evidence that the project would result in significant impacts to transit within the meaning of ceqa,nor has it provided sdsu with a sufficient nexus study relative to the project impacts and the student mitigation payment it proposes italics added.
in regard to sandag specific concern that the deir assumed a high level of transit use but did not address the capacity limitations of the transit system to absorb those increased transit trips,csu responded 
the premise of the comment is incorrect.ceqa does not require that the traffic impacts analysis address whether the transit system has capacity limitations or is able to absorb the projected transit trips.see,ceqa guidelines appendix g,subparagraph xv,
additionally,ceqa does not define increased transit ridership as an impact,nor does it provide applicable thresholds of significance to determine when such increased ridership would be significant within the meaning of ceqa,thereby requiring mitigation.absent identification of a significant impact within the meaning of ceqa,no mitigation is required.
in addition to the absence of significance criteria in appendix g of the ceqa guidelines,neither sandag nor the city of san diego has developed criteria that may be utilized to assess whether the project would significantly impact transit services 
moreover,to require a project proponent to mitigate increased transit ridership by paying for capital improvements to the transit system,as the comment letter requests,would be directly contrary to statewide land use and planning principles,which uniformly encourage the increased use of transit to reduce traffic impacts and related air quality impacts t he comments ask sdsu to take steps to further increase transit ridership,while at the same time contending that such increased ridership is an impact requiring mitigation.the inherent disincentive in this approach is counter to the fundamental principles of ceqa to reduce,not increase,environmental impacts.
in sum,any transit impacts that may result from the project relating to increased transit ridership are not subject to ceqa analysis as they are not environmental impacts recognized under ceqa.accordingly,if a transit impact analysis were to be undertaken,as the comment letter suggests,it would necessarily be conducted under a regime.
the comment implies that the focus of any such analysis would be on whether the project contributes to transit ridership rates in such a manner that implementation of the project would result in.accordingly,any analysis to be undertaken would entail assessing the transit service ability to accommodate the additional riders.
notably,at no time during the traffic consultant discussions with sandag was any concern expressed regarding future capacity associated with the green line.furthermore,at present time,there is no evidence that the green line is operating at or near capacity due to sdsu ridership.sandag comment letter provided no data or other documentation that the green line is operating over capacity,thereby resulting in physical deficiencies in the system 
t he projections of future ridership utilized in the eir are based on sandag own generated estimates.therefore,it is reasonable to expect that because the source of the numbers is sandag,sandag is planning for the increased ridership and this increased ridership has already been factored into sandag plans for the system.finally,there is no evidence that sandag will not be able to secure funding for any necessary transportation infrastructure programs through traditional funding sources at the local,state,and federal levels italics added.
based on csu responses to sandag comments,the feir revised the deir transportation analysis section to include the following statement 
with respect to transit,neither sandag nor the city of san diego has established criteria that could be utilized to assess the project impact on transit service.additionally,the congestion management program cmp provides no methodology to analyze potential impacts to transit and there is no criteria to determine whether an increase in transit ridership would be a significant impact within the meaning of ceqa.
the feir also included revisions to its appendix n traffic technical report,adding the following statements the p roject will result in an increase in ridership on both local bus service and the san diego trolley.the sandag forecasted increase in trolley ridership is discussed in section of this report.neither sandag nor the city of san diego has criteria that could be utilized to assess the p roject impact on transit service.in addition,the congestion management program cmp provides no methodology to analyze potential impacts to transit and there is no criteria to determine whether the increase in ridership would be significant.the san diego trolley line was recently extended to sdsu in and was constructed to accommodate large ridership amounts.
on november,after the period for public comment on the deir had ended,mts sent a letter to csu,expressing some of the same concerns sandag had expressed.mts stated 
the deir for the project recognizes the importance of transit and indicates that a large part of the anticipated growth in the campus population will rely on transit to gain access to campus facilities.unfortunately,the existing trolley and bus services can not possibly meet this demand.based on preliminary review,transit would need to provide an additional million investment in capital and an additional million per year to operate the service.the current state of funding for transit makes this investment impossible.among other factors contributing to this lack of funding is the state of california diversion of million from mts in this fiscal year and the promise to continue this diversion next year.
currently,mts trolley and buses make over trips per day to and from sdsu,which represents over percent of the student population.based on the eir,the number of transit trips serving sdsu is expected to increase by percent.not only is this substantial increase a reflection of the growth in student population,it also assumes an increase in transit share of trips to the university.to achieve this increase and adequately serve the demand,transit operations need to be expanded italics added.
on november and,csu held a public meeting on the feir.representatives of sandag and mts,among others,expressed their concerns regarding the feir and the project.csu then adopted the findings and the mmrp.in the findings,csu generally found the feir identified potentially significant effects that could result from implementation of the project,but inclusion of mitigation measures as part of approval of the project would reduce most,but not all,of those effects to less than significant levels.csu expressly found the project would have n o significant impacts on transit systems.italics added.csu then certified the feir and approved the project.
we first address sandag and mts assertion that csu did not adequately investigate or address the project potential impacts on transit.based on our independent review of the administrative record,we conclude csu did not adequately investigate and address the project significant,substantial or potentially substantial adverse impacts on the san diego public transit system,trolley and bus systems although csu calculated per sandag projections that the number of daily boardings at the sdsu trolley station would increase from boardings in to boardings in the academic year apparently due primarily to the project additional students and shift from vehicle to trolley usage as discussed above,csu did not conduct any substantive investigation or other study of the potential environmental impacts of that increased trolley usage and whether those impacts were significant environmental effects under ceqa.sandag and mts comments expressed their concerns that the increased trolley trips resulting from the project could not be absorbed by the trolley system without infrastructure and operational improvements.they expressed their belief that csu should study the capacity limitations of the trolley system and propose mitigation measures to reduce the project significant effects on the trolley system.however,rather than accepting their suggestions,csu rejected them.in its responses to sandag comments and in the feir,csu took the position that it had no duty under ceqa to investigate the potential effects of the project on the transit system because any impact of the project on the transit system is not an environmental effect under ceqa sandag and other agencies did not,and the guidelines do not,provide csu with any criteria for determining the capacity of the sdsu trolley station or whether the increased trolley usage is a significant environmental effect under ceqa and public policy favors increased transit use so impacts on the trolley system should not be considered significant environmental impacts subject to mitigation obligations under ceqa.
on appeal,csu appears to rely only on the second ground to justify its failure to investigate and address the potential significant effects of the project on the trolley system csu argues,in conclusory fashion,that because sandag and other agencies,city and mts did not provide it with either the exact capacity limitations of the sdsu trolley station or specific criteria for determining whether the project effects on the trolley system would be significant effects,there was no evidence in the administrative record that would allow it to investigate and determine whether the project increased trolley usage would exceed the sdsu trolley station capacity.csu further argues that absent specific criteria for determining whether the project effects on the trolley system would be significant,it had no duty to investigate those effects and determine,on its own,whether those effects would be significant under ceqa.however,in so arguing,csu improperly attempts to avoid,or at least unduly minimize,its duties as a lead agency under ceqa to investigate and address a project potentially significant environmental effects in an eir and to discuss and adopt feasible mitigation measures to avoid or reduce those effects.see generally,subd.d,subd.d,subd.a,sunnyvale,supra,th at sierra club,supra,cal th at laurel heights,supra,cal d at lead agency must prepare an eir which is an informational document and t he purpose of an eir is to provide public agencies and the public in general with detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment to list ways in which the significant effects of such a project might be minimized and to indicate alternatives to such a project.u nder ceqa,the lead agency bears a burden to investigate potential environmental impacts.county sanitation dist.county of kern,supra,th at.in so doing,the lead agency must consult with any public agency that has jurisdiction over natural resources or other potential environmental impacts of a project.berkeley,supra,th at.
csu has a duty to investigate potential environmental impacts of the project,including whether the project impacts on the transit system may be significant environmental effects.although the record supports a finding that csu consulted with sandag and other public agencies on certain matters,csu does not cite,and we are not aware of,any document in the administrative record showing csu expressly requested data or other specific information regarding the capacity limitations of the sdsu trolley station or trolley line or system generally.csu can not fulfill its duties as a lead agency under ceqa by acknowledging the project will cause a substantial increase in trolley ridership and then not proactively investigate whether that increase will exceed the trolley system capacity or otherwise cause potentially substantial adverse changes to the trolley system infrastructure and operations.guidelines,a n agency must use its best efforts to find out and disclose all that it reasonably can.berkeley,supra,cal.app th at no evidence lead agency made reasonably conscientious effort to collect data or make further inquiries of other agencies.alternatively stated,csu can not both conclude the project will cause substantially increased trolley ridership,an additional riders and then passively wait for other agencies to provide it with data or other information that would allow it to determine whether that effect is a significant environmental effect under ceqa therefore,although we presume sandag and mts did not provide csu with specific data regarding the capacity limitations of the sdsu trolley station or the trolley line or system generally,their failure to provide csu with that data or information did not excuse csu from carrying out its duty,on its own,to investigate and discuss in the deir and feir the project potentially substantial adverse effects on the transit system,including whether the capacity of the trolley station and system may be exceeded and thereby cause rider congestion at the station,denigration of trolley service,infrastructure,and rolling stock,and additional infrastructure and operating costs woodward park homeowners,city of fresno th,there is no foundation for the idea that a lead agency can refuse to require mitigation of an impact solely because another agency did not provide information.
furthermore,although appendix g of the guidelines does not specifically list transit as an environmental factor under ceqa or set forth criteria for determining when transit impacts are significant,those omissions do not support csu assertion that it need not address the project effects on the trolley system.that appendix is only an illustrative checklist and does not set forth an exhaustive list of potentially significant environmental impacts under ceqa or standards of significance for those impacts.see,amador,supra,th at.also,the lack of precise quantification or criteria for determining whether an environmental effect is significant under ceqa does not excuse a lead agency from using its best efforts to evaluate whether an effect is significant.berkeley,supra,th at.
by not substantively investigating and addressing the project impacts on the transit system and whether those impacts may be significant environmental impacts under ceqa,csu did not proceed in a manner required by law and therefore abused its discretion under ceqa.because csu did not comply with procedures required by law,its decision must be set aside as presumptively prejudicial.sierra club,supra,cal th at.csu noncompliance with ceqa substantive requirements and its information disclosure provisions precluded relevant information from being presented to csu and the general public and constitute d a prejudicial abuse of discretion within the meaning of sections and,regardless of whether a different outcome would have resulted if csu had complied with those provisions,subd.a county of amador el dorado county water agency,supra,th at.in other words,when csu fail ed to proceed as required by ceqa,harmless error analysis is inapplicable.the failure to comply with the law subverts the purposes of ceqa if it omits material necessary to informed decisionmaking and informed public participation.county of amador,at.the trial court erred by concluding csu adequately investigated and addressed the project potential impacts on public transit 
sandag and mts also assert there is insufficient evidence to support csu finding that the project will not cause any significant effect on public transit,trolley facilities and service.sandag and mts also argue csu finding that the project will have no significant effect on the transit system is legally deficient.after csu did not substantively address in the deir whether the project increased trolley use would cause a significant effect,whether direct or indirect,on the trolley system or other physical conditions within the area,subd.b,sandag commented on the deir and raised that issue.in response,csu made a conclusory,and unsupported,statement in the feir that any transit impacts that may result from the project relating to increased transit ridership are not subject to ceqa analysis as they are not environmental impacts recognized under ceqa.in the findings,csu then made the conclusory finding that the project would have n o significant impacts on transit systems.italics added.in so finding,csu did not support its finding of no significant effect on the transit system with a brief statement of its reasons for that finding.if an agency investigation shows particular environmental effects of the project will not be potentially significant,the eir must contain a statement briefly indicating the reasons for determining that various effects on the environment of a project are not significant and consequently have not been discussed in detail in the eir,subd.c see also guidelines,b.furthermore,the eir must include a statement of the agency reasons,albeit brief,for its conclusion that a particular environmental impact is not potentially significant.amador,supra,th at.a mere conclusion of insignificance is not adequate to allow meaningful judicial review and constitutes a failure to proceed in the manner required by law.id.at.accordingly,csu conclusory finding that the project will not have a significant effect on the transit system is legally deficient under ceqa.
more importantly,there is insufficient evidence in the administrative record to support csu finding the project will not have a significant effect on the transit system.on appeal,csu does not cite or rely on any substantial evidence showing the projected increase in trolley usage resulting from the project additional enrollment will not cause a potentially substantial,adverse change in or to the transit system.significant effect on the environment means a substantial,or potentially substantial,adverse change in the environment.csu calculated,based on sandag projections,that there will be an increase from daily boardings to daily boardings at the sdsu station by the academic year.of those daily boardings,csu calculated that will be boardings,an increase of boardings over the boardings in.therefore,there will be an increase of almost percent in the number of riders from to.however,csu did not conduct any substantive investigation or analysis regarding whether that substantial increase in trolley usage may affect the trolley system.furthermore,csu does not cite,and we are not aware of,any evidence in the administrative record showing the project increased trolley usage will not have a significant effect on the transit system.
although csu argues an sdsu economic benefit analysis contained in the administrative record provides support for its finding that the project will not have a significant effect on the transit system,we conclude that analysis does not constitute substantial evidence in support of csu finding.csu cites appendix q to the feir,titled sdsu economic impact report.that report,dated july,was prepared by icf international for sdsu and describes the report as measuring the economic impact on the region.by the nature of the issues it addresses,the economic benefit report does not directly investigate or address whether the project increased trolley usage will have a significant environmental effect on the transit system.nevertheless,in summarizing the project impacts on transportation,the report stated an estimated students,faculty and staff can be accommodated by the sdsu trolley station.the report stated the trolley can accommodate students,faculty and staff.that statement is supported by a citation to footnote,which is a reference to the website http none of the parties discuss,much less provide us with information regarding,that supporting website.furthermore,the website information is not contained in the administrative record.without further information regarding the supporting citation,we conclude the evidence is insufficient to support the economic benefit report statement that the sdsu trolley station can accommodate students,faculty and staff.accordingly,that unsubstantiated conclusory statement in the economic benefit report can not provide substantial evidence for a finding that sdsu trolley station capacity is or that the project will not have a significant effect on the transit system u nsubstantiated opinion or narrative,evidence which is clearly inaccurate or erroneous is not substantial evidence.substantial evidence shall include facts,reasonable assumptions predicated upon facts,and expert opinion supported by facts,subd.c guidelines.
in arguing there is substantial evidence to support its finding,csu primarily argues sandag and mts failed to provide it with data or other information that would allow it to determine whether the project would have a significant effect on the transit system.csu apparently argues that because those agencies did not provide it with evidence of the capacity limitations of the sdsu station or otherwise show the project would have a significant effect on the transit system,there is substantial evidence to support its finding that the project will not have a significant effect on the transit system.in so arguing,csu either misconstrues misapplies the substantial evidence standard of review under ceqa.substantial evidence under ceqa is defined as enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion,even though other conclusions might also be reached.guidelines,subd.a.although we make all reasonable inferences from th
