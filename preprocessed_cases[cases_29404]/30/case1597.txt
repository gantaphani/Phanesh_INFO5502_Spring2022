background 
maritrans was formed in to acquire the tugboat and tank barge fleet and related assets of sonat marine.since acquiring its fleet of tank vessels,maritrans has established itself as a marine petroleum transport company that transports,stores,and distributes oil for petroleum companies and distributors.it operates its fleet of tank barges in the united states coastwise jones act trade,transporting over million barrels of crude oil and refined petroleum products annually 
in,congress passed,in response to the massive march exxon valdez oil spill in prince william sound,alaska.requires that all newly constructed tank vessels engaged in marine transportation of oil and petroleum products in the united states be constructed with double hulls.a except as otherwise provided in this section,a vessel to which this chapter applies shall be equipped with a double hull.a double hull design provides a reinforced hull in order to minimize the impact of punctures and hull damage.applies to a vessel if the vessel is constructed or adapted to carry,or carries,oil in bulk as cargo or cargo residue and when the vessel is operating on the waters subject to the jurisdiction of the united states,including the exclusive economic zone.id.a.also requires that all single hull tank vessels,including tank barges,existing at the time of enactment be retrofitted with double hulls in order to qualify for operation on the navigable waters of the united states or the waters of the exclusive economic zone of the united states.id.c.any single hull tank vessels not retrofitted in that manner must be phased out of service according to a retirement schedule,which began on january.id.specifies that no single hull tank vessel may be operated on the navigable waterways of the united states or the waters of the exclusive economic zone after dates that are established on the basis of a vessel size and age.id.a c.
encompasses all single hull tank barges in operation in jones act trade,such as those owned by maritrans.approximately of maritrans tank vessels are constructed with single hulls or hulls and would be forced out of service if not retrofitted with double hulls by their assigned retirement dates.since,when became effective,maritrans has retrofitted two of its single hull tank barges with double hulls at a cost of approximately million per barge.maritrans also has sold five of its single hull tank barges for prices of to million per vessel.in addition,it has collected insurance proceeds from the casualty loss of one single hull tank barge that was involved in a collision in.as will be seen,it was these eight vessels that were the subject of the court of federal claims takings analysis.
ii.maritrans suit in the court of federal claims 
on august,maritrans filed suit in the court of federal claims under the tucker act,a.in its complaint,it alleged that it was entitled to compensation under the fifth amendment takings clause for the taking of of its single hull tank barges.maritrans asserted that double hull requirement extinguished the useful working lives of the barges and deprived it of of the economic value of the barges after their required retirement dates.accordingly,maritrans argued,the statute resulted in a categorical taking of the vessels.maritrans also argued that the double hull requirement resulted in a regulatory taking of its vessels 
in due course,the government moved to dismiss maritrans complaint pursuant to rule b of the rules of the court of federal claims for failure to state a cause of action for which relief could be granted.the government asserted that maritrans had no fifth amendment property interest for which it could assert a takings claim.specifically,the government argued that maritrans operated its tank barge fleet in a highly regulated field and therefore could have no property interest in the vessels in the fleet.the government pointed to a proposal by the united states coast guard recommending the adoption of a double hull requirement for all vessels to suggest that the field was highly regulated.the government further argued that personal property,such as a single hull tank barge,does not enjoy the same scope of constitutional protection as real property.the court disagreed,concluding that maritrans had a property interest in its vessels that was cognizable under the fifth amendment and that maritrans had stated a cause of action for which relief could be granted.maritrans united states.
on july,the court of federal claims held a trial on the issue of whether maritrans could establish that its property had been the subject of a regulatory taking under the analysis set forth in penn central transportation new york city,d.the penn central analysis focuses on three factors,the character of the governmental action at issue,the economic impact of the action on the claimant,and the extent to which the action has interfered with the claimant distinct,expectations.id.at.the court concluded that had interfered with a reasonable,expectation on the part of maritrans,because,when the tank barges were acquired,maritrans could not have foreseen that double hulls would be required during the estimated working life of the barges.maritrans.at.nevertheless,the court dismissed maritrans suit as not ripe for adjudication.id.at.it did so because it concluded that,at that time,a taking had not yet occurred.id.it reached that conclusion because none of maritrans vessels had been retrofitted,scrapped,or sold by reason of.id.maritrans moved for reconsideration of the dismissal,arguing that ten of its tank barges had been retrofitted,scrapped,or sold as a result of the statute.in response,the court agreed to consider maritrans takings claim on the merits insofar as it related to eight barges that had either been retrofitted with a double hull,scrapped as a result of a casualty,or sold on account of.see maritrans.at.those eight vessels were the ocean,the ocean,the ocean,the ocean,and the ocean each sold the ocean and the ocean each retrofitted with a double hull and the ocean a casualty loss.it determined,however,that the ripeness requirement was not met with respect to the remaining barges that were named in maritrans complaint.subsequently,maritrans withdrew its takings claim with respect to of the smaller barges in its fleet,thereby limiting its claim to the eight barges identified and seven additional barges for which the court had held maritrans takings claim was not ripe.those additional seven barges were the ocean,the ocean,the ocean,the ocean,the ocean,the ocean cities,and the ocean states.
in january of,the court of federal claims held a trial to assess the economic impact on maritrans of the double hull requirement of.based upon the evidence adduced at trial,the court determined that,when considered throughout the period of maritrans ownership of the eight tank barges at issue,had reduced maritrans profits arising from the barges,but had not deprived maritrans of all economically beneficial uses of the barges.maritrans.at.the court relied on the following facts that maritrans had received fair market value for the barges that it had sold that it could continue to use and derive benefit from the barges that had been retrofitted and that it had received insurance proceeds for the barge that had been scrapped after the collision.id.accordingly,the court concluded that there had not been a categorical taking of the barges.id.the court also concluded that there had not been a regulatory taking of the barges.id.at.the court reached that conclusion after finding that,even after,the barges retained substantial economic value and several beneficial uses for maritrans that was enacted to further a permissible goal that benefited the public the reduction of oil spills and that maritrans alone was not required to bear the burden of the double hull requirement.id.at.this appeal by maritrans followed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

ii.fifth amendment takings 
the fifth amendment provides,in pertinent part,as follows nor shall private property be taken for public use,without just compensation.const.amend.v,cl.the language of this clause does not prohibit the government from taking private property altogether rather,it prohibits the government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which,in all fairness and justice,should be borne by the public as a whole.penn,at.quoting armstrong united states,d.
while a taking often occurs as a result of a physical invasion or confiscation,the supreme court has long recognized that if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.coal mahon.real property,see lucas coastal council,d,tangible property,see andrus allard,d,and intangible property,see ruckelshaus monsanto,d,all may be the subject of takings claims.
the federal circuit has developed a test to evaluate claims that a governmental action constitutes a taking of private property without just compensation.see m j coal united states.first,a court must evaluate whether the claimant has established a property interest for purposes of the fifth amendment.id.at.second,once a court has determined that a property interest exists,it must determine whether a taking occurred.id.in that regard,we have stated that it is often important to determine at the outset whether a particular claimed taking was categorical or not.rith energy,united states,on rehearing.
a categorical taking has been defined as one in which all economically viable use,all economic value has been taken by the regulatory imposition.palm beach isles assocs.united states.a categorical taking is distinct from a taking that is the consequence of a regulatory imposition that prohibits or restricts only some of the use that would otherwise be available to the property owner but leaves the property owner with substantial economic use.id.when a taking is determined to be,the court must embark on a inquiry in which it applies the standard promulgated by the supreme court in penn central to evaluate whether the governmental action at issue constituted a cognizable taking of the property interest at issue.rith energy,at.the penn central analysis involves several factors that have particular significance.penn,at.as noted above,those factors are the character of the governmental action at issue,the economic impact of the action on the claimant,and the extent to which the action has interfered with the claimant distinct,expectations.id.however,if a claimant fails to demonstrate that the interest allegedly taken constituted a property interest under the fifth amendment,a court need not even consider whether the government regulation was a taking under the analysis set forth in penn central.m j coal,at.
cognizable property interest 
maritrans asserts that the government,through its implementation of double hull requirement,took the expected useful lives and associated revenue streams from each of its tank barges.complaint.in other words,maritrans argues that the government took its barges at the time became effective.the government,however,contends that personal property is not entitled to the same protection under the fifth amendment as real property.according to the government,the concept of a categorical taking can not be extended to regulations that restrict the use of personal property.the government further contends that,in any event,the use of single hull tank barges on the navigable waters of the united states increases the risk of oil spills and therefore is a nuisance not subject to fifth amendment protection.finally,the government argues that the use the government has chosen to regulate and,therefore,the property interest asserted by maritrans,is the use of the navigable waters of the united states by single hull tank vessels to transport oil.the government maintains that no individual or corporation has the right to use a public waterway,but may only do so at the discretion of the government.
the court of federal claims concluded that maritrans possessed a cognizable property interest in each of its single hull tank barges.maritrans.at.in reaching that conclusion,the court determined that the fact that maritrans participates in the marine transport industry,which is highly regulated,does not preclude it from proving that a compensable taking has occurred.id.at.the court also held that the operation of maritrans barges did not constitute a nuisance.id.at.
the constitution neither creates nor defines the scope of property interests compensable under the fifth amendment.bd.of regents of state colls.roth,d.instead,existing rules and understandings and background principles derived from an independent source,such as state,federal,or common law,define the dimensions of the requisite property rights for purposes of establishing a cognizable taking.lucas,at.as an initial matter,we dispose of the government arguments that personal property is not subject to fifth amendment protection and that maritrans use of its barges to transport oil constitutes a nuisance.as previously noted,tangible property may be the subject of a takings claim.see andrus,at.as far as the nuisance point is concerned,it is true that the supreme court has indicated that government regulation of a nuisance does not result in a taking.lucas,at.it is correct that many of our prior opinions have suggested that harmful or noxious uses of property may be proscribed by government regulation without the requirement of compensation.we agree with the court of federal claims that maritrans use of its tank barges to transport oil does not,by itself,constitute a nuisance.
we therefore turn to the government argument that,since maritrans utilizes its single hull tank barges on the navigable waters of the united states,the property interest maritrans asserts is the use of its vessels on such waterways,which it claims is not a protected property interest.the government asserts that such use does not amount to a cognizable property interest because the navigable waters of the united states are public property,in which maritrans may not assert a property interest.see gilman philadelphia,wall.stating that for the exercise of the commerce power,the navigable waters of the united states are to be deemed the public property of the nation,and subject to all the requisite legislation by congress.
we are not persuaded by the government argument.it is true that the primary beneficial use of maritrans single hull tank barges has been in coastwise jones act trade.it is also true that it was restriction on the use of those barges in that trade that precipitated maritrans suit.however,those facts do not somehow diminish or eliminate the basic property interest that maritrans has in its single hull tank barges.maritrans has various rights in its barges that qualify them as property for fifth amendment protection.for example,maritrans may sell or otherwise dispose of the barges it may possess and transport them and it may alter them by adding a second hull.see andrus,at.suggesting that the right to possess,transport,donate,devise,and sell are all sticks in the bundle of property rights.
maritrans interest in its tank barges is not unlike the interest that paul conti had in his swordfishing vessel,the providenza,and his swordfishing nets and gear in conti united states.conti alleged that a ban on drift gillnet fishing in the atlantic swordfish fishery had deprived him of a particular use of his property.conti,at.we split our analysis of conti takings claim between his swordfishing permit and his boat,nets,and gear.we found that,while conti permit did not constitute a cognizable property interest under the fifth amendment,his boat,nets,and gear did.id.at.in short,maritrans property interest in its barges was not compromised by the nature of its claim.thus,the court of federal claims did not err in holding that maritrans had a cognizable property interest in its tank barges.
categorical taking 
having concluded that maritrans has a cognizable property interest,we must determine whether the government interfered with that interest in a way that resulted in a compensable taking.in that regard,we consider first whether a categorical taking occurred.see rith energy,at.as noted above,a categorical taking is defined as one in which all economically viable use,all economic value has been taken by the regulatory imposition.palm beach isles,at.
the supreme court stated in lucas that total deprivation of beneficial use is,from the landowner point of view,the equivalent of a physical appropriation.lucas,at.the court further stated that regulations that leave the owner of land without economically beneficial or productive options for its use carry with them a heightened risk that private property is being pressed into some form of public service under the guise of mitigating serious public harm.id.at.the court concluded that when the owner of real property has been called upon to sacrifice all economically beneficial uses in the name of the common good,that is,to leave his property economically idle,he has suffered a taking.id.at.thus,in determining whether a categorical taking occurred in this case,we must decide whether maritrans was called upon to sacrifice all economically beneficial uses of its single hull tank barges.in conducting our inquiry,we recognize that the owner opportunity to recoup its investment or better,subject to the regulation,can not be ignored.rith energy,at quoting.rock,united states.
in concluding that maritrans had not suffered a categorical taking,the court of federal claims considered the fact that maritrans was able to use its barges for several years before took effect and that it was able to sell,rebuild,or receive insurance proceeds from all of the vessels at issue.maritrans.at.the court therefore found that maritrans had not been deprived of all economically beneficial use of its barges.id.maritrans argues,however,that it did suffer the loss of such use.it claims that there is no commercially viable use for the barges if they can not carry oil,and that their scrap value is negligible.under these circumstances,it contends,resulted in a complete,taking of the useful life of the barges for the periods of time that ensued after their various retirement dates under the statute.maritrans argues that it was not able to obtain full value for the five barges that it sold,the ocean,the ocean,the ocean,the ocean,and the ocean.it also argues that,on account of,it was not able to insure for its full value the ocean the barge that was a casualty loss.as far as the ocean and the ocean the two barges that were retrofitted with double hulls are concerned,maritrans contends that,when it rebuilt these vessels,the original single hull barges were destroyed and,in effect,it built and purchased two new double hull vessels.
taking away a property most beneficial use does not by itself constitute a compensable taking.andrus,at.in andrus,the court stated that a t least where an owner possesses a full bundle of property rights,the destruction of one strand of the bundle is not a taking.id.only where congress takes away every beneficial use does a categorical taking occur.id.in this case,took away one strand of maritrans bundle of property rights by putting limitations on maritrans use of its single hull tank barges on the navigable waters of the united states.did not deprive maritrans of of the beneficial uses of its barges,however.maritrans used and received income from its barges from its shipping operations in jones act trade prior to the retirement dates.additionally,it was able to recoup substantial sums of its original investment in the eight barges at issue in this case.maritrans was able to sell five of its single hull tank barges,the ocean,the ocean,the ocean,the ocean,and the ocean,for nearly of their original cost,and following the collision of the ocean,it was able to recover insurance proceeds in the amount of million.in addition,congress left maritrans with other options besides selling its vessels or collecting insurance proceeds.the statute contemplates that shipping companies,such as maritrans,can retrofit their single hull vessels to double hull vessels and continue to operate in jones act trade after scheduled retirement dates.maritrans took advantage of this option for two of its vessels and will be able to continue using them to transport oil.although this option imposes substantial costs,maritrans has not established that retrofitting is not viable for any of its vessels.the fact that maritrans return on its investment may now be less than it originally expected is not enough to make congress enactment of a compensable taking.
in urging that it experienced a categorical taking,maritrans argues that the court of federal claims erred in considering the entire timeframe during which maritrans owned the tank barges alleged to have been taken.see maritrans.at.maritrans claims that,instead,the court should have considered two separate periods,the period before and the period after the retirement dates,and then looked at the impact in each period separately when it conducted its takings analysis.it asserts that,after the various retirement dates,all of the economic value of the vessels will be lost,and that,therefore,a categorical taking occurred.
we do not agree with maritrans argument.a similar situation presented itself in rith energy.there,the claimant urged us to isolate the commercial activity that took place after the revocation of its mining permit from the commercial activity that occurred before the revocation.we declined to do so.
rith argues that the permit revocation deprived it of all of its remaining property,percent of the coal that was left in the ground.we reject that argument as we explained in our initial opinion,it is artificial to divide the interests in the coal lease in the way that rith proposes and to disregard the coal that had already been mined under the permit before it was revoked the effect of the regulatory action in this case was to permit rith to take some coal from the property that was the subject of its leases and then to prohibit it from taking any more.the course of regulatory action,viewed as a whole,did not deprive rith of all the economic value in its coal leases and thus did not constitute a categorical taking of rith property.
rith energy,at.
we think that rith energy disposes of maritrans temporal argument.just as the claimant in rith energy could not divide the term of its coal lease into two separate periods,one before and one after the governmental action allegedly effecting a taking,so here maritrans may not confine the takings analysis for its tank barges to the various periods following the retirement dates mandated by in order to argue that there were categorical takings during those periods 
regulatory taking 
when a court determines that a categorical taking has not occurred,it must embark on a inquiry in which it applies the standard promulgated by the supreme court in penn central to evaluate whether the governmental action at issue nevertheless resulted in a regulatory taking.penn,at.stating that regulatory takings cases require essentially ad hoc,factual inquiries.the supreme court has provided guidance in this area of jurisprudence by setting forth the factors that we must consider when addressing a regulatory takings claim.as noted above,the court has directed our attention to the character of the governmental action,the economic impact of the action on the claimant,and the extent to which the action has interfered with distinct,expectations of the claimant.id.at.see also chancellor manor united states,quoting florida rock,united states,stating that when a court conducts a regulatory takings analysis,it engages in a balancing of the penn central factors.
the court of federal claims held that did not subject maritrans tank barges to a regulatory taking.maritrans.at.although the court agreed with maritrans that it had reasonable,expectations when it acquired the barges at issue,it concluded that the governmental action embodied in was for the public good and that the burden resulting from the action was not disproportionately placed on maritrans.maritrans.at maritrans.at.the court of federal claims analyzed the government action in the following manner 
the requirement was intended to benefit the public.it is a burden for maritrans,but it is not borne exclusively by maritrans.any vessel that carries oil in jones act trade must have a double hull beginning in.although congress placed new burdens on plaintiffs and others in the industry,it did not prohibit them from doing business.
maritrans.at.
the character of the governmental action factor requires a court to consider the purpose and importance of the public interest underlying a regulatory imposition,by obligating the court to inquire into the degree of harm created by the claimant prohibited activity,its social value and location,and the ease with which any harm stemming from it could be prevented.creppel united states.a taking may more readily be found when the interference with property can be characterized as a physical invasion by government than when interference arises from some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.penn,at.
does not impose a physical invasion or restraint upon maritrans tank barges nor does it compel the surrender of the barges.rather,it imposes a significant precondition with respect to one use of the barges.in andrus,the supreme court made clear that the denial of one traditional property right does not always amount to a taking.andrus,at.thus,in conti,we rejected conti claim that his property was subjected to a regulatory taking by the ban on drift gillnet fishing in the atlantic swordfish fishery.conti,at.we held that,although the ban barred him from using his vessel,the providenza,and its gear for one particular purpose,harvesting swordfish using gillnets,the ban did not deprive him of all beneficial use of his property.id.we agreed with the court of federal claims that conti could sell his vessel and its gear,fish in a different fishery,or put the vessel to other uses.id.at.
statutory and regulatory restrictions on property rights have been upheld by the supreme court if the burdens they impose are not so wholly disproportionate to the burdens other individuals face in a highly regulated society that some people are being forced alone to bear public burdens which,in all fairness and justice,must be borne by the public as a whole united states locke,d quoting armstrong,at.maritrans does not dispute that the government interest in protecting the waterways of the united states from oil spills for environmental and navigational reasons is a permissible governmental goal.rather,it asserts that was passed for political reasons rather than out of environmental concerns.this argument is not persuasive.
congress determined that implementation of a double hull requirement for vessels that carry oil in bulk on the navigable waters of the united states was necessary in order to reduce the likelihood of high volume spills that would result in damaging pollution.we will not reweigh the evidence congress considered in making its determination that implementing a double hull requirement would avoid oil spills and thereby reduce pollution.see mugler kansas.i f,in the judgment of the legislature,the manufacture of intoxicating liquors for the maker own use,as a beverage,would tend to cripple,if it did not defeat,the effort to guard the community against the evils attending the excessive use of such liquors,it is not for the courts,upon their views as to what is best and safest for the community,to disregard the legislative determination of that question.moreover,maritrans is not the sole marine petroleum transport company that is required to outfit its single hull tank vessels with double hulls.congress created the restrictions in to apply uniformly across the oil transport industry,thereby spreading the burden imposed by the statute over the entire industry.that maritrans and other carriers in the industry benefit from transporting oil for profit in this case weighs in favor of allocating this burden to them,alone.at the same time,they pose the risk of the spills that congress was seeking to eliminate when it enacted.
maritrans attempts to draw an analogy between its situation and what happened in yancey united states.yancey does not help maritrans,however.in that case,during an outbreak of lethal avarian influenza,the united states department of agriculture imposed a quarantine on poultry in several geographic locations.as a result,the yancys birds were sold for slaughter despite the fact that testing showed they were not diseased.in yancey,a fifth amendment taking was found because we determined that it would be unfair for the yancys to bear the loss of their poultry stock when their birds did not pose the risk the government was attempting to eradicate.id.at.that is not the case here.even assuming careful operation and maintenance,maritrans vessels pose the risk of oil spills that congress was attempting to reduce.the reason is that maritrans tank barges,like other single hull vessels,are susceptible to possible collision and puncture.the result urged by maritrans would have the effect of creating a disincentive for the government to enact publicly beneficial laws by requiring compensation every time a statute or regulation affects a property owner interests.the purpose of the just compensation clause is not to deter the government from establishing regulations reasonably related to a publicly beneficial policy,but rather to discourage the government from requiring a few select individuals to bear the burdens of the public benefit.coal,at.government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law.in this case,the court of federal claims did not err in deciding that maritrans was not unfairly forced to bear a burden that should be borne by the public.the character of the governmental action in this case weighs against maritrans takings claim.
when considering penn central economic impact factor,a court must compare the value that has been taken from the property with the value that remains in the property.keystone bituminous coal ass debenedictis,d.the court of federal claims calculated the change in fair market value of maritrans vessels caused by by comparing the value of maritrans tank barges after took effect with the value of the vessels before took effect.maritrans.at.using values provided by maritran
