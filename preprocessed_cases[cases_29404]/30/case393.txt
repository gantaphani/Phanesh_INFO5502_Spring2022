the question presented in this case is whether f of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla allows a potentially responsible party prp to seek contribution from other prps for environmental cleanup costs when no civil action has been brought under cercla or a.see,a,f hereinafter,citations are to sections of cercla.we hold,contrary to the panel majority whose opinion generated this en banc proceeding,that it does.
background 
appellant aviall services,purchased from appellee cooper industries,property in dallas,texas,that was contaminated with various hazardous substances.after prodding from the texas natural resource conservation commission tnrcc,aviall began cleaning up the property the federal environmental protection agency epa never contacted aviall or designated the property as contaminated.to recover some of the millions of dollars it had incurred in cleanup expenses,aviall sued cooper in the district court seeking contribution under cercla and damages under state law theories.cooper filed counterclaims.both cooper and aviall concede that they are prps under cercla because they contributed to the contamination of the property.aviall,cooper,cir.
holding that aviall could not yet assert a claim for contribution under cercla because it had not been subjected to an action under or a,the district court granted summary judgment for cooper on aviall cercla claim,dismissed it without prejudice,and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the parties state law claims.aviall appealed.
a divided panel of this court affirmed,holding that a prp seeking contribution from other prps under f must have a pending or adjudged administrative order or a cost recovery action against it.aviall,at.for this conclusion,the panel majority relied primarily on its textual interpretation of f of cercla,which provides 
any person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section a of this title,during or following any civil action under section of this title or under section a of this title.such claims shall be brought in accordance with this section and the federal rules of civil procedure,and shall be governed by federal law.in resolving contribution claims,the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under section of this title or section of this title.
f.the panel read the first sentence of f to require a prp seeking contribution from other prps to have filed a f claim during or following a federal cercla action against it.aviall,at.the term contribution was understood to require a tortfeasor to first face judgment before it can seek contribution from other parties,and the term may in the first sentence of f was viewed by the majority as creating an exclusive cause of action and mean ing shall or must.id.at.compare resolution trust miramon,cir.as for the final sentence of f sometimes referred to as the savings clause the panel read this to mean that the statute does not affect a party ability to bring contribution actions based on state law.id.at.emphasis in original.the panel majority believed that interpreting the savings clause to allow contribution suits,regardless of whether the parties are cercla defendants in a or a action,would render superfluous the first sentence of f,the enabling clause,and thus,would violate the canon of statutory construction that a specific provision governs over a general provision.id.at.
judge wiener dissented,furnishing the alternative interpretation of f that we adopt here and pointing out that the great majority of circuit courts implicitly reject the panel majority conclusion.
because of the importance of this question to the allocation of financial responsibility for cercla cleanups,we granted aviall petition for en banc rehearing.
discussion 
statutory construction begins with the plain language of a statute,but plain does not always mean indisputable or pellucid.consequently,sound interpretation reconciles the text of a disputed provision with the structure of the law of which it is a part may draw strength from the history of enactment of the provision and acknowledges the legislature general policies so that the interpretation does not become absurd 
reasonable minds can differ over the interpretation of section f,because its syntax is confused,its grammar inexact and its relationship to other cercla provisions ambiguous.using the above tools,however,we adopt what we consider the most reasonable interpretation of the provision.to facilitate the discussion,we first state the preferred interpretation and compare it briefly with the interpretation advocated by the panel majority.prefatory to defending our interpretation,a review of the statutory and decisional background leading to the passage of f will be helpful.
the en banc majority concludes that section f does not constrain a prp for covered pollutant discharges from suing other prps for contribution only during or following litigation commenced under sections or a of cercla.instead,a prp may sue at any time for contribution under federal law to recover costs it has incurred in remediating a cercla site.section f authorizes suits against prps in both its first and last sentence which states without qualification that nothing in the section shall diminish any person right to bring a contribution action in the absence of a section or section a action.
the dissent narrow textual interpretation is flawed for several reasons regarding the first sentence,it focuses unduly on the phrase during or following,and it implicitly interprets civil action to include administrative remedial orders only when the government files suit to enforce them in federal court.it narrows the last sentence arbitrarily and without textual support to the preservation of state law contribution claims.finally,the dissent interpretation distorts the interplay of the first and last sentences and fails to make sense against the background of caselaw and other interpretive guideposts.
section f was needed 
cercla was enacted in to establish a means of controlling and financing governmental and private cleanups of hazardous releases at abandoned and inactive waste disposal sites.cercla twin purposes are to promote prompt and effective cleanup of hazardous waste sites and the sharing of financial responsibility among the parties whose actions created the hazards.see,ohm remediation servs.evans cooperage,cir carson harbor,unocal,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.under the statute,the epa possesses broad powers to remediate sites itself and require covered persons prps to reimburse the government costs,and to compel prps to perform the cleanups by administrative order or court action,a.the definition of covered persons encompasses nearly all those who have or had contact with a particular site further,every prp is jointly and severally liable unless it can prove the specific amount of harm it caused.see generally bell petroleum servs.sequa,cir applying principles of apportionment found in restatement second of torts to cercla liability.these circumstances,together with the enormous costs of remediating hazardous waste sites,make the availability of contribution among prps all the more important for achieving the purposes of the those responsible for environmental damage to sites,not other parties,properly bear the costs of their actions,and that the sites are actually cleaned up.
as enacted,however,cercla contained no explicit provision allowing recovery through contribution.federal courts soon began articulating a federal common law right of contribution to resolve claims among prps.the seminal decision is city of philadelphia stepan chem,in which the city of philadelphia sued another prp for cleanup costs.neither the federal nor state governments had brought suit against the city under cercla,id.at,and there is no indication in the opinion that the city had been sued or been the object of a cercla administrative cleanup order.the district court rejected the defendants argument that because the city was subject to liability under the statute,it could not recover its cleanup costs from other responsible parties.id.at.see also nl,kaplan,cir what amounted to a cercla action for contribution allowed to proceed in absence of lawsuit or federal administrative action against the contribution plaintiff under sections or pinole point,bethlehem steel.plaintiff,itself a prp,could seek recovery under cercla a b for its response costs where no governmental action had been taken 
several other published federal decisions allowed cercla actions for recovery in the nature of contribution to proceed even though the plaintiff had not been sued under or in particular,this court held that prior government involvement was not a prerequisite to recoupment of response costs by one group of prps against other prps.tanglewood homeowners,cir.whether the cases actually used the label contribution is irrelevant,as an action brought by a prp for response costs against another prp is inherently one for contribution and even if the first prp recovers of its costs from the second prp,that does not makes its recovery any less a recovery in contribution 
the supreme court expressly acknowledged this development of federal common law when it held that of cercla impliedly authorizes a cause of action for contribution.key tronic united states,d citing stepan chemical and others of the foregoing cases.ironically,the court was in part responsible for congress enactment of an express statutory provision for contribution among prps.decisions it rendered in the early,which were cited in the legislative history concerning f,had cast doubt on the ability of federal courts to fashion implied rights of contribution under federal statutes.see texas,radcliff materials,d northwest airlines,transp.workers union of,d.
congress passed f against this statutory and decisional background.first,a way had to be found to encourage among prps.second,lower federal courts were implementing,albeit unevenly,contribution rights that did not depend on epa administrative orders and that did not arise solely during or following cercla enforcement actions.third,the supreme court had cast doubt on the availability vel non of federal common law contribution claims,arguably including those under cercla.section f was born as the machinery to govern and regulate actions for contribution,providing the details and explicit recognition that were missing from the text of.pinal creek group newmont mining,cir section f was enacted as part of the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of sara,stat.
we conclude this section with a brief and cautious review of the legislative history of f.legislative history should be consulted gingerly,if at all,in aid of statutory construction.boureslan aramco,cir,adopted en banc cir,aff.sub,arabian am.oil,d.caution is even more necessary here,for cercla is notorious for vaguely drafted provisions and an inconclusive,if not contradictory,legislative history.bell petroleum,at quoting amoco oil borden,cir.only a few general observations can be drawn from the available legislative history materials.
first,the avowed purpose of f was to give prps the explicit right to sue for contribution and to confirm the decisions of federal courts that had so construed cercla.see,pt.i,at,reprinted in,at see also cong.rec.statement of stafford predicting that would remove any doubt as to the right of contribution.william araiza,text,purpose and facts the relationship between cercla sections and,notre dame.
second,congress emphasized in sara that it had previously encouraged the federal courts to devise equitable solutions for apportioning waste site cleanup costs among numerous prps 
no change has been made in the standard of liability that applies under cercla l iability under cercla is strict,that is,without regard to fault or willfulness.where appropriate,liability under cercla is also joint and several,as a matter of federal common law.
explicit mention of joint and several liability was deleted from cercla in to allow courts to establish the scope of liability through a application of traditional and evolving principles of common law and statutory law.the courts have made substantial progress in doing so.the committee fully subscribes to the reasoning of the court in the seminal case of united states,which established a uniform federal rule allowing for joint and several liability in appropriate cercla cases.
pt.i,at,reprinted in,citations omitted emphasis added another federal district court decision cited favorably in the legislative history expressly extends this common law process of development to contribution actions.united states south carolina recycling and disposal,aff in part,vacated in part on other grounds sub nom.united states monsanto,cir,cited in house report,pt.i,at,reprinted in,and cited in,at 
third,although snippets of the legislative history suggest that congress intended to remove any doubt that the right of contribution was available after the person seeking contribution had been sued under section or these statements are contradicted by others and,as noted,pertain to much different versions of f that were not ultimately adopted.see aviall,at wiener,dissenting.
the mixed and shifting signals from legislative history yield no guide that should color the textual interpretation of f.yet,it would seem odd that a legislature concerned with clarifying the right to contribution among prps and with facilitating the courts development of federal common law apportionment principles would have rather arbitrarily cut back the standard of contribution.in no event does the history overwhelmingly support the panel majority narrow view of the statute.id.at.
for sixteen years,sections f and have governed the availability of contribution actions under cercla.as the supreme court explained it,cercla,as amended by sara,authorizes two kinds of contribution actions among prps,one that is explicit under f and another that is an implied,similar and somewhat overlapping action pursuant to.key tronic,at.at to the statute we turn.
ii.statutory text 
this court expansive reading of f which enables a claim by a prp at whatever time in the cleanup process the party,seeking contribution,decides to pursue it suits its text better than the restrictive reading adopted by the dissent.
the first point of disagreement between the dissent and the en banc majority is over the exclusivity of the claim for contribution described in the first sentence of f.does its allowance of contribution actions during or following a or a civil action mean that contribution actions are only allowed in such circumstances we think not.the dissent interpretation of the first sentence of f departs from plain meaning in several ways.only,for instance,is the word choice of the dissent,not of congress,which characterized the actions permissively a prp may bring an action for contribution.elsewhere in cercla,congress used only many times,signifying its intent to narrow,exclude or define provisions had congress similarly intended to make contribution actions available only after the referenced cercla lawsuits have been brought,it could have done so.
after adding only to the first sentence of f,the panel revised may to mean shall,and thus rendered contribution claims available exclusively during or following certain cercla civil actions.the dissent then implicitly defines civil action to include a federal administrative enforcement proceeding but only when the administrative order is contested or enforced in federal court.no one doubts the importance of permitting contribution claims when administrative enforcement actions are underway.other courts have authorized such claims but the dissent has effectively limited the availability of such actions by requiring prior initiation of a lawsuit by the federal government.this interpretation would be unnecessary if the dissent had accorded the properly broad scope to the last sentence of f and considered the first sentence,as we do,to be a statement of circumstances in which actions for contribution may be brought 
the final point of contention concerns the of the first and last sentences of f.despite the unusual syntax of this subsection,the en banc court finds these sentences logically complementary,if somewhat unusual in this regard.thus,in addition to affording a particular right of contribution in the first sentence,the provision emphasizes in its last sentence that nothing shall diminish any other contribution right available to the parties.this savings provision takes on added meaning in light of the caselaw,which did not restrict common law contribution actions until during or after proceedings or civil actions against the party who had incurred disproportionate remediation and response costs.
the dissent,however,is driven to a narrow view of the savings provision for fear that any different reading would vitiate the effect of the first sentence of f the dissent reads the savings provision to refer to actions for contribution under state law,implicitly rejecting among other things a construction that would preserve contribution actions arising by federal common law under.taken together with its exclusive view of the first sentence of f,the panel interpretation is at least in tension with the supreme court description of cercla contribution 
thus the statute now expressly authorizes a cause of action for contribution in and impliedly authorizes a similar and somewhat overlapping remedy in.
key tronic,at.at.it is not clear that the dissent holding permits an implied contribution right to coexist.
this is not a situation in which the text of the savings clause robs the first sentence of f of its meaning,as the dissent contends.instead,the provision was enacted as confirmation that federal courts,in cases decided prior to sara enactment,had been right to enable prps to recover a proportionate share of their costs in actions for contribution against other prps.confirmation of this sort was needed to eliminate the uncertainty in the case law prior to sara enactment as to whether contribution was available under cercla at all.see ohm remediation,at garza,new castle county halliburton nus,cir.the first and last sentences of f combine to afford the maximum latitude to parties involved in the complex and costly business of hazardous waste site cleanups.
iii.decisions of this court and other courts of appeals after enactment of sara 
in numerous published cases decided after the enactment of sara in,this and other courts of appeals have ruled on cercla claims for contribution where no action had been brought under or of cercla hardly any of the decisions have explicitly parsed the language of f but that fact weighs more in favor of than against our view of the provision.given the enormous monetary exposure and the volume of litigation surrounding cercla mandates,one must assume that talented attorneys have had sufficient incentive and opportunity to explore statutory lacunae such as those created by a cramped reading of f.yet all that existed before this case arose are isolated dicta the absence of direct precedent is like the dog that did bark 
moreover,the reasoning employed by the court in sun,cir,favors our reading.in sun,the court held that f governs actions for contribution brought by a prp who had not incurred costs pursuant to a civil action under or but was itself subject to an administrative order under.at.while deciding which cercla statute of limitations to apply to such claims,the court said that prps who,like plaintiffs here,incur cleanup costs pursuant to a unilateral administrative order or by a consent decree,or in some cases,voluntarily potentially have an unlimited time in which to bring their contribution claims.id.emphasis added.see also id.at prps who have incurred costs in some other way than being sued under or are also covered by the language of f.
by creating doubt as to the meaning of f,the dissent has thrown into uncertainty more than two decades of cercla practice,if the common law of contribution is included.such a result may not be inconceivable,but it should place a heavy burden on the dissent to explain how its interpretation is justified under a plain meaning reading of the statute.
iv.policy considerations 
the dissent reading of f would also create substantial obstacles to achieving the purposes of only by slowing the reallocation of cleanup costs from less culpable prps to more culpable prps and by discouraging the voluntary expenditure of prp funds on cleanup activities but by diminishing the incentives for prps voluntarily to report contamination to state agencies.according to the dissent,even if the tnrcc had unambiguously ordered aviall to engage in cleanup activities,this would not have triggered aviall right to contribution under cercla for the costs of such activities.we do not think these effects are required by a faithful reading of the statute.
the dissent hypothesizes that the negative effects of its holding would be mitigated because its reading of the last sentence of f allows a prp to bring an action for contribution under state law.this is surely an inferior and questionable remedy for congress to have embraced.not all states allow contribution before the party seeking contribution has been subjected to judgment and those that do follow quite different substantive and procedural rules moreover,as the dissent acknowledges,some courts of appeals have held that cercla preempts claims for contribution for environmental cleanup costs 
policy considerations can not change the interpretation of congress language,but they can contribute to an understanding of the language.this court understanding,like that of most courts preceding and following enactment of f,better fulfills the statutory purposes.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.this leaves to the district court,for determination in the first instance,two issues previously left unaddressed.at.the first issue is whether aviall failed to give timely notice to the epa and the attorney general of its action under cercla.the second is whether aviall complied with the national oil and hazardous substances pollution contingency plan ncp,part,by failing to provide adequate opportunity for public participation.see ohm remediation,at remanding for similar determinations.
reversed and remanded.
the majority opinion holds that a party may bring an action for contribution under f of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,f,without being subject to a prior or pending or action.because the majority holding can not be reconciled with the text or structure of the statute,i dissent.
the majority acknowledges the tenuous nature of its textual analysis by characterizing f as a provision whose syntax is confused,its grammar inexact and its relationship to other cercla provisions ambiguous.the text is not so opaque as the majority opinion asserts.
the first sentence of f provides a ny person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under a,during or following any civil action under or under a.f emphasis added.the majority opinion reasons that the word may implies that contribution suits are permitted during the pendency of a or cost recovery action,but that a or action is not a prerequisite to a contribution suit.this analysis is problematic.the inclusion of the word may in an enabling provision generally establishes an exclusive cause of action.see resolution trust miramon,cir holding that the word may,when included as part of an enabling provision,implies an exclusive cause of action see also webster third new international dictionary ed defining may as shall or must esp ecially in deeds,contracts,and statutes.thus,the word may in the first sentence of f,the enabling provision,establishes that contribution suits must be brought during or following a civil action under or.
the phrase during or following also indicates that f is available only after a primary cost recovery action commences.this phrase serves two purposes.first,it reflects the general legal proposition that contribution actions do not require the execution of a final judgment before they can be brought.see restatement second of torts w hen two or more persons become liable in tort to the same person for the same harm,there is a right of contribution among them,even though judgment has not been recovered against all or any of them.emphasis added.second,the phrase during or following imposes a limitation on the timing of cercla contribution suits.section f requires,as its language suggests,that an initial cost recovery action commence before a contribution claim can proceed 
despite the limiting language in f enabling clause,the majority opinion concludes that the provision authorizes a party to sue for contribution in any circumstance.to justify this conclusion,the majority opinion focuses on the last sentence of f the savings clause however,this clause does not authorize contribution actions under any and all circumstances.section f savings clause,like cercla general savings clause,is best interpreted as expressly preserving state law causes of action when congress meant to preserve both federal and state law causes of action,it said so explicitly.see d cercla general savings clause provides nothing in this chapter shall affect or modify in any way the obligations or liabilities of any person under other federal or state law,including common law,with respect to releases of hazardous substances or other pollutants or contaminants see also pmc,cir the purpose of cercla general savings clause is to preserve to victims of toxic wastes the other remedies they may have under federal or state law.emphasis added 
the practical effect of the majority opinion holding is that f s savings clause overrides its enabling clause.in other words,the enabling clause does nothing more than provide an example of when a contribution action might be brought this conflicts with elementary canons of statutory construction.an enacting sentence containing limiting language can not be trumped by a savings clause purporting to save all other possible causes of action.rather,any repugnancy between the savings clause and the purview does not make the enacting part void but operates to invalidate the savings clause.norman singer,statutes and statutory construction ed.the majority opinion interpretation of the savings clause,however,renders the enabling clause inoperative.see mountain states.pueblo of santa ana,d citing the elementary canon of statutory construction that a statute should be interpreted so as not to render one part inoperative.
it is also important to note that f does not create categories of liability,but rather relies on a definition of liability and simply apportions costs among the liable parties.see,sun,cir stating that is no more than a mechanism for apportioning costs,and also noting that incorporates the liabilities set forth in internal citations and quotations omitted.prior to the passage of sara,courts implied a contribution right from the language of a b the overall structure of cercla liability provisions demonstrates that is merely a subset of,providing only for the allocation of liability.see key tronic united states,d section sets forth the scope of the liabilities that may be imposed on private parties and the defenses that they may assert therefore,a f action should be contingent upon the commencement of a prior or pending cost recovery action under or.
the structure of supports this interpretation.section g,which sets out the applicable statute of limitations for contribution actions proceeding under,suggests that a f action can not proceed in the absence of an initial cost recovery action.this provision sets forth a limitations period,which would begin to run following the date of judgment in a or action significantly,the statute is silent as to the limitations period to be applied in the absence of a or civil action.pursuant to the majority opinion interpretation of f,courts would be required to derive from some other source the limitations period to apply in this instance.some courts have attempted to do just that,adopting the limitations period for initial cost recovery actions under g and applying it to contribution actions proceeding in the absence of a or action.see,geraghty miller,conoco,cir finding that if there is no prior action,a f contribution must be brought within six years sun,at same united techs,cir stating that a contribution action brought in the absence of an underlying or action must be brought within three years of the accrual of the right to contribution because contribution and initial actions are distinct remedies.such herculean efforts are unnecessary.section g a provides that no action for contribution may be commenced more than three years after the date of judgment in any action under this chapter for recovery of such costs or damages.g a.there is no need to look outside of the contribution provisions in g to determine the appropriate limitations period 
in sum,the plain language and statutory structure of cercla contribution provisions demonstrate that the contribution remedy in f requires a prior or pending or action 
the majority opinion asserts that its interpretation of f is supported by existing precedent.however,the question presented here is one of first impression in the courts of appeals the handful of district courts attempting a statutory analysis of f have reached differing conclusions thus,the case law provides no clear guidance on the interpretation of f.
the majority opinion supports its analysis by focusing on policy concerns.in particular,the majority opinion asserts that requiring the commencement of a or civil action before a contribution action can be brought undermines cercla goal of promoting prompt and effective.the majority opinion policy justifications ultimately amount to an assertion that there are more effective means of promoting private than by conditioning the availability of f on a prior federal action or judicially approved settlement.however,when a statute language and structure are clear,as in this case,it is unnecessary to consider such policy arguments.united states ron pair,d a s long as the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent,there generally is no need for a court to inquire beyond the plain language of the statute.it is not our role to substitute our judgment for that of congress when weighing the effectiveness of statutory provisions.instead,we must adhere to the contribution scheme created by congress 
the text of f allows a contribution action only for those parties who are subject to a prior or pending or cost recovery action.i,therefore,respectfully dissent.
the tnrcc sent letters instructing aviall to undertake various investigation and remediation activities.the first such letter,styled a corrective action directive,contained a detailed list of required activities.two later letters cited alleged violations of regulations and statutory provisions and indicated that enforcement action would be sought i f you fail to adequately respond.a fourth letter promised enforcement action if aviall failed to pursue one of two suggested remediation options.

the dissent modifies the panel majority interpretation somewhat.this opinion responds only to the dissent.

one case that seems to have come close,at the very least,to deciding this question is pinal creek group,rev g.in that case,the pinal group voluntarily expended resources to clean up a waste site,then sued other prps for the costs of doing so.id.at pinal creek group.at after member of group provided state agency with proposed action plan,agency approved plan group was formed,then began response activities w ith the approval and under the oversight of state agency.the ninth circuit rejected pinal creek group argument that it was entitled to bring a joint and several cost recovery action under.id.at.instead,the ninth circuit concluded that the group claim was for contribution,and that applied to the claim.id at.the ninth circuit did not accept the group argument that allowing it a cost recovery action was appropriate because it ha d not incurred any liability which would trigger a contribution claim under f.id.at.pinal creek group had contended that the requisite liability only attaches if the government incurs response costs,arguing that before then,no liability exists under a,and that the pinal group status as a prp,by itself,does not give rise to a claim for contribution.id.the court rejected this argument.although prp status,by itself,does not generate liability,a prp that incurs necessary costs of response for a hazardous waste site consistent with the national contingency plan thereby bec o me s partly responsible for those costs along with all other prps associated with the site,giving rise to a right of contribution under cercla.id.id.at under,the pinal group responsibility for its own equitable share of the cleanup costs is generated independently of any liability that might arise from response costs incurred by the government.in other words,the group was entitled to bring a claim for contribution simply because it was a prp that had incurred necessary costs of response consistent with the national contingency plan.see fireman fund ins,cercla explicitly authorizes any prp that has incurred response costs to seek contribution from any other prp.

this court has acknowledged that allowing parties who have been sued under cercla to bring contribution claims makes possible the joinder of all potentially responsible parties in a single case,an early identification of potentially responsible parties for purposes of settlement,and a single judicial apportionment of cleanup costs among responsible parties.ohm remediation,at.the same purposes are achieved by allowing a prp who has incurred cleanup costs to bring a contribution suit before he himself has been sued.
