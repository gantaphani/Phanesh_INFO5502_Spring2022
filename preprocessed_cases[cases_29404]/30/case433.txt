on and tax returns,charles and susan glass taxpayers claimed charitable deductions for two conservation easements.the commissioner of internal revenue the commissioner issued a notice of deficiency.taxpayers filed a petition in the tax court challenging the commissioner decision.the commissioner conceded that the and contributions met two of the three requirements for a qualified conservation contribution under the internal revenue code,h,that the portions of the glass property covered by each conservation easement is a qualified real property interest and that the donee,little traverse conservancy ltc,is a qualified organization.the commissioner challenge focused on the third requirement,that the conservation easements be exclusively for conservation purposes.
the tax court concluded that the conservation easements were qualified conservation contributions under h because they protect a relatively natural habitat of plants or wildlife as required by h a ii and ltc,or any subsequent holder of the conservation easements,holds or will hold the conservation easements exclusively for conservation purposes as required by h.the commissioner appeals the decision of the tax court.because the tax court factual findings were not clearly erroneous and there was no error in its application of the law,we affirm the decision of the tax court.
background 
taxpayers property and its surroundings 
in,taxpayers purchased,for,a parcel of land in emmet county,michigan,between harbor springs and cross village.glass comm r,wl.the property sits along the shoreline of lake michigan.id.it was originally purchased and used as a vacation home.in,taxpayers began using the property as their primary residence.id.at.from through,taxpayers lived part time at the emmet property and part time in their secondary residence in grosse pointe farms,michigan.in or,they began to live full time at the emmet property.id.the same three buildings that were on the property in remain.these include taxpayers home,a square foot,small handcrafted cabin that is made of logs and elm bark shaving a square foot,guest cottage and a square foot,garage.id.
the tax court gave a thorough description of the property 
the property dimensions are generally feet in width from north to south and feet in depth from east to west.its eastern edge is a straight line bordering highway.its western edge is a crooked line abutting lake michigan.lake michigan can not be seen through the property from because many large trees and dense foliage grow throughout much of the property.included among the trees on the property is a plantation of large approximately old growth original white pine trees.
a portion of the property that generally includes the property total width and extends approximately feet from is relatively flat and is generally open,grassy,and well lawned around taxpayers home and wooded and bushy in other places,especially along.the rest of the property approximately feet in depth and feet in width slopes down a steep bluff at an angle of about degrees to the shoreline of lake michigan or,more specifically,to lake michigan ordinary high water mark.the bluff is approximately feet high,and a stairway goes down it to the shoreline.the shoreline is level and consists of rocks,sand,grass,and weeds.the side of the bluff contains many trees,white pine,cedar,spruce,oak,maple,balsam fir and dense vegetation,juniper bushes and other shrubs.
taxpayers home on the property is sited on relatively flat land on the top of the bluff approximately to feet from the edge at the top of the bluff 
species of plants that grow on the lake michigan shoreline in northern emmet county include lake huron tansy and pitcher thistle.these plants are considered to be threatened and require undisturbed habitats to survive.birds on that shoreline include bald eagles,piping plovers,and kingfishers 
in the early,bald eagles were returning to the lake michigan shoreline on and near the property,and the presence of bald eagles along that shoreline is more common today than in earlier years,when it was unusual to see an eagle on that shoreline the property also has attracted kingfishers and has lake huron tansy growing on it,especially on the bluff.the property is not an ideal habitat for lake huron tansy or pitcher thistle,another threatened species of plant,but the property,in its natural state,allows for the creation or promotion of the habitat of those species as well as the habitat of bald eagles and piping plovers.
id.at footnotes omitted.
in and,taxpayers property was located in two different land use zones scenic resource and recreation residential.the easternmost feet along was classified,allowing for homes with a minimum lot size of square feet.the portion of taxpayers property zoned was large enough that it could probably be divided into four building lots of square feet each.id.at.the remainder of taxpayers property was classified,requiring a minimum lot size of square feet and feet of frontage,and designed to accommodate cottage and seasonal home development.id.at.the portion of the property zoned also included from the high water mark a waterfront setback in which building or development was not allowed.the conservation easement included space that was within this limitation.id.
the tax court also described the area surrounding taxpayers property 
the lake michigan shoreline from north of harbor springs to cross village is generally developed only for residential and related purposes.most of that shoreline is privately owned with single family vacation homes.approximately one home is sited on that shoreline every feet in the half mile north of the property and in the half mile south of the property,approximately homes are in the immediate vicinity of the property.
the typical use of the land in the immediate vicinity of the property is for dwellings.taxpayers neighbors to the north,for example,built a large home on two parcels of land that cover approximately feet of lakefront.a number of high density developments with either lakefront or back lots are also found on the land in the immediate vicinity of the property such developments are not the norm in the area of the property single family homes and cottages are.
the nearest public access to the shoreline on the property is approximately miles to the south at readmond township park in readmond.readmond is approximately square miles,is approximately miles north of harbor springs the nearest incorporated city,and is in emmet county.
the readmond township park is a small park that is publicly owned by readmond.it has in it a picnic table,a sandy beach with approximately feet of frontage,and limited parking for approximately cars.on both sides of the park are private homes which extend down to the water.no incorporated cities are found to the north of readmond.
the nearest public access to the shoreline to the north of the property is approximately miles away in cross village.cross village is in emmet county and is also the nearest public access for boats to enter lake michigan.the public area in cross village includes to feet of lakefront property.
some homes in emmet county were built on the bluff along lake michigan.the construction of a home on a bluff on or near the property interferes with the bluff natural scenic beauty.it also interferes with and destroys the natural habitat of wildlife or plants that live or grow naturally on or near the bluff.there also are risks of a landslide in building on or near a bluff.
few people walk the lake michigan shoreline in emmet county at times other than in the summer.in the summer primarily july and august,many people walk that shoreline,up to the ordinary high water mark the people who walk the shoreline on or near the property are generally neighboring landowners or the renters of homes on that land,family,or friends.

taxpayers grant of conservation easements to ltc 
little traverse conservancy is a michigan nonprofit organization that is exempt from federal income tax under c.id.at.its purpose is to protect the natural integrity and scenic beauty of northern michigan for the enjoyment of future generations.id.it accomplishes this purpose by acquiring property by contribution or purchase and by educating the public.id.
the ltc actively sought contributions of conservation easements in the area along the corridor and the lake michigan shoreline.the executive director of the ltc testified that contributions of conservation easements to the ltc conservation trust trust were actively sought in the early because the ltc felt overdevelopment threatened the natural scenic beauty of the lake michigan bluffs,the return of bald eagles to the lake michigan shoreline,and survival of plant species like the lake huron tansy and pitcher thistle along the area beaches.id.as the tax court explained,ltc believes that northern michigan is relatively undeveloped as compared with other parts of the state.significant and abundant natural resources are present in northern michigan,particularly around and the nearby shoreline,and ltc believes that these resources may be threatened by overdevelopment.id.at.it was ltc goal to balance a development of northern michigan with a development of new nature preserves and the protection of areas for wildlife and scenic views.id.
a typical contribution of a conservation easement to the ltc also includes a cash contribution to help ltc to monitor and enforce its terms.ltc does not on an annual basis formally monitor each conservation easement that it receives to ensure compliance but occasionally monitors them informally.ltc maintains a file for each of these easements.id.at.
taxpayers made three contributions of conservation easements to the ltc trust one each in,and.the conservation easement is not at issue here the and contributions of conservation easements are at issue and are described below.
conservation easement 
on december,taxpayers signed a document entitled conservation easement which was recorded at the register of deeds for emmet county the following day.ltc prepared the deed contemporaneously with taxpayers contribution of the conservation easement in perpetuity to the ltc trust.at the same time,taxpayers also contributed to the ltc trust.id.at.
the conservation easement covers the northernmost feet of shoreline and all portions landward for feet from the ordinary high water mark of taxpayers property.id.at.it provides that the encumbered property contains a relatively intact forested ecosystem,providing wildlife habitat,as well as habitat for old growth white pine trees lake front property in and around the area of the encumbered property is under intense development pressure,thereby causing or at least exacerbating the impact on rare and protected flora and fauna of the area such as the piping plover and huron tansy taxpayers and ltc recognize the scenic and natural resource values of the property and share the common intention to conserve these values in perpetuity by the conveyance of a conservation easement to protect the use or development of the property for any purpose or in any manner which would conflict with the maintenance of these scenic and natural resource values and taxpayers intend to convey to ltc the right to preserve and protect the scenic and natural resource values of the property in perpetuity.id.quoting conservation easement at.

ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the tax court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error,and its application of the law to the facts is reviewed de novo.ekman comm r,cir.this appeal arises from taxpayers challenge of deficiency determinations by the commissioner.the commissioner deficiency determinations are presumed correct and the taxpayer bears the burden of proving otherwise.id.moreover,d eductions are a matter of legislative grace,and the taxpayer must satisfy the specific statutory requirements claimed to reduce a tax liability.id.at.
statutory framework 
under a,a deduction is allowed for a charitable contribution made during the tax year.as to charitable gifts of property,a taxpayer is generally not allowed to take a deduction if the charitable gift consists of less than the taxpayer entire interest in that property.f.there is an exception to this general rule for a qualified conservation contribution.f b iii.
the definition of a qualified conservation contribution is provided in section h.to constitute a qualified conservation contribution,the taxpayer must show that three requirements have been satisfied t he real property is a qualified real property interest the donee is a qualified organization and the contribution is exclusively for conservation purposes.turner comm r,wl citing h and g.only the third requirement is at issue in this appeal.
this third requirement,that a contribution is made exclusively for conservation purposes,is met if the taxpayer shows that the contribution satisfies h and.id.as to section h,subsection h a ii is at issue here.it defines conservation purpose as the protection of a relatively natural habitat of fish,wildlife,or plants,or similar ecosystem.h a ii.see also.d ii.the treasury regulations implementing this section further provide that 
i in general.the donation of a qualified real property interest to protect a significant relatively natural habitat in which a fish,wildlife,or plant community,or similar ecosystem normally lives will meet the conservation purposes test of this section.the fact that the habitat or environment has been altered to some extent by human activity will not result in a deduction being denied under this section if the fish,wildlife,or plants continue to exist there in a relatively natural state.
ii significant habitat or ecosystem.significant habitats and ecosystems include,but are not limited to,habitats for rare,endangered,or threatened species of animal,fish,or plants 
iii access.limitations on public access to property that is subject to a donation under this paragraph d shall not render the donation.
as to section h,subsection h a is at issue here.it provides that a contribution shall not be treated as exclusively for conservation purposes unless the conservation purpose is protected in perpetuity.h a.the treasury regulations implementing h a provide that 
in general.to meet the requirements of this section,a donation must be exclusively for conservation purposes.see paragraphs c qualified donee and g through g ii of this section conservation purpose enforceable in perpetuity 
inconsistent use a deduction will not be allowed if the contribution would accomplish one of the enumerated conservation purposes but would permit destruction of other significant conservation interests however,this requirement is not intended to prohibit uses of the property,if,under the circumstances,those uses do not impair significant conservation interests.
inconsistent use permitted.a use that is destructive of conservation interests will be permitted only if such use is necessary for the protection of the conservation interests that are the subject of the contribution a donor may continue a preexisting use of the property that does not conflict with the conservation purposes of the gift.
tax court decision 
the tax court held that taxpayers contributions of the and conservation easements were qualified conservation contributions under h.glass,at.it observed that the commissioner had conceded that the first and second requirements of h were satisfied,id.at,and concluded that taxpayers met the third the contribution be exclusively for conservation purposes because they protect a relatively natural habitat of wildlife and plants,as required under h a ii,and are exclusively for conservation purposes,as required under h.id.at.
discussion 
the sole issue on appeal is whether the tax court erred when it held that taxpayers and contributions of conservation easements satisfied the third requirement of h.
the commissioner first argues that the tax court construction of reg.d i and ii was erroneous because it read the word significant out of the treasury regulation and thus erred in concluding that the encumbered property satisfied h a ii.the commissioner next argues that the tax court findings that the encumbered property fell within reg.d i were clearly erroneous because the encumbered property was too small,allowed taxpayers too many retained rights,and failed to restrict the building rights of neighboring property owners thus precluding the easements from serving their stated conservation purpose.finally,using these same arguments,the commissioner asserts that the tax court erred in finding that the easements conservation purpose was protected in perpetuity and that the deductions were exclusively for conservation purposes as required under h a and reg.e,g.
for the reasons stated below,we affirm the decision of the tax court.
significant relatively natural habitat under h a ii 
the tax court examined taxpayers claim that the conservation easements protect a relatively natural habitat of wildlife or plants thus falling within the acceptable conservation purposes of h a ii.glass,at.it observed that the treasury regulation implementing that statutory provision provides that a qualified real property interest will meet the conservation purpose test,and thus satisfy the third requirement,if that interest is contributed to protect a significant relatively natural habitat in which a fish,wildlife,or plant community,or similar ecosystem,normally lives.id.quoting reg.d i.the tax court further observed that the regulation lists examples of significant habitats and ecosystems and expressly includes habitats for rare,endangered,or threatened species of animals,fish,or plants.id.citing reg.d ii.
contrary to the commissioner arguments,the tax court properly construed the plain language of h a ii and reg.d i and ii.while it is true that the relatively natural habitat where a wildlife or plant community normally lives must be significant to meet the conservation purposes test,habitats for rare,endangered,or threatened species of animals or plants are expressly recognized as significant.reg.d i and ii.moreover,it was not error for the tax court to give the words habitat and community their plain meaning.the tax court properly observed that a habitat denotes the area or environment where an organism or ecological community normally lives or occurs or the place where a person or thing is most likely to be found.id.at quoting american heritage dictionary of the english language ed and citing.it also properly observed that a community may be defined in this context as a group of plants and animals living and interacting with one another in a specific region under relatively similar environmental conditions.id.at quoting american heritage dictionary of the english language.
findings as to significant relatively natural habitat 
we now consider whether the tax court clearly erred when it found that the encumbered property constituted a habitat for threatened species of animals and plants,bald eagles,lake huron tansy,and pitcher thistle.we begin with the tax court findings and then discuss the commissioner arguments.
the tax court found that ltc executive director,thomas bailey,and taxpayer susan glass,testified credibly that the encumbered property is a famous roosting spot for bald eagles that the conservation easements establish a proper place for the growth and existence of lake huron tansy and pitcher thistle that bailey had toured the property on various occasions and had concluded that the habitat on the encumbered shoreline is a proper and normal environment for lake huron tansy,pitcher thistle,and bald eagles that the staff of ltc had seen lake huron tansy growing on the property and that susan glass had observed lake huron tansy growing on the property and that she has regularly seen bald eagles there as well.id.at.the tax court also found,based on evidence in the record,that both lake huron tansy and pitcher thistle are considered threatened species which are worthy of special attention towards the goal of preservation and that ltc has agreed through the conservation easements to attempt to preserve those species by giving them that special attention.id.contrary to the commissioner arguments on appeal,these findings are supported by the record.
the tax court next found that the encumbered shoreline property fell within the plain meaning of the words habitat and community.id.at.in its natural undeveloped state,it is a relatively natural habitat for a community of lake huron tansy,of pitcher thistle,and of bald eagles,among other species of plants and wildlife.id.this finding is supported by bailey testimony.
based on these findings,the tax court concluded that the and conservation easements protect and preserve significant natural habitats by limiting the development or use of the encumbered shoreline.id.it held that taxpayers had proved that their contributions of the conservation easements were for a conservation purpose under section h,specifically,section h a ii.id.
the commissioner first argues that,absent testimony that lake huron tansy,pitcher thistle,or bald eagles were actually sighted living on the encumbered property at the time of the donation,the tax court erred when it found h a ii satisfied.this argument fails for two reasons.first,it ignores glass testimony that she had observed bald eagles and lake huron tansy on the encumbered property.second,neither the plain language of the regulations nor the plain meaning of the words habitat or community support the commissioner argument.although under k,a private letter ruling can not be used as precedent,a recent ruling provides persuasive authority for refuting the commissioner argument.see at,wl,observing that,similar to the conservation easements at issue here,the conservation easement there is the actual habitat for numerous plants and animal species,and is potentially the habitat for several endangered,threatened or rare plant and animal species and thus qualified as a donation for the protection of an environmental system under h a ii.
the commissioner next argues that,even if lake huron tansy,pitcher thistle,or bald eagles did inhabit the encumbered property,the terms of the and conservation easements undermine their stated conservation purpose because the encumbered property is too small,taxpayers reserved rights are too great,and there is no limit on building on neighboring properties.thus,the commissioner argues,the tax court erred in finding that the easements satisfied the conservation purpose test of h a ii.we begin our analysis of this argument by examining the relevant terms of the easements and then address the commissioner arguments that the terms of the easements undermine their stated conservation purpose.
easements terms 
the easements first recognize that development in the area is having a negative impact on rare and protected flora and fauna like the huron tansy as well as wildlife habitat.they then state that their purpose is to conserve plant and wildlife habitat on the property and provide a list of prohibited and restricted list of permitted uses that do not conflict with that stated purpose.finally,they grant to ltc rights necessary to enforce compliance consistent with their stated conservation purpose so as to protect it in perpetuity.each easement also provides that it shall be liberally construed in favor of the purpose of this conservation easement,the ltc,and the conservation and historic preservation easement act,mcl,et ja at,and conservation easements.
i conservation purpose,prohibited and permitted uses 
the stated purpose of both easements is identical to ensure th
