the chesapeake ranch water company chesapeake appeals an order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of the board of commissioners of calvert county,maryland the county in this action seeking protection under a provision of the consolidated farm and rural development act of cfrda,see b west.chesapeake argues that b prohibits the county from providing water service to two new commercial developments presently under construction adjacent to chesapeake service area.finding no merit to chesapeake arguments,we affirm.
a recitation of the facts appears in the opinion of the district court.see chesapeake ranch water bd.of comm rs of calvert county,d.we recount them briefly here.
chesapeake is a nonprofit water association formed in to provide drinking water and fire protection services to citizens in calvert county.in,the county,which under maryland law has plenary authority over water and sewer matters within its borders,see,c,b supp,granted chesapeake authority to provide water service to a subdivision known as chesapeake ranch estates.on three subsequent occasions during and,the county expanded chesapeake franchise area to include lots in lusby town square,a subdivision adjacent to chesapeake ranch estates.
in response to substantial growth in calvert county,a number of new developments are being constructed in the county.at issue here are two new developments,the lusby town center and the patuxent business park,which are under construction adjacent to,but not within,chesapeake existing franchise area.in,chesapeake presented a formal offer to the county to provide water service to the new developments.the county rejected the offer.instead,the county resolved to and has begun the process of extending the solomons water facility to provide service to the new developments.the solomons facility is located approximately two miles from the developments.
alleging that the county proposed extension of the solomons facility violates both b and maryland state law,chesapeake filed this action seeking broad injunctive relief to prevent the county from continuing with its plan to provide service to the new developments.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the county on the federal claim,ruling that b afforded chesapeake no basis for relief against the county.the court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims,see c west,dismissing those claims without prejudice 
the cfrda is part of the agricultural act of,which congress enacted for the purposes,among others,of improving and protecting farm prices and promoting agricultural development.see,at,reprinted in.section of the cfrda specifically authorizes federal loans to nonprofit water service associations to promote the conservation,development,use,and control of water to assist farmers,ranchers,farm tenants,and other rural residents.bell arthur water greenville util.comm n,cir quoting a.by including water service to other rural residents as part of an agricultural program,congress intended to reduce peruser cost resulting from the larger base of users,to provide greater security for the federal loans made under the program,and to provide a safe and adequate supply of water.id.at.
congress sought to protect federally indebted,nonprofit water associations from competitive facilities,which might otherwise be developed with the expansion of the boundaries of municipal and other public bodies into an area served by the rural system,at,at.accordingly,congress enacted b,which provides 
the service provided or made available through any such association shall not be curtailed or limited by inclusion of the area served by such association within the boundaries of any municipal corporation or other public body,or by the granting of any private franchise for similar service within such area during the term of such loan nor shall the happening of any such event be the basis of requiring such association to secure any franchise,license,or permit as a condition to continuing to serve the area served by the association at the time of the occurrence of such event.
b.to qualify for protection under b,the water association must establish that it is an association within the meaning of the cfrda,it has a qualifying federal loan outstanding,and it has provided water service or made it available to the disputed area.see water dist.city of athens,ohio,cir.
the protection afforded by b is limited to the area in which the association provides or makes available water service and to the time period during which its federal loan is outstanding.see bell arthur,at.additionally,b protects against only certain forms of competitive behavior,including curtailment or limitation of the associations service areas through annexation or through the imposition of conditions for service such as the requirement of a franchise,license,or permit.id.
chesapeake argues that summary judgment in favor of the county was inappropriate for three reasons the county plan to provide service to the new developments would limit or curtail chesapeake service by invading a location to which chesapeake has made service available the county plan to tap into the aquifer from which chesapeake presently draws its water supply would limit or curtail chesapeake ability to serve its existing franchise area and disputed issues of material fact existed as to the scope of chesapeake franchise area.we address each of these arguments in turn.
chesapeake first argues that b affords it the exclusive privilege of providing water service to the new developments.as a threshold matter,we note that neither party disputes that chesapeake is a qualifying association under the statute.nor do the parties question that chesapeake has a qualifying federal loan outstanding.therefore,this issue turns on whether chesapeake has provided or made available water service to the new developments.
the district court ruled that because the new developments were not within the geographic boundaries of the franchise area formally granted to chesapeake by the county,b did not afford chesapeake the exclusive privilege of serving the new developments.the court reasoned that chesapeake could not use the protections of b offensively to expand the geographic boundaries of its franchise area the statute could only be used defensively to protect the territory already within its franchise area.see chesapeake ranch water,d at.chesapeake contends that the district court interpreted b too narrowly.because the locations of the new developments were adjacent to chesapeake existing franchise area,and because chesapeake was physically capable of providing water service to the new developments,chesapeake contends that it had already made available water service to the developments,and thus it was entitled to protection under b from competition by the county.we disagree.
the test for whether a water association has provided or made available water service for purposes of b varies among the courts of appeals.some courts have held that a water association has provided or made available service if it can demonstrate the physical capability to provide service to the area within a reasonable time,and the legal right under state law to serve the area.see rural water city of sioux,cir sequoyah county rural water dist.town of muldrow,cir focusing primarily on whether water association has proximate and adequate pipes in the ground with which it has served or can serve the disputed customers within a reasonable time.other courts permit an association to prove that it has provided or made available service by demonstrating that it has a duty not merely a right under state law to provide service to the disputed area.see north alamo water supply city of san juan,cir per curiam glenpool util.servs.auth.creek county rural water dist,cir holding that water association had made available water service by virtue of its line adjacent to the property and its responsibilities to applicants within its territory emphasis added the test articulated by the sixth circuit in is the most stringent,requiring a water association to demonstrate that it is physic
