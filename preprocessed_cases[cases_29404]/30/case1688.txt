cameron rose hit an oakland police officer with a folding chair during a confrontation between officers and participants in a teepee vigil on frank ogawa plaza the plaza,and he was arrested about a month later.he was charged with two felony counts arising out of the incident resisting an executive officer and assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer.he was also charged with one misdemeanor count arising out of his subsequent arrest resisting,obstructing,or delaying a peace officer on the charges arising out of the incident,a jury convicted rose of resisting an executive officer and acquitted him of felony assault,instead convicting him of the lesser included offense of misdemeanor assault on a peace officer under section,subdivision c.on the charge arising out of rose subsequent arrest,the jury was unable to return a verdict,and a mistrial was declared.
on appeal,rose argues that the trial court improperly denied his pitchess motion for discovery of the personnel files of several police officers denied his motion to compel the prosecution to run rap sheets of the officers who testified against him and imposed a probation condition prohibiting him from entering the plaza and a small area around it.we reject rose claims,except we conditionally reverse the judgment and remand for limited further pitchess proceedings involving one officer.
factual and procedural history 
in late november,the city of oakland issued a permit authorizing a teepee vigil on the plaza.the vigil was closely associated with occupy oakland,a protest movement.the permit authorized placing a teepee on the plaza,but it also prohibited a variety of activities,such as serving food and storing items.the permit was renewed a number of times over the next month,and it was in effect on december.
while in the plaza around on december,captain jeffrey israel noticed that various items,including bedding,clothing,coolers,and chairs,were blocking the walkways.he spoke to naomi reagan,a person associated with the vigil.acting on directions from the chief of police,captain israel informed reagan that all items not allowed by the permit had to be removed by that day.reagan asked for more time to comply,but captain israel insisted that the items had to be gone by.after overhearing the conversation between reagan and captain israel,a group of men,including rose,yelled at captain israel and approached him aggressively.captain israel left,and the men eventually stopped shouting.
around,a group of approximately officers arrived at the vigil area.many unpermitted items were still scattered around,and sergeant bernard ortiz believed this violated the oakland municipal code prohibition against minor encroachments without a permit.he ordered his officers to begin writing citations for the infractions.
one of the officers,officer marcos campos,thought that carly bate,a vigil participant,was violating the oakland municipal code because s ome of her property was protruding onto the walkway of the p laza,even though she began moving it after officers said they were going to start writing citations.she refused to give officer campos her identification or her name and date of birth.bate began to walk away,and officer campos believed she was trying to flee and therefore subject to arrest he tried to handcuff her but was unsuccessful because she was fla il ing her arms.he then felt someone else tug on his arm,and the handcuffs fell to the ground.an officer standing next to officer campos,officer grabbed bate other arm and handcuffed her.
another officer present at the scene,officer patrick gerrans gerrans corroborated officer campos testimony.he testified that he and the other officers had been briefed that the vigil participants had been warned to remove their things from the plaza and that they should cite the participants who refused to comply.he testified that he observed officer campos,who was about six feet away,trying to get bate identification while bate argued with him.officer gerrans saw bate begin to walk away and then saw officer campos grab and hold on to bate,which officer gerrans recognized as a detention.officer gerrans also saw bate begin to move her arms in an attempt to resist being handcuffed.
officer gerrans and sergeant ortiz testified that the confrontation escalated as bate was being restrained.they saw another woman,tiffany tran,intervene in the scuffle between officer campos and bate.they both saw tran grab officer campos from behind,and officer gerrans saw tran grab bate and try to pull her away from officer campos.officer gerrans responded by grabbing tran left arm,and sergeant ortiz responded by grabbing her right arm.another bystander,phillip boswell,then grabbed on to tran and tried to pull her away from the officers.boswell attempted to escape,and sergeant ortiz followed him.
while officer gerrans was still holding tran arm,intending to handcuff her,he was struck from behind.he felt a dull thud to the middle part of his back and a sharp pain near the bottom of his head.he turned around and saw rose pull a steel folding chair toward rose body,and throw it on the ground.officer gerrans testified that when he saw rose with the chair,it became very clear that rose had hit him with it because the impact felt like a large,hard object,not a punch.rose then picked up another identical chair like a baseball player would hold up a bat,like they getting ready to hit a pitch,and he threw it at officer gerrans legs and fled.neither sergeant ortiz nor officer campos,the only other officers present during the incident who testified at trial,witnessed rose attack on officer gerrans.
an arrest warrant was issued for rose,and approximately a month later he was arrested by officer mario bonilla.rose alleged actions during the arrest by officer bonilla formed the basis of the misdemeanor charge of resisting,obstructing,or delaying a peace officer.we do not discuss the facts surrounding the arrest because they are irrelevant to this appeal in light of the mistrial declared on this charge.
three rulings by the trial court two before the trial and one after give rise to rose appeal.first,rose challenges the court denial of his pitchess motion.the pretrial motion requested discovery of information in the personnel files of officers gerrans,bonilla,gerrans,and campos.the court summarily denied the motion as to all the officers except gerrans.it then conducted an in camera review of selected documents from officer gerrans personnel file and determined that none of the documents were subject to disclosure.
rose also challenges the denial of his pretrial motion to compel the prosecution to run a rap sheet for every police witness.although the prosecution acknowledged it had a duty to disclose any material information about an officer criminal history that a rap sheet would reveal,a representative from the alameda county district attorney office testified that the office had an alternative procedure for ensuring that such information was identified and turned over to the defense.the trial court denied rose motion on the basis that the court could not compel the prosecution to obtain information about officers criminal history in a particular manner.
the final ruling rose challenges involves a probation condition.after rose was convicted,the trial court suspended imposition of his sentence and granted probation for five years.in doing so,the court imposed a condition that rose stay out of an area of downtown oakland that includes the plaza and city hall the condition.after rose filed a motion challenging the condition,the court significantly reduced the restricted area but refused to strike the condition entirely because the court found it was necessary for rose successful completion of probation.
rose timely appealed.
discussiona.furtherpitchess proceedings are required as to officer gerrans,but the trial court denial of rose pitchess motion as to the remaining officers was harmless.
rose pitchess motion sought discovery as to prior acts of fabrication misstatement of facts,the fabrication of charges evidence,and the authoring of or acquiescing to false or misleading police reports by officers gerrans,bonilla,gerrans,and campos.the motion also sought discovery as to any acts of aggressive behavior,violence or attempted violence,excessive force or attempted excessive force by officer bonilla and discovery as to acts involving illegal search and seizure by officers and campos.the trial court summarily denied the motion as to all the officers except officer gerrans,concluding that the discovery sought was n ot material.the court granted t he motion for discovery of reports of complaints regarding false reports,fabrication of evidence,et cetera,as to officer gerrans that will sort of sweep up and include any allegations of false arrest,making up charges,things like that,which basically involve dishonesty and it the same thing as fabrication.
in accordance with pitchess procedures,a police records custodian brought to court records from officer gerrans personnel file that the custodian considered responsive to the discovery request.the custodian also provided a declaration that generally described other documents in the personnel file that the custodian considered nonresponsive to the request.after conducting an in camera review of the documents provided,the trial court determined that none of them were subject to disclosure because t hey did fall within the scope of the order.it also ordered that the custodian declaration be filed under seal.
rose argues that the trial court erred by summarily denying his pitchess motion as to the officers other than officer gerrans,and he asks us to independently review the in camera hearing at which the court evaluated the documents selected by the custodian from officer gerrans personnel file.for reasons we explain below,we conclude that any error in the court denial of the pitchess motion as to the officers other than officer gerrans was harmless,and the court properly exercised its discretion in determining that the documents the custodian selected from officer gerrans personnel file were not subject to disclosure.but we can not tell from the record whether the court reviewed the custodian declaration to ensure that the unselected documents were not potentially relevant.accordingly,we remand the matter for the court to conduct such a review.
the procedure for considering pitchess motions.
in pitchess,supra,cal d,our state supreme court held that a criminal defendant can compel discovery of certain relevant information in the personnel files of police officers by making general allegations which establish some cause for discovery of that information and by showing how it would support a defense to the charge or charges against him.warrick superior court cal th.this holding was later codified in sections,and and evidence code sections through.people mooc cal th,mooc see also warrick,at.pitchess and the resulting statutory scheme attempt to balance a criminal defendant due process right to a fair trial with an officer strong privacy interest in his or her personnel records.mooc,at.
to obtain discovery of an officer personnel records,a defendant must file a motion that includes an affidavit establishing good cause for discovery of the records,subd.b.establishing good cause requires that the affidavit propose a defense or defenses to the pending charges and articulate how the discovery sought may lead to relevant evidence or itself may be admissible direct or impeachment evidence citations that would support those proposed defenses.warrick superior court,supra,cal th at.a showing of good cause is a relatively low threshold for discovery.id.at.
if the trial court concludes that good cause is lacking,the motion is summarily denied.see people gaines cal th.but if good cause is found,the court conducts an in camera hearing to review the officer personnel file.the custodian of records must bring all potentially relevant records for the court review mooc,supra,cal th at,be placed under oath people white th,and state for the record whether other documents in the personnel file were deemed irrelevant or otherwise nonresponsive and,if so,why.mooc,at.the court then determines,subject to a variety of limitations and exceptions,whether any of the proffered documents are relevant and should be disclosed.see,subds.a,b.
to enable appellate review,the trial court should make a record of what documents it examined before ruling on the pitchess motion,whether by retaining copies of the documents or identifying them for the record.mooc,supra,cal th at.if the court does not make a record of the documents reviewed in camera or does not review the documents at all,the judgment should be conditionally reversed and the matter remanded for further pitchess proceedings.people gaines,supra,cal th at.
any error in the trial court denial of the motion as to the officers other than gerrans was harmless.
we review the trial court summary denial of rose motion as to the officers other than gerrans for an abuse of discretion.people lewis and oliver cal th.to prevail,rose must establish not only good cause for discovery of the records but also a reasonable probability of a different outcome had the evidence been disclosed.people gaines,supra,cal th at.we conclude that any error in the ruling was harmless under this standard.
in his briefing,rose does not explain why the denial of the motion as to these four officers was prejudicial.instead,he apparently believes that if the denial was erroneous,remand is required for an in camera review of the personnel files.but remand is not automatic whenever a trial court errs by summarily denying a pitchess motion an appellate court may deem the error harmless if,even assuming records favorable to the defense may have been discovered,there is no reasonable probability that the favorable evidence would have affected the trial outcome.see,people samuels cal th,even if trial court erred in summarily denying pitchess request for records of officer initially suspected in one of the crimes charged,such error was harmless in light of the extensive evidence linking defendant to that crime.
we conclude that any error in the trial court denial of the motion as to the officers other than gerrans was harmless.to begin with,the denial of the motion as to officer bonilla was not prejudicial because,as the attorney general points out,his testimony was relevant only to the misdemeanor charge of resisting,obstructing,or delaying a peace officer,and that charge resulted in a mistrial.rose does not argue to the contrary.
the denial of the motion as to officer gerrans also was not prejudicial.rose pitchess affidavit stated that officer gerrans had written a police report in which he corroborated officer gerrans statement that earlier on the day of the incident,rose threatened to kill the officers whole family after learning they were brothers.the affidavit claimed that the discovery sought was relevant to establish that rose did not make any such threat.although we agree with rose general point that pitchessdiscovery may be relevant to issues other than impeachment and may be available even when an officer does not testify,in this instance,impeachment was the only ground upon which discovery of officer gerrans records was sought,and no evidence about the threat was introduced at trial whether officer gerrans lied about the threat turned out to be inconsequential.
similarly,the denial of the motion as to officer was not prejudicial because he did not testify at trial,and the evidence relating to him was of minimal relevance.rose only reason other than impeachment for seeking discovery of officer records was to establish that bate arrest was unlawful,on the theory that officer fabricated a basis to arrest her.it is true that the lawfulness of bate arrest was at issue the jury was instructed that whether officer gerrans was aware or reasonably should have been aware of facts and circumstances suggesting that bate arrest was unlawful could affect whether his attempt to arrest tran was within the lawful scope of his duties an element of both felony charges but officer actions were of minimal relevance in determining the lawfulness of bate arrest.officer campos testified that he was the one who decided to cite bate and then to arrest her once she began to leave.according to officer campos,officer did not talk to bate and did not participate in her arrest until she was uncooperative and officer campos dropped the handcuffs.in addition,officer gerrans could not recall any participation by officer in bate arrest and testified that at the time of the incident he was focused on bate and officer campos.thus,any evidence of previous false arrests by officer would not have borne on whether bate arrest was lawful or whether officer gerrans believed the arrest was lawful.
finally,the summary denial of the motion as to officer campos was also harmless,although we acknowledge this issue is closer.rose pitchess affidavit sought the records of officer campos to impeach him and to establish that he fabricated a basis to arrest bate.officer campos testimony was relevant only to the issue of the lawfulness of bate arrest he did not see anything that tran or rose did.any evidence used to impeach officer campos could conceivably affect the trial outcome only by undermining his testimony about the lawfulness of bate arrest,which the jury was instructed was relevant only to the extent officer gerrans was aware or reasonably should have been aware of facts and circumstances suggesting that bate arrest was unlawful.
officer campos testimony about the lawfulness of bate arrest was not necessary to establish rose guilt,however,in light of officer gerrans testimony.the defense theory was that bate arrest was unlawful because the oakland municipal code did not prohibit personal belongings on the plaza,bate had already started to move her items when officer campos tried to cite her,and bate was under no obligation to provide identification because the penal code allows a thumbprint or signature in lieu of identification.but officer campos testimony did not bear on how to construe the municipal code or penal code,and officer campos conceded that bate was carrying items when he tried to cite her.nor was his testimony needed to establish that officer gerrans was acting within the lawful scope of his duties.rather,officer gerrans testimony alone sufficed to establish probable cause for arresting tran officer gerrans saw officer campos attempt to cite bate,saw bate attempt to leave and then resist officer campos attempt to handcuff her,and saw tran grab both bate and officer campos.under these circumstances,we conclude that a more favorable verdict was not reasonably probable even if officer campos testimony had somehow been discredited.
remand is required for the limited purpose of reviewing the declaration of the police custodian of records.
rose requests that we review the transcript of the in camera hearing on officer gerrans records to determine whether the trial court complied with the procedures required under mooc,supra,cal th and whether it erred by finding there were no relevant documents to disclose.the attorney general does not oppose the request.
although the appellate record does not contain the records that the police custodian of records brought to court,the trial court described them in detail at the in camera hearing,and thus the transcript is adequate for purposes of conducting a meaningful appellate review of the determination that the records were not subject to disclosure.people myles cal th.as to these records,the court followed the proper procedures.it swore in the custodian,reviewed the personnel documents provided,and gave a detailed description of each of those documents for the record.we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the documents reviewed were not subject to disclosure.
but we are unable to determine whether the trial court reviewed and evaluated the custodian declaration about the documents that were not brought to court.under mooc,t he custodian should be prepared to state in chambers and for the record what other documents or category of documents not presented to the court were included in the complete personnel record,and why those were deemed irrelevant or otherwise nonresponsive to the defendant pitchess motion.mooc,supra,cal th at.in addition,if it is not readily apparent from the nature of the documents that they are nonresponsive or irrelevant to the discovery request,the custodian must explain his or her decision to withhold them.absent this information,the trial court can not adequately assess the completeness of the custodian review of the personnel files,nor can it establish the legitimacy of the custodian decision to withhold documents contained therein.people guevara th.
here,some of the records not brought to court are described in the custodian declaration in a manner that leaves us unable to conclude that they were necessarily nonresponsive to rose pitchess motion.since the record does not reflect that the trial court reviewed the declaration or inquired into why these records were deemed nonresponsive,we conclude that we must conditionally reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.see people guevara,supra,th at conditionally reversing and remanding where record did not show that the trial court actually reviewed the list of records deemed irrelevant submitted in support of the custodian of record decision to produce no records for the court examination.
b.the trial court refusal to compel the prosecution to run rap sheets of the officer witnesses did not violate due process.
rose argues that his convictions must be reversed because the trial court improperly denied his motion to compel the prosecution to run rap sheets of the officer witnesses.he contends that the court ruling denied him due process under brady maryland brady and under united states supreme court cases invalidating asymmetrical application of the rules of evidence.we disagree with both contentions.
rose motion asked for the felony record,or conduct amounting to moral turpitude,for all police witnesses.at the hearing on the motion,the trial court construed the motion as a request for it to order the district attorney office to run criminal rap sheets of prospective law enforcement witnesses in this matter.the people opposed the motion,and in doing so provided the court with some background for the respective position s of counsel in the form of briefs from a writ proceeding in a different case in which the people challenged an order requiring them to run the rap sheets of the relevant officers.
jeffrey rubin,a member of the alameda county district attorney office brady committee,testified about the office procedures for ensuring that discoverable information about witnesses is turned over to the defense.he explained that the office gather s information from a variety of different sources about police officers and compiles this information in a database that members of the brady committee consult when a prosecutor asks whether discoverable information exists about a particular officer.although rubin agreed that rap sheets are generally within the district attorney office constructive possession and that information from an officer rap sheet is discoverable if it is relevant on the subject of credibility or some other relevant issue,he explained that the office policy was not to run a rap sheet as a matter of course for every officer.he stated that his office believed the mechanism he had described was a more efficient and more comprehensive and more ethical way of ensuring that it get s this information to the d efense,and that mechanism is not having to run a criminal history rap sheet for every officer in every case every time we have to prosecute a case.
the trial court denied rose motion.although the court expressed doubt that the district attorney office procedure was the most efficient way of learning about police officers criminal records and stated it would run the rap sheets if it were up to the court,it characterized the practice described by rubin as a good faith effort by the district attorney office to provide this information.the court ruled that due process did not require it to micromanage the district attorney office exercise of its brady obligation by tell ing it exactly how it ha d to look for the information,by ordering it to run rap sheets.
the prosecution can not be forced to comply with its brady duty to investigate in a particular manner.
rose argues that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to order the prosecution to run the police officers rap sheets because t he prosecution has a duty to obtain the criminal history information contained in the rap sheets under brady,supra,and the district attorney office procedures for acquiring evidence favorable to the defense are inadequate.although we confirm that the prosecution has a duty under brady to learn of material impeachment evidence within its actual or constructive possession,we reject the contention that a defendant can force the prosecution,through a discovery motion,to discharge this duty by running an officer rap sheet.
initially,we observe that rose is not attempting to establish a traditional brady violation,nor could he.there are three components of a true brady violation the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching that evidence must have been suppressed by the state,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice must have ensued.people salazar cal th,quoting strickler greene.here,there is no evidence at issue because rose has failed to show that any of the testifying officers have a criminal history.mere speculation that such information might exist and might not have been disclosed is insufficient to establish a violation of brady.see people mena cal th,brady merely serves to restrict the prosecution ability to suppress evidence rather than to provide the accused a right to criminal discovery,italics in original.and since rose has not shown that any such information exists,he has necessarily failed to show that it was favorable to him,that it was suppressed,or that he suffered any prejudice.
rather than asserting a traditional brady claim,rose instead argues that the trial court wrongly denied his motion because he was entitled to compel the prosecution to comply with its brady duty to investigate possible exculpatory or impeachment evidence in a particular manner by running the officers rap sheets.we are not convinced.
a prosecutor duty under brady,supra,has been summarized by our state supreme court.in brady,the united states supreme court held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.citation.the high court has since held that the duty to disclose such evidence exists even though there has been no request by the accused citation,that the duty encompasses impeachment evidence as well as exculpatory evidence citation,and that the duty extends even to evidence known only to police investigators and not to the prosecutor citation in order to comply with brady,therefore,the individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government behalf in the case,including the police.citations.people salazar,supra,cal th at see also in re brown cal th,prosecution has duty under brady to learn of information that is readily available to it.conversely,a prosecutor does not have a duty to disclose exculpatory or impeachment evidence or information to a defendant unless the prosecution team actually or constructively possesses that evidence or information.thus,information possessed by an agency that has no connection to the investigation or prosecution of the criminal charge against a defendant is not possessed by the prosecution team,and the prosecutor does not have the duty to search for or to disclose such material.in re steele cal th.
the prosecution in this case therefore had a duty under brady,supra,to learn of any material impeachment information about the officer witnesses that was within the prosecution constructive possession.in general,impeachment evidence has been found to be material where the witness at issue supplied the only evidence linking the defendant to the crime,citations,or where the likely impact on the witness credibility would have undermined a critical element of the prosecution case,citations.people salazar,supra,cal th at.although rap sheets themselves are not discoverable people santos th,some information about a witness criminal history that is included on a rap sheet may meet brady standard of materiality depending on the circumstances of a given case.see,people little th,prosecution has duty under brady to disclose the felony convictions of all material prosecution witnesses if the record is reasonably accessible.we need not decide here whether such information about an officer witness is necessarily within the prosecution constructive possession because the prosecution conceded both that it had constructive possession of information on rap sheets and that it had a corresponding duty of disclosure.
even when material information is within the constructive possession of prosecutors,brady,supra,does not empower a defendant to compel the precise manner by which prosecutors carry out their duty to learn of it.the trial court here declined to order the prosecution to run the officer witnesses rap sheets,but it did not deny that rose was entitled to discovery of the information sought.rose argues that the court abused its discretion because there was no showing that the district attorney procedure is an adequate alternative means of obtaining the information contained in the rap sheets,but he provides no authority suggesting such a showing is required district attorneys need some mechanism for ensuring that they learn of brady material within their constructive possession.see giglio united states,recognizing prosecutors burden to learn of information within their constructive possession and noting that procedures and regulations can be established to carry that burden and to insure communication of all relevant information on each case to every lawyer who deals with it.but the choice of that mechanism is within district attorneys broad discretionary powers in the initiation and conduct of criminal proceedings,which extend from the investigation and gathering of evidence relating to criminal offenses citation,through the crucial decisions of whom to charge and what charges to bring,to the numerous choices the prosecutor makes at trial regarding whether to seek,oppose,accept,or challenge judicial actions and rulings.people eubanks cal th.as such,that choice generally is not subject to supervision by the judicial branch.people birks cal th.rose fails to persuade us that the court erred in declining to compel the prosecution to run the officers rap sheets.
although we conclude that defendants can not use discovery motions to compel prosecutors to run rap sheets,we point out that prosecutors who investigate witnesses criminal histories through mechanisms other than running rap sheets risk a future brady challenge if favorable information is later uncovered that would have been revealed on a rap sheet.prosecutors have the discretion to learn of evidence favorable to the defense through the methods they consider to be appropriate,but a brady claim may lie if a defendant is prejudiced because a prosecutor failed to obtain favorable evidence that was readily available by running a rap sheet.and this will be true regardless whether the prosecutor acted in good faith or actually knew about the evidence that was not disclosed.kyles whitley,people williams cal th.if the suppression of evidence results in constitutional error,it is because of the character of the evidence,not the character of the prosecutor.united states agurs.
rose has not established that an asymmetrical application of the rules of evidence denied him due process.
before trial,the people moved to be provided with the defense witness list,the witnesses names and dates of birth,and the opportunity to check the witnesses criminal records.characterizing the request as essentially a request for a witness list,and i think we have had that already,the trial court grant
