we must decide whether the availability of judicial review for pattern and practice claims,as discussed in mcnary haitian refugee center,d,extends to a claim brought by goodrich corporation challenging the united states environmental protection agency epa administration of unilateral administrative orders under a of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla.we hold that it does not and,therefore,affirm the district court dismissal of goodrich claim for lack of jurisdiction.
factual and procedural history 
the groundwater basin is an important source of water for san bernardino county,california.the epa has detected groundwater contaminants,including perchlorate and trichloroethylene,in municipal supply wells in the basin.the epa suspects that the source of the contaminants may be a particular site in rialto,california rialto site.the rialto site has been,and is currently,used for industrial and commercial purposes.from approximately to,goodrich operated the site and conducted activities that may have contributed to pollution there.
cercla authorizes the epa to issue unilateral administrative orders uao as may be necessary to protect public health and welfare and the environment,if the epa determines that there may be an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or welfare or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of a hazardous substance from a facility.a.in july,the epa issued a unilateral administrative order concerning the rialto site uao or order.the order directs goodrich and one other previous operator to conduct a remedial investigation for contaminants.the minimum investigation requirements specified by the order include detailed soil sampling and groundwater monitoring.goodrich chose to comply with the order and,accordingly,began the remedial investigation.goodrich alleges that,at all times,it has complied with the order.
on december,goodrich filed a complaint initial complaint against the city of rialto,the rialto utility authority,the united states department of defense,and the epa in federal district court the initial complaint alleged contribution claims against the city,the utility authority,and the department of defense and a due process claim against the epa.the contribution claims alleged that the contaminants originated,in whole or in part,from the activities of the other parties.the due process claim was premised on the allegation that,contrary to the epa position,per chlorate is not a hazardous substance subject to regulation by cercla.the initial complaint alleged that the cercla review provisions,on their face and as administered by the epa,comprise a coercive and fundamentally unfair regime that violates due process.
goodrich settled its contribution claims with the city and the utility authority and therefore withdrew those claims.the department of defense and the epa filed a joint motion for judgment on the pleadings.
the district court denied the motion with respect to the claims against the department of defense but granted the motion with respect to the claims against the epa.the court held that goodrich could bring its contribution claims against other potentially responsible parties prps,including the department of defense,because it met the criteria for bringing suit under both and.the court held that it lacked jurisdiction over goodrich challenge to cercla review provisions concerning the epa administration of uao.specifically,the court held that it is clear that goodrich is attempting to obtain review of the uao issued to it by the epa and that such review is foreclosed by h.the court next held that it had jurisdiction over goodrich facial challenge to cercla review provisions,but rejected that claim on the merits.finally,the district court held that,contrary to goodrich arguments,the initial complaint did not assert a pattern and practice claim.
goodrich did not appeal that dismissal.instead,it filed a first amended complaint complaint.that complaint reiterates the contribution claims against the department of defense and clearly alleges a pattern and practice claim against the epa.the complaint characterizes uaos as emergency orders and alleges that the epa routinely issues emergency orders where no conceivable emergency exists,thereby read ing the emergency requirement entirely out of the statute.the complaint also alleges that the epa obstruct s judicial review of those orders by delaying its discretionary certification of completion.finally,the complaint alleges that the epa control s and manipulat es the record of decision which supports the agency selection of a response action.that record is compiled entirely by epa,and amounts to nothing more than a advocacy document favoring the agency choices.goodrich seeks 
a judicial declaration that epa pattern and practice in administering cercla unilateral administrative orders regime embodied in,c,and h is unconstitutional and,therefore,the uao issued to goodrich is unenforceable because it was issued pursuant to unconstitutional procedures.
the epa filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings.the district court granted the motion,holding that it lacked jurisdiction over the pattern and practice claim because of the provision contained in h.the district court entered a final judgment on the pattern and practice claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.goodrich timely appeals.
discussion 
we review de novo whether subject matter jurisdiction exists.schnabel lui,cir.
statutory framework 
cercla was designed to promote the timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites and to ensure that the costs of such cleanup efforts were borne by those responsible for the contamination.burlington santa fe ry.united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.as its name implies,cercla is a comprehensive statute that grants the president broad power to command government agencies and private parties to clean up hazardous waste sites.key tronic united states,d.the supreme court has described the two primary methods of effecting cleanup under cercla,the federal government may clean up a contaminated area itself,see,or it may compel responsible parties to perform the cleanup,see a a.cooper,aviall,d citation omitted.
under the first option which is not at issue here,the government pays for the cleanup under and then seeks recovery for its costs from prps under.this option has an obvious drawback for the government it must pay first and sue for recovery of costs later often in protracted litigation.the second prps to perform the has its advantages.as the eighth circuit noted,s ince superfund money is limited,congress clearly intended private parties to assume responsibility.solid state circuits,epa,cir.
under the second option which was used here,the epa can issue uaos to compel cleanup and other remedial measures under a that statute provides 
in addition to any other action taken by a state or local government,when the president determines that there may be an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or welfare or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of a hazardous substance from a facility,he may require the attorney general of the united states to secure such relief as may be necessary to abate such danger or threat,and the district court of the united states in the district in which the threat occurs shall have jurisdiction to grant such relief as the public interest and the equities of the case may require.the president may also,after notice to the affected state,take other action under this section including,but not limited to,issuing such orders as may be necessary to protect public health and welfare and the environment.
once the epa issues a uao against a party,that party can obtain judicial review to challenge the validity of the uao.but congress limited the timing of such review in h.that provision,titled timing of review,provides 
no federal court shall have jurisdiction under federal law other than in circumstances irrelevant to this appeal to review any challenges to removal or remedial action selected under section of this title,or to review any order issued under section a of this title,in any action except one of the following enumerated exceptions.
emphases added.as detailed below,the enumerated exceptions permit judicial review of the validity of a uao either before a prp begins complying with the order or after the prp has completed the work required by the order.additionally,as soon as the prp spends dollar one,and regardless of whether it has completed the work,it can bring claims against other prps.the result of the various statutory provisions is that,once the prp begins complying with the order,it can not seek judicial review of the validity of the order until it has completed the work required by the order.but it can always bring a claim against other prps to recover its own costs of complying with the order we turn now to the details of the enumerated exceptions to h.
one of the enumerated exceptions,h,applies if the prp declines to comply with the uao and the epa brings an enforcement action under a.in such an enforcement action,the prp can challenge the validity of the uao as a defense to enforcement.see b.this avenue for judicial review is not without risk,however.section b states 
any person who,without sufficient cause,willfully violates,or fails or refuses to comply with,any order of the president under subsection a of this section may,in an action brought in the appropriate united states district court to enforce such order,be fined not more than for each day in which such violation occurs or such failure to comply continues.
the potential for stiff fines undeniably creates a high risk for a prp that chooses this course of action.but the clause without sufficient cause mitigates that concern substantially.see employers ins.of wausau browner,cir describing a prp options in this scenario.even if a court disagrees with the prp on the merits and orders it to comply with the uao,the court can deny or reduce the fines if it concludes that the prp position was justified even if ultimately unpersuasive.see id.
another of the enumerated exceptions,h,applies once the prp has completed the work required by the uao and seeks reimbursement from the epa under b a.if the epa refuses reimbursement,the prp can bring suit under b b and obtain judicial review of the epa refusal.reimbursement is required if the prp was not responsible under a,see b b c,or if the prp can demonstrate,on the administrative record,that the president decision in selecting the response action ordered was arbitrary and capricious or was otherwise not in accordance with law,b d.it is noteworthy that the latter option applies whether or not the prp was responsible for the contamination that is,reimbursement is appropriate if the order was arbitrary or unlawful,even if the prp was responsible for the contamination.the statute also expressly authorizes recovery of attorney fees and related costs.id.b e.
a third enumerated exception h,applies as soon as the prp begins complying,whether or not it has completed the work required by the uao.once the prp has incurred its own costs,it can seek cost recovery from other prps under a b.united states atl.research,d see also f allowing contribution claims in certain circumstances.indeed,goodrich claims here against the department of defense,the city,and the utility authority are just those types of claims 
in summary,a prp can obtain judicial review of the validity of a uao either before or after it has complied with the order and,as soon as it spends dollar one,it can always seek cost recovery from other prps and obtain judicial review of those claims.it is true that there are some limitations and disincentives attendant to each avenue of judicial review.but congress intentionally chose not to authorize judicial review whenever a prp desired.instead,by specifying the t iming of review in h,congress chose to prioritize the timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites.burlington.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the three situations described above illustrate congress preference for timely cleanup.cercla permits prps to challenge the validity of a uao primarily once the work required by the order is completed.to protect entities from by the epa,the statute also authorizes challenges before work has begun,but only under threat of fines if the challenge is not justified by sufficient cause.b.cercla also allows prps to allocate costs among themselves while the work is underway or after the work has been completed,but that litigation does not delay the cleanup activities.in sum,litigation can delay cleanup activities only if a prp has sufficient cause to challenge the validity of the uao otherwise,litigation during cleanup activities will concern only allocation of costs among prps and will not delay the cleanup activities themselves.congress thus ensured the timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites while,at the same time,protected prps by providing judicial review over agency action at specified stages in the process and judicial review of cost recovery claims as soon as a prp begins to comply with the order.
goodrich facial challenge to the adequacy of the judicial review provisions is not before us directly,because goodrich did not appeal the district court rejection of that claim.that issue nevertheless underlies the question that we face on appeal.in a lengthy,detailed,and opinion,the seventh circuit rejected the same claim.employers ins.of wausau,at.the thrust of the seventh circuit reasoning is that,although cercla judicial review provisions contain some pitfalls and difficult decisions for a prp that faces a uao,there are ample and adequate opportunities to seek meaningful judicial review and,therefore,the statute comes nowhere near violating due process.see id.at the constitutional challenge is baseless as we shall see,the remedies that the superfund law creates against invalid orders fully satisfy the requirements of due process.with that background in mind,we turn to goodrich pattern and practice claim.
pattern and practice claim 
goodrich acknowledges that h bars direct judicial review of uao,because goodrich has has not yet remedial work required by the order.instead,goodrich argues that its pattern and practice claim can proceed despite h.invoking mcnary,d,goodrich argues that its pattern and practice claim does not seek judicial review of uao directly and therefore does not come within the reach of h bar to federal court jurisdiction.as we shall see,the phrase pattern and practice is not an automatic shortcut to federal court jurisdiction.
in mcnary,the supreme court addressed a statute concerning certain amnesty provisions for undocumented aliens.at.those provisions allowed aliens to apply for saw status,id.at which conferred many rights,including employment rights and protection against certain forms of deportation,id.at.but the statute forbade direct judicial review of the agency individual determinations of an alien eligibility for this benefit.id.at.the only provision for judicial review appeared in the context of a deportation proceeding,if one was ever initiated against the alien.id.a group of unsuccessful applicants and a refugee organization brought suit in federal district court.id.at.the plaintiffs did not challenge the denials of their individual applications but,instead,challenged the agency practices as a whole.id.at.they argued that the agency implementation of the program violated due process by,for example,systematically denying the opportunity to challenge evidence,present witnesses,and bring translators to hearings.id.
the court held that section e of the immigration and nationality act,which bars judicial review of individual determinations except in deportation proceedings,did not foreclose a general,collateral challenge to the agency unconstitutional procedures.id.at.the court first emphasized that the text of section e barred judicial review of individual determinations only.id.at.additionally,the court observed that judicial review was subject to review,limited to the administrative record,and available only in the courts of appeals.id.at.those facts supported the court conclusion that congress did not intend to foreclose general collateral challenges,because such challenges generally involve de novo review and require consideration of facts beyond the administrative record of any single saw application,facts that typically must be developed by a federal district court.id.
the court then distinguished its opinion in heckler ringer,d.in ringer,the court declined to entertain a broad challenge to the secretary policy of refusing medicare reimbursement for certain types of surgery before the plaintiffs exhausted their administrative remedies.mcnary,at.the mcnary court emphasized two distinctions.first,the relief sought by the mcnary plaintiffs was not a substantive declaration that they are entitled to saw status but,instead,was only an opportunity for reconsideration under constitutional procedures.id.at.second,the court in ringer had held that the plaintiffs clearly have an adequate remedy in g for challenging in the courts all aspects of the secretary denial of their claims for payment for the surgery.mcnary,at second bracketed alteration in original quoting ringer,at.by contrast,the court held that the mcnary plaintiffs would not as a practical matter be able to obtain meaningful judicial review of their application denials or of their objections to ins procedures.id.at see also id.at describing the judicial review provisions as tantamount to a complete denial of judicial review for most undocumented aliens id.at characterizing the provisions as the practical equivalent of a total denial of judicial review of generic constitutional and statutory claims id.at stating that,if judicial review of the claim were not permitted in this case,meaningful judicial review of many respondents statutory and constitutional claims would be foreclosed.
in reno catholic social services,css,d,the supreme court applied mcnary rule to the plaintiffs challenges to certain agency regulations.the court held that,because the statutory provisions at issue in css were in all relevant respects identical to the statutory provisions at issue in mcnary,the plaintiffs challenges were not barred by statute.id.at.the statutory bar to judicial review,however,is not the only jurisdictional hurdle in the way of the plaintiffs,whose claims still must satisfy the jurisdictional and justiciability requirements that apply in the absence of a specific congressional directive.id.at.in particular,the court held that the plaintiffs must bring claims in a controversy ripe for judicial resolution.id.at quoting abbott labs.gardner,d.
the court acknowledged that,in most circumstances,the same act that would ripen a claim would also bring the claim within the reach of the statutory bar to federal court jurisdiction,thus requiring the plaintiffs to bring their claims at the time envisioned by the statutory scheme of judicial review.id.at.the court distinguished mcnary on the ground that the procedural objections raised by the plaintiffs in mcnary,unlike the claims in css,could receive no practical judicial review within the scheme established by statute.id.at.
we have distilled two guiding principles,ortiz meissner,cir,or clear propositions,ins,cir,from the court decisions in mcnary and css.as we summarized in proyecto san pablo ins,cir,i n order to determine jurisdiction,we first ask whether the claim challenges a procedure or policy that is collateral to an alien substantive eligibility,for which the administrative record is insufficient to provide a basis for meaningful judicial review.quoting ortiz,at see also immigrant assistance project of county fed of labor ins,cir applying the rule,at same.at this first step,we have stressed the importance of meaningful judicial review of agency action.see,ortiz,at more important,unless the district court has jurisdiction,there will be no meaningful opportunity for these plaintiffs to obtain a resolution of this claim.indeed,in,at,we rejected jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claim in part because we held that the claim can be effectively advanced in the context of an appeal from an individual order of deportation.
second,we ask whether plaintiffs claim is ripe.in order for ripeness to be satisfied,plaintiffs must have taken the affirmative steps that they could take before the ins blocked their path.proyecto san pablo,at alterations in original quoting css,at see also,at discussing the ripeness analysis.this step derives directly from the supreme court holding in css that,even if there is no statutory bar to jurisdiction,a plaintiff claim still must satisfy the jurisdictional and justiciability requirements that apply in the absence of a specific congressional directive.at.
although all of the cases we have just summarized involve judicial review provisions within immigration statutes,the principles announced there apply more generally to all statutes that bar judicial review of individual agency actions.for instance,in skagit county public hospital district shalala,cir,we addressed a medicare statute that barred judicial review of individual reclassification decisions.relying on mcnary,the plaintiff sought review of the agency procedures in making an individual determination.id.at.we acknowledged the distinction between a procedural challenge and a substantive challenge.id.at.but we were ultimately unpersuaded that the plaintiff claim could proceed because,even though the plaintiff challenged an agency procedure,the plaintiff sought direct relief from the agency reclassification decision,not the collateral relief sought by the plaintiffs in mcnary.id.at.we were careful to illustrate the distinction between precluded judicial review and permissible judicial review of methods and other collateral issues.id.at.
similarly,in mace skinner,cir,we addressed whether a district court can exercise federal question jurisdiction over a action that challenges conduct arising out of an administrative agency decision,when the relevant statute appears to vest jurisdiction exclusively in the appellate courts.we held that the claims could proceed because the claims,like those asserted in mcnary,are not based on the merits of the plaintiff individual situation,but constitute a broad challenge to allegedly unconstitutional agency practices.id.at.we made clear that the district court lacks jurisdiction over a challenge to the agency actions or conduct in adjudicating a specific individual claim,but district courts do have jurisdiction over a broad challenge to the agency procedures or practices.id.at.
with those principles in mind,we turn to the details of goodrich pattern and practice claim.as discussed above,we first ask whether the claim brings a collateral,procedural challenge to the epa practices,where no meaningful judicial review is otherwise available.if so,we next ask whether the claim is ripe we discern three distinct claims from the allegations in the complaint goodrich alleges that the epa has a pattern and practice of issuing orders beyond its statutory authority,issuing emergency orders when no conceivable emergency exists refusing to certify completion of the work required by a uao,even though the work has,in fact,been completed,so as to delay judicial review and controlling the record of decision and manipulating it to present a advocacy document favoring the agency choices.we will address those allegations in turn.
epa statutory authority to issue uaos 
goodrich allegation that the epa routinely issues orders beyond its statutory authority is decidedly substantive.true procedural challenges confront an agency methods or procedures and do not depend on the facts of any given individual agency action.in mcnary,for instance,the plaintiffs challenge to the agency refusal,as a matter of policy,to allow applicants to present witnesses or bring translators did not depend on the merits of any given individual application the due process violation undermined the agency entire system of adjudication.here,by contrast,whether or not a uao exceeds the epa statutory authority necessarily depends on factual considerations unique to that uao,specifically,whether the issuance of the particular uao in question met the substantive requirements of the statute.compare ortiz,at holding that the
