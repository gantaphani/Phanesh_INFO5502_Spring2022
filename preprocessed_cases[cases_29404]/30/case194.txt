background 
morgan,the central facility in new york city,is a two million square foot operation occupying two city blocks in midtown manhattan and employing people.the main post office,james farley station farley,is nearby and connected by tunnel.
on october,the centers for disease control and prevention cdc confirmed the presence of bacillus anthracis,or anthrax,in several letters that had been sent by mail more than four weeks earlier to nbc studios and to the new york post.anthrax spores are known to cause an acute infectious disease in humans if they enter the body through an open wound,cut,or mucous membrane such as the mouth or nose.alerted by the cdc,the usps conducted an investigation and determined that the letters had entered the united states postal system in trenton,new jersey and were processed on september,through one or more of the delivery bar code sorting dbcs machines at morgan.
two days after the cdc alert,the usps started testing at morgan and certain other postal facilities in new york.private environmental consultants collected and tested hundreds of environmental samples.results received several days later indicated the presence of anthrax in samples taken from four dbcs machines on the third floor of the southern portion of morgan.these four machines were taken out of service,and the area around them was sealed.additional testing the next day implicated a fifth adjacent machine,which was immediately taken out of service as well.
on october,the cdc provided antibiotics,gloves,and face masks to more than postal employees at morgan,farley,and various other manhattan postal facilities.at this than five weeks after the contaminated letters had passed postal employee in new york had reported any kind of health problem.
on the same day october,plaintiffs served the usps,the united states environmental protection agency epa regional administrator,and the united states attorney general with a notice of intent to file an action against the usps under the citizen suit provision of rcra,a b,which permits civil suits against any person or entity,including the federal government,who has contributed or who is contributing to the past or present handling,storage,treatment,transportation,or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.id.on october,plaintiffs filed a complaint pursuant to rcra and state law,seeking inter alia a declaration that the usps handling of the anthrax contamination was in violation of rcra and the new york state environmental conservation law,an injunction against the continued operation of morgan pending a court determination that it was free of anthrax,an order requiring testing at various mail facilities,and an order permitting plaintiffs to inspect morgan as well as an award of costs,including attorneys fees and expert witness fees.
between november and november,cleanup and decontamination work was conducted at morgan hours a day by approximately employees of an environmental contractor hired by the usps.this work was performed in cooperation with the cdc under the supervision of a monitoring consultant.the contaminated area was sealed off and isolated with a plastic barrier.
while the cleanup was ongoing,plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to compel the usps to close morgan completely for a more comprehensive decontamination,and to force testing for anthrax at farley and various other postal facilities downstream from morgan in the mail delivery system.at a preliminary injunction hearing held on november,experts gave conflicting estimates of the danger level presented by the processing of letters at morgan,and of the efficacy of the cleanup effort mounted by the usps.
in a ruling issued at the conclusion of the hearing on november,and subsequently clarified in a november,published order,the district court granted the motion for testing at farley,but declined to shut down morgan,finding that there is no imminent and substantial danger present.smith potter smith i,d.the court noted that no postal worker at morgan had come down with the disease in the weeks between the transit of the contaminated letters and the start of the cdc investigation,and credited testimony from stephen ostroff,the chief epidemiologist for the cdc infectious diseases center and the person in charge of the federal government anthrax investigation in new york,that the amount of anthrax tracked through morgan does not continue to pose an ongoing public health risk.id.at.
after the hearing,the usps finished the cleanup and took samples for testing.the only sample that tested positive for anthrax was taken from one of the five suspect dbcs machines.it was immediately sealed off and recleaned.afterward,all tests for anthrax at morgan were negative.the usps provided the district court and the plaintiffs with a full report of the testing at both morgan and farley.all told,the investigation and cleanup of the anthrax there cost over million.
on january,the usps executed an action memorandum which provided that its actions at morgan had been undertaken pursuant to section of cercla,which authorizes the postmaster general,under authority delegated by the president of the united states pursuant to executive order,to conduct removal actions for the cleanup and removal of hazardous substances,pollutants,and contaminants.the usps then published a notice in two new york city newspapers that the administrative record for the cercla removal action would be available for review,and that usps would accept public comment on this record for a period of days.several days later,the government moved pursuant to.b to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that their claims were precluded by h of cercla,h,which bars federal jurisdiction in suits challenging certain ongoing cercla removal actions for hazardous substances,pollutants,or contaminants plaintiffs opposed the motion on the ground that the usps actions at morgan could not be a cercla removal action because the usps lacked authority over emergency removal actions.
the district court granted the motion to dismiss,relying largely on its earlier factual findings.smith potter smith ii,d.plaintiffs appealed.
