plaintiffs filed a complaint in district under the administrative procedure act the apa,arguing that approval by the environmental protection agency the epa of the state of iowa d lists violated several aspects of the clean water act the cwa.the district court dismissed the complaint.we affirm.
statutory and regulatory background 
the cwa requires each state to establish water quality standards for bodies of water within the state boundaries.a c.to do so,a state first designates the use or uses of a particular body of water,water supply,recreation,see,and then designates the water quality criteria necessary to protect that designated use,id.the water quality standards comprise designated uses water quality criteria defining the amounts of pollutants that the water can contain without impairment of the designated uses and requirements,which apply to bodies of water whose quality is better than required.c a.
section d of the cwa requires that each state,after establishing its water quality standards,compile a list of waters,a d list,that do not meet those standards.d.in creating its d list,a state must assemble and evaluate all existing and readily available water data and information.b.the relevant data and information include the state b report and its report.id.b i,iv.a b report is a water quality assessment report regarding all navigable waters within the state that each state must submit to the epa pursuant to cwa b.b.the epa compiles,analyzes,and transmits these b reports to congress.id.b.a report is a water quality assessment report regarding the navigable waters within the state that will fail to meet water quality standards without limitation of nonpoint of pollution.id.a.
along with the d list,the state must submit,inter alia a description of the methodology used to develop the list a description of the data and information used to identify waters a rationale for any decision not to use any existing and readily available data and information for certain categories of water and a ny other reasonable information requested by the regional administrator.b.since,states have been required to submit a d list to the epa every two years states were not required,however,to submit lists in.see revision to the water quality planning and management regulation listing requirements.the epa must approve or disapprove the state d list within thirty days of its submission.id.d.if the epa disapproves a d list,the epa must establish its own list for the state within thirty days of the date of disapproval.id.
for each water on the d list,the state must establish total maximum daily loads each a tmdl of certain pollutants that the water can sustain without exceeding water quality standards.d c defining pollutant.the tmdl includes pollutants from both point sources and nonpoint sources,as well as a margin of safety.g i.the epa must review the state tmdls,and if the epa disapproves any particular tmdl,the epa itself must establish the tmdl.d.
starting with the states reporting requirements,the epa recommended that each state submit an integrated report that comprised the state b report and d list.robert wayland iii,integrated water quality monitory and assessment report guidance,report guidance.epa guidance recommended that the integrated report designate bodies of water as belonging to one of five categories,which the epa specified as 
attaining the water quality standard and no use is threatened.
attaining some of the designated uses no use is threatened and insufficient or no data and information is available to determine if the remaining uses are attained or threatened.
insufficient or no data and information to determine if any designated use is attained.
impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses but does not require the development of a tmdl.
tmdl has been completed.
b.other pollution control requirements are reasonably expected to result in the attainment of the water quality standard in the near future.
impairment is not caused by a pollutant.
the water quality standard is not attained.the water is impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses by a pollutant s,and requires a tmdl.
report guidance.the epa slightly revised and repeated this recommendation for reports.see epa,guidance for assessment and reporting requirements pursuant to sections d and b of the cwa july,report guidance.because category would not be considered a part of the d list,epa guidance advised that waters that were impaired,but not impaired by a pollutant,should be omitted from the states d lists.see id.as discussed below,plaintiffs contend that the cwa does not allow such a distinction and that waters that are impaired,but not impaired by a pollutant,must be included on iowa d list.
factual and procedural background 
in,the sierra club filed a complaint alleging that the epa had not carried out its duty to approve or disapprove iowa d list.in,a consent decree arising from that complaint provided that the epa had approved part of the d list,disapproved part,and created a final d list.the consent decree required that tmdls be established over a period pursuant to a schedule agreed by the parties.in evaluating compliance with the tmdl schedule,the epa could consider tmdls established by iowa and approved by the epa,tmdls established by the epa,and impaired waters and pollutants the epa determined do not need tmdls.the consent decree,which is not directly at issue here,contemplated that water bodies might be removed from future d lists as provided by the cwa and epa regulations.
in,iowa passed its credible data law,iowa code,which limited the data iowa considers when creating its draft d list to data iowa considers credible.id.c.the credible data law provides,inter alia,that iowa will presume data over five years old not to be credible.id.the epa informed iowa that the restrictions of the new law were inconsistent with the cwa mandate to evaluate all data and that the epa would be reviewing iowa list without applying the credible data law.iowa,nevertheless,followed its credible data law when preparing its d lists.
on december,iowa submitted its draft list to the epa,along with a summary of comments it had received on the draft list and a description of the methodology used to compile the list.iowa draft list omitted a large number of waters that had been on the final d list.iowa rationale for omitting many of the waters was the insufficiency of data,a rationale iowa considered a flaw in the original,analysis.iowa omitted other waters because new data indicated the cause of the impairment was flow or habitat alteration,which were not considered pollutants.after reviewing iowa d list,the epa approved the list in part and disapproved the list in part.the epa approved the omissions of waters,having concluded that iowa provided sufficient rationale for the exclusions.the epa disapproved,however,the omissions of twenty waters.after a public comment period,the epa added eighteen of the twenty waters to the final d list.
on may,iowa submitted its draft list.waters were removed for reasons including new data showing lack of impairment and the establishment of a tmdl.the epa again approved the list in part and disapproved the list in part.the epa determined that fourteen new waters should be added to the list and that six waters included on the list but not included on the draft list should not have been removed.after a public comment period,the epa added seventeen of the twenty waters to the list.as a result,iowa d list does not include a number of waters that were included on iowa d list.because the rationales supporting omission of numerous waters from the list were originally forwarded as reasons for delisting in,we refer to the final and lists together as the d list.
on august,plaintiffs filed a complaint under the apa challenging the epa approval of iowa d list,seeking a declaratory judgment and an order to set aside the epa approval of the d list.the epa would then be required,plaintiffs argue,to prepare a d list that complies with the law.after considering the parties briefs on the merits,the district court dismissed the complaint.
