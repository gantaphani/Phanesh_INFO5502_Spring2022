order on petition for rehearing 
this matter is before the court on appellees petition for rehearing.the panel has voted to grant a limited rehearing to modify some of the language in our panel opinion.the court opinion filed on august,is withdrawn,and an amended opinion is attached to this order.
in october,the forest service approved a project in utah fishlake national forest.utah environmental congress uec,an environmental organization,filed a petition for review,and the district court dismissed the petition and affirmed the project authorization.uec alleges on appeal that the forest service did not properly select and monitor the management indicator species mis that it used to determine the effects of management activities on other species,and did not consider a reasonable range of alternatives to the project.exercising jurisdiction under,we reverse the judgment below and remand to the district court with instructions to vacate the forest service approval of the project.after the district court rendered its decision,our court decided utah environmental congress bosworth,cir uec i.this intervening circuit precedent required the agency to collect quantitative population data on actual mis populations before authorizing a project under the planning regulations,which the forest service used here.
background 
the thousand lakes community forestry initiative project the project is located in wayne county,utah,on the fishlake national forest.a collaboration of timber representatives,environmentalists,politicians,and federal land managers undertook the project to reduce the overall stand densities of the spruce and aspen stands that are at the highest risk of spruce beetle infestation,while maintaining a forested appearance and to provide forest products to resource dependent industries in an economically feasible manner.administrative record vol.i,at ar.the project encompasses timber harvests on acres,with approximately mile of road and activities to minimize erosion and the use of authorized vehicles.no new road building is involved.the project would use salvage removal of unhealthy trees,sanitation removal of dead trees in excess of resource needs for habitat,and commercial thinning removal to reduce overall stand densities.
the forest service manages the fishlake national forest at two different levels.at the first level,the forest service develops the forest plan,which is a broad,programmatic document,accompanied by an environmental impact statement and public review process conducted in accordance with the national environmental policy act nepa.colorado envtl.coal.dombeck,cir.to this end,the forest service adopted the fishlake national forest plan the forest plan in to maintain the fishlake national forest.as part of its substantive responsibilities,the forest plan must provide for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area in order to meet overall objectives.g b.
at the second level,the forest service implements the forest plan by approving with or without modification or disapproving particular projects,such as the thousand lakes community forestry initiative project.dombeck,at.individual projects are also subject to nepa and must comply with the forest plan and the national forest management act nfma.i.
in november,the forest service began preparing an environmental assessment ea of the project.the forest service examined the project potential impact to wildlife,soils,vegetation,and other resources,and it prepared a biological assessment and biological evaluation of impacts to sensitive plant and animal species.in may,the forest service published its ea for the project,and in october,the district ranger issued a finding of no significant impact fonsi and a decision notice approving the project.uec brought an administrative appeal,and the forest service issued a final decision in february that affirmed the district ranger.ar.
uec challenged the forest service approval of the project in federal district court.in september,the district court dismissed uec petition for review and affirmed the agency decision notice and fonsi.uec now appeals the forest service approval of the project on two of the three grounds rejected by the district court.uec alleges that the forest service did not properly select and monitor certain management indicator species and did not consider a reasonable range of management alternatives 
ii.standard of review 
we take an independent review of the agency action and are not bound by the district court factual findings or legal conclusions.olenhouse commodity credit,cir.we review the forest service decision under the administrative procedures act and set aside agency action if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.we give deference to an agency interpretation,especially when that interpretation involves questions of scientific methodology.dombeck,at.in addition,t he agency,not the reviewing court,is entrusted with the responsibility of considering the various modes of scientific evaluation and theory and choosing the one appropriate for the given circumstances.city of bridgeton faa,cir quotation marks and internal citation omitted,cited with approval in custer county action ass garvey,cir.t he court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.citizens to preserve overton park volpe,d.
iii.applicable forest service regulations 
before we proceed to uec separate challenges,we briefly describe the relevant regulations at issue.forest service regulations implement nfma requirement that the government address how forest plans provide for plant and animal diversity.rules enacted in required the forest service to identify and select mis to estimate the effects of each management alternative on fish and wildlife populations.a.the department of agriculture department substantially amended the regulations in november,see,and followed those somewhat confusing amendments with a bewildering series of transitional rules.first,the regulations included a transition provision that initially delayed the application of its substantive provisions to project decisions until november.see d.the department subsequently proposed revisions to the regulations and further extended the transition period for applying the substantive provisions to project decisions.see id.new rules replaced the planning regulations in january.the rules include yet another transition provision with directions for the application of mis.f.at,see generally silverton snowmobile club united states forest,cir describing how t he regulations which implement the nfma have been frequently amended.
under the transition provisions,from november,until the promulgation of final planning regulations,the forest service was directed to consider the best available science in implementing a forest plan.a,d.when the forest service issued its decision notice in october and filed its appellate brief in this court in may,it did not contend that the transition provisions of the regulations applied to the project.the forest service only considered authorization of the project under the rule,those regulations in place prior to the amendments.see.
in a rule j letter filed one week before oral argument,the forest service informed us of the department publication of an interpretative rule in september,see also fed.j.the interpretative rule explained that the regulations rendered the rule inoperative for decisions made after november.the interpretative rule stated that,during the transition period between november and promulgation of a final rule,the forest service should use the best available science under a for project decisions.at.
significantly,and thankfully,the forest service now concedes on appeal that it has waived any argument that the regulations apply.see aples pet.for panel reh g at because we did not raise the issue of the rule until we filed our j letter,this court may reasonably conclude that the government has in this case waived any argument that the rule applies.we appreciate the candor of the agency concession in light of its oral arguments and on appeal and in the the rule.indeed,as the second circuit has noted,the standards of the rules and the transitional rule.forest watch united states forest,cir.like the second circuit case,nothing in the record explains what best available science entails.see also id.declin ing to decide whether work done by the agency under one regime satisfies the demands of another.
thus,we review the forest service obligations under the rule,and code of federal regulations citations used in this opinion unless otherwise noted refer to the edition,which is the last published edition before the amendments.
iv.analysis 
uec claims that the forest service acted arbitrarily,capriciously,and contrary to law by failing to select and monitor management indicator species appropriately and failing to consider a reasonable range of project alternatives.
selection and monitoring of mis under 
to assess habitat viability,the forest service estimates a project effect on certain representative species.
fish and wildlife habitat shall be managed to maintain viable populations of existing native and desired vertebrate species in the planning area.
a in order to estimate the effects of each management alternative on fish and wildlife populations,certain vertebrate invertebrate species present in the area shall be identified and selected as management indicator species and the reasons for their selection will be stated.those species shall be selected because their population changes are believed to indicate the effects of management activities.
a rea in subsection a refers to a planning area,a term mentioned several times in.see id.defining planning area as t he area of the national forest system covered by a regional guide or forest plan.
mis are analogous to the famed canaries once used to monitor air in coal mines.they are a bellwether for other species that have the same special habitat needs or population characteristics,inland empire pub.lands council schultz,cir,and serve as a proxy for determining the effects of management activities on other species.forest guardians united states forest,d.the regulations require that p opulation trends of the management indicator species will be monitored and relationships to habitat changes determined.a.in addition,i nventories shall include quantitative data making possible the evaluation of diversity in terms of its prior and present conditions.id.
to meet the diversity provisions under,the forest plan designates two categories of mis ecological indicator and high interest species.the ecological indicators include five groups of species and one individual species the guild,riparian guild,guild,resident trout,and northern goshawk.a guild is a group of species that exploits the same class of environmental resources in the same way.the forest service selects ecological indicator species according to five criteria affinity for the vegetation type,life cycle keyed to a vegetation type,s ensitivity to habitat change,r elative ease of monitoring,easily recognized and adequate numbers,and being s omewhat representative of other species which use the same vegetation type.ar forest plan final environmental impact statement feis at.
high interest mis include elk,mule deer,bonneville cutthroat trout,and rydberg milkvetch.the forest service chose high interest mis because of their threatened,endangered,or sensitive status,social or economic importance,or high public interest.id.at.uec does not challenge,and we need not examine,the forest service selection of ecological indicator and high interest mis guilds for the project.rather,uec challenges the chosen representatives within these mis guilds.
our recent decision in uec i addressed the forest service mis obligations with regard to the monroe project,another project in the fishlake national forest,and that decision resolves two important issues here.first,uec i makes clear that the regulations anticipate application of to project level as well as plan level management actions.at.as we noted in uec i,this approach is consistent with other circuits.see sierra club martin,cir recognizing that the regulations refer to the formulation of forest plans rather than to specific projects proposed under already enacted forest plan but that the planning process does not end with the forest service approval and continue s throughout the plan existence inland empire pub.lands council,at because any district contained within the boundaries of a forest having a plan would be an area covered by a forest plan,it would also be a planning area governed by regulation.quoting.thus,the forest service obligations under apply to the project.
second,we decided in uec i that the forest service must use actual,quantitative population data to meet mis monitoring obligations under.at.t o effectuate its mis monitoring duties under the language of its regulations,the forest service must gather quantitative data on actual mis populations that allows it to estimate the effects of any forest management activities on the animal population trends,and determine the relationship between management activities and population trend changes.id.at see also martin,at examining a and concluding that i t is implicit that population data must be collected before it can be monitored and its relationship determined.prior to uec i,the forest service contended that it need not conduct of mis in a planning area because it had discretion to assess a project effects on mis using habitat data,population data,or both.see generally andrew orlemann,note,do the proposed forest service regulations protect biodiversity an analysis of the continuing viability of habitat viability analysis,land resources envtl,describing the split among federal circuits as to the adequacy of habitat viability analysis under.
with these requirements in mind,we examine uec challenges to the forest service monitoring of the guild,riparian guild,guild,northern goshawk,and mexican spotted owl.
guild sage grouse as mis 
uec maintains that the forest service did not determine the presence of sage nesters in the project area and did not explain why it chose the sage grouse as the guild sole representative.the forest service concluded,based on a july field survey and unpublished radio telemetry data,that sage grouse are not present in the project area.ar,ar.it also used aerial photos and vegetation mapping to conclude that the project includes no sagebrush habitat.the ea noted that the project road reconstruction would occur along an existing road through potential sage nesting habitat.ar.however,because sage nesters have not been documented along the road and the additional disturbance would involve only or less of total available sagebrush habitat on thousand lakes mountain,effects to sage nesting species are expected to be minimal as a result of implementing the proposed action.id.
we first look to our treatment of the forest service sage grouse monitoring in uec i,as the same forest plan and regulations governed the agency responsibilities for that project.in uec i,the forest service acknowledged that sage grouse were potentially present and referenced unconfirmed sightings in the monroe project area.at.we also recognized that the mis selected for the plan were chosen,in part,due to relative ease of monitoring.id.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.while not all mis designated in the fishlake forest plan are necessarily present within a project area,the forest service must show good faith efforts to confirm the absence or presence of an mis species under.id.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.in uec i,the record reflect ed no attempt by the forest service to confirm the presence of the sage grouse,and we therefore concluded that the agency did not comply with.id.at.
the thousand lakes project on this appeal is governed by the same forest plan as in uec i,and the forest service similarly selected the sage grouse in part due to its r elative ease of monitoring.ar feis at.the agency provides no evidence of any sage grouse population or even a single sighting in the project area.importantly,however,uec does not contest the forest se
