endangered species act 
the panel affirmed the district court summary judgment in favor of the secretary of the department of the interior and other federal officials in an action brought by the defenders of wildlife concerning the possible impacts of the silver state south solar project on the desert tortoise.
plaintiff alleged that defendants violated the requirements of the endangered species act and the administrative procedures act by issuing a biological opinion analyzing the effect of the silver state south solar project on the desert tortoise that was,among other things,arbitrary and capricious.
the panel first rejected plaintiff contention that the biological opinion determination that silver state south would not result in jeopardy to the desert tortoise impermissibly relied upon unspecified remedial measures.the panel held that the biological opinion did not rely on mitigation measures to make its no jeopardy determination and this circuit precedents do not require mitigation measures to be identified or guaranteed when the mitigation measures themselves may be unnecessary.
the panel held that the biological opinion determination that silver state south was not likely to adversely affect the critical habitat of the desert tortoise,which permitted the united states fish and wildlife service to forego an adverse modification analysis,was neither arbitrary nor capricious.
the panel held that the biological opinion failure to address the fish and wildlife service comments to a supplemental environmental impact statement was not arbitrary or capricious because the supplemental environmental impact statement and the biological opinion evaluated substantially different plans.
the panel held that because it could discern the biological opinion reasoning in concluding that silver state south would not have significant edge effects and the record supports this conclusion,the biological opinion consideration of silver state south edge effects was not arbitrary or capricious.the panel further held that the biological opinion did not establish an impermissibly vague trigger for reinitiating formal consultation over silver state south.
the panel concluded that because the biological opinion was neither legally nor factually flawed,the bureau of land management permissibly relied upon the biological opinion in approving of the for silver state south.

ii.the desert tortoise 
the desert tortoise is a reptile native to the mojave and sonoran deserts in southern california,southern nevada,arizona,and the southwestern tip of utah.in,the fws listed the desert tortoise as threatened.see fed.reg.in,the fws divided the entire range of the desert tortoise into six recovery units to conserve the genetic,behavioral,morphological,and ecological diversity necessary for sustainability of the entire desert tortoise population.the fws then designated a total of million acres of land within the six recovery units as the desert tortoise critical habitat.fed.reg.one of the six recovery units,the eastern mojave recovery unit,is at issue here.
iii.the silver state south project 
in,nextlight renewable power,llc submitted applications to the blm for the construction of two solar power facilities,silver state north and silver state south.it proposed to locate both project sites on unincorporated public lands in the ivanpah valley.although the proposed project sites fell within the eastern mojave recovery unit,both were outside the designated critical habitat for the desert tortoise within this recovery unit.however,silver state south would be located within a corridor between silver state north and the lucy gray mountains,which is currently the geographical linkage that provides the most reliable potential for continued population connectivity of the desert tortoise throughout the ivanpah valley.connectivity is the degree to which population growth and vital rates are affected by dispersal and the flow of genetic material between two populations.connectivity promotes stability in a species by providing an immigrant subsidy that compensates for low survival or birth rates of residents and increasing colonization of unoccupied habitat.
in october,the blm approved the application for silver state north but deferred approval of the application for silver state south.the blm explained that the deferral of silver state south was in part due to the higher density of desert tortoise that reside in that portion of the project area,which requires additional wildlife consideration and potentially further consultation with the fws.
in october,the blm issued a draft supplemental environmental impact statement seis that evaluated three alternative layouts for silver state south.in response to the seis,the nevada field office of the fws recommended that the blm reject all three layouts and choose a no action alternative.the fws expressed concern over silver state south potential impact on habitat fragmentation and genetic isolation of the desert tortoise and noted that the proposed layouts would reduce the existing width of the corridor between silver state north and the lucy gray mountains to miles,miles,or mile.in the alternative,the fws recommended that the blm create a new proposal that would keep the corridor wide enough to accommodate multiple desert tortoise ranges,spanning up to several times the desert tortoise lifetime utilization area.the fws also recommended the adoption of additional mitigation measures to offset any reductions in the linkage and monitoring studies to track impact on population demographics and genetic stability.
on february,the blm initiated formal consultation under the esa for silver state south.the consultation process among the blm,the fws,and silver state solar power south,llc,a wholly owned subsidiary of the original applicant for the silver state south project,resulted in a new proposal the alternative that was authorized by the blm in.the alternative reduced the size of the project from acres to acres,and left a mile long corridor between silver state south and the lucy gray mountains with a width ranging from to miles.the alternative also incorporated measures to minimize adverse effects on the desert tortoise,such as the translocation of desert tortoises found within the project site,and measures to offset the loss of the desert tortoise habitat,primarily consisting of the silver state south applicants funding the blm conservation activities.
of particular importance to this case,the silver state south applicants agreed to fund a monitoring program jointly developed by the geological survey and the blm the usgs monitoring study that would track the regional desert tortoise populations for changes in demographic and genetic stability.the study would monitor the effects of silver state south on connectivity by taking an initial set of measurements that would establish baseline conditions that could then be compared to subsequent data over time and across sites.changes that rise to the level of significance alpha would likely indicate changes in demographic and genetic stability,which could require the blm to formal consultation under the esa.
iv.the biological opinion 
on september,the fws issued the biop,which formally reviewed the alternative.the biop selected the entire ivanpah valley as the action area for silver state south,because of the potential effects on connectivity for the desert tortoise within the entire valley.
the biop first concluded that silver state south would be not likely to adversely affect the critical habitat of the desert tortoise,because the proposed actions would not occur within the boundaries of critical habitat of the desert tortoise or directly or indirectly affect the primary constituent elements of critical habitat no adverse modification determination.
the biop next concluded that silver state south was unlikely to appreciably diminish the reproduction,numbers,or distribution of the desert tortoise in the action area no jeopardy determination.the biop found no long term effects on the reproductive rates of tortoises that live adjacent to the project site or of tortoises that would be translocated.it estimated that few tortoises would be harmed or killed because of the proposed translocation of tortoises found in the project site and fencing to be built around silver state south.it also acknowledged that the habitat loss of acres will reduce connectivity between the southern and northern ends of ivanpah valley,but explained that the proposed mitigation measures would offset,to some degree,the decrease in the width of the linkage.the biop therefore expressed uncertain ty as to whether the reduced width of the corridor between the silver state south project and the lucy gray mountains would cause demographic or genetic instability.but,the biop reasoned,should silver state south ultimately degrade connectivity,the usgs monitory survey would be able to detect any change and the long generation time of the tortoise and requirements of section a would enable the blm to undertake correction actions on the ground to bolster connectivity.
the biop also concluded that silver state south would not appreciably impede the recovery of the desert tortoise,but acknowledged that the project was likely to reduce connectivity within the ivanpah valley,which would temporarily impede recovery.however,the biop concluded that the project was not likely to appreciably diminish the likelihood of recovery because at least one desert tortoise lifetime utilization area would remain in the corridor after construction of the product.in addition,t his corridor,combined with the increased level of management proposed by the blm has the potential to increase the density of desert tortoises in the region to a degree that may mitigate the loss of habitat.the biop again noted that the usgs monitoring study would detect any changes to connectivity,which would allow for imposition of remedial measures.
v.the blm approval of the for silver state south 
in february,the blm issued a record of decision,and granted the requested for silver state south.the record of decision specifically approved the alternative for silver state south and noted that the reasonable and prudent measures contained in the biop significantly minimize mitigate environmental damage and protect resources.construction of silver state south has now been completed.
vi.procedural history 
on march,dow sued the federal defendants to enjoin construction of silver state south.silver state solar power south,llc and silver state south solar,llc,another subsidiary of the original project applicant,subsequently intervened as defendants.the district court denied dow request for a preliminary injunction,concluding that dow could not show a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the biop no jeopardy determination was arbitrary or capricious.defs.of wildlife jewell,no.cv,wl,at cal.
the parties subsequently for summary judgment.the district court denied dow motion and granted summary judgment for the various defendants.in doing so,the district court first concluded that the biop no adverse modification determination was neither arbitrary nor capricious because adverse modification is an alteration to a critical habitat primary constituent elements,and gene flow is not a primary constituent element of the desert tortoise critical habitat,mere inclusion of critical habitat in the identified action area for silver lake south is not a finding of adverse modification,and adverse effects on connectivity are not modifications to critical habitat and should instead be analyzed under the analysis.the district court next concluded that the biop no jeopardy determination was neither arbitrary nor capricious,because the biop permissibly made a no jeopardy determination based on equivocal evidence that the reduced corridor was unlikely to jeopardize the desert tortoise recovery,the usgs monitoring study was a sufficiently specific and certain mitigation measure,and the usgs monitoring study provided a sufficiently clear trigger for reinitiating formal consultation under section a of the esa.the district court therefore concluded that the biop fully complied with both the esa and the apa,and that the blm permissibly relied upon the biop in authorizing silver state south.dow timely appealed on may.

jeopardy analysis 
dow first argues that the biop determination that silver state south would not result in jeopardy to the desert tortoise impermissibly relied upon unspecified remedial measures.dow cites the biop conclusion,which states 
to summarize,we concluded that the proposed actions are not likely to appreciably diminish reproduction,numbers,or distribution of the desert tortoise in the action area,or to appreciably impede recovery of the desert tortoise.integral to that conclusion is our expectation that the reduction in the width of habitat east of the silver state south project is either unlikely to degrade demographic or genetic stability in ivanpah valley or that we will be able to detect degradation of those values and implement remedial actions,if necessary.
emphasis added.dow interprets this second sentence to indicate that the biop no jeopardy determination was dependent on the ability to detect future demographic or genetic degradation and implement remedial measures.and,because the biop did not identify specific remedial actions to combat these future effects,dow argues that biop no jeopardy determination was arbitrary and capricious.
dow objection to the biop no jeopardy determination fails for two reasons.first,the biop did not rely on mitigation measures to make its no jeopardy determination.throughout the biop,the fws expressly stated that it was uncertain if the reduced width of the corridor between silver state south and the lucy gray mountains would cause genetic or demographic instability.this uncertainty reflected the lack of a scientific consensus regarding the requisite corridor width necessary to support connectivity for the desert tortoise.in the face of such uncertainty,the fws permissibly concluded that the reduced width of the corridor would not result in jeopardy.although the esa requires the fws to make its determinations with the best scientific data available,b,the esa accepts agency decisions in the face of uncertainty.cattle growers ass salazar,cir.see also san luis water,at it is not our job to task the fws with filling the gaps in the scientific evidence.we must respect the agency judgment even in the face of uncertainty.internal quotation marks omitted.this standard does not require that the fws act only when it can justify its decision with absolute confidence.cattle growers,at.the fws therefore permissibly concluded that the proposed action would not result in jeopardy to the desert tortoise in spite of the uncertainty of the effect of silver state south on the connectivity within the corridor.
second,our precedents do not require mitigation measures to be identified or guaranteed when the mitigation measures themselves may be unnecessary.we have held that an action agency may consider the impact of mitigation measures on a proposed action only when the measures are the result of specific and binding plans and show a clear,definite commitment of resources,wildlife fed n,at,but our precedents imposing this requirement all involve mitigation measures aimed at certain immediate negative effects,see also sierra club marsh,cir.requiring the fws to reinitiate formal consultation after the fws concluded that a highway construction project would adversely affect bird habitat and the county preservation of marshland was necessary to mitigate the effects of the project,but the county subsequently failed to acquire the marshland,abrogated on other grounds as recognized in cottonwood envtl.law ctr.forest,cir.thus,our precedents require an agency to identify and guarantee mitigation measures that target certain or existing negative effects.however,dow cites no authority for the proposition that an agency must similarly identify and guarantee mitigation measures that target uncertain future negative effects.as aptly noted by the district court,t he fws can not be expected to respond to data that is not yet available to surmise potential mitigation actions that are not needed under the agency current interpretation of the data.
here,although the biop repeatedly emphasized that monitoring would allow the fws to detect any future genetic or demographic degradation and implement responsive mitigation measures,the biop ultimately found these potential harms to be uncertain.as such,even the sentence of the biop upon which dow relies acknowledges that the need for future mitigation measures is similarly uncertain,by explaining that the implementation of remedial actions will only be done if necessary.because the biop did not rely upon these potential remedial measures to target a certain or existing harm that would be caused by silver state south,the biop was not obligated to identify or guarantee these future remedial measures.accordingly,the biop no jeopardy determination was neither arbitrary nor capricious.
ii.adverse modification analysis 
the biop concluded that silver state south would be not likely to adversely affect critical habitat of the desert tortoise,because the proposed actions would not occur within the boundaries of critical habitat of the desert tortoise or directly or indirectly affect the primary constituent elements of critical habitat.the biop therefore did not analyze whether silver state south would adversely modify the critical habitat within the ivanpah valley.dow challenges the failure to do so on two grounds.
inclusion of critical habitat in the action area 
dow first contends that the biop inclusion of critical habitat within silver state south action area expressly conceded that there would be an effect on critical habitat,which should have obligated the fws to conduct an adverse modification analysis in the biop.the esa implementing regulations require biological opinions to analyze effects of the proposed action on listed species or critical habitat,h,and e ffects of the action refers to the direct and indirect effects of an action on the species or critical habitat within the relevant action area,id.at.the regulations then define action area as all areas to be affected directly or indirectly by the federal action and not merely the immediate area involved in the action.id.the biop selected the ivanpah valley as the action area for silver state south,and dow notes that the ivanpah valley critical habitat unit chu is within the ivanpah valley.dow insists that the biop inclusion of ivanpah valley chu in the action area is a finding that critical habitat would be affected by silver state south.
we rejected a similar argument in friends of the wild swan weber,cir.there,we concluded that the consulting agency need not conduct an adverse modification analysis in spite of the biological opinion inclusion of critical habitat within the action area.id.at.because both the consulting and action agencies had agreed that the projects at issue were unlikely to affect the critical habitat,t his informal consultation satisfied the requirements of the esa and no formal consolation was thus required.id.citing.friends of the wild swan illustrates the proposition that the inclusion of critical habitat in a biological opinion action area does not automatically trigger the duty to conduct an adverse modification analysis the relevant inquiry remains whether the proposed action is likely to adversely affect critical habitat.b see also id.g.
here,both the blm and the fws concluded that silver state south would be unlikely to adversely affect any critical habitat through informal consultation.as mentioned above,no formal consultation is required if both the action agency and the consulting agency determine,the latter in writing,through informal consultation that the action is not likely to adversely affect listed species or critical habitat.id.a.the blm made this determination in a biological assessment dated february.the fws reached an identical conclusion in the biop itself.because the blm and the fws were in agreement,the fws had no obligation to conduct an adverse modification analysis pursuant to formal consultation in the biop.in any event,the biop also explained that its inclusion of the entire ivanpah valley in the action area was due to the potential effect of silver state south on connectivity for the desert tortoise within the entire valley,not any potential effect on the ivanpah valley chu.
reduced connectivity as an adverse modification of critical habitat 
although the construction of silver state south was not to occur on any critical habitat,dow argues that the biop was obligated to perform an adverse modification analysis because evidence in the record indicated that the construction of silver state south would narrow the corridor between two critical habitats,and thus adversely affect the connectivity of the desert tortoise.dow contends that this reduction in connectivity constitutes adverse modification of critical habitat because it is an impact to the critical habitat recovery value.
during the period of time in which the blm,the fws,and silver state south applicants engaged in the section consultation process that resulted in the biop,the esa implementing regulations defined destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species the regulation.the regulation further explained that s uch alterations include,but are not limited to,alterations adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical.id.however,on february,the fws and the nmsf published a final rule amending the definition of adverse modification the regulation that became effective on march.fed.reg.the regulation now defines adverse modification as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for the conservation of a listed species.and s uch alterations may include,but are not limited to,those that alter the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of a species or that preclude or significantly delay development of such features.id.this amendment was a direct result of our decision in gifford pinchot task force fish wildlife service,cir.fed.reg.there,we found the regulation to be invalid insofar as it limited adverse modifications to actions that appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of habitat.gifford pinchot task force,at quoting.we explained that this definition read the recovery goal out of the adverse modification inquiry altogether,b ecause it is logical and inevitable that a species requires more critical habitat for recovery than is necessary for the species survival,the regulation singular focus becomes survival.id.we emphasized that the text of the esa evinced congressional intent to view conservation,which incorporates recovery,and survival as distinct,though complementary,goals,and the requirement to preserve critical habitat is designed to promote both conservation and survival.id.at.we therefore concluded that w here congress in its statutory language required or,the agency in its regulatory definition substituted and.id.
the parties each rely on different versions of the regulation to argue whether reduced connectivity can constitute adverse modification.defendants first emphasize that the plain language of section of the esa requires agencies to ensure that none of their actions result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat.a.defendants argue that the phrase adverse modification of habitat itself imposes two requirements there must be a modification of habitat,which defendants interpret to mean some change to the habitat itself,that is adverse.second,defendants insist that a change in the desert tortoise connectivity is an effect on the species and not a change to the habitat.third,defendants cite our precedents and other esa implementing regulations that frame adverse modification inquiry as one based on alterations to the primary constituent elements of the critical habitat.see,butte envtl.council army corps of eng rs,cir.characterizing adverse modification as a dverse effects on constituent elements or segments of critical habitat quoting fish wildlife serv.marine fisheries,endangered species consultation handbook procedures for conducting consultation and conference activities under section of the endangered species act all federal agencies must insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by them is not likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of the constituent elements essential to the conservation of the listed species within these defined critical habitats.critical habitats are comprised of primary constituent elements,which are listed in the critical habitat designations.b.defendants argue that reducing connectivity would not affect any of the desert tortoise primary constituent elements,which includes s ufficient space to provide for gene flow,but not connectivity as a whole.fed reg.finally,defendants contend that the regulation does not alter the requirement that adverse modification requires some modification to the habitat itself.
in contrast,dow argues that any action that adversely impacts the recovery value of critical habitat can constitute an adverse modification.dow also cites to the language of section of the esa,but instead argues that the esa use of the phrase result in indicates clear congressional intent to require fws to focus on the consequences of federal actions.next,dow contends that defendants interpretation of adverse modification can not be squared with the fws interpretation of adverse modification as embodied by the regulation.first,dow argues that the regulation definition of adverse modification as an alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for the conservation of a listed species supports dow argument that the adverse modification inquiry must focus on the impact of the proposed agency action on critical habitat recovery value as opposed to whether there was an alteration to the habitat itself.second,dow argues that the regulation interpretation of the phrase may include,but not limited to supports a broad conception of what constitutes an alteration of critical habitat.in the supplementary information accompanying the publication of the regulation regulation commentary,the fws and the nmfs explained that this phrase emphasizes that the types of direct or indirect alterations that appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat for listed species include not only those that affect physical or biological features,but also those that affect the value of critical habitat itself.fed.reg.this phrase therefore encapsulates impacts to an area of critical habitat itself that are not impacts to features,such as those that would impede access to or the use of the habitat.id.
we agree with defendants that the plain language of the esa requires that an adverse modification of critical habitat consists of two elements a modification of the habitat that is adverse.a.both the and definitions reflect that understanding by defining adverse modification as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of the critical habitat.emphasis added same.this interpretation of adverse modification is further confirmed by the regulation commentary,which describes the adverse modification analysis as follows 
the fws will generally conclude that a federal action is likely to destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat if the action results in an alteration of the quantity or quality of the essential physical or biological features of designated critical habitat,or that precludes or significantly delays the capacity of that habitat to develop those features over time,and if the effect of the alteration is to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat for the conservation of the species.
fed.reg,emphasis added.dow interpretation of adverse modification focuses solely on the effect of the proposed agency action,and thus improperly reads the alteration requirement out of the esa implementing regulations altogether.furthermore,dow reliance on the regulation commentary explanation of the phrase may include,but are not limited to is misplaced.this phrase merely clarifies the types of impacts on the critical habitat that can result in adverse modification it does not speak to the threshold requirement that there must be an alteration to the critical habitat that creates these impacts to begin with.see fed.reg.
with this proper understanding of adverse modification in mind,we conclude that reduced connectivity resulting from the narrowing of the corridor between silver state south and the lucy gray mountains can not constitute adverse modification because the construction of silver state south would not have resulted in any alteration to the critical habitat of the desert tortoise.it is undisputed that the corridor itself is not critical habitat and the construction of silver state south would not have taken place on any critical habitat within the ivanpah valley.nor can reduced connectivity itself serve as the alteration reduced connectivity can lead to a change in the desert tortoise genetic health,which is an alteration to the species,not its critical habitat.accordingly,the biop determination that silver state south was not likely to adversely affect the critical habitat of the desert tortoise,which permitted the fws to forego an adverse modification analysis,was neither arbitrary nor capricious.
iii.inconsistent positions in the biop 
a.the fws seis comments 
dow next contends that the biop was arbitrary and capricious because it failed to address the fws nevada field office comments on the blm draft seis pertaining to adverse impacts on recovery,connectivity of critical habitat,and recommended.dow notes that the fws comments on the seis specifically recommended that the corridor between silver state south and the lucy gray mountains should be wide enough to accommodate multiple desert tortoise ranges,spanning up to several times the desert tortoise lifetime utilization area.dow argues that because the fws also authored the biop,which permitted the corridor narrowest point to be slightly less than a single lifetime utilization area,the fws was obligated to address this inconsistency in the biop.
agencies are entitled to change their minds.butte envtl.council,at.thus,the fact that a preliminary determination by a local agency representative is later overruled at a higher level within the agency does not render the decisionmaking process arbitrary and capricious.ass of home builders defs.of wildlife,see also friends of the earth hintz,cir.finding that agency approval of a permit despite earlier criticism because the agency ultimate decision was not a reversal but simply the culmination of over a year and a half of investigations,meetings,and reports.however,an agency also must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.humane soc y of locke,cir.emphases and internal quotation marks omitted.under certain circumstances,an agency prior factual findings or conclusions may be relevant data such that an agency must articulate a satisfactory explanation when it changes its mind.see id.
humane society of the united states locke illustrates this principle.there,we held that the nmfs did not adequately explain its finding that a sea lion predation rate of percent would have a significant negative impact on the decline or recovery of salmon given earlier factual findings by nmfs that fisheries that cause similar or greater mortality among the salmon population are not having significant negative impacts.id.at.we noted that the fishery environmental assessments were in apparent conflict with nmfs finding in this case yet the agency has not offered a rationale to explain the disparate findings.id.at.we acknowledged that agencies do not have a duty to identify and any potential tensions between current and earlier factual determinations in marginally related administrative actions,but explained that the impact of fisheries compared to that of sea lion predation ha d occupied the center of this controversy from the start.id.at.the prior fishery environmental assessments were therefore relevant data which required a satisfactory explanation.id.
locke is distinguishable from the circumstances here in two ways.first,the fws comments on the seis did not make any factual or scientific findings.although the fws recommended that any alternative plan preserve a corridor between silver state south and the lucy gray mounts spanning up to several times the desert tortoise lifetime utilization area,the fws did not conclude that anything less w
