john sturgeon sturgeon challenges the national park service nps enforcement of a regulation banning the operation of hovercrafts on the nation river,part of which falls within the yukon charley rivers national preserve.the ban prevented sturgeon from using his personal hovercraft on his moose hunting trips on the nation river.the state of alaska intervened,challenging nps authority to require its researchers to obtain a permit before engaging in studies of chum and sockeye salmon on the alagnak river,part of which falls within the boundaries of the katmai national park and preserve.
sturgeon and alaska present the same legal argument c of the alaska national interest lands conservation act anilca precludes nps from regulating activities on lands and navigable waters that fall within the boundaries of national park system units in alaska.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the federal appellees.because we find that sturgeon interpretation of c is foreclosed by the plain text of the statute,we affirm as to sturgeon.we hold that alaska lacks standing to bring this challenge,and thus vacate and remand with instructions that alaska case be dismissed.
the facts are straightforward and largely undisputed.since,sturgeon has hunted moose on an annual basis on the nation river the lower six miles of the nation river lie within the yukon charley rivers national preserve yukon charley,which is a unit of the national park system.in,sturgeon purchased a small,personal hovercraft,which he used on his hunting excursions.in september,while repairing his hovercraft on a gravel bar adjoining the river,sturgeon was approached by three nps law enforcement employees.they informed him that nps regulations prohibited the operation of hovercrafts within the yukon charley and issued him a verbal warning.sturgeon protested that the nps regulations were inapplicable because he was operating his hovercraft on a navigable river.sturgeon contacted his attorney via satellite phone,who in turn contacted andee sears,a regional law enforcement specialist with nps.sears told sturgeon attorney that the hovercraft must be removed from the yukon charley.sturgeon complied.
later,sturgeon followed up with sears over the phone and met with him in anchorage.sears advised sturgeon that even though alaska might own the submerged land beneath the river,the hovercraft ban was nonetheless in force within the boundaries of the yukon charley.sears warned sturgeon that he risked criminal liability if he operated his hovercraft within the yukon charley.in response to these warnings,sturgeon refrained from using his hovercraft during the to moose hunting seasons and has not been able to hunt on the portions of the nation river that fall within the boundaries of the yukon charley.
although sturgeon sent a letter to of the interior,ken salazar,petitioning for repeal or amendment of the nps regulations restricting his access to navigable waters located within national park boundaries,he did not receive a response.he then sued in federal district court,seeking an order declaring that nps regulations violated anilca,as applied to him on lands and waters,and enjoining the federal defendants from enforcing these regulations.
alaska intervened,raising the same argument that the application and enforcement of nps regulations on lands and waters violated anilca.specifically,alaska challenged nps regulations that required employees of the alaska department of fish and game to obtain a scientific research and collecting permit before engaging in genetic sampling of chum and sockeye salmon on the alagnak river.these regulations purportedly harmed alaska in the form of increased staff time and expense in complying with nps procedures and in the form of delays in implementing the project.alaska further argued that nps actions both interfered with its sovereign right to manage and regulate its lands and waters and chilled its citizens ability to enjoy the rights and benefits flowing from its management of state resources.
on summary judgment,the district court ruled in favor of the federal appellees.sturgeon masica,cv hrh,wl,at.the district court found that sturgeon and alaska interpretation of anilca c lacks support in the plain language of the statute.id.at.this appeal followed.
we review questions of law resolved on summary judgment de novo,and the district court factual findings for clear error.al haramain islamic,dep t of treasury,cir.
as an initial matter,the federal appellees contend that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal because sturgeon and alaska have failed to establish standing.even though the federal appellees did not present these arguments to the district court below,they may nonetheless do so for the first time on appeal.the constitutional requirements for standing under article iii are jurisdictional,can not be waived by any party,and may be considered sua sponte.city of los angeles cnty.of kern,cir.the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.lujan defenders of wildlife.first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact,which is both concrete and particularized,as well as actual or imminent.id.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,meaning that the injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant.id.quoting simon eastern.welfare rights,quotation mark and alterations omitted.third,it must be likely that a favorable decision would redress the injury identified.id.at.
apart from these constitutional concerns,there exists a body of judicially limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction that forms the prudential standing doctrine.cnty.of kern,at quoting allen wright,see also sprint commc ns,apcc servs.because these considerations are nonconstitutional in nature,they may be deemed waived if not previously raised before the district court.cnty.of kern,at.
we find that sturgeon has established standing.the federal appellees argue that sturgeon has failed to show probable or imminent enforcement of the nps regulations to meet the first requirement of an.the federal appellees view,however,can not be reconciled with the supreme court recent decision in susan anthony list driehaus,where the court emphasized that threatened enforcement actions may suffice to create article iii injuries.when an individual is subject to such a threat,an actual arrest,prosecution,or other enforcement action is not a prerequisite to challenging the law.id.at.thus,a plaintiff satisfies the requirement where he alleges an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest,but proscribed by a statute,and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.id.quoting babbitt farm workers union.
sturgeon has satisfied the requirement.he has alleged an intention to use his hovercraft,and has contacted both nps and the department of the interior regarding the applicability and enforcement of the regulation to his hovercraft use.sturgeon inability to use his hovercraft for purposes arguably implicates his right under the privileges or immunities clause of the fourteenth amendment to use the navigable waters of the united states,however they may penetrate the territory of the several states.the slaughter house cases,see also courtney goltz,cir interpreting the privileges or immunities clause to encompass a right to navigate the navigable waters of the united states.sturgeon thus alleges an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest.susan anthony list.at quoting babbitt,at.
further,there is no dispute that his intended conduct is proscribed by nps regulation.see e stating that t he operation or use of hovercraft is prohibited within lands and waters,which include the yukon charley.finally,there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.susan anthony list.at quoting babbitt,at.the federal appellees concede that sturgeon received a verbal warning not to use the hovercraft,that special agent sears told sturgeon lawyer that sturgeon should remove the hovercraft from the preserve,and that sears later indicated that sturgeon might be subject to criminal liability if he operated a hovercraft in the preserve.these facts are sufficient to show a credible threat of enforcement against sturgeon.
next,the federal appellees argue that any identified by sturgeon is not fairly traceable to actions of nps.we disagree.the regulation was promulgated by nps and enforcement has been threatened by nps employees.therefore,sturgeon injuries are fairly traceable to actions of nps.finally,a favorable decision would redress sturgeon identified,and the federal appellees do not contend otherwise.
in addition to contending that sturgeon lacks article iii standing,the federal appellees argue that prudential considerations of ripeness and adverseness militate against a finding of standing.however,the federal appellees failed to raise these arguments before the district court.we thus find them waived,as prudential standing arguments can be deemed waived if not raised in the district court due to their nonconstitutional nature cnty.of kern,at quoting bd.of natural res.brown,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the state of alaska,on the other hand,lacks standing.alaska offers three bases to support its standing harm in the form of increased staff time and expense in obtaining and complying with the terms of a scientific research and collecting permit injuries to alaska sovereign right to control its lands and waters and the secretary of the interior denial of its petition for administrative proceedings that would repeal or amend the regulations at issue.we address each of the proffered bases in turn.
with regard to alaska chum and sockeye salmon study,the increased burdens to alaska as a result of nps permit requirement clearly constitute.it is undisputed that nps employees informed alaska department of fish and game dfg that a scientific research and collecting permit was required before it engaged in the study.the scientific research and collecting permit that dfg actually obtained and the general conditions and park specific guidance that accompanied of which are part of the that dfg was forced to comply with numerous obligations and limitations under the terms of the permit.to name just a few,dfg was not allowed to destroy research specimens without nps prior authorization,was obligated to catalogue collected specimens into nps interior collections management system and label such specimens with nps accession and catalog numbers,and was required to submit an investigator annual report and copies of other final reports and publications resulting from the study within a year of publication.the record thus amply supports alaska allegation of harm in the form of increased staff time and expense.
but while alaska may have suffered cognizable injuries,a favorable ruling would not redress these injuries.alaska complaint sought a declaration that the nps regulations were invalid and void as applied to lands and waters and an injunction barring future enforcement of the regulations on lands and waters.such relief would not remedy injuries relating to dfg chum and sockeye salmon study in,which have already been incurred and suffered.at oral argument,alaska represented that dfg chum and sockeye salmon study is complete,and the record offers no indication that related studies or efforts are pending or forthcoming.in the absence of evidence showing how the requested relief would redress its identified injuries,alaska may not rely on activities relating to the study of chum and sockeye salmon to establish standing.lujan,at past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief if unaccompanied by any continuing,present adverse effects.alteration in original quoting los angeles lyons,internal quotation marks omitted.
the second basis proffered by alaska presents a closer question.alaska argues that the nps regulations violate its sovereign and proprietary interests in its lands and waters,and interfere with its authority and ability to manage its property in accordance with the alaska constitution and state law.states certainly possess sovereign and proprietary interests that may be pursued via litigation.alfred snapp son,puerto rico ex rel.barez,see also,pennsylvania new jersey,it has become settled doctrine that a state has standing to sue only when its sovereign or interests are implicated.however,we conclude that alaska arguments are unavailing for purposes of establishing standing under the circumstances of this case.
to begin with,alaska failed to meet the requirement that its purported injuries be actual or imminent.lujan,at quoting whitmore arkansas,internal quotation mark omitted.because alaska did not identify any actual conflict between nps regulations and its own statutes and regulations,we are left with only a vague idea of how exactly nps permitting requirement infringes on the state sovereign and proprietary interests in its lands and waters,or how the requirement interferes with the state control over and management of those lands and waters.in the absence of such a conflict,alaska purported injuries are too conjectural or hypothetical to constitute.id.quoting whitmore,u.at internal quotation marks omitted.
alaska has cited no case that finds standing based simply on purported violations of a state sovereign rights.rather,evidence of actual injury is still required.for example,in massachusetts epa,the supreme court found that massachusetts had standing to challenge the epa denial of a rulemaking petition requesting regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act.id.at.the court noted that the state was due special solicitude in the standing analysis based on two factors massachusetts sought to vindicate a procedural right,which eliminated the need under article iii to demonstrate redressability and immediacy,and massachusetts status as a sovereign state.id.at see also washington envtl.council bellon,cir distinguishing massachusetts epa.even in light of this special solicitude,however,the court specifically found that b ecause the commonwealth own ed a substantial portion of the state coastal property,it ha d alleged a particularized injury in its capacity as a landowner due to rising global sea levels.massachusetts,at citation omitted.
similarly,in oregon legal services,cir,oregon contended that a private,nonprofit corporation established by the united states to provide federal funds to local legal assistance programs thwart ed its efforts at policy making with regards to oregon legal service program.id.at.we rejected oregon claim because there was no dispute over oregon ability to regulate its legal services program,and no claim that oregon laws ha d been invalidated as a result of the corporation restrictions.id.because oregon was able to regulate its legal service programs as it desire d,there was thus no judicially cognizable injury.id.at.
finally,nevada burford,cir,is also illustrative.nevada challenged the bureau of land management decision to grant a over land to the department of energy.id.at.because nevada complaint was silent as to how the bureau alleged violations resulted in injury to nevada,in the absence of demonstrated injury,its claim constitute d a generalized grievance that the bureau was not acting in accordance with federal laws and was thus insufficient to demonstrate standing.id.at first,third,and fourth alterations added,second alteration in original quoting nevada burford.see also table bluff reservation wiyot tribe philip morris,cir finding no where twenty native american tribes challenged a master settlement agreement between philip morris,and states,five territories,and the district of columbia because the tribes identified no tribal regulations or contracts that would be affected by the agreement.
similarly,here,alaska claims regarding its sovereign and proprietary interests lack grounding in a demonstrated injury.while alaska alleges that nps regulations have directly interfered with alaska ability as a sovereign to manage and regulate its land and waters,alaska identifies no conflict between nps regulations and its own state statutes and regulations any injury to alaska sovereign and proprietary interest is pure conjecture and thus insufficient to establish standing.
the third and final basis upon which alaska relies to establish standing is the secretary of the interior denial of its petition for new administrative proceedings.a plaintiff possesses standing to enforce procedural rights so long as the procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of his that is the ultimate basis of his standing.lujan,at.as discussed above,alaska fails to identify any threatened concrete interest.alaska can not rely on the secretary denial of its petition because p articipation in agency proceedings is alone insufficient to satisfy judicial standing requirements.gettman drug enforcement,quoting fund democracy,llc sec,internal quotation marks omitted.alaska right to petition the agency does not in turn automatic ally confer article iii standing when that right is deprived.id.alteration in original quoting pet rs br.
therefore,we hold that alaska has failed to establish standing to challenge the nps regulations.we vacate the district court judgment as to alaska and remand with instructions that alaska case be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
we now turn to the merits of sturgeon challenge.sturgeon contends that c of anilca bars the application and enforcement of nps hovercraft ban on the nation river which he contends is land.according to sturgeon,the plain text of the statute,its legislative history,and our decision in city of angoon marsh,cir,support his view.before explaining why we find sturgeon contentions unpersuasive,we offer a bit of background.
anilca,enacted in,offered new protection s for the national interest in the scenic,natural,cultural and environmental values on the public lands in alaska,and at the same time provide d adequate opportunity for satisfaction of the economic and social needs of the state of alaska and its people.d.summarized succinctly,anilca is generally concerned with the designation,disposition,and management of land for environmental preservation purposes.stratman leisnoi,cir.to this end,congress set aside approximately million acres of federal land in alaska for protection of natural resource values by permanent federal ownership and management.audubon soc y hodel.portions of those lands were used to expand existing units of the national park system and create new units,which were to be administered by the secretary of the interior.id.such units included national parks,preserves,and monuments.see id.anilca refers to units of the national park system situated in alaska as conservation system unit s csus.
not all lands that lie within the boundaries of a csu are owned by the federal government.where possible,congress drew unit boundaries to include whole ecosystems and to follow natural features,and was thus cognizant of the fact that state,native,or land could fall within the boundaries of csus.marsh,at quoting cong.rec.the presence of both and land lying within csus led congress to clarify two things first,what land would actually comprise the csus,and second,more generally,how land falling within a csu boundaries whether federally owned or not could be regulated.see id.discussing the house version of anilca and the tsongas substitute in the senate.
such clarification came in anilca c.the full text of that subsection reads as follows 
only those lands within the boundaries of any conservation system unit which are public lands as such term is defined in this act shall be deemed to be included as a portion of such unit.no lands which,before,on,or after december,are conveyed to the state,to any native corporation,or to any private party shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely to public lands within such units.if the state,a native corporation,or other owner desires to convey any such lands,the secretary may acquire such lands in accordance with applicable law including this act,and any such lands shall become part of the unit,and be administered accordingly.
section c thus contains three separate instructions regarding the composition and regulation of csus.first,only public lands lying within the boundaries of a csu are deemed to be included as a portion of such unit.id.under anilca,public lands are f ederal lands including lands,waters,and interests therein in which the united states holds title after december.id.the first sentence of c makes clear that the boundaries of csus do not in any way change the status of that state,native,or private land lying within those boundaries.cong.rec.
the second sentence of c declares that state,native,and land shall not be subject to regulations applicable solely to public lands within such units.c.accordingly,under c plain text,only public land lying within a csu boundaries may be subjected to regulations nonfederal land is expressly made exempt from such regulations.as the senate report on anilca makes clear,nonfederal land would not be subject to the management regulations which may be adopted to manage and administer any national csu which is adjacent to,or surrounds,the private or non federal public lands,at,reprinted in,emphasis added.importantly for purposes of this case,in contrast to regulations,f ederal laws and regulations of general applicability to both private and public lands are unaffected,and would be applicable to private or public land holdings within csus.id.
finally,c third sentence provides that the secretary of the interior may acquire nonfederal land lying within a csu boundaries such land would then become part of the unit and may be administered accordingly.c.once acquired,what was previously nonfederal land would no longer be free from regulations applicable solely to public lands within csus.see also cong.rec.noting that if the native corporations ever decide to dispose of their property,it could become part of the csu.
with this background in mind,we easily resolve sturgeon appeal.sturgeon argues that the plain language of anilca c removes nonfederal lands from the reach of federal regulations promulgated to manage public lands.thus,his argument goes,nps may not enforce the hovercraft ban on the lower portion of the nation river that falls within the yukon charley because the water and submerged land of that river is owned by the state of alaska.
while we agree with sturgeon that c is unambiguous,we find that it unambiguously forecloses his interpretation.the plain text of c only exempts nonfederal land from regulations applicable solely to public lands within csus.c emphasis added.the regulation at issue,banning hovercraft use in the yukon charley,is not so limited.
in,congress vested the secretary of the interior with the authority to p romulgate and enforce regulations concerning boating and other activities on or relating to waters located within areas of the national park system,including waters subject to the jurisdiction of the united states.h.pursuant to this grant of authority,the secretary promulgated a number of regulations to provide for the proper use,management,government,and protection of persons,property,and natural and cultural resources within areas under the jurisdiction of the national park service.a.within the chapter of the code of federal regulations containing those regulations,parts through apply to all persons entering,using,visiting,or otherwise within federally owned lands and waters administered by nps and w aters subject to the jurisdiction of the united states located within the boundaries of the national park system,including navigable waters.a.the hovercraft ban is located within part of that chapter.see e.
in short,then,the hovercraft ban is not one that appli es solely to public lands within csus in alaska.c.rather,this regulation applies to all lands and waters administered by nps nationwide,as well as all navigable waters lying within national parks.thus,even assuming without deciding that the waters of and lands beneath the nation river have been conveyed to the state for purposes of c,that subsection does not preclude the application and enforcement of the nps regulation at issue.because of its general appl
