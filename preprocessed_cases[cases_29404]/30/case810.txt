this case calls on us to determine,in the first instance,whether the holder of a revocable permit to use real property is an owner of that real property for purposes of imposing liability under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla for the cleanup of hazardous substances disposed on that property by others.a common sense reading of the statute and existing state law persuade us that this permittee,as the holder of a possessory interest,can not be such an owner under cercla,and we so hold.
the city of los angeles the city appeals from the district court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of bci bottling company of los angeles bci.the city sued bci on ten counts arising from environmental contamination caused by operation of the san pedro boat works located at berth in the port of los angeles berth.the city seeks reimbursement for the expense of cleaning up hazardous substances disposed of at berth.the parties do not dispute whether hazardous substances were released at berth they were.the disagreement is over who should pay the costs.
under cercla,bci must pay if and only if it or its was an owner or operator of the boatworks when the hazardous substances were disposed at berth.see cercla,in a separate decision,the district court held that pacific american,and thus bci,was not an operator of the boatworks at berth.the city,for reasons unexplained by the record,did not appeal the district court ruling on operator liability.we therefore focus our analysis on the district court determination that pacific american,and thus bci,was not an owner of the boatworks for purposes of cercla.
because the definitions congress provides in cercla for owners and operators are mere tautologies this court has looked to the common the state law of the property guidance in other cases when imposing cercla liability on possessors and owners of various property interests.see burlington santa fe ry.united states,congress intended the scope of liability to be determined from traditional and evolving principles of common law.quoting united states,long beach unified sch.dist.dorothy godwin cal.living trust,cir looking to the common law,including california common law,to determine whether an easement holder is an owner under cercla.under california law,the holder of a revocable permit,like the easement holder in long beach,has only a possessory interest in the real property governed by the permit,an interest which exists as a result of possession,exclusive use,or a right to possession or exclusive use of land unaccompanied by the ownership of a fee simple or life estate in the property.bd.of supervisors archer,emphasis added.given this common law distinction between ownership interests and possessory interests,and the juxtaposition of owner and operator in operator liability has been construed expansively in this circuit and conclude that congress intended to give owner its common law meaning.we here hold that owner liability under cercla does not extend to holders of mere possessory interests in land,such as permittees,easement holders,or licensees,whose possessory interests have been conveyed to them by the owners of real property,which owners continued to retain power to control the permittee use of the real property.
in conjunction with the more permissive operator liability,this narrow construction of owner liability furthers congress intent to hold liable both the passive fee title owner of real property who pollutes or acquiesces in another discharge of harmful pollutants on his land,and the active or negligent operator of the facility who has only a possessory interest in the owner real property.under this construction,and in accordance with california common law,bci a permittee,subject to restrictions imposed by the landowner,city of los angeles,on bci not liable as an owner under cercla.
further,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to bci on the city nuisance claims because the city did not raise a triable issue of fact that pacific american ever had knowledge,or was put on notice,of the environmental contamination.nor did the district court err in denying the city leave to amend its complaint to add a breach of contract claim against pacific american.therefore,we affirm.
factual background 
berth is located within the port of los angeles,which is itself part of the los angeles harbor.it is owned by the city of los angeles and run by the board of harbor commissioners.the board of harbor commissioners have the management,supervision and control of all navigable waters and all tidelands and submerged lands at los angeles harbor.charter of the city of los angeles charter,art.xi.the board of harbor commissioners is responsible for issuing franchises,permits,and leases for use of the land at the los angeles harbor.charter,art.xi c d.
in,the board of harbor commissioners issued revocable permit to the los angeles harbor marine corporation harbor marine,for the limited purpose of operating a facility for the repair,maintenance,and rebuilding of ships and berth.the permit granted possession of roughly acres of land and acres of water at berth.from to,harbor marine operated a boatworks at berth.during this time,pacific american began negotiations with harbor marine to purchase the permit.while those negotiations were ongoing,pacific american incorporated san pedro boat works it became a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of pacific american.pacific american and harbor marine agreed on the terms of the sale,and with the city necessary and prior approval,pacific american purchased the permit in an asset sale that closed in august.
in the close of the asset sale,pacific american conveyed all of its interest in harbor marine physical assets,not including revocable permit,to its whollyowned subsidiary corporation,san pedro boat works so that at no time did pacific american ever own the boatworks assets.at closing,san pedro boat works became the sole owner of the facilities and machinery at berth.
nevertheless,pacific american efforts to make san pedro boat works wholly responsible for all things related to the boatworks on berth were not immediately successful.on august,pacific american,not san pedro boat works,accepted an assignment of revocable permit from harbor marine.in april or may of,pacific san pedro boat revocable permit from the board of harbor commissioners to replace revocable permit.not until june did pacific american rid itself of its last direct connection to berth by assigning revocable permit to san pedro boat works,which assignment was approved by the board of harbor commissioners.thus,pacific american was the named permittee of revocable permits and for operation of the boatworks for approximately ten months.the parties do not contest,however,that only san pedro boat works operated the boatworks facility at all times,including during those ten months.
in,martin vincent purchased the facilities and machinery of the san pedro boat works.although pacific american remained the named permittee on revocable permit,vincent assumed san pedro boat works role as assignee of the permit upon his purchase of san pedro boat works.in,vincent sold the assets of san pedro boat works to billfish,incorporated,and revocable permit was assigned to billfish.subsequently,the city and billfish entered into revocable permit,replacing revocable permit.in,bci purchased pacific american,including pacific american remaining assets and its liabilities.bci does not dispute that it acquired all of pacific american liabilities,and therefore stands in the shoes of pacific american for the purposes of this case.
in,the city first began to investigate the soil and groundwater at berth.a variety of contaminants were discovered,including volatile organic compounds,petroleum hydrocarbons,polychlorinated biphenyls,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,copper,lead,mercury,and chromium.in and,subsea sediment samples collected by the city from the area surrounding berth revealed particularly high levels of copper and zinc.the city removed the contaminated sediments from the area in by dredging,which reduced contaminant concentrations to levels acceptable to a contaminated sediments task force.
the city filed its initial complaint against bci,pacific american,and san pedro boat works among others,on october,alleging the defendants were responsible for contamination of the soil,groundwater,and sediments at and around berth,and thus were liable for the cleanup costs.in its fourth amended complaint,the city alleged twelve claims against eight named defendants for site pollution at berth.relevant to this appeal,the city alleged three claims against bci under cercla,as well as claims for private and public nuisance under state law.the city also moved to add a claim for breach of contract in its fourth amended complaint,but the district court denied this motion.
in its fourth amended complaint,the city advanced four theories of cercla liability against bci based on pacific american relationship with berth the city alleged pacific american was a cercla owner because it held title to assets used at berth,pacific american was a cercla owner because it held revocable permits from the city to do business at berth,pacific american was derivatively liable as an operator because san pedro boat american its and san pedro boat works was liable as an operator of the boatworks at berth,and pacific american was itself an operator of the boatworks business at berth.
the city moved for summary adjudication of its cercla claims against bci,and on july,the district court held there was a genuine issue of fact as to whether pacific american held title to assets used at berth,the revocable permits were insufficient to establish owner liability of pacific american,and thus of bci as,under cercla,pacific american could not be held derivatively liable for san pedro boat works ownership or operation of the boatyard business at berth because san pedro boat works was not the of pacific american,and pacific american was not an operator of the boatworks under cercla.the district court submitted to a jury the first pacific american owned the assets of the boatyard business at berth specific instruction as to the definition of ownership.the jury returned a special verdict that pacific american did not own the assets of the boatworks.the district court then sua sponte dismissed the city cercla claims.
the district court next granted bci motion for summary judgment on the city claims.the district court dismissed the city nuisance claims on the ground that the city failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether pacific predecessor,whose liabilities became bci had knowledge or notice of the environmental contamination.
the district court entered final judgment in favor of bci,holding that all of the city claims were premised on the theory that bci was liable as a to pacific american,but the jury had determined pacific american never owned any of the assets of the boatworks.in fact,all of the physical assets of the boatworks were owned by the san pedro boat works,before being acquired by martin vincent in.thus,bci ownership of pacific american did not vest any ownership of the boatworks assets in bci.the city appeals on the ground that because pacific american held the revocable permit to operate the boatworks at berth for ten months in,pacific american was an owner of the boatworks for purposes of cercla liability.the city also appeals the district court denial of the city motion for leave to amend its complaint to add a breach of contract claim against pacific american.

ii.cercla claims 
the city contends on appeal that bci is liable for the of the berth boatworks because pacific american possessed revocable permits from the city for ten months from to,and was thus an owner of the physical assets of the berth boatworks when the pollution was discharged,and bci assumed pacific american cercla owner liability in the purchase.
cercla imposes the costs of the environmental cleanup on those responsible for the contamination,at quoting union gas,at.the remedy that congress felt it needed in cercla is sweeping everyone who is potentially responsible for contamination may be forced to contribute to the costs of cleanup.id.
our court construes cercla liberally to effectuate the statute two primary goals to ensure the prompt and effective cleanup of waste disposal sites,and to assure that parties responsible for hazardous substances bear the cost of remedying the conditions they created.carson harbor village,unocal,f d,cir internal alterations omitted.however,in enacting cercla,congress did not intend to impose liability on everyone else who has any interest at all in land containing a toxic waste facility.long beach,at.therefore,we have cautioned that we must reject a construction that the statute on its face does not permit,and the legislative history does not support.carson,at quoting stevens creek barclays bank of,cir.
cercla imposes liability on any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of.a as a to pacific american,bci is liable under cercla if pacific american was an owner of the boatworks facility.congress did not clearly define the word owner in cercla.instead,congress defined the terms owner and operator,to mean in the case of an onshore facility or an offshore facility,any person owning or operating such facility.a ii.in short,an owner is any person owning a facility.the supreme court has recognized that this definition is entirely tautological,and thus useless.bestfoods,at.
our court has examined the meaning of the term owner under cercla in just one case.see long beach,at.in long beach,the school district bought land from the godwin trust.the godwin trust had previously leased the land to the schafer brothers transfer and piano moving company schafer,which maintained a waste pit on the land.the school district sued the godwin trust and schafer,both of which settled,and also mobil oil and powerine oil m p,which did not.the school district alleged m p were liable under cercla as owners or operators because m p held an easement to run a pipeline across the land.the pipeline had no connection to the targeted waste pit.the district court granted m p motion to dismiss.id.at.we affirmed,holding that an easement for a pipeline was not sufficient to show m p were operators or owners under cercla.id.at.having an easement does not make one an owner for purposes of cercla liability.id.
first,we noted that because cercla did not provide a definition of owner,we should read the statute as incorporating the common law definitions of its terms.id.at.looking to california law,we found a number of state law cases distinguishing convey only rights of and from another in or over the ownership.id.at.see,city of hayward mohr,holding that although an easement is an interest in land,it is only a limited use or enjoyment of the land in which the interest exists it is not itself either land or an estate in land robinson cuneo,holding that an easement holder,unlike an owner,owns no part of the land itself and has no right to exclude the owner from the use of any of the land.from these state law cases,we determined that the common law definition of owner did not include an easement holder,and therefore,extending cercla owner liability to m p was unwarranted.long beach,at.
long beach establishes the rule that this court should look to the common the law of the state where the land at issue is determining whether a party was an owner for purposes of cercla liability.id.at.although the holding in long beach with regard to easement holders is not conclusive of the issue in this case,the case demonstrates that there is a relevant distinction,for purposes of cercla owner liability,between absolute title ownership to real property and possessory interests in real property,conveyed by the holder of fee title.
however,not all courts have followed long beach methodology of looking to the common law to determine whether a given holder of a property interest is an owner under cercla.some district courts have determined cercla ownership liability by examining whether the holder of that interest typically a lessee possessed site control over the facility.see united states south carolina recycling disposal,aff in part,vac in part sub nom.united states monsanto,cir.
in south carolina recycling,the district court of south carolina held that a lessee could be an owner under cercla id.at.there,the president of the lessee negotiated a verbal lease with the owners to use the site to store raw chemicals.individuals associated with the lessee began storing waste at the site,but did not do so as employees of the lessee.eventually,these individuals formed a new corporation to manage the waste operations.that entity assumed the lease two years after the verbal lease was formed.the entity continued to store hazardous waste on the property for six more years.the district court held the lessee was liable as an owner under cercla because it maintained control over and responsibility for the use of property and,essentially,stood in the shoes of the property owners.id.at.the court explained that site control is an important consideration in determining who qualifies as an owner under cercla.id.
in the only circuit court decision to address the liability of a lessee under cercla owner provision,the second circuit held that lessees could be liable as owners only in the rare case where the lessee was a de facto owner,and expanded the test into a test for determining de facto ownership.commander oil barlo equip,cir.in that case,commander oil bought two lots.lot was clean office space lot was a polluted petrol depot.commander oil leased clean lot to barlo equipment and polluted lot to pasley solvents chemicals.a few years later,commander oil reorganized the leases,so that it leased both lots to barlo and barlo then sublet polluted lot to pasley.the local department of health discovered the pollution on lot and ordered commander oil to clean that lot.commander oil then sued barlo and pasley for contribution under cercla.the district court held barlo was an owner,by virtue of the consolidated lease,and ordered barlo to pay of the clean up costs.id.at.
the second circuit reversed,holding owner liability applied only to lessees when the lessee was a de facto owner,such as in the case of the proverbial lease.id.at.the second circuit held barlo did not possess sufficient attributes of ownership for owner liability.id.at.
commander oil identified five factors to consider in determining de facto ownership 
whether the lease is for an extensive term and admits of no rights in the to determine how the property is used whether the lease can not be terminated by the owner before it expires by its terms whether the lessee has the right to sublet all or some of the property without notifying the owner whether the lessee is responsible for payment of all taxes,assessments,insurance,and operation and maintenance costs and whether the lessee is responsible for making all structural and other repairs.
instead of applying a nebulous and flexible analytical framework such as site control or commander oil balancing which do not clearly call out what an investor in land can expect and which factors are themselves susceptible to endless manipulation in follow our court methodology in long beach.looking to common law,including california common law,we find that the holder of a permit for specific use of real property is not the owner of that real property,where,as here,the fee title owner retained power to control the permittee use of the real property.instead,such a permittee holds merely a possessory interest in the land,comparable to the interest of a licensee or easement holder.as the california court of appeals has held,a possessory interest is an interest in real property which exists as a result of possession,exclusive use,or a right to possession or exclusive use of land unaccompanied by the ownership of a fee simple or life estate in the property,which ownership interest is retained by the fee title owner of the real property.archer.at emphasis added internal quotation marks,alterations,and citations omitted.such a possessory interest may be a leasehold interest or the interest of either an easement holder or a mere permittee or licensee,and may exist as the result of a grant,among others,of a leasehold estate,a profit a prendre,or any other legal or equitable interest of less than freehold.id.emphasis added.
california state courts have consistently distinguished between possessory interests,such as a revocable permit,and title ownership as the supreme court of california recently reiterated with regard to a lease which,as the facts of this case show,usually confers greater property interests than does a revocable permit 
notwithstanding the fact that a lease is a present possessory interest in land,there is no question that as a nonfreehold estate it is a different species of interest from a freehold estate in fee simple a leasehold is not an ownership interest,unlike the possession of land in fee simple it is for that reason that common parlance refers to the owner of a freehold estate,encumbered or unencumbered,but to the holder of a lease the freeholder is seised of land,whereas the leaseholder is not.
auerbach assessment appeals bd,cal quoting pac.sw.realty cnty.of los angeles,cal see also dirs.of fallbrook irr.dist.abila,cal,owner,in its general sense,means one who has full proprietorship in and dominion over property.in bouvier law dictionary it is said that the word owner,when used alone,imports an absolute owner.
california is not alone in recognizing this distinction other common law courts have held that a mere possessory interest in the use or enjoyment of real property,such as a permit,does not constitute ownership.see,peoples gas,light,and coke harrison cent.appraisal,texas courts have generally defined taxable owner as the individual or entity holding legal title to the property or holding an equitable right to obtain legal title.stansbury mdr,t he owner of land in fee holds all of the complex elements of a single right,a bundle of sticks,if you will,which include not only the right to use the surface,but so much of the superjacent airspace as he can use,as well as the subjacent reaches below.quoting macht dep t of assessments of baltimore city,mesa verde montezuma cnty.bd.of equalization,holding that the united states owned the real property at issue,while the permittees and lessees held only a possessory interest in the land spanish river resort walker,so d,fla.app holding that an owner enjoy s all of the sticks which constitute the bundle of rights that is fee ownership of real estate internal quotation omitted.
this interpretation of the term owner is particularly appropriate in the context of imposing cercla liability.after all,if congress intended to impose,liability on the holder of a mere possessory interest in real property,the least it could do is speak clearly.in establishing owner liability,congress did not say de facto owner,or possessor,or person with some incidents or attributes of ownership,as it has in other legislation.see,stating that a life insurance policy can be included in the decedent gross estate for estate tax purposes as if owned by the decedent,if the decedent possessed incidents of ownership in the insurance policy.instead it used the unmodified term owner which,as the supreme court of california noted in abila,when used alone,imports an absolute owner.cal.at internal quotations omitted.
the logic of this distinction between holders of possessory interests,in this case a permittee,and owners is made manifest by the narrow bundle of rights pacific american in fact enjoyed during its possession of the revocable permits to operate the berth boatworks.for example,the two revocable permits possessed by pacific american in and could be terminated by the city,at its pleasure,with thirty and ninety days notice respectively.pacific american could not convey the permit to another entity without permission of the city,nor could it change
