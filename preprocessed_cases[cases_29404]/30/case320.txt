green valley coal company green valley appeals the award of attorney fees in a citizen suit brought under the surface mining control and reclamation act smcra or the act,et.initially,three environmental organizations,ohio river valley environmental coalition,hominy creek preservation association,and citizens coal council collectively,ovec,sued the director of the west virginia division of environmental protection the state agency to mandate changes in the way the agency enforces its regulatory program under smcra.in its complaint against the state agency,ovec alleged that certain mining permit applications filed by green valley were deficient,and green valley intervened to defend the validity of its applications.the district court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the state agency from approving one of green valley applications,though the injunction was later dissolved as moot after green valley withdrew the application.later,ovec filed supplemental claims against green valley in this litigation and a citizen complaint in the administrative arena,alleging smcra violations at one of green valley mining sites.partly as a result of ovec efforts,green valley took remedial actions at the site,which led ovec to dismiss its claims voluntarily.ovec ultimately moved for an award of attorney fees under smcra provision,d.the district court made a fee award that included prejudgment interest.we affirm the fee award with respect to the preliminary injunction phase phase one of the litigation.however,we vacate the fee award with respect to the supplemental claims phase phase two because that award includes fees for ovec efforts in the administrative arena,and fees for these efforts are not recoverable under d.on remand the district court may reconsider,in light of the applicable standard,whether a fee award is appropriate for ovec efforts in phase two of the litigation.we also affirm the award of prejudgment interest but vacate and remand to allow the district court to correct an apparent miscalculation.
ovec started this litigation in january by filing a lawsuit under smcra citizen suit provision,against the director of the west virginia division of environmental protection.congress enacted smcra to,among other things,assure that surface coal mining operations are so conducted as to protect the environment.d.to further its goals,smcra creates an arrangement that allows a state to assume exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations within its borders if the federal secretary of the interior the secretary approves the state regulatory program.see bragg west virginia coal ass n,cir.however,if an approved state program fails to enforce properly the minimum national standards established by smcra,the secretary may revoke the state exclusive jurisdiction and reassume regulatory authority.a,b see bragg,at.west virginia received approval for its smcra regulatory program in,and the state agency continues to administer the program.see.
ovec asserted in its initial complaint that the state agency was consistently failing to enforce numerous provisions in the applicable surface mining regulations.the regulations relevant in this appeal require a coal operator to include in each surface mining permit application an assessment of the probable hydrologic impact of the proposed mining on the surrounding area.see b.the regulations bar approval of a permit application unless this assessment,known as a cumulative hydrologic impact assessment chia,demonstrates that the proposed mining operation will not cause material damage to the surrounding area.see b.ovec complaint alleged,among other things,that the state agency had a pattern and practice of approving permit applications that contained inadequate chias.the complaint identified numerous applications,some approved and others still pending,that were allegedly inadequate.ovec sought a declaratory judgment that the state agency has a mandatory duty to deny any permit application that is not supported by an adequate chia and an injunction barring approval of all inadequate pending applications.
green valley,the intervenor in this case,had filed two of the permit applications that ovec complaint identified as inadequate.these two applications,known as incidental boundary revisions and ibr and ibr,sought revisions to existing permits related to green valley operations in the hominy creek watershed in nicholas county,west virginia.these revisions were necessary because the refuse area authorized by the existing permit was nearing its capacity.ibr proposed a solution to this problem that would nearly double the size of the authorized refuse area while also converting it from a fill to a valley fill.ibr,on the other hand,was designed to meet the operation refuse needs during the time required for implementation of the plan proposed by ibr.
ovec complaint asserted that green valley permit applications for ibr and ibr were deficient in failing to include at least three separate pieces of information complete and accurate hydrologic baseline information an adequate hydrologic monitoring plan and an adequate statement demonstrating that the proposed operation would not cause violations of applicable water quality standards.the practical effect of these alleged deficiencies was that the permit applications,in ovec view,contained neither adequate information detailing the existing iron problem in hominy creek nor a sufficient basis for concluding that the proposed operations would not worsen the iron problem.
on june,roughly four months after this lawsuit was filed,the state agency informed ovec that ibr and ibr would soon be approved.ovec responded by moving first for a temporary restraining order on june and then for a preliminary injunction on june.on june green valley moved to intervene in the case to protect its property interest in both its mining operations and its surface mining permit.the court granted green valley motion to intervene,and the company participated fully in the injunction proceedings.
following a hearing in,the district court issued a preliminary injunction that enjoined the state agency from approving ibr.the court denied relief with respect to ibr subject to the condition that the state agency amend the chia to account for certain information adduced at the hearing.with respect to ibr,the court found that the chia does not include an adequate assessment of the current iron problem and that ovec was likely to prevail on one of its principal challenges to the sufficiency of the chia.the court also concluded that the baseline data in the chia was questionable and that the chia groundwater monitoring plan was inadequate.in its decision the court highlighted evidence tending to show that the chia had an insufficient basis for concluding that the existing iron problem in hominy creek derived mostly from an abandoned mine downstream of green valley operations and that the significant expansion of the fill proposed by ibr would not worsen the iron problem.the court noted that green valley and the state agency contested the evidence on these points but found that ovec had made a sufficiently strong showing to warrant a preliminary injunction.the court concluded that further investigation was necessary to determine whether the proposed project was likely to worsen materially the iron problem in hominy creek.
the state agency filed its notice of appeal from the preliminary injunction on july.several months later,in december,green valley obtained permission from the state agency to withdraw the ibr application.in february the state agency informed the district court of this development and noted that green valley had resubmitted the application as ibr.ovec then moved to dissolve the preliminary injunction as moot.though the state agency opposed the motion based on the similarities between ibr and ibr,it acknowledged that it had not completed a full administrative review of ibr and could not predict the outcome of such review.the district court dissolved the preliminary injunction on april,based on its determination that a lthough similar to the enjoined ibr,the newly submitted ibr has not been reviewed by the state agency.dissolution of the injunction concluded what we refer to as phase one of the litigation.
later,in october,ovec filed an administrative complaint,known as a citizen complaint,with the charleston,west virginia,office of the federal office of surface mining osm.the citizen complaint alleged that green valley existing hominy creek operations were in violation of numerous provisions of smcra.a few days after filing the citizen complaint with osm,ovec notified green valley of its intent to commence a civil action against the company based on the violations identified in the citizen complaint.a year later,in october,phase two of this litigation began when ovec moved successfully in district court to file supplemental claims against green valley.
in the meantime,ovec october citizen complaint prompted osm to begin a lengthy administrative review process.the most important events in that process,at least for our purposes,occurred in.on june,osm issued a notice of violation based on several seeps containing iron that were draining into hominy creek without first passing through a treatment pond.green valley thereafter took remedial measures to address these seeps.in response to green valley measures,osm terminated its notice of violation on september.based in part on its satisfaction with green valley remedial efforts,ovec moved on may,to dismiss,without prejudice,its supplemental claims against green valley.the district court granted ovec dismissal motion the next day,thus ending phase two of the litigation.
ovec petitioned the district court for an award of costs of litigation,including attorney and expert witness fees,under d.in a series of rulings the district court held that ovec was eligible for a fee award based on the preliminary injunction that barred issuance of ibr,calculated the amount of a reasonable fee award based on the degree of success ovec achieved in the two phases of the litigation,and awarded prejudgment interest.for phase one the district court awarded in fees and in prejudgment interest.the court determined that ovec limited success in phase two warranted reducing its fee award for that phase by half,resulting in an award of with prejudgment interest of.the court also awarded additional amounts for the attorney fees incurred in preparing the fee petitions and for a few other miscellaneous lawyer expenses.green valley appeals the award of fees and prejudgment interest.
under what is called the american rule,a prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect an award of attorney fees from the loser.alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d.congress from time to time departs from this rule by enacting provisions that require or permit a court to order one party to pay the reasonable attorney fees of another.most provisions allow a court to award fees to a prevailing party.see loggerhead turtle county council,cir listing prevailing party provisions.less commonly,a provision,such as smcra,authorizes a fee award to any party,whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.d see loggerhead turtle,at listing whenever appropriate provisions.under a whenever appropriate provision a fee award is appropriate only when the fee claimant achieves some degree of success on the merits.ruckelshaus sierra club,d.we review de novo the legal determination of whether a party has achieved sufficient success to be eligible for a fee award under a whenever appropriate provision.highlands conservancy norton,cir.the factual findings underpinning that determination are reviewed for clear error.carolina care plan,mckenzie,cir.
we first consider whether ovec achieved sufficient success on the merits during phase one of the litigation to warrant an award of attorney fees.
ovec advances alternative reasons to support its eligibility for a fee award with respect to phase one.it argues first that the district court was correct in holding that the preliminary injunction,by itself,provided ovec with sufficient success on the merits to justify the award.ovec argues in the alternative that it is eligible for an award under the catalyst theory based on green valley withdrawal of the ibr permit application.because we conclude that the catalyst theory supports a fee award for phase one of this litigation,we do not take up the question of whether obtaining a preliminary injunction might,standing alone,support a fee award under a whenever appropriate provision.smyth rivero,cir holding that a preliminary injunction was not sufficient to create eligibility for fees under a prevailing party provision.
the catalyst theory holds that parties who obtain,through settlement or otherwise,substantial relief prior to adjudication on the merits may be eligible for attorney fees under a whenever appropriate provision.see sierra club epa.the theory derives in large part from the supreme court observation in ruckelshaus that congress intended the whenever appropriate standard in the clean air act to allow fee recovery for suits that force defendants to abandon illegal conduct,although without a formal court order.at.citing.allowing catalyst theory recovery was,as the supreme court noted,a somewhat expansive innovation that extended fee eligibility beyond that available under the prevailing party standard.id.the legislative history demonstrated,however,that congress clearly intended such a result.see also gwaltney of smithfield chesapeake bay,d citing similar legislative history relating to the whenever appropriate standard in the clean water act.
green valley argues that the catalyst theory is no longer valid after state board of education,cir,and buckhannon board care home west virginia department of health human resources,d.both and buckhannon hold that prevailing party fee provisions do not permit recovery based on the catalyst theory,at buckhannon,at.instead,these provisions require a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.buckhannon,at.green valley argument based on cases that interpret prevailing party provisions runs squarely into ruckelshaus,which remains the controlling law on the construction of whenever appropriate provisions.as ruckelshaus acknowledges,congress adoption of the whenever appropriate standard acts as a rejection of the prevailing party standard and its narrower application.at.for this reason,buckhannon and other cases rejecting the catalyst theory under prevailing party provisions do not bar the application of the theory to whenever appropriate provisions.
other circuits agree with us that buckhannon does not bar catalyst recovery under a whenever appropriate provision.see sierra club epa,clean air act loggerhead turtle county council,cir endangered species act.these circuits have likewise reasoned that ruckelshaus,which was not even cited in buckhannon,remains the controlling supreme court decision with respect to the whenever appropriate standard.sierra club,at loggerhead turtle,at.in sum,smcra whenever appropriate provision authorizes recovery under the catalyst theory.
we turn now to whether the catalyst theory supports ovec fee recovery for phase one of this case.to warrant a catalyst recovery,ovec must establish three things first,that green valley actions provided ovec with some of the benefit sought in the lawsuit second,that ovec claims in the lawsuit were not frivolous and third,that ovec lawsuit was a substantial or significant cause of green valley actions providing relief.see sierra club,at.
the district court findings support application of the catalyst theory in this case,although the court did not base the fee award on that theory.the second element of a catalyst recovery is not in dispute.in granting the injunction with respect to ibr,the district court necessarily found that ovec claims were not frivolous.the third element,causation,is likewise satisfied.the record makes clear that,absent the preliminary injunction obtained by ovec,the state agency would have approved ibr in its original form,and green valley would have had no reason to submit ibr in lieu of ibr.green valley withdrawal of ibr was thus caused,at least in significa
