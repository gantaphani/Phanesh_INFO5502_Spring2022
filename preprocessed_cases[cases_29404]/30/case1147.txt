background 
statutory background 
in,congress passed the clean water act cwa or act to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.in order to attain this objective,congress sought to eliminate the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters by.id.
the act focuses on two possible sources of pollution point sources and nonpoint sources.congress dealt with the problem of point source pollution using the national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit process.under this approach,compliance rests on controls that limit the discharge of pollutants from any point source into certain waters unless that discharge complies with the act specific requirements.a.
when the npdes system fails to adequately clean up certain rivers,streams or smaller water segments,the act requires use of a based approach.states are required to identify such waters,which are to be designated as water quality limited segments wqls.the states must then rank these waters in order of priority,and based on that ranking,calculate levels of permissible pollution called total maximum daily loads or tmdls.d a,c.tmdls are the maximum quantity of a pollutant the water body can receive on a daily basis without violating the water quality standard.the tmdl calculations are to ensure that the cumulative impacts of multiple point source discharges and nonpoint source pollution are accounted for.states may then institute whatever additional cleanup actions are necessary,which can include further controls on point and nonpoint pollution sources.
under the act,states are required to submit lists of wqlss and tmdls to the epa at certain times the first such submission was due by june.d,d once a state makes the required submission,certain mandatory duties by epa are triggered.within days,epa must review the state submissions.if approved by epa,the submissions are incorporated by the state into its continuing planning process established under e.if epa does not approve the submission,however,the epa has days after disapproval to make its own identification of waters and establish tmdls necessary to implement the applicable water quality standards.d.the act is silent as to the nature of epa obligations if a state,such as california here,fails to make any initial submission at all.
california tmdl program 
as this is a review of summary judgment,we must construe the facts in the light most favorable to baykeeper,the party in this case.baykeeper contends that california did not submit any tmdls until,which was over years after the initial deadline for making a submission pursuant to d of the act.
since that time,however,california has dedicated substantial resources to the development of its tmdl program.according to the may report of the epa on california tmdl program review,the state has completed more than tmdls for waters on california lists.in addition,the report demonstrates that california has established a schedule for completing all tmdls for waters on its d lists within the next years.finally,the state has dedicated substantial resources to its tmdl program,allotting million annually to tmdl funding.

iii.discussion 
clean water act 
baykeeper argues that california failings under the cwa have triggered a duty on the part of the epa to establish tmdls for the entire state.in order to prevail on this claim,baykeeper must prove that epa has a nondiscretionary duty to establish tmdls for the state of california.see a limiting against epa to suits alleging epa has failed to perform a duty which is not discretionary.in attempting to prove such a duty,baykeeper relies upon d of the cwa.that section reads as follows 
each state shall submit to the administrator from time to time,with the first such submission not later than one hundred and eighty days after the date of publication of the first identification of pollutants under section a d of this title,for his approval the waters identified and the loads established under paragraphs a,b,c,and d of this subsection.the administrator shall either approve or disapprove such identification and load not later than thirty days after the date of submission.if the administrator approves such identification and load,such state shall incorporate them into its current plan under subsection e of this section.if the administrator disapproves such identification and load,he shall not later than thirty days after the date of such disapproval identify such waters in such state and establish such loads for such waters as he determines necessary to implement the water quality standards applicable to such waters and upon such identification and establishment the state shall incorporate them into its current plan under subsection e of this section.
d emphasis added.
baykeeper argues that epa duty under this statute has been triggered by both california failure to submit a tmdl between and and epa failure to disapprove of several of california d submissions.we find these arguments unpersuasive.
california submission of tmdls 
the district court,in construing d of the cwa,noted that the statute only requires the epa to act if it disapproves of a state tmdl submission.baykeeper,however,argues that this same duty is also invoked when a state either fails to submit or submits an inadequate tmdl listing.although not a novel issue,it is one that nonetheless has received little attention within this court.however,we note that other courts faced with this same issue have dealt with it using what has been termed the constructive submission doctrine.under this doctrine,a complete failure by a state to submit tmdls will be construed as a constructive submission of no tmdls,which in turn triggers the epa nondiscretionary duty to act.
the first case to employ this doctrine was the seventh circuit decision in scott city of hammond,cir.scott was a against the epa for failure to prescribe tmdls for pollutants discharged into lake michigan,after illinois and indiana had failed to do so.id.at.because of the lengthy absence of any state submissions,the seventh circuit concluded that the epa had an affirmative duty to treat the states inactions as a constructive submission,warranting the epa response under d.id.the court held,
we believe that,if a state fails over a long period of time to submit proposed tmdl,this prolonged failure may amount to the constructive
