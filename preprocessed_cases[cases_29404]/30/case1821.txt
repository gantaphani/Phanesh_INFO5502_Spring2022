appellant california water impact appeals from a judgment entered upon the trial court order granting the respondents,the newhall county water district the water district and real parties in interest,the city of santa clarita the city and gateking properties and mark gates motion for judgment on the pleadings on petition for a writ of mandate.petition requested that the trial court the water supply assessment wsa prepared by the water district at the request of the city as a part of the city environmental impact report eir and review process required under the california environmental quality act ceqa for a large scale park development proposed by gateking properties.the water district and the city filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,asserting among various arguments,that action was premature,and that a wsa is not subject to direct judicial review in mandamus proceedings.the trial court agreed,noting that wsas are properly challenged as part of ceqa review.
on appeal,asserts that it is entitled to directly challenge a wsa by way of either administrative or traditional mandamus because the wsa is a final determination of the water supplier concerning the sufficiency of the water supply for a proposed project,that it is not required to exhaust its administrative remedies with the city because the city lacks the authority to grant the relief it seeks,and that without an opportunity to assert a direct challenge the water suppliers will be able to evade direct review of the wsa.we do not agree.as we shall explain the wsa is a technical,informational document and not a final act or determination subject to direct mandamus review and failed to exhaust its administrative remedies the city had the authority to address claims concerning the wsa and until the city certified the eir and approved the project,the adequacy of the wsa was not subject to judicial challenge.in our view,the adequacy of wsa is properly challenged as a part of a challenge to an eir after project approval.consequently,the trial court here properly granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings and accordingly we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
gateking properties proposed building a park the project located near the intersection of the golden state freeway and the antelope valley freeway in the city of santa clarita as required by ceqa,public resources code section et,the city was required to prepare and certify an eir before it could approve the project.because the industrial park met the definition of project under the water code the city was required to include a water supply assessment wsa in the eir to assess the sufficiency of water supplies for the project before the city could approve it.at the request of the city,respondent the water district prepared the wsa for the project.thereafter,the city included the wsa in its eir.on june,after a formal review and comment period the city certified the eir the eir and approved the project.
the california oak foundation,the santa clarita oak conservancy and the santa clarita organization for planning the environment collectively know as scope petitioned the trial court for a writ of mandate scope requested the trial court order the city to set aside its certification of the final eir and related resolutions approving the project.scope claimed that the approval of the project,and the eir supporting it,violated ceqa because the eir overstated and misstated the extent of reliable sources of water.
the trial court found the eir to be adequate and denied the petition for a writ of mandate in march.scope appealed arguing among other contentions that insufficient evidence existed to support the eir conclusion that sufficient water supplies existed for the project see california oak foundation city of santa clarita,supra,th at,d.division eight of this district concluded the trial court erred in approving the eir because the section of the eir discussing water supplies was inadequate,but found no other defects in the eir,or other reversible errors.id.at,d.specifically division eight found that the eir did not adequately discuss or examine the legal uncertainties surrounding the availability of acre feet per year afy of imported water and failed to fully explain the conclusion that water supplies were sufficient notwithstanding the uncertainties.id.at,d.division eight ordered the trial court to decertify the eir for the project and to retain jurisdiction until the lower court determined that the city revised eir complied with ceqa.id.at,d.in february,the trial court issued a writ of mandate ordering the city to decertify the eir and to stay the city project approvals until it prepared and certified a revised eir which was consistent with the opinion expressed in california oak foundation and which complied with ceqa.the lower court further directed city to file a return to the writ to demonstrate compliance by.
thereafter,the city requested the water district to prepare and adopt a new wsa for the project.the water district prepared a new wsa.prior to the adoption of the new wsa by the water district,objected and urged the water district not to approve the new wsa as proposed.on march,the water district board considered and adopted the new wsa at its regular meeting.
on may,before the city had an opportunity to review and evaluate the new wsa and incorporate it into the revised eir filed a petition in the superior court for a preemptory writ of mandate under california code of civil procedure sections and as well as water code section,et and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the water district alleging the new wsa was legally deficient and misleading in a number of respects 
in october of the water district,the city and gateking filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the petition,arguing among other things that wsa was a technical,informational document and not a final act or determination subject to review under code of civil procedure section a wsa was neither a ministerial or legislative action subject to review under code of civil procedure section had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and that must object to the lead agency,the city first and that until the city had the eir and approved the project the adequacy of the wsa was not subject to judicial challenge lacks standing to challenge the wsa and that had failed to name the proper respondent in the action and the water code does not provide for private claims challenging a wsa.
on january,the trial court granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds articulated by the water district,the city and gateking,noting that wsa are not immune from judicial review,but must be challenged and reviewed as part of ceqa review.the court dismissed petition with prejudice and entered judgment against.
timely appeals.
discussion 
on appeal,asserts the court erred in granting the judgment on the pleadings because it is entitled to assert a direct challenge to the adequacy of the wsa in a mandamus proceeding under either california code of civil procedure section or section.as we explain below,we do not agree.
before turning to the underlying contentions,however,we address one preliminary matter.specifically we examine the effect of the trial court statement of decision in the california oak foundation case on the matter before us.indeed,underlying complaints concerning the wsa in this matter are nearly identical to those scope asserted concerning the revised eir,which the trial court rejected in discharging the writ in the california oak foundation case.
effect of the trial court statement of decision in california oak foundation.
in january,this court requested that the parties submit additional briefing in this appeal on the legal effect,if any,of the trial court conclusions in the statement of decision in california oak foundation on the sufficiency of the revised wsa.respondents asserted claims are the same as those asserted by the plaintiffs in california oak foundation,contending the trial court statement of decision in california oak foundation resolved the underlying contentions in petition for a writ of mandate filed in this case.acknowledging the statement of decision is now pending on appeal,respondents further maintain that when the statement of decision becomes final the appeal in this matter will be moot and thus,they requested that this court stay this appeal until the appeal of the statement of decision in california oak foundation is resolved.conceded this appeal might become moot based on the outcome of appeal in california oak foundation,and joined in the request that we stay this appeal.
we deny the request to stay this appeal.even if the final decision in california oak foundation effectively moots underlying challenge to the revised wsa,the california oak foundation decision will not resolve the significant matters of first impression at issue in this appeal.the courts have developed various doctrines to permit the appellate review of a case in which it is no longer possible to remedy the injury giving rise to the request for review.one exception to the mootness doctrine applies to those controversies that are capable of repetition and yet evading review.see conservatorship of wendland cal th,fn,d,district election.committee d.this is such a case.in our view,this appeal poses an issue of important public interest concerning whether wsa are subject to direct judicial challenge by agency prior to the certification of the eir and project approval.in addition,because this appeal does not itself concern the adequacy of the wsa the issues before us are necessarily distinct from those pending in the california oak foundation.given the increasing public focus and interest on water supply issues as they relate to land use and development we have no doubt that a challenge of this nature will arise again,and yet given the statutory timeframes imposed upon lead agencies under ceqa,the issues presented by this appeal may evade review.
consequently,this court exercises its discretion to resolve questions presented in this appeal even though the resolution of the california oak foundation might moot the underlying relief sought by in its petition.
ii.standard of review 
review of an order granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings is governed by the same standard applicable to reviewing an order sustaining a general demurrer.this court will examine only the face of the pleadings,together with matters subject to judicial notice,to determine whether such facts are sufficient to constitute a cause of action.a defendant is entitled to a judgment on the pleadings when it appears from the face of the complaint or on those matters judicially noticed that the complaint is barred as a matter of law.saltarelli steponovich douglas th,d.we review the pleadings de novo to determine whether the trial court erred in granting the motion.angelucci century supper club cal th,d.
iii.the trial court properly granted judgment in this matter.
on appeal argues the trial court erred in dismissing the petition for a writ of mandate asserts that it was entitled to relief under the code of civil procedure either section or section,arguing that the new wsa was subject to direct judicial challenge and the water district is a proper respondent in the proceedings.maintains the wsa constitutes a final determination that commits the water district to a course of action with serious implications,including a commitment that the water district would supply water to the project if it was approved.also asserts that it is not required to exhaust its remedies with the city because the city could not grant it the relief sought and thus absent a direct judicial challenge the wsa will evade review.
to assess contentions first requires an understanding of the law governing ceqa and the preparation of wsas and their use in the process of preparing and certifying eirs.it is to the consideration of these laws which we now turn our attention.
ceqa and eirs in general 
as division eight noted in california oak foundation an eir is an informational document.its purpose is to provide public agencies,and the public,with detailed information about the effect a proposed project is likely to have on the environment to list ways in which the significant effects of a project might be minimized and to indicate alternatives to a project.pub.resources code.before approving a project,the lead,the find either that the project significant environmental effects identified in the eir have been avoided or mitigated,or that unmitigated effects are outweighed by the project benefits.california oak foundation city of santa clarita,supra,th at,d,citing laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d,citing,and.if ceqa is scrupulously followed,the public will know the basis on which its responsible officials either approve or reject environmentally significant action,and the public,being duly informed,can respond accordingly to action with which it disagrees.laurel heights,supra,cal d at.
historical background of the wsa laws,and wsa framework and requirements and the wsa role in the eir and ceqa review 
in the california legislature enacted sb which later was codified at water code sections collectively referred to as the wsa law as an effort to ensure that water needs and supplies were analyzed by cities and counties before major developments were built.
under the version of water code section enacted in,any city or county,the lead agency preparing an environmental impact report eir for a qualifying project was required to request each potential water supplier for a wsa.the assessment was based on the supplier most recent urban water management plan and would indicate whether the supplier could meet the water supply needs of the project.sb,however,applied only to certain types of projects that exceeded a defined size the wsa had to indicate whether in the view of the water supplier there would be sufficient water to meet the project needs over a projected period that included single dry water years and multiple dry water years.if the supplies were inadequate,the lead agency conducting the environmental review had to be notified and the lead agency was required to include information received as a result of the assessment in the eir.after reviewing the assessments,the lead agency was required to make the final determination on whether sufficient water supply existed to meet the anticipated demand of the project as originally enacted in the wsa law framework did not contain any provisions to ensure that water suppliers provided water assessments and no mechanisms for ensuring that the assessments would be prepared or considered in the event that the water suppliers fail to provide them.see water code sections et see tepper,bruce,new water requirements for large scale developments.
notwithstanding the framework provided in sb,it soon became apparent to the courts that the water supply issues were not being adequately considered by lead agencies prior to the approval of a number of large scale projects.see,stanislaus heritage project county of stanislaus th,d court invalidated an eir for a large scale residential development where the wsa addressed only the first years of a phased project napa citizens for honest gov t napa county th,d court of appeal invalidated an eir based on findings including that the water supply analysis had not adequately addressed secondary water sources.
the legislature also observed the with sb,and in enacted sb and sb,designed to correct perceived deficiencies in sb sb and sb were intended to ensure that local land use authorities would thoroughly consider the availability of water supplies before approving major new developments.sb was intended to amend the water code section,et and applied to a wide range of residential,commercial,and industrial projects,while sb,which later was codified as government code section applied only to residential housing projects 
sb focused on improving the sb process by strengthening urban water management plans as well as the connection between water supply assessment and the plans or the equivalent level of analysis if there is no plan 
as amended in,water code section requires that,before approving any projects as defined in section,the lead agency must request a wsa from the water supplier most likely to serve the project,subd.b.the wsa must evaluate whether the total water supplies during a period will meet the projected water demand of the proposed project,subd.c.section,subdivision c allows the public water supplier to incorporate into the wsa information from the water system most recent urban water management plan,if the plan has taken the project demand into account.but if the plan has not taken the proposed project into account,or the public water system has no urban water management plan,the wsa for the project shall include a discussion with regard to whether the public water system total projected water supplies available during normal,and water years during a projection will meet the projected water demand associated with the proposed project,subd.c.section further states that the wsa shall include an identification of any existing water supply entitlements,water rights,or water service contracts relevant to the identified water supply for the proposed project,and a description of the quantities of water received in prior years by the public water system under the existing water supply entitlements,water rights,or water service contracts,subd.d.in addition,section indicates that if the water supply for the proposed project relies on ground water supplies additional specific information must be provided in the wsa see,subd.f.section provides that i f,as a result of its assessment,the public water system concludes that its water supplies are,or will be,insufficient,the public water system shall provide to the city or county its plans for acquiring additional water supplies,setting forth the measures that are being undertaken to acquire and develop those water supplies.see,subd.a.notwithstanding the assessments and projections that wsa law requires the water supplier to prepare and submit to the lead agency,section provides that the wsa provisions were not intended to create a right or entitlement to water service or any specific level of water service or to impose,expand,or limit any duty concerning the obligation of a public water system to provide certain service to its existing customers or to any future potential customers,subds.a b.
section,subdivision g specifies the timeframe for preparing and submitting wsa.specifically,the governing body of each public water system is required to approve the wsa at a regular or special meeting and must submit the wsa to the lead agency not later than days from the date on which the request was received.see,subd.g.in addition,subdivision g further states that if the water supplier fails to submit the wsa the lead agency may seek a writ of mandamus to compel the water supplier to comply.see,subd.g.
after the water supplier provides the wsa to the lead agency the law further dictates that the lead agency shall include the wsa in any ceqa environmental documents,namely the eir the lead agency prepares for the project,subd.b.section further provides the lead agency may include in any environmental document an evaluation of any information included in the wsa,subd.c.further the lead agency shall determine,based on the entire record,whether projected water supplies will be sufficient to satisfy the demands of the project,in addition to existing and planned future uses.if the city or county determines that water supplies will not be sufficient,the city or county shall include that determination in its findings for the project.ibid.
with this legal framework in mind,we turn to specific claims on appeal.
claims for mandamus relief.
on appeal argues it may assert a direct challenge against the water district assailing the adequacy of the water district wsa for the project pursuant to either code of civil procedure sections or 
a party may seek to set aside an administrative decision for failure to comply with ceqa by petitioning for either administrative mandamus code civ,or traditional mandamus code civ.western states petroleum association superior court cal th,d.
the appropriate type of mandate is determined by the nature of the administrative action or decision under review.in general,or adjudicative acts,that is,acts that involve the actual application of a rule to a specific set of existing facts are reviewed by administrative mandamus under code of civil procedure section.ohton board of trustees of cal.state university th,d.
more specifically,a petition for administrative mandamus under code of civil procedure section is appropriate when the party seeks review of a final determination,finding,or decision of a public agency,made as a result of a proceeding in which by law a hearing is required to be given,evidence is required to be taken and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in a public agency pub.resources code,see langsam city of sausalito d.it is well established that the intent of the legislature in enacting code of civil procedure section was to authorize judicial review only of the exercise by an administrative agency of an adjudicatory or function.see also cal.administrative mandamus,administrative mandamus is the procedure used to obtain judicial review of adjudicative decisions,decisions that determine what the facts are in relation to specific private rights or interests.in an action to set aside an agency decision under code of civil procedure section,the trial court inquiry extends only to whether a prejudicial abuse of discretion has occurred.abuse of discretion occurs if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law,or if its decision is not supported by substantial evidence.laurel heights,supra,cal d at.
in contrast,the actual formulation of the rule itself constitutes a act and is reviewed by ordinary mandate.pacific legal foundation california coastal commission cal d,adoption of guidelines interpreting coastal access provisions constituted agency action because guidelines governed future permit decisions rather than the application of the rules to a particular case and thus were reviewed under california civil procedure code section rather than section stores,city of turlock th,d traditional mandate the proper vehicle to challenge constitutionality of city zoning ordinance.a petition for traditional mandamus is appropriate in other actions brought to attack,review,set aside,or void a where in general no evidentiary hearing is held or ministerial determination,or decision of a public agency.ohton board of trustees of cal.state university,supra,th at,d see also pub,del mar terrace conservancy,city council th,d langsam city of sausalito,supra,d.where an agency is exercising a function,judicial review must proceed under ordinary or traditional mandamus.the trial court reviews an administrative action pursuant to code of civil procedure section to determine whether the agency action was arbitrary,capricious,or entirely lacking in evidentiary support,contrary to established public policy,unlawful,procedurally unfair,or whether the agency failed to follow the procedure and give the notices the law requires.lewin joseph hospital of orange d.even though mandate will not lie to control a public agency discretion,that is to say,force the exercise of discretion in a particular manner,it does lie to command the exercise of compel some action upon the subject involved.sunset drive corporation city of redlands th,d traditional mandamus appropriate vehicle to compel city to complete an eir because preparation of the document was a duty compelled by law state board of education honig th,d mandate will lie only where the respondent has a clear,present,and usually ministerial duty to act and the petitioner has a clear,present,and beneficial right to performance of that duty.
here asserts that code of civil procedure section should apply because the wsa was approved,as required by water code section,at a meeting where the public was invited to comment.asserts that the meeting constituted an evidentiary hearing under section code of civil procedure section.in the alternative,argues that traditional mandamus under code of civil procedure section would also be appropriate because it is available to challenge agency abuse of discretion.
for its part,the water district asserts neither form of mandamus is appropriate in this case.the water district maintains the meeting at which it approved the wsa does not qualify as an evidentiary hearing for the purposes of the code of civil procedure section.the water district asserts that although the meetings of the water district governing board are open and afford the public an opportunity to comment on agenda items,there is no requirement that evidence be offered at the meetings.consequently,the water district maintains that administrative mandamus is not available.in addition the water district argues that may not avail itself of traditional mandamus under code of civil procedure section because the determination at contents of the wsa and its not or ministerial acts.the water district argues that contents of the wsa are factual determinations and assessments based on the discretion and expert opinions of its professional staff.
this court need not decide which form of mandate would apply here,because the petition fails to satisfy prerequisites common to both administrative and traditional mandamus review.has failed to demonstrate that the wsa constitutes a final determination,finding,or decision of a public agency as that term is used in the context of administrative and traditional mandamus or that exhausted its administrative remedies.see lopez civil service commission of the city of san francisco d.the same principles,requirements and limitations,including finality and the exhaustion doctrine apply to writ proceedings under code of civil procedure sections and eight unnamed physicians medical executive committee of the medical staff of washington township hospital th,d exhaustion requirement applies whether relief is sought by traditional or administrative mandamus.
a decision attains the requisite administrative finality when the agency has exhausted its jurisdiction and possesses no further power to reconsider or rehear the claim.see long beach unified school district state d.finality may be defined either expressly in the statutes governing the administrative process or it may be determined from the framework in the statutory scheme.see du four unemployment insurance appeals board d.du four court rejected aggrieved employee effort to system of determination and review provided in statutory scheme by seeking direct judicial review of an unemployment insurance referee decision on benefits where statute provided for direct review by an appeals board.until a public agency makes a final decision,the matter is not ripe for judicial review.san bernardino public employees association city of fontana th,d where city had not yet agreed in a mou to reduce employee retiree benefits,court of appeal concluded that trial court prematurely granted a petition for a writ of mandate compelling the city to refrain from reducing or eliminating retiree benefits.
the wsa law does not expressly state when a wsa becomes final for the purpose of mandamus relief or for the purpose of requesting other judicial intervention.nonetheless,finality can be determined from a review of the wsa law framework.
where,as here,a lead agency requests a water supplier prepare and adopt a wsa for a particular project,the water supplier duty in so doing is defined and in detail in water code sections and.as described elsewhere,the water system provider most likely to supply the project must evaluate and prepare an assessment of whether the water supplies will meet the projected needs of the project,and if the water supplier determines that water supplies are not sufficient,the water supplier must describe its plans for acquiring additional water supplies.this notwithstanding,the code is also clear that nothing in the wsa itself or the statutes governing its preparation actually imposes any duty upon the water supplier to provide water services to the project.see.thus,in our view the wsa is,as the respondents and the amicus curiae posit,a technical,informational advisory opinion of the water provider.though the wsa is required by statute to include an assessment of certain statutorily identified water supply issues and is required to be included in the eir,the wsa role in the eir process is akin to that of other informational opinions provided by other entities concerning potential environmental as traffic,population density or air quality.the fact that the duties of the water provider in preparing the wsa and responsibility of the lead agency in requesting the wsa are committed to statute does not change the fundamental nature of the wsa itself as an advisory and informational document.this is true especially in view of the legislative history of sb.
sb was motivated by a concern that certain counties and cities were either ignoring or inadequately considering water supply issues prior to approving new developments.while the legislature wanted to ensure that lead agencies thoroughly considered water supply issues and wanted to add transparency to the entire process,the legislature committed the final determination on water supply issues to the lead agency,not the water providers.indeed an earlier iteration of the wsa law that gave the water providers ultimate determination of whether insufficient water supplies constituted a significant environmental effects under ceqa was rejected because opponents viewed it as shifting land use decision making authority from the cities and counties to water suppliers.
furthermore,there is no indication that the legislature intended to create an additional layer of judicial review or to provide an additional avenue for judicial intervention in the middle of the eir process at the behest of any party other than the lead agency.most telling in this respect is that on the same day the legislature enacted sb,it also enacted sb which provides third parties with an opportunity to seek judicial intervention under government code section to compel a water system to comply with the water verification law.that the legislature omitted the right to judicial intervention from sb is instructive as to how the wsa should be viewed in the larger context of the eir process.the wsa is but an interlocutory and preliminary step in the eir process,and in general,interim determinations are not subject to mandamus review.jones oxnard school district d.jones court rejected defendant attempt to seek mandamus review of action of school board in filing a statement of need for noncertificated teacher with the state board of education because school board action was a preliminary step by one government agency the school district enabling another the state board of education to act.
in same way that the referee decision was the final assessment as to the availability of unemployment benefits in du four,and that the filing of the statement of need was final as to the school board in jones,the wsa approved by a water provider may in fact constitute the final opinion of the provider as to the sufficiency of the current water supply final determination as to the provider plans for acquiring or developing additional water supplies.such finality,however,does not mean the wsa is final for the purposes of judicial intervention by way of mandamus review.
once the wsa is approved by the water provider governing board the wsa is submitted to the lead agency.the lead agency may then evaluate the information included in the wsa,subd.c.the power to evaluate wsa necessarily invests the lead agency with the authority to consider,assess and examine the quality of the information in the wsa and endows the lead agency with the right to pass judgment upon the wsa.while the lead agency must include the wsa in the eir,the lead agency is not required to accept the wsa conclusions.the lead agency may in evaluating the wsa accept or disagree with the water provider analysis or may request additional information from the water provider in any event,the lead agency is required by statute to make the ultimate determination,based on the entire record,whether water supplies are sufficient,subd.c.the lead agency may make a finding that adequate water supplies exist or do not exist to meet the project anticipated demand,even if that finding is inconsistent with the conclusions in the public water system assessment.
in short,because the adoption of a wsa does not create a right or entitlement to water service or impose,expand,or limit any duty concerning the obligation of a public water system to provide certain service and because the lead agency has a separate from the water provider wsa and independent obligation to assess the sufficiency of water supplies for the proposed project,we conclude the wsa is not a final agency decision,determination or action as that term is used in the context of mandamus relief.under the wsa law framework,the final decision for the purposes of writ review occurs only after the lead agency its obligations under the wsa and ceqa.
our conclusion that the wsa is not final for the purposes of mandamus review until the lead agency makes the final determination on the sufficiency of water supplies,the ceqa review is complete and the project is approved by the city is fully consistent with the manner in which judicial challenges are asserted to assail the adequacy of environmental impact determinations in general.a judicial proceeding challenging compliance with ceqa specifically attacking the adequacy of the eir,including the conclusions and analysis contained in an environmental assessment prepared for eir is properly commenced after the lead agency certifies the eir and approves the project.see,santa clarita organization of planning the environment county of los angeles th,d after the lead agency approved the eir,an environmental group filed a petition for an administrative writ of mandate challenging the adequacy of the water supply assessment contained in the eir mission oaks ranch,county of santa barbara th,d running of statute of limitations to challenge adequacy of an eir commences upon the filing of the lead agency determination on the matter thus judicial attack on the contents of an eir found to be untimely where challenger waited too long after the agency administrative decision to file its petition for writ of mandate,overruled on other grounds in briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,fn,d,county of amador el dorado county water district th,d ceqa challenges to project were not untimely where they were filed within statute of limitations period which commenced when the agency approved the project,agreeing to be legally bound to take a course of action county of san diego community college district th,d adequacy of college district findings on traffic impacts and traffic mitigation measures contained in eir properly challenged by way of writ of mandate filed after college district certified the eir and approved the master plan for the project.
thus,the wsa was not final for mandamus purposes when filed its petition.
exhaustion of administrative remedies 
likewise neglected to exhaust its available administrative remedies before seeking judicial intervention.
the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is a closely related concept to finality.the policy reasons behind the two doctrines are similar.the exhaustion doctrine precludes review of an intermediate or interlocutory action of an administrative agency.alta loma school district san bernardino county committee on school district reorganization d.alta loma.a party must proceed through the full administrative process to a final decision on the merits.la costa beach homeowners wayne d.each step in the administrative proceeding can not be reviewed separately,any more than each ruling in the trial of a civil action may be separately reviewed by a separate appeal.administrative proceedings should be completed before the issuance of a judicial writ.the rule is not a matter of discretion compliance is a jurisdictional prerequisite to judicial review.alta loma,supra,d at.exhaustion applies where a claim is cognizable in the first instance by an administrative agency alone judicial interference is withheld until the administrative process has run its course.united states western pacific railroad company,d,superceded by regulation on other ground in jones truck lines,aladdin synergetics.moreover,the exhaustion doctrine applies even where the administrative remedy is couched in permissive language.county of los angeles farmers insurance exchange d.although the insurance code did not expressly direct claimants to seek administrative remedies from the insurance commissioner prior to seeking judicial intervention,the broad statutory power afforded the insurance commissioner provided the authority to grant adequate remedies and thus claimants were not permitted to bypass the entire administrative process.
the principal purposes of exhaustion requirements include avoidance of premature interruption of administrative processes allowing an agency to develop the necessary factual background of the case letting the agency apply its expertise and exercise its statutory discretion administrative efficiency and judicial economy.mckart united states,d.the exhaustion doctrine is grounded on concerns favoring administrative autonomy,courts should not interfere with an agency determination until the agency has reached a final decision and judicial efficiency,overworked courts should decline to intervene in an administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary.farmers insurance exchange superior court cal th,d.
this notwithstanding,exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required where it appears the administrative board is without jurisdiction and thus the remedy is unavailable or where the remedy is inadequate.eight unnamed physicians medical executive committee of the medical staff of washington township hospital,supra,th at,d.in addition,exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine also exist where the administrative agency has made it clear it would be futile to pursue the administrative process to conclusion or where irreparable harm will result if judicial intervention is withheld until a final administrative decision is rendered.alta loma school district san bernardino county committee on school district reorganization,supra,d at.
in this case the issue is whether was required to submit its complaints about the wsa to the lead agency and wait until the lead agency acted prior to seeking judicial intervention.maintains that it is not required to seek redress from the lead agency because the city had no authority to disapprove,modify or the wsa and thus had no administrative remedy.
we disagree.as explained elsewhere herein,we interpret the city statutory authority derived from water code section to evaluate the wsa and the concomitant duty to make the final determination on the sufficiency of water supplies as empowering the city to approve or disapprove of the wsa or to request the water district to revise,modify,amend or supplement the wsa.
the matter before this court is similar to that presented in alta loma where certain school districts brought a mandamus proceeding challenging a county reorganization plan that would have caused the school districts to go out of existence.the school district sought to prohibit the transmittal of the plan to the state board of education.the school districts claimed,among other arguments,that they were not required to exhaust administrative remedies before the state board of education because the board did not have jurisdiction to assess some of the claims and therefore there was no available administrative remedy.alta loma school district san bernardino county committee on school district reorganization,supra,d at.the court of appeal disagreed concluding the county was entitled to a demurrer because the school districts had failed to exhaust the administrative remedies.specifically the school districts had failed to seek review from the state board of education of sufficiency of the proceedings before the county and of the reorganization plan whether the alleged procedural defects in the county committee proceedings occurred and,if so,whether the proposed reorganization plan should be disapproved are matters which come within the juri
