this appeal by the rhode island attorney general and the director of the rhode island department of environmental management challenges various rulings which prompted the district court to hold that appellee david laroche obligations to the state of rhode island,for its costs in remediating water contamination on property owned by laroche and for related civil penalties,were expunged by the chapter discharge subsequently obtained by laroche.we vacate and remand,with directions that judgment enter for appellants.
background 
in,appellants joined in citizen lawsuits brought against laroche in the united states district court for the district of rhode island,claiming violations of the clean water act cwa,et,and the rhode island water pollution control act riwpca,laws et the action.ultimately,the district court entered partial summary judgment for appellants,after determining that laroche had known,prior to purchasing the property,that its faulty septic system was polluting an adjacent river.see friends of sakonnet dutra.the amount of the remedial damages award against laroche remained unresolved.
creditors instituted involuntary chapter reorganization proceedings against laroche in january the order for relief was entered in february,see in re laroche,cir,and the chapter trustee was appointed on june.
meanwhile,the parties had negotiated a settlement of all the remedial issues in the action pending before the federal district court.whereupon the district court entered a consent decree,which stated,inter alia the intention of the parties is to resolve any pending disputes arising out of this matter.the only responsibilities and obligations that will survive are those set forth in this stipulation.
in due course,a special master was appointed to marshal a settlement fund from the state and the former owners of the laroche property for the purpose of acquiring an adjacent tract of land upon which to construct a new waste water collection and treatment facility.any excess acreage,over and above that required for the new facility,was to be sold to cover related project costs.
laroche agreed to reimburse the state for any shortfall amount,defined as the difference between ninety percent of the cost of the new waste water collection and treatment facility and the net proceeds from the sale of any excess acreage.in addition,laroche promised to affirm his obligation to pay the shortfall amount,to the extent then unpaid,as a debt not discharged in any bankruptcy proceeding in which he is the bankrupt whether now pending or hereafter filed.finally,laroche pledged to procure an order of the united states bankruptcy court for the district of rhode island in his involuntary bankruptcy proceeding affirming his obligation to pay the shortfall amount and to perform his other obligations hereunder.
all parties agreed to proceed expeditiously and in good faith with their respective obligations under the consent decree,which further provided as follows 
laroche hereby agrees to the imposition of a civil penalty under the rhode island water pollution control act and regulations issued thereunder equal to the shortfall amount.dem and the attorney general agree that the imposition of such civil penalty will be stayed for so long as laroche complies with his obligations under section of this stipulation,to seek reaffirmation of his obligation to pay this debt in his involuntary bankruptcy case for so long as any order procured from the bankruptcy court under section ii.d,an order approving laroche reaffirmation of his prepetition debt remains in effect.laroche specifically agrees that the civil penalty imposed hereunder constitutes a debt for a fine,penalty or forfeiture payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit,is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss and is specifically under a.
emphasis added.the district court explicitly retained continuing jurisdiction over this stipulation and the performance of the parties hereto.
although laroche was granted a chapter discharge,see on march,it was more than two years later,on april,before he finally submitted a motion to reaffirm the shortfall amount indebtedness.
following a hearing which appellants elected not to attend,the bankruptcy court rejected the motion to reaffirm submitted by laroche at the same time,the bankruptcy court expressed concern that its rejection of the motion to reaffirm might obstruct the state efforts to recover the shortfall amount.accordingly,the bankruptcy court directed that its laroche motion to reaffirm the shortfall amount served upon all parties to the consent decree and t hat all entities who oppose the entry of this order shall have ten days from the entry of this order within which to file a motion under fed.to alter and amend this order.
appellants elected not to submit a rule motion,opting instead for a motion before the district court which had retained jurisdiction over the consent decree seeking a judicial declaration that laroche had breached the reaffirmation agreement,thereby rendering himself liable for the alternative civil penalty in a sum equal to the shortfall amount,estimated at more than one million dollars.laroche responded that i the consent decree was void and unenforceable due to appellants failure to comply with the prerequisites to reaffirmation,see bankruptcy code c,c,and ii consequently,the general discharge he was granted relieved him of all liabilities,including those asserted by appellants.
for their part,appellants argued that the consent decree itself expressly defined the civil penalty imposed upon laroche as a fine payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit,rather than as compensation for actual pecuniary loss.accordingly,appellants contended,the civil penalty imposed against laroche was rendered nondischargeable as a matter of law.see id.a.
in due course,the district court determined that the characterization which the consent decree ascribed to the laroche indebtedness for the civil penalty in the shortfall,a nondischargeable civil penalty was not conclusive.consequently,the district court opined,in order to safeguard their rights it was incumbent upon appellants not only to have submitted a proof of claim,but also to have commenced an adversary proceeding to obtain a bankruptcy court ruling that the laroche indebtedness for the shortfall amount was a nondischargeable civil penalty.failing that,the district court reasoned,the general discharge in bankruptcy granted laroche in the bankruptcy court presumptively discharged the civil penalty in the shortfall amount as contemplated by the consent decree.
discussion 
appellants contend that the explicit language employed in the consent a contingent civil penalty if and whenever laroche were to default on his obligation to procure bankruptcy court approval of the reaffirmation agreement relating to the shortfall amount indebtedness to the civil penalty nondischargeable under bankruptcy code a,a.accordingly,appellants insist,the interpretation the district court ascribed to the consent decree contravened the law of the case doctrine,which makes binding upon a court a ruling made in the same level of court during prior stages of the same litigation.lacy gardino,cir.
the district court,that appellants failed either to establish or preserve their entitlement to a judicial determination that their claim was excepted from us with a mixed question of law and fact subject to de novo review.see,warfel city of saratoga,cir.bap noting that dischargeability exceptions under a normally turn upon whether undisputed facts fit pertinent legal rule.similarly,a judicial interpretation of the terms of a consent decree is subject to plenary review.see braxton united states,d.
bankruptcy code a excepts from discharge in bankruptcy any debt for a fine,penalty,or forfeiture payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit,which is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss.a.thus,in order to establish that the instant consent decree imposed a nondischargeable obligation upon laroche,appellants needed to establish that their claim was based on i a fine,penalty,or forfeiture,ii payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit,and iii not compensation for actual pecuniary loss.id.were appellants required to relitigate the dischargeability issue de novo,there may well have been substantial impediments to overcome.we explain.
although bankruptcy code a applies both to civil and criminal penalties,see dep t of hous.urban dev.cost control mktg.sales mgmt.of,cir,in order to qualify for a dischargeability exception under subsection a,normally the particular penalty must serve some punitive or rehabilitative governmental aim,rather than a purely compensatory purpose.see kelly robinson,d.
appellants contend that these civil penalties,imposed pursuant to rhode island law,see laws,were designed to deter and remediate environmental contamination,a particularly important governmental function implemented under the state police and regulatory powers.moreover,appellants argue,laroche potentially was exposed to fines up to per day,a sum which bears neither any obvious nor essential correlation to the amount needed to compensate the state for its actual response costs.
on the other hand,there can be no question but that the consent decree itself explicitly equates the amount of these civil penalties with the shortfall amount,which in turn plainly was designed to reimburse the state for its actual losses,neither more nor less.appellants respond,however,that their decision to calculate the punitive fines under that convenient methodology can not deprive these civil penalties of their punitive nature.see,state bar of doerr in re doerr.we need not resolve these issues,however,since the consent decree itself disposes of the contention that appellants claim is excepted from discharge under bankruptcy code a.
first,the district court erred,as a matter of law,in ruling that appellants forfeited their rights by not commencing a timely adversary proceeding to determine the dischargeability of these debts while the laroche bankruptcy proceeding was pending.normally,the bankruptcy code enables a debtor to obtain a discharge from all debts that arose before the date of the order for relief.bankruptcy code b see also id.a.any claim for environmental contamination asserted against laroche plainly arose prior to the chapter petition.see id.defining claim as a right to payment,whether or not such right is reduced to judgment,fixed,or contingent.consequently,absent exceptional circumstances not present here,any liability incurred for environmental contamination would have been extinguished by the discharge in bankruptcy laroche obtained in.
on the other hand,under the terms of the consent decree,laroche became liable to appellants for two distinct debts the shortfall amount and the contingent civil penalty.thus,as appellants correctly point out,the present case implicates two distinct dischargeability exceptions.
first,a debtor represented by counsel may reaffirm any lawful debt by entering into a written reaffirmation agreement which strictly comports with the criteria prescribed in bankruptcy code c.the mandated criteria require that the reaffirmation agreement i be executed before the subsection a discharge has been granted ii be in consideration for a dischargeable debt,whether or not the debtor waived discharge of the debt iii include clear and conspicuous statements that the debtor may rescind the reaffirmation agreement at any time prior to the granting of the general discharge,or within sixty days after the execution of the reaffirmation agreement,whichever occurs later,and that reaffirmation is neither required by the bankruptcy code nor by nonbankruptcy law iv be filed with the bankruptcy court and v be accompanied by an affidavit of the debtor attorney attesting that the debtor was fully advised of the legal consequences of the reaffirmation agreement,that the debtor executed the reaffirmation agreement knowingly and voluntarily,and that the reaffirmation agreement would not cause the debtor undue,financial hardship.id.c 
an entirely voluntary,fully informed reaffirmation agreement meeting the demanding requirements of bankruptcy code enables a creditor to undertake all lawful efforts to recover a reaffirmed debt as though no petition in bankruptcy had been filed.see ripple boston whaler fin.servs.in re ripple.otherwise,a reaffirmation agreement is void and unenforceable.see bessette avco fin,cir see also bassett am,in re bassett,cir.bap.
the consent decree in the instant case required that laroche submit a motion to reaffirm only the non penalty debt for the shortfall amount shortfall debt.unlike the contingent civil penalty,which was stayed,the shortfall debt presumptively constituted a dischargeable debt that is,one which could not be excepted from discharge unless laroche entered into a valid agreement to reaffirm it.
second,and altogether apart from whether a particular reaffirmation agreement is enforceable,an eligible creditor may be entitled to invoke any one or more among the sixteen exceptions to discharge enumerated in bankruptcy code a.in this connection,appellants once again posit that the alternative civil penalty contemplated by the consent decree came within an exception to discharge,since it is for a fine,penalty or forfeiture payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit,and is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss.bankruptcy code a a.
unlike motions to reaffirm,which may be filed only by debtors,see supra note,either a debtor or a creditor may commence an adversary proceeding to determine the dischargeability vel non of a debt under subsection a.see galbreath.dep of in re galbreath,citing fed.a and.the fundamental fresh start policy underlying the bankruptcy code requires that the exceptions to discharge prescribed in subsection a be narrowly construed by the courts,and established by a preponderance of the evidence by the claimant asserting the dischargeability exception.see grogan garner,d seton hall van ess in re van ess.
although bankruptcy code sections and frequently overlap in application,each entails discrete criteria and procedures pertinent to the instant case.the laroche reaffirmation agreement purported to serve two distinct ends a laroche promised to submit a subsection c motion to confirm,reaffirm the prepetition obligation to reimburse appellants for the shortfall amount,presumably because that indebtedness i had not yet been converted to a contingent civil fine or penalty ii would not qualify for an exception to discharge under subsection a and iii presumptively would be covered by a general discharge in bankruptcy and b the reaffirmation agreement explicitly stipulated that should laroche default on his reaffirmation agreement with regard to the shortfall amount,the shortfall amount would become a nondischargeable civil penalty under subsection a.
appellants correctly refrain from contending that the first component of the consent decree,the reaffirmation provision relating to the shortfall amount is enforceable,since the consent decree did not include the requisite clear and conspicuous statement either informing laroche that he could rescind the reaffirmation agreement or that reaffirmation was not obligatory under either the bankruptcy code or applicable nonbankruptcy law.moreover,the debt reaffirmation provision contained no representation that reaffirmation would not cause laroche undue hardship.accordingly,even if a timely motion to reaffirm the shortfall amount indebtedness had been submitted by laroche,see supra note,it would not have been allowable.
yet the district court ruled as well that appellants right to recover the civil penalty had been forfeited the bankruptcy court rejected the laroche motion to to either i their deliberate refusal to intervene in the reaffirmation proceeding for the purpose of submitting a motion to amend the bankruptcy court order disallowing the reaffirmation,but see supra note,ii their failure to commence an adversary proceeding to obtain a judicial determination that the contingent civil penalty asserted against laroche was nondischargeable under bankruptcy code a.these district court rulings constituted reversible error.
a creditor intent on establishing that its
