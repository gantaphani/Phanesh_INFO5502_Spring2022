engine manufacturers association ema challenges certain regulations adopted by the california air resources board carb requiring engine manufacturers to obtain a sample of emissions of engines equipped with diagnostic obd systems that are nearing the end of their certified useful life and conduct a series of tests on these engines to assure that engines certified for sale in california are equipped with obd systems that properly function,tit,subd.a,subds.a,c.the challenged regulations also contain provisions requiring carb to order the recall and repair of all engines that have been determined to be equipped with a obd system where certain conditions exist,subd.d.ema operative complaint sought a judicial declaration that the challenged regulations,which will be described in greater detail in the background portion of this opinion,are in excess of carb statutory authority and therefore invalid.the trial court granted ema motion for judgment on the pleadings and declared the challenged regulations invalid.carb appeals.
we reverse.as we explain,the legislature has granted carb broad authority to adopt regulations designed to reduce air pollution caused by motor vehicle emissions as expeditiously as possible,subject to and feasibility limitations.see health.while carb has no power to vary or enlarge the terms of an enabling statute,and may not issue regulations which conflict with an enabling statute or any other statute,the absence of any specific provisions regarding manufacturer testing of engines equipped with obd systems and mandatory recall of engines determined to be equipped with a obd system does not mean that such regulation s exceed statutory authority in our view,it indicates only that the legislature did not itself desire to determine the proper method of regulating such systems.citations.courts have long recognized that the legislature may elect to defer to and rely upon the expertise of administrative agencies.citations.credit ins.agents payne cal d,payne.we conclude the challenged regulations fall within the scope of authority conferred by the legislature unless manufacturer testing of obd systems on engines is prohibitively costly.however,the question of prohibitive cost can not be settled on the pleadings.the remaining question,whether the regulations are reasonably necessary to effectuate the statutory purpose,was not properly raised in ema motion for judgment on the pleadings.nor does ema advance an argument regarding the issue on appeal.we therefore reverse and remand the matter to the trial court with directions to deny ema motion for judgment on the pleadings.
background 
carb is the state agency charged with coordinating efforts to attain and maintain ambient air quality standards,to conduct research into the causes of and solution to air pollution,and to systematically attack the serious problem caused by motor vehicles,which is the major source of air pollution in many areas of the state.ema is a trade association representing manufacturers of engines used in motor vehicles,including the engines covered by the challenged regulations.
on board diagnostic systems 
carb requires most engines in vehicles certified for sale in california to be equipped with an obd system,tit,subd.b applies to and subsequent passenger cars,trucks,and vehicles and engines,subd.b applies to and subsequent engines.these obd systems,through the use of an onboard computer s,shall monitor emission systems for the actual life of the engine and shall be capable of detecting malfunctions of the monitored emission systems,illuminating a malfunction indicator light mil to notify the vehicle operator of detected malfunctions,and storing fault codes identifying the detected malfunctions,subd.a,subd.a.the declared purpose of requiring such systems is to ensure reductions in motor vehicle and motor vehicle engine emissions through improvements of emission system durability and performance,subd.a.ema does not challenge this requirement.
pre certification testing of obd systems 
before manufacturers are permitted to sell new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines,carb must certify that the vehicle or engine meets emission standards,subd.a.section requires carb to adopt and implement such standards,subject to the requirement that they be necessary and technologically feasible to carry out the purposes of division of the health and safety code,subd.a.section requires carb to adopt,by regulation,test procedures and any other procedures necessary to determine whether the vehicles or engines are in compliance with the emissions standards established pursuant to section,and further provides such procedures shall be based on federal test procedures or on driving patterns typical in the urban areas of california.
vehicles are tested for emission compliance on a chassis dynamometer,a platform with large steel rollers on which the vehicle can be operated at prescribed speeds for prescribed periods of time.vehicle emissions are measured and compared against the applicable emission standards.vehicle engines are typically tested for emission compliance outside their intended vehicle on an engine dynamometer,a machine that can cause the engine to operate at prescribed speeds and under prescribed loads for long or short periods of time to generate an operating cycle that is representative of how the engine might operate in a vehicle driving on california roads.equipment attached to the engine measures and compares the emissions generated against applicable standards.
as part of the certification process,manufacturers of vehicle engines must demonstrate that the engine obd system will function properly for the actual life of the engine,the entire period that an engine is operated on public roads in california up to the time an engine is retired from use,tit,subds.c,d.this can be as much as miles for the heaviest vehicles.in order to demonstrate the performance and durability of the obd system,manufacturers put a certain number of test engines through an accelerated aging process on an engine dynamometer and then test the obd system ability to detect various malfunctions by replacing each of the engine major emission controls,one at a time,with malfunctioning emission controls,subd.i.if the engine obd system illuminates an mil prior to emissions exceeding the applicable emission threshold malfunction criteria specified in the regulation,the obd system has passed the test and no further demonstration is required,subd.i.ema does not challenge these testing requirements.
the challenged regulations 
the challenged regulations require engine manufacturers to verify obd system performance by duplicating the testing on a sample of production engines,starting with the model year,tit,subd.l,subd.c c.in selecting engines to be included in the test sample group,manufacturers are required to use only engines that,among other things,are certified to the requirements of title of the california code of regulations,section and have mileage that is between to percent of the certified full useful life mileage and an age of less than the certified full useful life age for the subject engines,subd.c c i.the number of engines to be tested depends on the model year and the number of engine families certified by the manufacturer in that model year for example,f or the and subsequent model years,a manufacturer certifying one to five engine families in a model year shall provide emission test data of a test engine from one engine rating.a manufacturer certifying six to ten engine families in a model year shall provide emission test data from test engines from two engine ratings.a manufacturer certifying eleven or more engine families in a model year shall provide emission test data of test engines from three engine ratings,subd.c b ii.testing must be completed w ithin three calendar years after the model year of the engine,by the end of calendar year for a model year engine,subd.c a.
as with the testing,if the obd system properly illuminates an mil prior to emissions exceeding the applicable emission threshold malfunction criteria,no further testing is required,tit,subd.c a.if,however,the obd system does not illuminate an mil for one or more monitors before emissions exceed the malfunction criteria,the engine manufacturer shall conduct further testing on additional engines,subd.c b.specifically,within six months after the completion of the failed test,the engine manufacturer shall test an additional four engines from the same engine rating and engine family as the failed test engine,but shall be required to test only the monitors for which the obd system did not illuminate the mil before emissions exceeded the malfunction criteria,subd.c b i,ii.if the obd system on three or more of the additional test engines properly illuminates the mil for the tested monitor or monitors before emissions exceed the malfunction criteria,no further testing is required,subd.c c.however,if the obd system on two or more of the additional test engines also fails the test,the engine manufacturer shall test an additional five engines from the same engine rating and engine family as the previously tested engines,subd.c d i,ii.
the manufacturer is required to submit a report of the test results to carb executive officer,who shall make a determination as to nonconformance of the obd system in the engine class using specified criteria,tit,subd.c a.for example,f or through model year engines all engines classified as obd parent and child ratings shall be considered to be nonconforming if the emission test results indicate that percent or more of the engines in the test sample group do not properly illuminate the mil when emissions exceed times the malfunction criteria,times the standard if the malfunction criterion is times the standard,subd.b a ii.
among other remedial actions,the challenged regulations require the executive officer to order the recall and repair of all engines in an engine class that have been determined to be equipped with a nonconforming obd system if one or more of a list of criteria is satisfied,tit,subd.d a.for example,f or through model year obd parent and child ratings,recall is required if testing or other information received from the manufacturer indicates the obd system is unable to detect and illuminate the mil for a malfunction of a monitored by the major monitor prior to emissions exceeding a three times the applicable major monitor malfunction criteria,if the malfunction criteria is times the applicable standard,recall would be required when emissions exceed times the applicable standard,subd.d a ii.exceptions to the mandatory recall requirement are provided for in the regulations,subd.d b.upon issuance of a recall order,the manufacturer may contest the decision at a public hearing,subd.d.finally,the challenged regulations require manufacturers to develop a remedial action plan when initiating a remedial action other than payment of monetary penalties and provide for penalties for failure to comply with such an action plan,subds.e a,f.
the present lawsuit and motion for judgment on the pleadings 
in july,ema filed the present lawsuit seeking a judicial declaration that the challenged regulations are in excess of carb statutory authority and therefore invalid.the complaint alleges carb exceeded its statutory authority by adopting regulations that i unlawfully require hd engine manufacturers to conduct onerous and costly obd system testing of hd diesel engines that have been sold into commerce,and that are beyond the manufacturers custody and control and ii unlawfully mandate the recall of hd diesel engines without the required showing under california law that there has been a violation of an emission standard or emissions test procedure.
the following month,carb filed an answer.ema filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings in november.with the motion,ema requested that the trial court take judicial notice of the challenged regulations,an unpublished superior court decision in an unrelated case,a copy of an agreement entered into between carb,ema,and certain engine manufacturers,and portions of carb rulemaking file for the challenged regulations.in january,carb filed an opposition to the motion and requested that the trial court take judicial notice of an executive order issued by its executive officer certifying certain vehicles as meeting emission standards and indicating the certified engines would be subject to testing under title of the california code of regulations,section,subdivision c.the following month,ema filed a reply memorandum and requested that the trial court take judicial notice of certain additional regulations,tit,and a document detailing carb share of the governor proposed budget.
the trial court,through judge thomas warriner,issued a tentative decision denying the motion for judgment on the pleadings initial tentative decision.the initial tentative decision divided the challenged regulations into two categories obd testing provisions and recall provisions.with respect to the former,the tentative decision assumed carb lacked express statutory authority to issue the challenged regulations,but concluded,the pleadings do not settle the issue of carb implied authority to do so,explaining whether carb possesses the implied authority to sustain the challenged regulations depends on whether the regulations are consistent with carb statutory mandates,as opposed to contradicting them.citation.in adopting regulations to enforce its mandates,carb is not limited to the exact provisions of any statute.citation.carb can fill up the details of the statutory scheme.citation.hence,for example,the california supreme court held in western oil gas orange county air pollution control dist.cal d that carb authority to control vehicle emissions brought with it the implied authority to regulate lead,a fuel input.the western oil court,however,reasoned that carb possessed this implied authority because,without it,carb would have had no realistic means of controlling the emissions the legislature had empowered it to reduce.citation.this reasoning,combined with the standards governing motions for judgment on the pleadings,lead the court in the instant case to conclude that the ema motion for judgment on the pleadings should be denied.the initial tentative decision also noted ema argument the obd testing regulations are prohibitively costly,found this to be potentially problematic because t he legislature could not have authorized carb to issue regulations with which manufacturers have no means to comply,but explained carb denials as to the prohibitive nature of the cost prevented the court from granting ema motion for judgment on the pleadings.
with respect to the challenged recall provisions,the initial tentative decision concluded carb possesses the implied authority to order a manufacturer recall of engines that fail the obd testing,explaining as indicated above,carb has broad mandates to reduce vehicle emissions,including diesel emissions from vehicles.as the court understands them,the recall regulations at issue are meant to minimize the likelihood that vehicles with defective obd systems will remain in use without the capacity to notify vehicle operators that inspections and repairs may be required.the court does not see how such regulations are inconsistent with the powers that the legislature has granted carb.the initial tentative decision also requested that the parties address three questions regarding the obd testing issue and three questions regarding the recall issue at the time of the hearing on the motion.
in july,prior to the hearing on the motion,the matter was transferred to judge shelleyanne chang.judge chang directed the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing the issues raised in the initial tentative decision.carb supplemental brief came with an additional request that the trial court take judicial notice of a resolution stating carb findings that the challenged regulations are necessary,and technologically feasible and a united states environmental protection agency epa document granting carb a federal clean air act preemption waiver for its obd system regulations applicable to and vehicles.ema also submitted the requested supplemental brief as well as a rebuttal to carb supplemental brief.the following month,the trial court issued a tentative decision denying ema motion for a very different reason standing.the tentative decision explained carb has not opposed the motion on the ground that ema lacks standing or that the pleadings do not present a justiciable controversy sufficient to advance a declaratory relief action.indeed,the parties and the court have proceeded on the assumption that the complaint and answer present a justiciable controversy over which the court may exercise jurisdiction.thus the court issued a detailed tentative ruling and requested supplemental briefing relative to certain substantive issues.on further review of the pleadings,however,the court observes that carb denied ema allegations regarding its associational standing to challenge the subject regulations.this denial appears to be dispositive.
because carb never intended to challenge ema standing to bring the lawsuit,pursuant to an agreement between the parties,ema redrafted the factual basis for its standing in an amended complaint filed in september.carb answer admitted ema allegations regarding standing and denied almost every other allegation of the complaint.ema then filed a new motion for judgment on the pleadings.the parties filed nearly identical versions of their earlier briefs,their supplemental briefs as exhibits to the primary briefs,and requested that the trial court take judicial notice of the same documents previously requested.
in june,the trial court judge chang granted each request for judicial notice except with respect to the unpublished superior court decision and the settlement agreement,noting it would not accept the truth of the factual assertions therein,and granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings the trial court first ruled the challenged regulations did not fall within carb broad authority to adopt regulations that reduce air pollution resulting from emissions,explaining carb states that the obd systems on heavy duty engines result in significantly lower exhaust emissions.although carb cites to a portion of the rulemaking file that was judicially noticed to support this position,the court does not accept the truth of the factual assertions therein.citation.carb further states that testing of diagnostic systems and recalls of defective systems ensure that the systems function properly and achieve this result.this general statement,however,is not supported by the language of the challenged regulations.the definition of nonconforming obd system states that for purposes of section,an engine class shall be considered nonconforming irrespective of whether engines in the engine class,on average,meet applicable tailpipe or evaporative emission standards.carb may order recall of engines in an engine class that have been equipped with nonconforming obd systems.citation.based on the explicit language of the regulation a nonconforming obd system is not related to emission standards,the testing could result in the recall of engines even if,on average,they meet emission standards.thus,the testing may not assist in the attainment of air quality standards.accordingly,the challenged regulations do not fall within carb broad authority to regulate pollution from emissions.
the trial court also concluded sections and,which will be described more fully in the discussion portion of this opinion,did not authorize carb to adopt the challenged regulations because these statutory provisions unambiguously apply to new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines,not vehicles.nor would these provisions save the challenged regulations even if they applied to vehicles because,contrary to section,they allow the recall without first demonstrating that the manufacturer has violated emission standards or test procedures.finally,the trial court concluded the challenged regulations were not reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of sections and.

motions for judgment on the pleadings are usually made by defendants.in such instances the motion is the equivalent of a general demurrer,and on appeal from the judgment the appellate court will assume the truth of all facts properly pleaded in the complaint.citation.motions by a plaintiff for judgment on the pleadings,which are less common,are the equivalent of a demurrer to an answer,and the standard of review is obverse the appellate court will assume the truth of all facts properly pleaded in the answer and will disregard the controverted allegations of the complaint.citations.sebago,city of alameda d,sebago.such a motion must be denied if the defendant pleadings raise a material issue or set up affirmative matter constituting a defense.macisaac pozzo cal d.stated differently,w here the answer,fairly construed,suggests that the defendant may have a good defense,a motion for judgment on the pleadings should not be granted.barasch epstein d.

aside from admitting the challenged regulations were adopted,they relate to the obd systems motor vehicle engine manufacturers design and install into their diesel engine products,and other similarly matters,carb denied each allegation of ema complaint.thus,the practical effect of the standard of review is to bring before us the text of the challenged regulations and statutes authorizing carb to adopt such regulations,which we must independently review for consistency under the first prong of the analysis.see sebago,supra,d at.as already indicated,the second prong of the analysis was not properly raised in ema motion for judgment on the pleadings.nor does ema advance an argument regarding the issue on appeal.however,because the trial court appears to have ruled on the issue,we note carb reasons for adopting the challenged regulations can be found in portions of the rulemaking file,which were judicially noticed by the trial court,but effectively disregarded with the statement the trial court would not accept the truth of the factual assertions therein.a trial judge deciding a motion for judgment on the pleadings may also consider,in addition to facts pleaded,any matters subject to judicial notice.id.at.we too may consider the rulemaking file on appeal,and we may take judicial notice of the rulemaking file in a tenor different from that noticed by the trial court,subd.a.the burden was on ema to demonstrate the rulemaking file does not reasonably support the challenged regulations in light of the purposes of the statute s authorizing the regulations.payne,supra,cal d at.

we conclude the trial court erred in granting ema motion for judgment on the pleadings because carb answer,fairly construed,suggests the agency may have a good defense.barasch epstein,supra,d at.we reach this conclusion for the same reasons expressed in the initial tentative decision.specifically,as we explain immediately below,unless manufacturer testing of obd systems on engines is prohibitively costly,the challenged regulations are in harmony with,and not in conflict with or contradictory to,existing provisions of law.california of medical products suppliers maxwell jolly th,quoting,subd.d.however,the question of prohibitive cost can not be settled on the pleadings.nor can the question of reasonable necessity.
statutory authority 
under the first prong of the analysis,we independently review the challenged regulations for consistency with controlling law.communities for a better environment california resources agency,supra,th at.as our supreme court has explained q rules are reviewed independently for consistency with controlling law.a court does not,in other words,defer to an agency view when deciding whether a regulation lies within the scope of the authority delegated by the legislature.the court,not the agency,has final responsibility for the interpretation of the law under which the regulation was issued.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,fn.in interpreting the statutes granting regulatory authority to carb,we employ rules of statutory construction.our fundamental task is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.we first examine the statutory language,giving it a plain and commonsense meaning.we do not examine that language in isolation,but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment.if the language is clear,courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the legislature did not intend.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.citations.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th.
section,subdivision a,requires carb to adopt standards,rules,and regulations necessary for the proper execution of the powers and duties granted to,and imposed upon,carb by division of the health and safety code and by any other provision of law.one of carb statutory duties is to systematically attack the serious problem caused by motor vehicles,which is the major source of air pollution in many areas of the state.see also,subd.a emission of air pollutants from motor vehicles is the primary cause of air pollution in many parts of the state.more specifically,section,subdivision a,grants carb the authority to adopt and implement motor vehicle emission standards,performance standards,and motor vehicle fuel specifications for the control of air contaminants and sources of air pollution which carb has found to be necessary,and technologically feasible,to carry out the purposes of this division,unless preempted by federal law.italics added.section,subdivision c,directs carb to adopt standards and regulations which will result in the most combination of control measures on all classes of motor vehicles and motor vehicle fuel,including,among others,r eductions in emissions from motor vehicles through improvements in emission system durability and performance.subdivision a of this section requires carb to endeavor to achieve the maximum degree of emission reduction possible from vehicular and other mobile sources in order to accomplish the attainment of the state standards at the earliest practicable date,subd.a see also,subd.h intent of the legislature that carb act as expeditiously as is feasible to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel vehicles which significantly contribute to air pollution problems,subd.b declaring need for substantial improvements in the durability of vehicle emissions systems.
read together,these statutes grant carb broad authority to adopt regulations,including performance standards,designed to reduce air pollution caused by motor vehicle emissions as expeditiously as possible,subject to and feasibility limitations.performance standard means a regulation that describes an objective with the criteria stated for achieving the objective.without repeating all of the details,the challenged regulations require engine manufacturers to perform testing on a sample of their engines to verify obd system performance,tit,subd.l,subd.c c.these testing provisions describe an objective,the proper functioning of the obd system,subd.a,and set criteria for achieving that objective,the malfunction criteria defined in title of the california code of regulations,section,subdivisions e through g,subd.c.we conclude these provisions qualify as performance standards within the meaning of government code section,and specifically,performance standards within the meaning of section.if the testing reveals the obd system does not function properly,in other words,is not able to detect a fault before emissions exceed the malfunction criteria,tit,subd.c,another set of criteria is used to determine whether carb executive officer is required to order a recall.see,subd.d a.such an enforcement mechanism is also within carb regulatory authority.see motor equipment mfrs,environmental protection agency,the absence or ineffectiveness of an enforcement program might endanger the ability of the standards to accomplish the levels of emissions they seek,and thus an indirect relationship exists between enforcement procedures and the public health and welfare.
we also conclude the challenged regulations are designed to reduce air pollution caused by emissions from motor vehicles through facilitating prompt repair of malfunctions and by providing an incentive to manufacturers to make improvements in emission system durability and performance.as stated in the rulemaking file by alerting the owner of malfunctions as they occur,repairs can be sought promptly,which results in fewer emissions from the vehicle.additionally,the obd system stores important information including identification of the faulty component or system and the nature of the fault,which would allow for quick diagnosis and proper repair of the problem by technicians.this helps owners achieve less expensive repairs and promotes repairs done correctly the first time.moreover,in adopting the challenged regulations,carb anticipated that the manufacturers will produce increasingly durable,more robust components in order to avoid customer dissatisfaction that may be caused by frequent illumination of the mil because of malfunctions.we can not agree with the trial court that statements in the rulemaking file regarding the purpose of the challenged regulations must be disregarded.we need not accept the truth of these statements,properly working obd systems actually result in fewer emissions,or manufacturers would in fact produce more durable emissions systems in response to the challenged regulations.for present purposes,it suffices to note the challenged regulations were designed with such objectives in mind.whether they are reasonably necessary to achieve the objectives is a matter for the second stage of the analysis.
nor do we agree with the trial court conclusion the definition of nonconforming obd system found in title of the california code of regulations,section,subdivision a,negates the stated purpose of the challenged regulations.an obd system is considered nonconforming irrespective of whether engines in the engine class,on average,meet other applicable emission standards,exhaust emission standards defined in title of the california code of regulations,section,evaporative emission standards defined in title of the california code of regulations section,tit,subd.a.borrowing an analogy from carb opening brief,obd systems are akin to smoke detectors.the purpose of requiring properly functioning obd systems is to reduce emissions and related damage to the environment by alerting the vehicle operator of malfunctions as they occur to facilitate prompt repair just as the purpose of requiring properly functioning smoke detectors in a residence is to reduce fire damage both to the occupants and t
