kern county farm bureau,et.kern,appeal from the district court judgment denying their claim against the fish wildlife service fws for listing the buena vista lake shrew the bvl shrew as an endangered species,contending that fws violated the endangered species act esa and the administrative procedure act apa by failing to provide public review and comment on new studies that became available after the close of the comment period,not basing its listing decision on the best scientific data available,not summarizing the data underlying its decision,and not showing the relationship between the data and its decision.because the information was only important,not critical,to fws decision,and given the deference owed to agencies in making such decisions,we affirm the district court judgment.
factual history 
the bvl shrew is a subspecies of ornate shrews endemic to kern county,california,codified at pt.fewer than thirty are known to exist.id.at.
on june,fws published a rule proposing to list the bvl shrew as an endangered subspecies under the esa.june.the proposal explained that only bvl shrews had been observed since their rediscovery in,and that the only known population existed in a small wetland area on private property.id.at.the proposal emphasized that the amount of suitable habitat for the bvl shrew had been significantly reduced while noting that additional patches of habitable land in the area that might have supported the bvl shrew were marginal at best and would not likely have support ed a significant number of animals.id.at citation omitted.the proposed rule explained that this loss and fragmentation of habitat due to human activities was t he primary cause of decline of the bvl shrew.id.additionally,fws found that the bvl shrew was threatened by agricultural activities,modifications and potential impacts to local hydrology,uncertainty of water delivery,possible toxic effects from selenium poisoning,and by random naturally occurring events.id.at.fws concluded that there was a high probability that these threats would have result ed in the extinction of the bvl shrew id.
fws opened a comment period for the proposal,seeking information about threats to the bvl shrew,locations of any additional populations,and the range,distribution,and population size and genetics of this subspecies.id.at.fws then reopened the comment period for another sixty days to provide all interested parties additional opportunity to comment on the proposal.further,fws solicited the expert opinions of five independent specialists regarding the biological and ecological information about the bvl shrew contained in the proposed rule.at.of the four peer reviewers who responded within the comment period,three stated that the proposed rule was an accurate summary of the species biology and status,while one felt that additional surveys and improved management of known populations could eliminate the need to list the species.id.at.ultimately,three supported the listing,while the fourth remained neutral 
after the comment period,but before issuance of the final rule,three new studies became available.two of the studies dealt with morphological and genetic variations among the multiple subdivisions of ornate shrews,while the third assessed the distribution,habitat,and status of the bvl shrew.see infra section.following the release of these new studies,fws did not reopen the public comment period.instead,on march,it published the final rule listing the bvl shrew as an endangered subspecies.at.the final rule responded to various comments on the proposed rule and incorporated some of the data from the new studies.nevertheless,it listed factors nearly identical to those mentioned in the proposed rule to justify its listing decision and concluded that listing the bvl shrew as endangered was the preferred action.at.
kern soon thereafter filed its complaint,primarily alleging various apa and esa violations.after a bench trial,judgment was entered in favor of fws,and kern filed this appeal.
ii.statutory framework 
the apa requires federal agencies to publish a general notice of proposed rule making in the federal register to give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data,views,or arguments with or without opportunity for oral presentation,and a fter consideration of the relevant matter presented,to incorporate in the rules adopted a concise general statement of their basis and purpose.b c see also b esa listing decisions must comply with the apa.
under the esa,an endangered species is any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range a species includes any subspecies of wildlife and any distinct population segment of any species of wildlife which interbreeds when mature.the decision to list a species as endangered is based on five statutorily prescribed factors,any one of which may support a listing determination the present or threatened destruction,modification,or curtailment of its habitat or range for commercial,recreational,scientific,or educational purposes disease or predation the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms or other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.a a e.
listing determinations must be made solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available b a.additionally,fws must include in any proposed or final listing decision a summary of the data on which such regulation is based and must show the relationship of such data to such regulation b.
iii.standard of review 
the apa provides that final agency action shall be set aside if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law,or if it is taken without observance of procedure required by law.a,d accord idaho farm bureau fed babbitt,cir.the arbitrary and capricious standard is highly deferential,presuming the agency action to be valid and requires affirming the agency action if a reasonable basis exists for its decision.indep.acceptance california,cir quotations and citations omitted.under such deferential review,we may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.marsh or.natural res.council,d.
unlike substantive challenges,however,our review of an agency procedural compliance is exacting,yet limited.see coalition for gov t procurement fed.prison,cir citing natural res.def.council,sec,campanale sons,evans,cir.we review de novo but are limited to ensuring that statutorily prescribed procedures have been followed.campanale sons,at quoting natural res.def.council,at.further,we determine the adequacy of the agency notice and comment procedure,without deferring to an agency own opinion of the opportunities it provided.natural res.def.council epa,cir.
iv.discussion 
notice and comment for new studies 
integral to an agency notice requirement is its duty to identify and make available technical studies and data that it has employed in reaching the decisions to propose particular rules.an agency commits serious procedural error when it fails to reveal portions of the technical basis for a proposed rule in time to allow for meaningful commentary.solite epa,quotations,punctuation,and citation omitted.yet,n othing prohibits an a gency from adding supporting documentation for a final rule in response to public comments.rybachek epa,cir.after publishing a proposed rule,agencies often receive new information,which in turn improves the accuracy of agency action 
it is perfectly predictable that new data will come in during the comment period,either submitted by the public with comments or collected by the agency in a continuing effort to give the regulations a more accurate foundation.the agency should be encouraged to use such information in its final calculations without thereby risking the requirement of a new comment period.

accordingly,the public is not entitled to review and comment on every piece of information utilized during rule making.instead,an agency,without reopening the comment period,may use supplementary data,unavailable during the notice and comment period,that expands on and confirms information contained in the proposed rulemaking and addresses alleged deficiencies in the data,so long as no prejudice is shown.idaho farm bureau fed n,at quoting solite,at internal quotations omitted.
in idaho farm bureau federation,we held that fws committed procedural error in listing the bruneau hot springs snail as an endangered species because it failed to provide the public with an opportunity to review and comment on new material in the record.at.the new material did not merely supplement or confirm existing data,but rather provided the only scientific information on the cause of the decline in the snail habitat,and,therefore,constituted unique information that was not duplicated in other reports.id.at.the need for notice and comment was greatly heightened because fws relied largely on the new study to support its final rule.id.at.in particular,the study was critical to fws s listing decision,because fws support ed its key analysis by citing the new study.id.at see also ober epa,cir reopening the public comment period because the additional materials were relied on and critical to the agency decision.additionally,the need for public comment was exacerbated by the questionable accuracy of the new study we noted that in idaho farm bureau fed n,at,the o pportunity for public comment is particularly crucial when the accuracy of important material in the record is in question.
in contrast,the circuit,in solite,upheld the epa failure to provide a public opportunity to comment on new data used in the final rule.at.the epa had replaced one report with a later report as the source of data on which final quantitative measurements were based.idaho farm bureau fed n,at explaining solite,at.in affirming the epa actions,the court found it significant that the accuracy of the new data was not challenged,that the record did not suggest that the agency hid the information or conducted rule making in bad faith,that the new data confirmed prior assessments,and that the agency methodology remained constant.solite,at.
here,the first study was a genetic study of shrew specimens by jesus maldonado.jesus maldonado,et,tripartite genetic subdivisions in the ornate shrew sorex ornatus,molecular ecology hereinafter maldonado study.this study evaluated genetic variations among ornate shrews at twenty localities and postulated that ornate shrews in california could be organized into three clades northern,central to which the bvl shrew belongs,and southern id.the study noted that t he ornate shrew is one of the most threatened small mammals in california,primarily due to destruction of wetlands and riparian habitats id.at.the study did not purport to change the taxonomic classification of the bvl shrew,referring to it as a separate subspecies.id.
a second study,also conducted by maldonado examined the morphological characteristics of over ornate shrew skulls throughout the species range to determine if any differences existed,and,if so,whether they corresponded to the three genetic clades identified in his study.see jesus maldonado,discordant patterns of morphological variation in genetically divergent populations of ornate shrews sorex ornatus forthcoming hereinafter morphological study.maldonado found significant morphological differences between ornate shrew populations,which did not correspond to the three genetic clades he had previously identified.id.at.further,the morphological differences between subspecies seem ed to portray the patterns of variation between shrew populations better than the genetic regions identified in the maldonado study.id.he concluded that the current boundaries for the seven subspecies that were analyzed in the study correspond ed to morphological divergence and should therefore continue to be considered evolutionarily significant units.id.at.
the third study,authored by daniel williams and adam harpster,assessed the distribution,habitat association,and population status of the bvl shrew by trapping for shrews at six sites see daniel williams adam harpster,status of the buena vista lake shrew sorex ornatus relictus,unpublished report,on file with the bureau of reclamation hereinafter status review.the trapping caught sixteen shrews at three of the six sites.id.at.these three additional bvl shrew populations were discovered in wetland and riparian habitat that had been reduced to small,degraded,and scattered remnants id.at.the status review speculated that ornate shrews may reside on actively farmed ground,or cultivated fields,but limited its hypothesis to ornate shrews generally not bvl shrews,and based its belief on a survey of unknown significance.id.at.further,it surmised that bvl shrews also rarely will be found in more arid,upland communities,but noted that such communities are extremely reduced and isolated in small parcels,and might provide extremely low quality habitat for bvl shrews id.at.
although the study deduced that measures to conserve and enhance bvl shrew populations are justified,and cautioned that it did not have insight into the size and extent of bvl shrew populations,the authors did not believe that bvl shrews are endangered now,nor are there foreseeable threats to remaining populations in the near future.id.at.it reached this conclusion,in part,by noting that several possible initiatives in the region hold great promise for greatly enhancing populations of bvl shrews.id.still,the study found that the persistence of bvl shrews depends upon maintenance of riparian and wetland communities in the southern tulare basin and enhancing the size and connectivity between the small and mostly isolated habitats where the shrews currently are found.id.
like the petitioners in solite,kern does not point to inaccuracies in the new studies.id.at.nor does the record suggest that fws hid the information from the public or conducted rule making in bad faith.rather,kern contends that the new studies were critical to the listing decision.
the district court correctly concluded that the new studies merely supplemented the data in the proposed rule.unlike the study in idaho farm bureau federation,the new materials do not provide the sole,essential support for the listing decision.instead,as in solite,the studies confirm and expand on existing data,providing additional grounds for the conclusions in the proposed rule.id.at.moreover,the new studies did not alter the justifications or conclusions that were vital to the listing decision.just like the proposed rule,fws concluded in the final rule that the bvl shrew was a distinct subspecies threatened with extinction,explaining that few bvl shrews remain,that the amount of suitable habitat has been significantly reduced,and that several factors jeopardize the bvl shrew continued existence.indeed,the entire discussion of the extinction factors in the final rule strongly resembles the factors provided in the proposed rule.compare.at with.at.
despite the limited use of the new studies and the analytical symmetry between the two rules,kern argues that further notice and comment was required,basing its claim on three assertions the new studies provided crucial information on whether the bvl shrew is a distinct subspecies the new studies provided crucial information on whether the bvl shrew is in danger of extinction and the new studies undermined the listing decision.
subspecies distinction 
to be eligible for an endangered species listing,an animal must first be classified,at a minimum,as a distinct subspecies.see.fws used the maldonado study and the morphological study in the final rule only to describe further the distinct morphological and genetic characteristics of the bvl shrew subspecies.at.fws sought to add depth to its morphological discussion by incorporating these studies into the final rule.the proposed rule primarily supported the conventional conclusion that the bvl shrew is a distinct subspecies by citing to a study by grinnell,which,according to fws,is the only scientifically valid,and published taxonomic treatment of the bvl shrew.at.the maldonado studies confirmed fws previous conclusion by providing additional data on the bvl shrew morphological and genetic
