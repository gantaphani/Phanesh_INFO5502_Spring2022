the union of medical marijuana patients,ummp appeals the trial court denial of its petition for writ of mandate seeking to set aside under the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et an ordinance prohibiting mobile medical marijuana dispensaries mobile dispensaries in the city of upland city.ummp contends the city adoption of the ordinance violated ceqa because the city did not first consider the ordinance reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts.the city counters that the ordinance is not a project subject to ceqa,or is exempt under ceqa commonsense exemption for projects that have no potential to cause a significant effect on the environment.we conclude the ordinance is not a project under ceqa,and affirm on that basis.we therefore do not address the city contention regarding the commonsense exemption.
factual and procedural background 
the ordinance 
in,the city adopted ordinance the ordinance which added to the city municipal code a provision specifying that n o medical marijuana dispensary shall be permitted in any zone within the city.the ordinance defined a medical marijuana dispensary as a facility or location,whether fixed or mobile,which provides,makes available or distributes marijuana to a primary caregiver,a qualified patient or a person with an identification card issued in accordance with state law.italics added.
the city conducted an initial study of the ordinance potential environmental effects and concluded there was no substantial evidence that the ordinance could have a significant effect on the environment accordingly,the city prepared and adopted a n egative d eclaration under ceqa.that declaration was not challenged.
the ordinance 
in,the city adopted ordinance the ordinance,which added a new chapter to the municipal code expressly prohibiting mobile dispensaries within the city the ordinance recited that mobile dispensaries have been associated with criminal activity,and stated that more than mobile dispensaries within miles of the city advertised direct delivery of marijuana on the internet commercial listing service.based on these and other observations,the city determined that there is a high likelihood that mobile dispensaries will immediately flourish in the city without the adoption of this ordinance.
before the city adopted the ordinance,ummp submitted comments in opposition.ummp explained it is a civil rights organization that is devoted to defending and asserting the rights of medical cannabis patients.ummp argued the city was required to undertake a preliminary review under ceqa because the ordinance constituted a project inasmuch as prohibiting mobile dispensaries would have foreseeable environmental effects,such as increased travel by residents who would now be forced to travel outside the city to obtain medical marijuana and increased indoor cultivation activity within the city,which would result in increases in electrical and water consumption,waste plant material and odor,and hazardous waste materials associated with fertilizing and harvesting marijuana plants.
it appears from the record the city did not address ummp comments before adopting the ordinance.
ummp lawsuit 
ummp filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the validity of the ordinance on generally the same grounds asserted in its comment letter to the city the city argued the ordinance was not subject to environmental review either because it was not a project as defined by ceqa,or because it fell within ceqa commonsense exemption.after a hearing,the trial court denied ummp petition,explaining the city did not fail to proceed in the manner required by law and there was no violation of ceqa.
discussion 
ceqa overview 
ceqa and its implementing administrative regulations embody california strong public policy of protecting the environment.tomlinson county of alameda cal th.ceqa and the guidelines establish a process to ensure that public agencies inform their decisions with environmental considerations.muzzy ranch solano county airport land use com.cal th,muzzy ranch.
the first tier is jurisdictional,requiring that an agency conduct a preliminary review to determine whether an activity is subject to ceqa.muzzy ranch,supra,cal th at.an activity that is not a project as defined in ceqa and the guidelines is not subject to ceqa.id.at see guidelines.
the second tier concerns exemptions from ceqa review.the legislature has provided that certain projects,such as ministerial projects and repairs to public service facilities of an emergency nature,are exempt.muzzy ranch,supra,cal th at see,subd.b,guidelines,subd.b.the guidelines also list categorical exemptions or classes of projects that the resources agency has determined to be exempt per se because they do not have a significant effect on the environment.muzzy ranch,at,subd.a guidelines,et,subd.b.
a project that qualifies for neither a statutory nor a categorical exemption may nonetheless be found exempt under what is sometimes called the commonsense exemption,which applies w here it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment.muzzy ranch,supra,cal th at,quoting guidelines,subd.b.
if a public agency properly finds that a project is exempt from ceqa,no further environmental review is necessary.citation.if a project does not fall within an exemption,the agency must conduct an initial study to determine if the project may have a significant effect on the environment.citation.if there exists no substantial evidence that the project or any of its aspects may cause a significant effect on the environment citation,the agency must prepare a negative declaration that briefly describes the reasons supporting its determination citation.muzzy ranch,supra,cal th at.
ceqa third tier applies if the agency determines substantial evidence exists that an aspect of the project may cause a significant effect on the environment.in that event,the agency must ensure that a full environmental impact report is prepared on the proposed project.muzzy ranch,supra,cal th at.
in a ceqa case,as in other mandamus cases,our review of the administrative record for error is the same as the trial court we review the agency action,not the trial court decision.muzzy ranch,supra,cal th at.we review the city action for a prejudicial abuse of discretion,quoting.
ceqa definition of a project 
ceqa defines a project in part as a n activity directly undertaken by any public agency that may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment.guidelines.ordinances passed by cities are clearly activities undertaken by a public agency and thus potential projects under ceqa.santa monica chamber of commerce city of santa monica th,fn,italics added see save the plastic bag coalition city of manhattan beach cal th,fn.
the guidelines define and provide examples of direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect changes to the environment.a direct physical change in the environment is a physical change in the environment which is caused by and immediately related to the project.examples of direct physical changes in the environment are the dust,noise,and traffic of heavy equipment that would result from construction of a sewage treatment plant and possible odors from operation of the plant.guidelines,subd.d.
an indirect physical change in the environment is a physical change in the environment which is not immediately related to the project,but which is caused indirectly by the project for example,the construction of a new sewage treatment plant may facilitate population growth in the service area due to the increase in sewage treatment capacity and may lead to an increase in air pollution.guidelines,subd.d.an indirect physical change is to be considered only if that change is a reasonably foreseeable impact which may be caused by the project.a change which is speculative or unlikely to occur is not reasonably foreseeable.guidelines,subd.d.
a municipal ordinance that merely restates or ratifies existing law does not constitute a project and is therefore
