petitioner south county citizens for smart growth smart growth appeals from the trial court denial of its petition for writ of mandate in which smart growth alleged that the county of nevada the county violated various provisions of the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et in approving a commercial real estate project in nevada county smart growth contends we must reverse the judgment because the county failed to prepare and recirculate a revised draft eir adding an alternative project proposal recommended by staff for the nevada county planning commission the staff alternative the county failed to make any findings regarding the feasibility of the staff alternative and the county relied on future traffic improvements that have not been approved yet in order to declare the revised project traffic impacts less than significant.
we conclude the county did nor err in failing to prepare and recirculate a revised draft eir adding the staff alternative,because the staff alternative was not significant new information within the meaning of the ceqa guidelines the county was not required to make findings regarding the feasibility of the staff alternative because the alternative was proffered after preparation of the final eir and adequate alternatives were discussed in the eir and the county did not rely on future traffic improvements,but instead relied on the current actual use of the road in question,rather than its current traffic designation.
we will affirm the judgment.
background 
this appeal arises from the county decision to approve the higgins marketplace project the project in southwestern nevada county.real party in interest katz kirkpatrick properties kkp submitted the application for the project to the county in.the acre site consisted of one parcel owned by the tintle family,but kkp had an option to purchase the northern portion of the site.the original proposal involved subdivision of the site into parcels for commercial,light industrial,and office uses.on five of the parcels approximately acres,the proposal called for a retail store expected to be a bel air market,two retail buildings one square feet and the other square feet,two restaurants,and parking stalls.no development was proposed for four other parcels approximately acres,which would continue to be owned by the tintle family,although the proposal allowed for future development of approximately square feet of light industrial and office spaces.the last parcel,which was around acres,was designated to retain existing wetlands and to provide a foot buffer between the developed parcels and the onsite wetlands.the proposal also included a proposed habitat management plan,as required by the county code because the wetland buffer was less than feet.
in november,the county published a draft environmental impact report draft eir analyzing the project potential significant impacts on the environment,and identifying potentially feasible mitigation measures and alternatives that would minimize or avoid potential significant impacts.the draft eir identified two significant traffic impacts and one significant cumulative air quality impact that could not be reduced to less than significant levels even with the implementation of the mitigation measures identified in the draft eir.all other potentially significant impacts would be reduced to less than significant levels with the implementation of mitigation measures.
in january,the nevada county planning commission planning commission held a public hearing to receive comments on the draft eir.at the request of members of the public,the planning commission extended the public comment period.during the extended comment period,kkp submitted a letter that included a peer review of the draft eir traffic analysis and a proposal to reduce the size of the bel air to help reduce the project traffic impacts.at the request of kkp,pitney bowes map info submitted a letter updating the distribution of projected patrons to the project site,which could influence traffic patterns.the planning commission extended the public comment period again until february,to give the public the opportunity to comment on kkp additional submissions.
the county environmental consultant prepared responses to the written and oral comments received at the hearing on the draft eir.the final eir which consisted of the draft eir,the responses to comments,and associated appendices was released for public review on october.following release of the final eir,but prior to the planning commission hearing on the document,four more comment letters were received,including a letter from smart growth counsel.the county environmental consultant prepared responses to the late comments,and the county included the late comments and the responses in an appendix to the final eir.
on january,the planning commission held a hearing on the final eir to consider whether to recommend that the nevada county board of supervisors the board certify the final eir,and approve the legislative actions required for the project including the general plan amendment and rezone.the staff report prepared for the planning commission hearing recommended that the planning commission vote to recommend that the board approve a modified version of the project,the staff alternative,in order to address concerns over the project air quality and traffic impacts.the staff alternative built upon alternative in the draft eir the density alternative,which provided for a reduction in overall retail development.the staff alternative would cap commercial property at square feet,have acres of open space,increase the wetland buffer from to feet,and prohibit fast food restaurants due to their high traffic generation.the planning commission voted three to two to recommend that the board approve the staff alternative,and the planning commission unanimously voted to recommend that the board certify the final eir.
thereafter,kkp worked to address the planning commission concerns and revise the project based on the planning commission recommendations.kkp submitted two alternatives that would reduce the project footprint and eliminate fast food restaurants.the overall number of proposed buildings was reduced from five to four,and the total square footage was reduced from square feet to square feet.kkp first alternative included a foot setback from the onsite wetlands,but would reduce landscaping and cause parking space conflicts with the major interior circulation routes.kkp second alternative included a foot nondisturbance setback from the wetland area,with a foot buffer zone and greater landscaping.planning commission staff conferred with a biological consultant concerning the setback and buffer,concluded that kkp second alternative was preferable,and recommended to the planning commission that it recommend kkp second alternative to the board.
the primary differences between the staff alternative and kkp second alternative were that in kkp second alternative the tintle family property was allowed to keep its existing business park designation on acres and the proposed office professional designation on acres the wetland setback would be feet rather than feet,but an additional feet was added as a buffer,making the overall reduction to the setback only feet the total square footage of community commercial designations was increased from square feet to square feet and open space was reduced by approximately four acres 
consistent with the staff recommendation of kkp second alternative hereafter also referenced as the revised project,the proposed tentative parcel map was modified to coincide with the new site plan,with seven parcels divided as follows one for each building,one for the space parcel,and two for the tintle property parcels,which the tintles intended to retain after the sale to kkp.in response to objections from the tintles,the revised project would continue to allow the future development of their parcels for commercial uses as permitted by existing zoning standards.however,development would be limited to square feet of building space.
on may,the planning commission held a meeting to consider the details of the revised project,and whether to recommend that the board certify the final eir.due to a procedural error in noticing the meeting,the planning commission did not discuss the details of the revised project at that time.instead,it voted five to zero that the final eir adequately encompassed the revised project,and it recommended that the board certify the final eir.however,on june,the planning commission met again and discussed the details of the revised project.the planning commission voted to recommend that the board approve the revised project kkp second alternative rather than the staff alternative,and that the board approve the legislative actions associated with the revised project.
on july,the board held a public hearing to consider the final eir,and whether to approve the associated legislative actions.smart growth attorney submitted a lengthy comment letter on the final eir at the beginning of the hearing.to allow time to consider the letter,the board continued the meeting until.in light of the lengthy comment letter and other letters that were received,additional responses to comments were prepared and incorporated into the final eir.
on august,the board held two public hearings one to consider the final eir and the other to consider the legislative actions.the board voted to certify the final eir and approve the legislative actions.
smart growth timely filed a petition for writ of mandate in superior court.as relevant to the present appeal,smart growth asserted in a second amended petition that the county violated ceqa by failing to prepare and recirculate a revised draft eir with the staff alternative,which was a potentially feasible alternative and would have less impact on the environment than the revised project failing to make any findings or otherwise cite to substantial evidence explaining why the staff alternative should not or could not be approved asserting that traffic impacts were mitigated to less than significant levels by administratively redesignating an affected road as a minor arterial without any change to actual traffic conditions on the impacted road and finding that the revised project impacts on traffic conditions would be less than significant.after reviewing the administrative record,the trial court rejected these contentions and denied the petition for writ of mandate.

discussion 
smart growth contends the county violated ceqa mandatory procedures by failing to prepare and recirculate a revised draft eir with the staff alternative.before addressing this contention,it will be helpful to set forth the relevant ceqa framework and address the difference between the determination,during the scoping process,of whether to include alternative projects in the draft eir and the adequacy of the chosen alternatives,and the determination of whether to recirculate an eir when significant new information is added concerning a feasible project alternative.
the core of an eir is the mitigation and alternatives sections.the legislature has declared it the policy of the state to consider alternatives to proposed actions affecting the environment.citations.in determining the nature and scope of alternatives to be examined in an eir,the legislature has decreed that local agencies shall be guided by the doctrine of feasibility.i t is the policy of the state that public agencies should not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such projects goleta ii,supra,cal d at pp,original italics.
ceqa establishes no categorical legal imperative as to the scope of alternatives to be analyzed in an eir.each case must be evaluated on its facts,which in turn must be reviewed in light of the statutory purpose a n eir for any project subject to ceqa review must consider a reasonable range of alternatives to the project,or to the location of the project,which offer substantial environmental advantages over the project proposal and may be feasibly accomplished in a successful manner considering the economic,environmental,social and technological factors involved.goleta ii,supra,cal d at,original italics.
the range of alternatives that must be discussed and their level of analysis are subject to a rule of reason.laurel heights i,supra,cal d at guidelines,subd.f an eir must set forth only those alternatives necessary to permit a reasoned choice.absolute perfection is not required what is required is the production of information sufficient to permit a reasonable choice of alternatives so far as environmental aspects are concerned.citation.village laguna of laguna beach,board of supervisors d,village laguna.the eir is not required to set forth every conceivable alternative jones regents of university of california th,given that in some cases there are literally thousands of reasonable alternatives to the proposed project.village laguna,supra,d at.
the scoping process is the screening process by which a local agency makes its initial determination as to which alternatives are feasible and merit consideration,and which do not.goleta ii,supra,cal d at see guidelines.it involves consult ation directly with any person or organization the lead agency believes will be concerned with the environmental effects of the project in hopes of solv ing many potential problems that would arise in more serious forms later in the review process.guidelines.it takes place after notice of preparation has been sent out and prior to completion of the draft eir.gilroy citizens for responsible planning city of gilroy th,fn.guidelines.
the determination of whether to include an alternative during the scoping process is whether the alternative is potentially feasible mira mar mobile community city of oceanside th,mira mar,and the eir is required to make an discussion of those alternatives identified as at least potentially feasible.sierra club county of napa th,fn,italics omitted.differing factors come into play when the final decision on project approval is made at that juncture the decisionmaking body evaluates whether the alternatives are actually feasible.guidelines,subd.a.t he decision makers may reject as infeasible alternatives that were identified in the eir as potentially feasible.california native plant society city of santa cruz th.
the feasibility of a new alternative proffered after the scoping process,and after the draft eir is circulated,is one of the factors to be considered in determining whether to recirculate an eir,but not the only factor.guidelines,subd.a.according to ceqa,recirculation is required only when significant new information is added to the eir after public notice is given of the availability of the draft eir for public review but before certification.guidelines,subd.a.new information added to an eir is not significant unless the eir is changed in a way that deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon a substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an effect including a feasible project alternative that the project proponents have declined to implement.significant new information requiring recirculation include,for example,a disclosure showing that a feasible project alternative or mitigation measure considerably different from others previously analyzed would clearly lessen the significant environmental impacts of the project,but the project proponents decline to adopt it.guidelines,subd.a.
in other words,recirculation is not required simply because new information is added.as the california supreme court observed in laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal th laurel heights ii,the final eir will almost always contain information not included in the draft eir given the ceqa statutory requirements of circulation of the draft eir,public comment,and response to these comments prior to certification of the final eir.id.at.but r ecirculation was intended to be an exception,rather than the general rule.id.at.
an express finding is not required on whether new information is significant it is implied from the agency decision to certify the eir without recirculating it.laurel heights ii,supra,cal th at ceqa does not require an express order or finding on the subject of whether to recirculate a final eir western placer citizens for an agricultural rural environment county of placer th,western placer citizens a written finding is not required b y certifying the final eir,the board necessarily concluded the new information did not require recirculation and additional public comment.furthermore,all new information occurring after release of the final eir but prior to certification and project adoption need not be included in the eir before the agency determines whether the new information is significant so as to trigger revision and recirculation.western placer citizens,supra,th at.
after the final eir had been circulated,the planning commission voted to recommend that the board certify the final eir and approve the staff alternative.thereafter,however,kkp submitted its second alternative addressing some of the planning commission concerns kkp second alternative was recommended by planning commission staff and the planning commission as the revised project and the board ultimately approved the revised project.
under its first argument heading,smart growth does not challenge the adequacy of the various alternatives that were included and discussed in the draft eir as a result of the scoping process.nor does smart growth challenge the county failure to recirculate the final eir with a discussion of the revised project rather,the only challenge smart growth raises is that when the planning commission initially voted to approve the staff alternative,and before the planning commission recommended kkp second alternative as the revised project,the county should have prepared and recirculated a revised draft eir with the staff alternative.smart growth argues that because the county did not do so,the public was deprived of the opportunity to comment on a feasible alternative in violation of ceqa mandatory disclosure procedures.smart growth further contends that because the county failed to proceed in the manner required by law,the applicable standard of review is abuse of discretion.
smart growth does not identify any ceqa statute,guideline or judicial decision mandating that where an eir includes a reasonable range of alternatives,then any additional alternative,even if proffered after the final eir is released,must be added to the eir or else the agency will not have proceeded in a manner required by law and will have violated ceqa disclosure requirements.as we explained above,all new information occurring after release of the final eir but prior to certification and project adoption need not be included in the eir before the agency determines whether the new information is significant so as to trigger revision and recirculation.western placer citizens,supra,th at.moreover,the failure to recirculate the final eir is not a failure to proceed in the manner required by law unless the staff alternative meets the factual definition of significant new information.guidelines,subd.a.a determination whether new information is significant so as to warrant recirculation is reviewed only for support by substantial evidence.vineyard area citizens,supra,cal th at laurel heights ii,supra,cal th at.substantial evidence means enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion,even though other conclusions might also be reached.guidelines,subd.a.
smart growth bears the burden of proving a double negative,that the county decision not to revise and recirculate the final eir is not supported by substantial evidence.western placer citizens,supra,th at sierra club county of napa,supra,th at.that is,smart growth must demonstrate that there is no substantial evidence to support a determination that the staff alternative was not significant new information.guidelines,subd.a.for the staff alternative to be significant new information,it must be feasible it must be considerably different from other alternatives previously analyzed it must clearly lessen the significant environmental impacts of the proposed project and the project proponents must decline to adopt it.ibid.smart growth has the burden to demonstrate that there is no substantial evidence to support a negative finding on any of these factors in order to establish that the county abused its discretion in failing to recirculate the eir.
as with all substantial evidence challenges,an appellant challenging an eir for insufficient evidence must lay out the evidence favorable to the other side and show why it is lacking.failure to do so is fatal.a reviewing court will not independently review the record to make up for appellant failure to carry his burden.citation.defend the bay city of irvine th.
smart growth has not met its appellate burden.for example,smart growth does not demonstrate that there is no substantial evidence to support a determination that the staff alternative was not considerably different than all of the others in the eir,which analyzed four alternatives to the project.
alternative was the no project alternative required by ceqa.guidelines,subd.e.in that alternative the site would be left in its current condition.
alternative,the woodridge court right in,right out alternative,provided for restricted and access to the project from woodridge court.this alternative was selected to determine whether restricted access would avoid traffic impacts to state route.
alternative,the business park land use alternative,would develop the project under the current general plan land use designations.this alternative was designed to reduce traffic and noise impacts to nearby residences.
alternative,the density alternative,would develop the site with commercial uses similar to those of the proposed project.however,it would remove parcel a commercial building and associated improvements in order to accommodate a foot buffer between the wetland conservation area,and it would relocate the restaurants and commercial building so as to provide a greater buffer between the uses and adjacent residential areas.this alternative was designed to reduce biological,noise,visual and traffic impacts.
smart growth argues that the staff alternative is considerably different from the alternatives considered in the draft eir,because none of the draft eir alternatives meet the project stated objectives by providing for the development of a shopping alternative that would improve the county balance,while simultaneously reducing the project acknowledged significant and unavoidable cumulative air quality impacts by designating the remainder of the project site as open space.emphasis omitted.smart growth claims that none of the alternatives presented during the county administrative consideration of the project contemplates this potentially feasible way to reduce the project air quality impacts.rather,every action alternative considered in the publicly circulated draft eir reserves a substantial portion of the project site for future,business park and office uses which are not among the draft eir stated project objectives,which necessarily include these land uses attendant incremental future contributions to cumulative air quality impacts.emphasis and fn.omitted.
in other words,the staff alternative allows for more open space.but smart growth fails to explain,with reasoned analysis supported by citations to the evidence in the record,why this specific increase in open space is considerably different.nwosu uba th,fn.the failure to present argument with references to the record and citation to legal authority results in a forfeiture of any assertion that could have been raised badie bank of america th,when an appellant fails to raise a point,or fails to support a point with reasoned argument and citations to authority,it is forfeited.moreover,smart growth does not meet its appellate burden of setting forth all the evidence favorable to the county and showing wherein it is lacking.this is fatal to its claim.defend the bay city of irvine,supra,th at.although smart growth attempts to rectify its error in its reply brief,it is too late to do so there because it deprives the respondent of the opportunity to respond.reichardt hoffman th,american drug stores,stroh th.
these same flaws undermine smart growth attempt to address the other factors in guidelines section,subdivision a.for example,in its opening brief,smart growth maintains that the staff alternative is feasible,but smart growth does not refer us to the statutory definition of the term or address the factors set forth in that definition by citation to evidence in the record.see guidelines.smart growth does not provide any analysis justifying its position that only potential feasibility,as opposed to actual feasibility,is required at this late stage of the ceqa process,under circumstances where there is no claim that the draft eir lacked adequate reasonable alternatives,the draft eir had been circulated for public discussion,and the staff alternative was not raised until after the final eir was submitted for certification.
with respect to another recirculation factor,smart growth simply asserts that the staff alternative will clearly lessen the significant environmental impacts of the proposed project guidelines,subd.a by designating four acres as open space on the tintle property,rather than permitting future business park and professional use,and by eliminating the fast food restaurants.smart growth provides no analysis,supported by citations to evidence in the record,explaining how this will clearly lessen the project environmental impacts.for example,the reduction in cumulative air quality environmental impacts might be insignificant when viewed under the appropriate thresholds for nevada county.moreover,smart growth fails to show that the staff alternative clearly lessens the significant environmental impacts of the revised project instead,smart growth compares the staff alternative to the project as originally proposed.
we are not required to cull through the more than page administrative record to see if there is support for smart growth position.defend the bay city of irvine,supra,th at.under the circumstances,smart growth has not established its claim that the county abused its discretion in failing to prepare and recirculate a revised draft eir with the staff alternative.
in a related contention,smart growth claims the county violated ceqa mandatory procedures by failing to make findings regarding the feasibility of the staff alternative.smart growth believes that once the planning commission found the staff alternative sufficiently feasible to recommend approval of the alternative to the board,the board had to either adopt the staff alternative or make findings setting forth the reasons why the staff alternative was not feasible.smart growth argues that because the board did not adopt the staff alternative,it had to make findings regarding the feasibility of that alternative.
although a lead agency must give reasons for rejecting an alternative as infeasible during the scoping process guidelines,subd.c the scoping process takes place prior to completion of the draft eir.gilroy citizens for responsible planning city of gilroy,supra,th at,fn.guidelines.the staff alternative was proposed well after completion of the draft eir indeed,it was proffered after preparation of the final eir.
furthermore,although the lead agency must give reasons for rejecting the alternatives discussed in the eir where the document identifies one or more significant environmental effects of the project,subd.a guidelines,subd.a,the staff alternative was not one of the alternatives discussed in the eir and smart growth has not established that the county erred by not including it in the eir.
smart growth does not point to any ceqa statutes or regulations requiring that the lead agency make findings regarding why it rejected an alternative proposed after the final eir and not included in the eir.south orange county wastewater authority city of dana point th,the legislature has expressly forbidden courts to interpret ceqa or the ceqa guidelines to impose procedural or substantive requirements beyond those explicitly stated in the act or in the guidelines.indeed,as we explained in part i,the county was not required to make an express finding of infeasibility.it was only required to find that the staff alternative was not significant new information,a finding that may be implied from its decision to certify the eir without recirculating it.laurel heights ii,supra,cal th at western placer citizens,supra,th at.feasibility was just one of the factors to be considered in determining whether the staff alternative qualified as significant new information.
smart growth contends the county failure to make findings explaining why the staff alternative was infeasible can not be squared with laurel heights i,supra,cal d,and goleta ii,supra,cal d,but those cases are inapposite.
laurel heights i,supra,cal d concerned an eir inadequate discussion of alternative locations for a project in violation of guidelines section.the regents of the university of california merely included a conclusory statement that any alternatives were infeasible without providing supporting analysis.id.at.the california supreme court held that the regents must include their analytic route so that the public can be fully informed,rather than simply expecting the public to trust them.id.at.but here,adequate alternatives were discussed in the eir.laurel heights i has no bearing on the present claim that the county had an obligation under ceqa to issue a finding of infeasibility if it chose not to recirculate the eir with the staff alternative.
goleta ii,supra,cal d arose following a first appeal in which the county eir was held to be inadequate because it failed to discuss any alternative project sites.citizens of goleta valley board of supervisors d,goleta i.during the pendency of the appeal in goleta i,the county began preparation of a supplemental eir which contained a discussion of only one alternative site.goleta ii,supra,cal d at.a citizens group,cgv,belatedly requested consideration of a number of additional sites.id.at.the board of supervisors concluded none of the alternative sites were feasible and issued pages of findings concerning those alternative sites,but a discussion of the additional alternatives was not included in the eir.id.at.the court of appeal concluded that the eir failed to delineate facts sufficient to explain its rejection of alternative sites other than the single alternative discussed in the eir.id.at.
the california supreme court reversed the court of appeal,holding that it was reasonable to explain why the alternative sites were rejected via administrative findings,rather than in the eir,due to the belated manner in which the sites were brought to county attention.goleta ii,supra,cal d at.the supreme court
