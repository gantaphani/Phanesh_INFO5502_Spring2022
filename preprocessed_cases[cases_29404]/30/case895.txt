in their suit filed pursuant to the administrative procedures act apa,the league of wilderness mountains biodiversity project and cascadia wildlands project collectively,lowd sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the deep creek vegetation management project the project,which called for the selective logging of million board feet of timber in the ochoco national forest.lowd claims in its suit that the united states forest service forest service failed to comply with the national environmental policy act nepa,et,and the national forest management act nfma,et,in developing and implementing the project.the district court denied lowd motion for summary judgment and granted the forest service for summary judgment.because the final supplemental environmental impact statement fseis may not tier to a watershed analysis to consider adequately the aggregate cumulative effects of past timber sales,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the forest service,and we remand this case so the forest service can reissue its nepa documentation to include the omitted information regarding past timber sales contained in the watershed analysis.
factual and procedural background 
deep creek watershed analysis 
the forest service manages the ochoco national forest under the ochoco national forest land and resource management plan ochoco lrmp.in,the regional forester directed the paulina ranger district,among others,to conduct a watershed analysis that identified processes and functions within the deep creek watershed that are key to maintaining sustainable and resilient terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.to carry out these instructions,the forest service created an interdisciplinary team of employees that eventually documented its findings and conclusions in the august deep creek watershed analysis watershed analysis.
the watershed analysis collectively considered past actions in the deep creek watershed and the results of those actions to determine existing conditions and trends.based on this cumulative evaluation,the watershed analysis determined that many of the tree stands were overly dense and susceptible to wildfires and forest diseases that some types of tree stands were as compared to historical conditions,while other types of stands were and that riparian habitats along streams exhibited similar problems.the watershed analysis accordingly concluded that the forest service should undertake a blend of management activities to alleviate and improve these unsatisfactory conditions.
b.the project 
in october,based on the results of the watershed analysis,the forest service initiated the nepa documentation process for the project.in april,the forest service published a draft environmental impact statement eis and,after receiving public comments and making adjustments,issued a final eis in september.the forest service also issued a corresponding record of decision rod.
shortly thereafter,lowd filed an administrative appeal of the project on behalf of itself and a number of environmental organizations.in response,the forest service withdrew the original rod to perform additional analyses on the project effects,and dismissed the appeal as moot.
in july,the forest service issued a draft supplemental eis for the project.after receiving and considering public comments,the forest service issued a fseis in january.according to the fseis,the stated purpose and need for the project are to move the diversity of vegetation and associated wildlife habitat closer to the historic range of variability hrv in terms of species composition and structure,given that forest vegetation is outside the hrv for of the watershed increase the amount of single strata late and old structure los stands and move the overall abundance of los closer to the hrv reduce the forest susceptibility to moderate and high severity fires by lowering fuel levels,reducing stand densities,increasing the relative abundance of fire tolerant species,and fire into the watershed reduce the forest susceptibility to insects,diseases,and wildfires by reducing their stocking levels enhance vegetative conditions in the aspen,riparian,upland shrub,and meadow communities that have gradually declined over time and improve water quality and enhance the vegetation aspect of areas to provide for sustainability of resident and anadromous fisheries by reducing stream temperatures and lowering sedimentation.
in january,the forest service issued another rod and selected modified alternative c,which includes commercial timber harvest on acres,thinning on acres,miles of new and temporary road construction,miles of road reconstruction,and treatments on acres.modified alternative c would allow logging of million board feet of timber,primarily through tractor logging.the rod concludes that this alternative presents the best balance of activities suited for meeting the identified needs of the deep watershed at this time and balances water quality issues while improving uplands and riparian vegetation conditions and reducing susceptibility to moderate and high severity fires.
procedural history 
following issuance of the rod,lowd filed an administrative appeal,which the forest service denied.lowd then filed a complaint in the district of oregon pursuant to the apa,alleging that the forest service approval of the project violated nepa,nfma,and the applicable ochoco lrmp,and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.in adopting the magistrate judge findings and recommendations,the district court denied lowd motion for summary judgment,granted the forest service for summary judgment,and dismissed the action with prejudice.lowd timely appealed.we have jurisdiction over lowd appeal pursuant to.

discussion 
lowd argues that,in developing the project,the forest service violated nepa because the fseis fails to consider adequately the cumulative effects of the project,as required by.lowd also argues that the forest service violated nfma and the applicable ochoco lrmp by failing to assure that forest service employees properly mark trees for avoidance of harvest and failing to maintain connective habitat corridors in the project planning area.
cumulative effects analysis 
lowd first claims that the forest service failed to consider adequately the cumulative environmental effects of other timber sales and grazing in the project planning area.the forest service responds that its responsibility is to consider cumulative effects in the aggregate rather than on an individual basis,and that the fseis contains a sufficient discussion of cumulative effects to satisfy the agency duty under nepa.we conclude that the forest service may aggregate its cumulative effects analysis,and that it properly did so with respect to grazing and future timber sales.however,we find the aggregated cumulative effects analysis of past timber sales deficient because the forest service failed to include the relevant inputs in the fseis itself.
nepa provides that a federal agency that proposes a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment must prepare a detailed eis on the proposed action,including an analysis of alternatives to the proposed action and a discussion of the significant environmental impacts.c.to comply with this requirement,the forest service must consider,among other things,the cumulative impacts of the proposed action,which nepa implementing regulations define as the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency federal or or person undertakes such other actions.
timber sales 
past timber sales 
lowd contends that the cumulative effects analysis in the fseis regarding past timber sales is insufficient because it only mentions one past timber sale,the summit timber sale,and otherwise generally states that timber harvest has occurred in the past.the forest service counters that,under its reading of department of transportation public citizen,d,agencies can conduct an adequate cumulative effects analysis by focusing on the current aggregate effects of past actions.
aggregation 
in rejecting lowd arguments,the district court agreed with the forest service interpretation of public citizen 
the supreme court recently construed the cumulative effects regulation and found it required an evaluation of the incremental impact of the project at issue rather than focusing on the incremental impacts attributable to each of the past,present and reasonably foreseeable future actions in the planning area.dep t of transportation public citizen,d.thus,the court in public citizen approved an agency approach that considers the effects of past actions in the aggregate,and explained that actions need not be considered separately and distinctly when analyzing cumulative effects.
the district court then concluded,without elaboration or citation to the record,that the fseis discusses cumulative effects from past vegetation management activities in the watershed to a sufficient degree.
this reading of public citizen is inaccurate.in that case,the court addressed the narrow issue of whether nepa require d the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa to evaluate the environmental effects of operations of motor carriers when fmcsa merely promulgated administrative rules implementing a presidential order allow ing such activities to occur.public citizen,at.in concluding that nepa lacked such a requirement,the court did state that t he cumulative impact regulation required fmcsa to consider the incremental impact of the safety rules themselves,in the context of the presidential order and other relevant circumstances,not to treat the presidential order itself,or consequences from the order.id.at.quoting.nevertheless,the court emphasized twice that its analysis and holding were limited to the critical feature of the,that fmcsa lacked authority to countermand the presidential order allowing mexican carriers into the united states,id.at.subsequent ninth circuit cases have limited their application of public citizen on that basis.see,or.natural res.council fund brong,cir holding that public citizen limitation on nepa does not apply where an agency has statutory authority to prevent the relevant effects.accordingly,because the forest service has statutory authority to regulate the environmental consequences of the project,public citizen does not support the agency position.
we conclude,however,that a different source does permit the forest service to consider cumulative effects in the aggregate.during the summary judgment proceedings,the forest service introduced a june,memorandum issued by the chairman of the council on environmental quality ceq,entitled guidance on consideration of past actions in cumulative effects analysis.this ceq memorandum advises that a gencies are not required to list or analyze the effects of individual past actions unless such information is necessary to describe the cumulative effects of all past actions combined.instead,the memorandum explains,agencies can conduct an adequate cumulative effects analysis by focusing on the current aggregate effects of past actions without delving into the historical details of individual past actions.
the magistrate judge struck the ceq memorandum from the record,characterizing it as a hoc rationalization with no relevance to judicial review of the forest service compliance with nepa.based on supreme court precedent,however,this determination constituted an abuse of the magistrate judge discretion.see golden gate hotel ass city county of,cir we review a district court decision to grant a motion to strike unscheduled supplementary material for abuse of discretion.in auer robbins,d,the court granted deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulation even though the agency offered the interpretation for the first time as a litigation position.the court noted that the agency interpretation was controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,and that t here was simply no reason to suspect that the interpretation d id not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
similarly here,ceq interpretation that permits consideration of all past impacts in the aggregate is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the language of the regulation,and ceq is the agency charged with interpreting nepa and that adopted the regulation.see jones gordon,cir.in addition,lowd points to no evidence to suggest that ceq interpretation does not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the cumulative effects issue,and ceq interpretation is just as plausible as lowd position that analysis of past effects requires evaluation of discrete past events.the ceq memorandum is therefore entitled to auer deference and,as a result,we hold that the forest service may aggregate its cumulative effects analysis pursuant to.
our circuit precedent further supports this conclusion.although lowd argues that lands council powell lands council i,cir,requires a complete cataloguing of all prior timber sales in all cases,this interpretation is incorrect.lands council i instead merely reaffirms the general rule that nepa requires adequate cataloguing of relevant past projects in the area.id.at citing muckleshoot indian tribe forest,cir emphasis added.an aggregated cumulative effects analysis that includes the relevant inputs comports with this standard,and also furthers nepa purpose of concentrat ing on the issues that are truly significant to the action in question.see b.
moreover,sitting en banc,this court recently clarified that lands council i does not require the forest service to conduct any particular test or to use any particular method,so long as the evidence provided to support the forest service conclusions,along with other materials in the record,ensure that the agency made no clear error of judgment that would render its action arbitrary and capricious.lands council ii,at internal quotation marks omitted.in lands council ii,the en banc court reasoned that this approach not only respects our law that requires us to defer to an agency determination in an area involving a high level of technical expertise,but also acknowledges that w e are not free to impose on the agency our own notion of which procedures are best or most likely to further some vague,undefined public good.id.internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.
accordingly,to the extent that does not explicitly provide otherwise,the forest service is free to consider cumulative effects in the aggregate or to use any other procedure it deems appropriate.it is not for this court to tell the forest service what spec
