edward ober and other residents of phoenix,arizona,appeal from the environmental protection agency adoption of a federal implementation plan for the phoenix area under the clean air act.ober claims that the plan violates the clean air act because it fails to adopt controls for sources of airborne particulate pollution that the agency labels de minimis.
background 
the attempts by the environmental protection agency epa to formulate a plan to control air pollution in the phoenix area pursuant to the clean air act,et,have been the source of much litigation and administrative revision.five years ago,this court reversed epa approval of arizona state implementation plan for the area.ober epa,cir ober i.on remand,epa adopted a federal implementation plan for the phoenix area.in this appeal,phoenix citizens,including asthma sufferers who are particularly sensitive to particulate pollution,challenge epa failure to require controls on sources of particulate pollution that epa labels de minimis.
under the clean air act,epa has identified airborne particulate matter under ten microns in size,known as,as a pollutant to be regulated under state and federal programs.epa promulgated two national ambient air quality standards naaqs for pollution,an annual standard and a standard.see ober i,at.each state must submit to epa a state implementation plan to comply with the naaqs if epa disapproves the state plan,epa formulates a federal implementation plan for the area.see c.
an area that does not meet the national ambient air quality standards for is classified as either a moderate or serious nonattainment area.phoenix did not meet the standards.under the amendments to the act,phoenix was classified as a moderate nonattainment area required to attain the naaqs,with a deadline of december.the act requires each state that contains areas with moderate levels of pollution to submit a state implementation plan sip,describing reasonably available control measures to bring the pollution within the national ambient air quality standards as expeditiously as practicable,within a deadline set at the time the area is designated as moderate.c,a c.if the state implementation plan can not show attainment of the naaqs by the deadline,it must demonstrate that attainment by that date is impracticable,and epa may reclassify the area as a serious nonattainment area.a b ii,b.
the state of arizona submitted to epa its sip for phoenix,in which it stated that it would be impracticable to attain the national standard for annual pollution by the deadline.epa approved the plan in.under the act,because the sip stated that attaining the standard would be impracticable,phoenix was reclassified in june,from a moderate to a serious nonattainment area for.ober i,at.the state was still required to submit a moderate area plan,however.id.at.
in ober i,we reversed epa approval of arizona state implementation plan for reasons not at issue here,and remanded so that epa could consider a revised sip.id.at.on remand,epa directed the state to revise the sip,and in epa disapproved the revised state plan.under the act,because epa did not approve the state plan,the agency had a duty to promulgate a federal implementation plan fip for the phoenix area to meet all the requirements that the disapproved sip failed to satisfy.see c b,y.
epa proposed the fip in april,and after public comment adopted a final federal plan in august.the fip concluded that attainment of the clean air act standards for by the statutory deadline of december,was impracticable.see c setting attainment deadline of december,for area designated as serious for.the fip exempted from control a variety of sources of pollution that epa considered de minimis.
ober filed a petition for review of final agency action in this court under b.at issue is whether epa acted arbitrarily and capriciously by exempting from control measures sources of pollution it considered de minimis.
this court reviews the final administrative actions of epa pursuant to the clean air act under the standard set forth in the administrative procedure act.we reverse an epa decision only if it is arbitrary,capricious,or contrary to law or if it exceeds the statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations.exxon mobil epa,cir.we review epa interpretation of the clean air act by asking whether congress intent is clear,and if it is not,whether epa interpretation is permissible.see id.citing chevron,natural resources defense council,d.
the fip stated that it was impracticable to attain the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for particulate pollution by the deadline.epa made this impracticability determination while proposing no controls at all for some of the sources of pollution which it labeled de minimis sources.epa concluded that,because these sources were de minimis,there were no reasonably available control measures to reduce the pollution these sources generated.it is that equation that is before us in this appeal.we must determine whether the clean air act allows epa to make de minimis exemptions,and,if so,whether epa acted reasonably in designating some sources of pollution as de minimis.
de minimis exemptions under clean air act 
the first question is whether,under the clean air act,epa has the power to exempt de minimis sources of pollution from controls.
the act requires that a plan to reduce air pollution in a moderate nonattainment area such as the plan required in this case must include either reasonably available control measures racm to bring the pollution levels within national standards by a specified deadline,or a demonstration that attainment by such date is impracticable.a b c.the act makes no explicit provision for a de minimis exception.
epa issued a general preamble for the implementation of title i of the clean air act amendments of in april.the preamble,in describing how a moderate area plan should identify racm for pollution,states 
if it can be shown that one or more measures are unreasonable because emissions from the sources affected are insignificant,de minimis,those measures may be excluded from further consideration as they would not represent racm for that area.
at.an accompanying footnote explains 
where the sources affected by a particular measure contribute only negligibly to ambient concentrations that exceed the naaqs,epa policy is that it would be unreasonable and therefore would not constitute racm to require controls on the source.in this regard,it is worth noting that the inherent authority of administrative agencies to exempt de minimis situations has been recognized in contexts such as this where an agency is invoking a de minimis exemption as a tool to be used in implementing the legislative design.
id.at quoting alabama power costle.although the preamble assumes that de minimis levels of can be exempted from controls in moderate nonattainment areas,it does not establish thresholds for de minimis sources.
in alabama power,the district of columbia circuit held that epa could exempt de minimis sources of air pollution from the requirements of the clean air act 
categorical exemptions may be permissible as an exercise of agency power,inherent in most statutory schemes,to overlook circumstances that in context may fairly be considered de minimis.it is commonplace,of course,that the law does not concern itself with trifling matters,and this principle has often found application in the administrative context.courts should be reluctant to apply the literal terms of a statute to mandate pointless expenditures of effort the ability to exempt de minimis situations from a statutory command is not an ability to depart from the statute,but rather a tool to be used in implementing the legislative design.

this court has not explicitly held that the clean air act is subject to de minimis exemptions.we have,however,implicitly approved epa power to make appropriate de minimis ex
