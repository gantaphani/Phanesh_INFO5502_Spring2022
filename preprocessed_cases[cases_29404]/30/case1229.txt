creation of the monument 
on september,president clinton created the grand national monument monument,located in kane and garfield counties,utah,to protect a spectacular array of scientific and historic resources.in doing so,president clinton proclaimed that a ll federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of th e monument we re t hereby appropriated and withdrawn from entry,location,selection,sale,leasing,or other disposition under the public land laws,and that l ands and interests in land not owned by the united states s hould be reserved as a part of the monument upon acquisition of title thereto by the united states.id.at.the proclamation did not,however,reserve water as a matter of federal law.id.as part of the proclamation,president clinton directed the secretary of the interior the secretary to prepare,within years,a management plan for the monument.id.lastly,the proclamation provided that the secretary would manage the m onument through the bureau of land management blm.id.
the management plan for the monument 
on november,the secretary issued a final management plan the plan and record of decision rod for the monument.
the rod,which was published as part of the plan,stated,in pertinent part 
d iscussion of assertions in footnote of chapter of the approved plan has also been clarified to emphasize that nothing in the plan extinguishes any valid existing in grand national monument.nothing in this plan alters in any way any legal rights the counties of garfield and kane or the state of utah has to assert and protect rights,and to challenge in federal court,or any other appropriate venue,any blm road closures that they believe are inconsistent with their rights.
app.at citing rod,ix.
the plan,in a section entitled transportation and access,stated 
this plan designates the route system for the monument.the transportation map map,in the back of the document shows routes that will be open for public use and those available for administrative use only see the administrative routes and authorized users section for related decisions.any route not shown on map is considered closed upon approval of this plan,subject to valid existing rights.fn 
the specific routes shown open for public use are based on a variety of considerations including what is needed to protect monument resources,implement the planning decisions,and provide for the transportation needs of surrounding communities.the basic philosophy in determining which routes will be open was to determine which routes access some destinations,scenic overlook,popular camping site,heavily used thoroughfare and present no significant threat to monument resources.these routes will be open for public use.routes that were not considered necessary or desirable for resource protection purposes will not be kept open for motorized and mechanized public access.in the event that title are issued or in the event of legal decisions on rs assertions,routes will be governed under the terms of those actions.
grand national monument management plan at,available at management.html last visited on january,emphasis added 
under the transportation and access provisions,the plan also provided 
road restoration strategy 
the blm strategy for restoring routes that will no longer be available for public or administrative motorized use in the monument will be phased over a period of years.this will be accomplished as rapidly as funding permits.it is anticipated that this could take as many as ten years.each year,a percentage of the monument base budget will be used to restore routes in areas that are easily accessible to the public and that involve sensitive resources in immediate danger of being degraded.generally,routes in the frontcountry and passage zones will be closed first.however,there may be routes in the outback and primitive zones that will be considered on a basis.
the proposal for restoration will include 
not repairing washed out routes 
natural barriers,such as large boulders 
dead and down wood to obscure route entry ways 
ripping up the route bed and reseeding with vegetation natural to that area 
replacing gates with a fence if area has a fence in place 
visitor education and information 
each route will be looked at individually,and the best,least intrusive method will be used based on the geography,topography,soils,hydrology,and vegetation.the first several hundred feet of select routes identified for closure could be left open to provide areas or camping opportunities,preventing new ground disturbance elsewhere.
the plan also addressed the diversion of water to locations outside of the monument 
ensure that land management policies protect water resources.
since much of the water important to the monument falls as precipitation within the monument,its continued availability can be ensured by appropriate land management policies within the monument.the blm will exercise its existing land management authorities to protect and maintain all available water and natural flows in the monument.several decisions described in other sections of this plan are designed to meet this objective.these include the following 
in general,diversions of water out of the monument will not be permitted.there is an existing diversion of groundwater out of the monument for the domestic water supply of the nearby town of henrieville.this plan does not prohibit the continuation of this diversion,nor its expansion,if necessary,to meet the municipal needs of population growth in henrieville.any proposed new groundwater diversion to meet henrieville municipal needs could be approved,consistent with the plan,if the blm and the utah state engineer complete a joint analysis to determine that such development would not adversely impact springs or other water resources within the monument,and the blm completes the usual nepa analysis.exceptions could be considered for other local community culinary needs if the applicant could demonstrate that the diversion of water will not damage water resources within the monument or conflict with the objectives of this plan.

the filing and dismissal of plaintiffs complaint 
on november,a group of entities consisting of kane county,utah,the kane county board of commissioners,the kane county water conservancy district the district,garfield county,utah,and the garfield county board of commissioners filed this action against the secretary,the department of the interior,the blm and its director,the acting utah state director of the blm,and the manager of the monument,seeking mandamus,declaratory and injunctive relief.in their first amended complaint,the plaintiffs alleged that kane and garfield counties own ed numerous crossing public lands within the counties and also within the monument that continue d to serve the valuable interests of the public in traveling from place to place across public lands within and without the counties,app.at,and that the counties were authorized under utah state law to regulate the use of the roads on,and traffic across,those,id.at.the first amended complaint further alleged that the district own ed various water rights and rights to water within kane county,id.at,some of which ha d points of diversion within the boundaries of the monument,id.at.in turn,the first amended complaint alleged that the plan fail ed to comply with the flpma in that it wa s not subject to valid existing rights,it restrict ed the use of,and terminate d,valid existing rights,it extensively and unnecessarily curtail ed historic and current public uses,it utterly fail ed to address plaintiffs local plans,and it ignore d flpma principles of multiple use.id.at.more specifically,the first amended complaint alleged that the plan its implementation 
created a transportation system in willful blindness to the counties rights,purported to regulate and restrict the use of valid existing rights,and to otherwise close and destroy valid existing rights within the boundaries of the monument,id.at 
fail ed to identify even a single county within the entire million acre monument,
denied and impaired the counties ability to manage their,the public historic uses and rights,and the county roads that traverse these in accordance with applicable law,id.at 
denied the counties,and the public,the use and enjoyment of the counties within the monument,including according to historic and current public uses,id.at and 
purport ed to trap the district water rights and points of diversion within the monument,and to impose unauthorized burdens upon the district to seek diversion of these water rights from the monument,id.at.
based upon these allegations,the first amended complaint asserted three causes of action against defendants a claim under the administrative procedures act apa the doctrine of judicial review,id.at,seeking a declaration that defendants actions had violated the flpma the due process clause and impaired the counties interests in the continuing use,access,possession,maintenance and management of their,id.at a claim for injunctive relief in the form of an order enjoining enforcement of certain transportation and access,including map,and water sections of the plan,id.at and a claim for mandamus relief in the form of a court order directing each of the individual defendants to first determine plaintiffs valid existing rights before asserting or taking any action in enforcement or implementation of certain transportation and access,including map,or water sections of the plan,and directing monument manager david hunsaker to remove any physical barriers placed upon any or road within the monument until such time as it has been determined that such actions will not impair valid existing rights,id.at.
on november,the southern utah wilderness alliance,the national trust for historic preservation,the wilderness society,and the sierra club collectively suwa moved to intervene as defendants in the action pursuant to.a.the district court granted suwa motion on january.
on may,the federal defendants moved to dismiss the first amended complaint on four grounds because plaintiffs vague and conclusory assertions of injuries to unspecified and water rights we re insufficient to establish a concrete,giving rise to standing,id.at because plaintiffs challenges to the plan we re not ripe due to plaintiffs failure to allege how the plan ha d,in fact,restricted or denied on a level the exercise of any valid existing rights held by plaintiffs,id.at because the apa does not waive sovereign immunity for the adjudication of claims that are premised upon the assertion of unproven property interests in federal land,such as plaintiffs and water right claims,and because neither flpma nor the due process clause require d the federal defendants to identify and determine all existing within a planning area when preparing a land use plan,id.
on may,suwa moved for judgment on the pleadings,arguing,in pertinent part,that the united states could not be sued based upon bare allegations of title,such as made by the counties here,except under the quiet title act,which the counties failed to invoke.id.at.
on june,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting in part the federal defendants motion to dismiss and suwa motion for judgment on the pleadings.in doing so,the district court dismissed the claim for judicial review of the plan under the apa,but granted the plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint under the quiet title act as to the existence and scope of id.at.as for the district claim concerning the diversion of water out of the monument,the district court dismissed it as premature,but granted the district leave to file an amended complaint within twenty days id.
the district supplement to the first amended complaint 
on july,the district filed a supplement to the first amended complaint.the supplement alleged that on june,the district filed its application for transportation and utility systems and facilities on federal lands for the purpose of obtaining a for the use of a and to install a to buried pipeline and related utility lines along an existing road.id.at.the supplement further alleged that t he monument manager responded to the application by citing the plan provisions regarding diversions of water and stating that a could probably be issued,id.at,if the district was able to demonstrate that the diversion of water w ould not damage water resources within the monument or conflict with the objectives of th e plan,id.at.the supplement alleged that d efendants ha d no right or authority to determine underground water resource damage,water conflicts,or to prohibit types of uses of the district water because t hose decisions we re within the exclusive jurisdiction of the utah state engineer.id.at.in addition,the supplement alleged that d efendants ha d no process or authority for adjudicating water resource damage or conflicts,nor any such process or authority for the criteria that we re being imposed upon the district by the monument manager and his staff.id.at.ultimately,the supplement alleged that d efendants refusal to process the district application constitute d either discrete,final agency action that wa s arbitrary,capricious and beyond statutory right and authority,or agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed,id.at.in turn,the supplement asked the district court to enter an order declaring the water resource based restrictions or criteria on diversion of water from the monument in the plan and sections to be arbitrary,capricious,or beyond right or authority,enjoining enforcement of the unlawful water resource based restrictions or criteria in the plan and sections,and directing defendants to process the district application without reference to the unlawful restrictions or criteria id.
on august,the federal defendants moved to dismiss the first amended complaint as supplemented by the district.the motion argued that the supplement should be dismissed as unripe and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the plan d id not prohibit new water diversions within the monument and the district otherwise c ould not establish that the blm ha d denied or unreasonably delayed the processing of the district application.id.at.in the memorandum in support of the motion,the federal defendants acknowledged that the district had filed its application on june.the federal defendants alleged,however,that the monument manager notified the district on june,that additional information and documentation including a location map needed to be submitted before the application could be processed.id.at.the monument manager allegedly further advised the district that a the processing time would vary depending upon whether the district or the blm prepared the environmental assessment ea,b there were no restrictions in the plan that would preclude issuance of the assuming the district could establish that the diversion of water would not damage water resources within the monument or conflict with the objectives of the plan,and c it would be premature to offer any opinion on the likelihood that the application would be approved.id.at.according to the federal defendants,the district subsequently completed its application and the monument manager,on july,sent a letter to the district advising it that upon payment of the required processing fee,the blm w ould begin processing the application and preparing an ea to analyze the action id.at.based upon these allegations,the federal defendants motion argued that the district challenges to the water provisions of the plan were unripe and should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
on august,suwa filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings arguing that,for the reasons set forth in the federal defendants motion to dismiss,the district supplemental complaint should be dismissed for lack of ripeness and failure to state a claim upon which relief c ould be granted.id.at.
on december,the district court issued an order granting the federal defendants motion to dismiss and suwa motion for judgment on the pleadings.id.at.in doing so,the district court opined that the district claims we re still premature because its application wa s still pending before the blm,id.at,and the utah state engineer ha d not taken any final action on a separate water right change application filed by the district with the state engineer in august,id.at.in short,the district court noted that not much ha d changed since the court issued its memorandum opinion,and the district challenges to the water provisions of the plan remain ed unripe and premature pursuant to the terms of the court prior ruling.id.
the district has since filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court june,and december,orders.
the county plaintiffs appeal 
on july,the county plaintiffs all of the plaintiffs except for the district filed a motion asking the district court to certify,pursuant to.b,its memorandum opinion and order dated june,as a final order.id.at.on september,before any action was taken on their rule b motion,the county plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the district court memorandum opinion and order entered on june,dismissing their claims.shortly thereafter,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting the county plaintiffs rule b motion id.at.
consolidation of appeals 
on february,we issued an order consolidating the two appeals for purposes of record creation,briefing,and court consideration.id.at.
the county plaintiffs,in appeal,contend the district court erred in granting the federal defendants motion to dismiss and suwa motion for judgment on the pleadings.we review a district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under.b de novo.tsosie united states,cir.a district court dismissal for failure to state a claim under.b is also reviewed de novo.id.
did the district court summary dismissal violate olenhouse 
the county plaintiffs first assert that the district court summary dismissal of their claims,dismissing based solely on review of the first amended complaint and motions,and without benefit of the administrative record,violated the procedures required by our decision in olenhouse commodity credit,cir.according to the county plaintiffs,the allegations of their first amended complaint established that they had both constitutional and prudential standing to challenge the blm plan,and thus the district court was prohibited from summarily dismissing their complaint,and was instead required to obtain the administrative record and review on the merits the challenged agency action.
we readily reject the county plaintiffs arguments.it is true that in olenhouse we outlined the principles of judicial review of final agency action under the administrative procedure act apa.see at.importantly,however,nothing in olenhouse or,for that matter,other controlling case law or the apa itself precludes an complaint from being summarily dismissed pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.indeed,olenhouse is silent with respect to the propriety of motions to dismiss claims olenhouse aside,case law firmly establishes that claims can,if appropriate,be summarily dismissed,benzman whitman,cir concluding that district court properly rejected the sufficiency of all aspects of the plaintiffs apa claims.
we thus conclude,contrary to the county plaintiffs arguments,that the district court did not err by dismissing the complaint pursuant to rule b and without obtaining or reviewing the administrative record.
did the district court properly dismiss the county plaintiffs claims 
the county plaintiffs assert a host of challenges to the merits of the district court order dismissing their claims.chief among those is their contention that the federal defendants have a duty,prior to closing or managing any roads on purported,to conduct administrative determinations regarding the validity of those purported.id.at.these determinations,the county plaintiffs argue,are necessary for the federal defendants to comply with their flpma duty to manage public lands subject to valid existing rights and without diminishing or reducing any granted prior to.id.at.we disagree.
prior to,the blm staunchly maintained that it lacked authority to make binding decisions on rights of way.utah,at.in,however,the blm changed course and proposed comprehensive regulations governing rights of way,including an administrative procedure by which the blm would adjudicate the validity of claims.id.at.congress responded with an appropriations provision prohibiting the department of the interior from issuing final rules governing id.the general accounting office has since concluded that this provision has the status of permanent law.id.citing gao opinion at.consequently,we have held that the blm lacks primary jurisdiction to conclusively adjudicate claims such as those now asserted by the county plaintiffs.id.at.
in light of this background,we readily conclude that the county plaintiffs allegations failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under the apa.section of the apa empowers a district court to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.in norton utah wilderness alliance,d,the supreme court held that a claim under can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take.here,as noted,we have expressly held,in recognition of binding federal law,that the blm lacks the authority to conclusively resolve claims.utah,at.thus,the county plaintiffs are not entitled under the apa to an order directing the blm to resolve all outstanding claims as part of its plan.
in their appellate brief,the county plaintiffs attempt to disclaim any interest in having the blm conclusively adjudicate ownership of the purported.aplt.br.at.according to the county plaintiffs,all they are seeking instead is an order directing the blm to consider,for its own planning purposes,whether or not the county plaintiffs purported are valid.id.at.more specifically,the county plaintiffs allege that the blm has a duty to administratively adjudicate,by relying at least in part on preliminary determin ations it made during its prior and.utah transportation planning,any and all claims the county plaintiffs may have.id.at.in our view,however,neither the statute,note providing that all actions by the secretary concerned under this act shall be subject to valid existing rights,nor the regulation,the county plaintiffs cite to imposes such a requirement.further,although plaintiffs also cite to a handful of decisions issued by the interior board of land appeals,aplt.br.at,none of those decisions impose any type of binding requirement on the blm that would be enforceable under the apa.
to be sure,we recognized in utah that the blm possessed the authority to determin e the validity of rights of way for its own purposes.at.but,importantly,nothing in federal law requires the blm to do so.thus,even though the county plaintiffs might prefer that the blm informally adjudicate their purported,they may not,as the district court correctly concluded,shift their burden as claimants or shortcut the existing processes for determining their unresolved claims by insisting that the blm import its internal and preliminary road inventory work on unresolved claims in and prior to this court decision in utah into its planning processes in formulating the management plan.app.at.
lastly,the county plaintiffs contend that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to review what they refer to as their due process claims under the apa.aplt.br.at.in support of this contention,the county plaintiffs again refer to the procedural requirement that the federal defendants consider valid existing rights during planning id.at.as explained above,however,we are aware of no provision of federal law that imposes such a procedural requirement.
in connection with this contention,the county plaintiffs also cite,in passing,to the flpma directive that l and use plans of the secretary under this section shall be consistent with state and local plans to the maximum extent he finds consistent with federal law and the purposes of this act.c.but this directive does not help the county plaintiffs.to begin with,it gives the secretary of the interior discretion to determine the extent to which the agency land use plans are consistent with state and local plans.in light of this discretion,it is doubtful that the provision was intended to,or could reasonably be construed as,creating a procedural right enforceable by state or local governmental entities.in any event,even assuming that the provision did create some type of procedural right,that right was protected in this case because the plan expressly recognizes that the county plaintiffs may have valid and acknowledges that any such will be honored by the blm.
does the quiet title act preclude the relief requested by the county plaintiffs 
the county plaintiffs contend that the quiet title act,which they concede is the exclusive means for adverse claimants to challenge the federal government title to real property,does not preclude their claims because they are not request ing an adjudication of title to the purported,but rather are seek ing declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the federal defendants to comply with statutory procedures and duties before taking agency action.aplt.br.at.
although it is true that nothing in the quiet title act necessarily precludes the type of relief the county plaintiffs now assert they are seeking,that does not change the fact that they have failed to point to any provision of federal law that would require the blm to perform the actions they are seeking,the nonbinding administrative determination of their purported.in other words,quiet title act aside,the county plaintiffs claims lack merit.
the county plaintiffs other claims 
in the proceedings below,the county plaintiffs also complained that a the plan restrictions on vehicles ohv infringed on their purported,and b the blm failed to coordinate its formulation of the plan with county officials and existing county plans for the purported.the district court,in its june,memorandum opinion and order,dismissed both claims.with respect to the claim,the district court concluded that it necessarily implicate d questions of title,the existence and historical scope of the counties claimed within the monument boundaries.app.at.because t he counties ha d not pleaded their existing ohv claims under the quiet title act,the district court concluded,they must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.id.as for the failure to coordinate claim,the district court concluded that the alleged flowing from the blm alleged failure to coordinate the formulation of the management plan with county officials and existing county plans appear ed to be indistinguishable from that alleged with respect to the plan restriction of vehicles or the status of the counties unresolved claims within the monument,and thus t hese allegations could not confer standing upon the counties or jurisdiction upon th e court where the same has already been found to be lacking.id.
in their appellate brief,the county plaintiffs do not specifically address either of these claims and thus have presumably waived those claims.even assuming otherwise,we find the district court analysis persuasive.
the district,in appeal,contends that the plan water resource exception criteria are unlawful and have impaired the district water rights.according to the district,t he utah state engineer has exclusive jurisdiction to decide water resource damage or conflicts,and t he district water right in the monument is an appropriated water right,the uses of which are exclusively governed by the utah state engineer.aplt.br.at.the district contends that it seeks judicial review of the agency decisionmaking culminating in the federal defendants decision to keep water in the monument,and to assume management of water resources.id.at.the district also contends that t he exception criteria are being enforced upon its water rights to its detriment and there is no further refinement of the agency position to warrant delaying review.id.
the problem with the district claim,as the district court aptly concluded,is that it fails to allege an actual resulting from the challenged plan provisions.app.at.the plan provisions addressing the diversion of water to locations outside of the monument expressly acknowledged the district existing water rights there is an existing diversion of groundwater out of the monument for the domestic water supply of the nearby town of henrieville.this plan does not prohibit the continuation of this diversion,nor its expansion,if necessary,to meet the municipal needs of population growth in henrieville.plan at.these provisions,which the district all but ignores,clearly protect and preserve the district existing water rights.thus,we conclude the district lacks standing to challenge these plan provisions.see sprint commc ns,apcc,d i n order to have article iii standing,a plaintiff must adequately establish an injury in fact.
that leaves,at best,only the district interests in expanding its use of water from within the monument.as to that issue,the plan stated any proposed new groundwater diversion to meet henrieville municipal needs could be approved,consistent with the plan,if the blm and the utah state engineer complete a joint analysis to determine that such development would not adversely impact springs or other water resources within the monument,and the blm completes the usual nepa analysis.id.apparently acknowledging the validity of this provision,the district,on june,nearly seven months after this action was initiated,submitted an application to the blm for a flpma title v to drill a well and to construct an access road,pipeline and electrical service line to convey water from the well to the district johnson canyon water system.app.at affidavit of michael noel.because the district application remains pending before the blm,any potential claim arising out of the blm final decision is premature.see ohio forestry,sierra club,d noting that the ripeness requirement is designed to protect agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging party.in other words,it is entirely possible that the blm will grant the district application,in which event the district will have suffered no injury.
the judgment of the district court is affirmed.the appellees motions to dismiss in appeal are denied as moot.
i concur in my colleagues fine opinion,but write separately to remind the counties and the blm of another avenue that is open to them.
i agree with the majority that the counties have failed to allege a concrete and particularized injury stemming from blm adoption of the management
