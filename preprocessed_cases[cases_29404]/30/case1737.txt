the present action is brought by plaintiff homeowners,michael gutierrez,louise gutierrez,martin gutierrez,carmen gutierrez,anthony bieggar,rosa bieggar,frank magdaleno,carol magdaleno,ulric presta,nikki presta,chris scott,and michelle scott,for inverse condemnation against defendant county of san bernardino the county.the alleged takings occurred during rainstorms in december and october.on both occasions,plaintiffs properties were inundated with water,dirt,and debris flowing from the mountainous area north of their properties.
plaintiffs properties are located along greenwood avenue in devore,just north of interstate.the area,while residential,is rural in nature.greenwood avenue runs generally in a direction with kenwood avenue being the southern terminus,and mountains to the north.at the time of the floodings,approximately percent of greenwood avenue was paved the percent closest to the mountains known as the greenwood alignment was unimproved dirt,not suitable to drive on.the paved portion of greenwood avenue appears to be about feet wide with no storm drains.aerial photographs show a large canyon that drains to the base of the mountains just north of the unimproved greenwood alignment.there is no flood control infrastructure at the base of the mountains.
in october,the old fire denuded the mountains north of devore.on december,it rained.the water flowed out of the mountains and down greenwood avenue,carrying with it significant amounts of debris and sediment.the flow caused substantial damage to plaintiffs residences and property.the following month,the county placed along both sides of the paved portion of greenwood avenue for the purpose of protecting the residents from further damage.in october,more rain hit the area,causing water,debris,and sediment to flow down greenwood avenue.some of the water,debris,and sediment escaped the confines of the,causing damage to plaintiffs properties.
introduction 
inverse condemnation 
article i,section of the california constitution permits private property to be taken or damaged for public use only when just compensation has first been paid to,the owner.when there is incidental damage to private property caused by governmental action,but the governmental entity has not reimbursed the owner,a suit in inverse condemnation may be brought to recover monetary damages for any special injury,one not shared in common by the general public citation.locklin city of lafayette cal th,locklin.
courts have referred to an important policy underpinning inverse condemnation damages as the loss distribution premise.see holtz superior court cal d,fn.omitted holtz.as the holtz court explained the general rule of compensability does not derive from statutory or common law tort doctrine,but instead rests on the construction of our constitutional provision the decisive consideration is whether the owner of the damaged property if uncompensated would contribute more than his proper share to the public undertaking.in other words,the underlying purpose of our constitutional provision in inverse as well as ordinary condemnation is to distribute throughout the community the loss inflicted upon the individual by the making of public improvements citation to socialize the burden to afford relief to the landowner in cases in which it is unfair to ask him to bear a burden that should be assumed by society citation.id.at.
an action for inverse condemnation lies when there is actual physical injury to real property proximately caused by a public improvement as deliberately designed and constructed whether said physical injury is foreseeable or not.belair riverside county flood control dist.cal d,belair.to be a proximate cause,the design,construction,or maintenance of the improvement must be a substantial cause of the damages.arreola county of monterey th.
b.the parties contentions and procedural background 
although plaintiffs asserted claims against the county for inverse condemnation,nuisance,dangerous and defective condition of public property,and trespass,only the cause of action for inverse condemnation was tried as to this theory,plaintiffs alleged that during both storms greenwood avenue functioned as intended,designed,constructed and maintained to channel large portions of storm flows down greenwood avenue,allowing the water and debris to escape onto plaintiffs properties,causing substantial damage.at trial,plaintiffs basic positions were greenwood avenue,together with the unpaved greenwood alignment,was a county roadway and,as such,was a public improvement for purposes of inverse condemnation law the county installation of the prior to the october flood constituted a further public improvement in both the december flood and the october flood,greenwood avenue functioned as a storm channel,proximately causing damage to plaintiffs properties and under albers county of los angeles cal d albers,the county is strictly liable for such damage.
the county contended that,as to the december flood,any damage to plaintiffs properties was not caused by a public improvement.as for the installation of the and the october flood,the county submitted that there was no showing that the caused any damage over and above the damage that would have occurred in the absence of the.further,as to the flood,the county asserted that strict liability does not apply instead,its actions are governed by a reasonableness standard under locklin,and that it acted reasonably.
at trial,the issue of damages was bifurcated from that of whether a taking had occurred.following the presentation of plaintiffs on the takings issue,the trial court granted a nonsuit as to the claim arising from the december flood.following the presentation of the defense case,the court ruled in favor of the county on the remaining claim.in its tentative decision,which became the statement of decision,the court found that as to the december flood there was no public improvement that constituted a taking.as to the october flood,the court found that the installation of the was a public improvement and that it caused damage to the plaintiffs properties.the court concluded,however,that strict liability did not apply,and that in considering the various criteria set forth in locklin,supra,cal th at pages and,the county acted reasonably.
as presented by the pleadings,the evidence,and the arguments on appeal,the present matter deals with two alleged takings.the first being the initial flood in december,which occurred approximately two months after the old fire,and the second being the flood of october.
as to the incident,we conclude the greenwood alignment was not a public improvement for purposes of inverse condemnation,and to the extent the lower,paved greenwood avenue was a public improvement,plaintiffs failed to submit any evidence that it was a cause of their injuries.
relative to the october flooding,surface water was diverted into a temporary fixed channel consisting of the paved roadway bordered on both sides by.although this channel constitutes a public improvement,we hold that the appropriate legal standard to apply is that of reasonableness,and that substantial evidence supports the trial court conclusion that the county acted reasonably relative to its installation of the.
we therefore affirm the judgment.
ii.discussion 
a.the december and october storms 
geologically,the greenwood avenue area is described as a relatively flat mesa and an alluvial fan.to the immediate north are mountains.a aerial photograph shows greenwood avenue as a dirt road extending northerly to the base of a canyon.there is a deep,incised,natural channel at the bottom of the canyon.the photograph shows no evidence of any dam or other infrastructure.as depicted in the photograph,the unpaved greenwood avenue was the primary flow path for water coming from the canyon.
an aerial photograph taken in also shows the greenwood alignment and greenwood avenue which was by then paved to be the primary flow path out of the canyon.sometime before,fill was placed near the outlet of the canyon,creating a dam for the natural flows coming out of the canyon over time,the dam allowed sediment to build up at the outlet of the canyon.before the old fire and the december,rain,water flowed out to the bottom of the canyon,hit the dam,and moved westerly.plaintiffs expert testified that he was not aware that any of the plaintiffs sustained any damage to their properties as a result of flooding or debris prior to the fire and the december,incident.
the debris from the december,storm came in two large waves one in the morning and one in the afternoon.as the initial flow intensified,water moved south down the greenwood alignment between the uppermost two homes.during the afternoon wave,the dam burst,allowing all of the material to flow down greenwood avenue in a very concentrated manner.the water and debris flowed down greenwood avenue and inundated adjacent houses 
if the dam had not burst,the owners would have suffered less damage.of the cubic yards of debris that came down greenwood avenue was attributable to the sediment and debris built up at the fill came from the upper portions of the canyon.without the sediment and debris from the dam,most of the material would have spread out and not reached the houses along greenwood avenue.
at the end of january,the county installed along greenwood avenue,just off the pavement edge.the purpose of the was to protect the properties adjacent to greenwood avenue by keeping the majority of the debris within the confines of greenwood avenue.in addition to the installed along the paved portion of greenwood avenue,a few were installed closer to the mouth of the canyon so that flows would remain in the natural drainage course along the greenwood alignment.
in the october flood,greenwood avenue served as a storm drain.the installed on both sides of greenwood avenue created a kind of funnel,capturing debris and water and conveying it all down greenwood avenue.
b.the trial court properly granted a nonsuit as to the december flood 
as to the december storm,plaintiffs contend the entire length of greenwood avenue,including the unimproved dirt alignment,is a public improvement.they submit that,historically,greenwood avenue was a natural flow path for water coming from the mountains and,as a public improvement,it should have been improved such that it would carry the water and debris generated by the december,storm.they further contend that the road concentrated and exacerbated the natural flow of water,thereby causing damage to their properties in both veins,they contend the county is strictly liable.
as to whether there was a public improvement at the time of the december flood,the parties agree that the paved portion of greenwood avenue was a county road and that it had been improved by its paving.it is the unimproved greenwood alignment that is the bone of contention.at both the trial level and on appeal,a great deal of briefing and argument has been dedicated to whether this unimproved area was a county road.plaintiffs maintain that the county owned the fee interest underlying the road and had accepted the road into the county road system.the county argues that it merely had an easement,which had not been accepted into its road system.while the evidence may be in conflict on this issue,we do not believe its resolution is crucial to the outcome of the case.as we explain below,even accepting plaintiffs position that the dirt alignment is a county road,owned in fee and accepted into the county road system,it is nonetheless unimproved raw land that has not been deliberately acted upon by the county and,as such,is not a public improvement for purposes of inverse condemnation.
in viewing numerous photographs in our record,it is evident that the greenwood alignment is unimproved.photographs show that at the time of the december flood there were two houses at the base of the mountains between which the greenwood alignment was located.to reach each of these homes there were driveways that spurred off from the top of the paved portion of greenwood avenue.neither resident appears to have used the unimproved alignment for access to their properties.before the floods,the greenwood alignment appears as nothing more than raw land.no grading had been done and the area was incapable of being used by passenger vehicles.other than the fact that the county may have been a fee owner of the property,there was no evidence that the county deliberately acted upon the property in any fashion prior to the december flood.
wildensten east bay regional park dist.d is instructive.there,the defendant governmental entity owned undeveloped land known as wildcat canyon regional park.within the park was a steep slope the plaintiff,wildensten,owned the property on top of the slope and immediately adjacent thereto.the slope was subject to landslides,thereby subjecting wildensten property to retrogressive failure.wildensten contended that her property had been taken and damaged within the meaning of article i,section of the california constitution.the court of appeal stated the issue before us is whether a governmental entitys mere ownership of undeveloped land and refusal to stabilize part of the land which threatens an adjacent landowners property with landslide supports a claim for inverse condemnation.we hold it does not.to state a cause of action for inverse condemnation,the plaintiff must allege the defendant substantially participated in the planning,approval,construction,or operation of a public project or improvement which proximately caused injury to plaintiffs property.citations.wildenstens first amended complaint makes the legal conclusion that the districts ownership of the land alone constitutes an improvement.wildensten offers no authority holding that a governmental entitys mere ownership of raw land which threatens adjoining private property with landslide amounts to substantial participation in a public project or improvement.we have found no cases directly addressing the novel theory urged by wildensten.to the contrary,relevant case law confirms that mere ownership of undeveloped land,without more,can not form the basis for an inverse condemnation claim.wildensten east bay regional park,supra,at,fn.omitted.alleging no affirmative actions by the district to further a public project which proximately caused injury to her property,wildensten thus failed to state a cause of action for inverse condemnation.id.at.here,as in wildensten,there is no evidence that the greenwood alignment is anything other than unimproved raw property over which the county took no affirmative action.
even if mere ownership of unimproved property is sufficient to constitute a public improvement,it is still necessary to show that the governmental entitys conduct toward the property was deliberate.as stated in arreola county of monterey,supra,th at page a public entity maintenance of a public improvement constitutes the constitutionally required public use so long as it is the entity deliberate act to undertake the particular plan or manner of maintenance.in the present case,as in wildensten,there was no evidence that the county deliberately undertook a particular plan of maintenance or course of action toward the unimproved greenwood alignment.we therefore conclude that under our facts the greenwood alignment was not a public improvement.
the parties do not dispute that the paved portion of greenwood avenue is a public improvement.the paved portion was indisputably accepted into the county road system by and was improved by being paved.see sheffet county of los angeles d,improvement of streets constitutes a public improvement for purposes of inverse condemnation andrew jergens city of,supra,d at the defendants paving of a roadway allegedly increased the downstream flow of water.the primary issue,however,is whether the paved status of greenwood avenue was a substantial cause in bringing about plaintiffs damages.we agree with the trial court that it was not.
here,the trial court in its statement of decision found that the paved portion of greenwood avenue was not a substantial cause of plaintiffs damages.in our review,we accept any reasonable interpretation of the evidence that supports the trial courts decision.we do not,however,defer to that decision entirely.dimartino city of orinda th.we look to the entire record to determine whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence.in re marriage of schmir th,locklin,supra,cal th at.
the issue of causation was addressed in belair,supra,cal d.there,a levee failed to retain water within its designed capacity and gave way after several days of heavy storms.id.at.in finding a causal relationship between the failure of the public improvement and the plaintiffs damages,the court stated i n order to establish a causal connection between the public improvement and the plaintiffs damages,there must be a showing of a substantial relationship excluding the probability that other forces alone produced the injury.citations.citation.where independently generated forces not induced by the public flood control improvementsuch as a rainstormcontribute to the injury,proximate cause is established where the public improvement constitutes a substantial concurring cause of the injury.id.at.
here,there was no evidence that any property owners along the paved portion of greenwood avenue sustained any damage from water or debris flows prior to the december storm.as the trial court found,pradels testimony established that the sole cause of plaintiffs damages was the breaking of the dam.pradel testified that without the sediment and debris from the dam,most of the material would not have reached the houses along greenwood avenue.our record is devoid of any facts supporting plaintiffs position that the paved portion of greenwood avenue was a substantial concurring cause of plaintiffs injuries in december accordingly,we find no error in the trial courts grant of nonsuit as it relates to the december flood.
c.the trial court did not err in applying a reasonableness standard or in finding that the county acted reasonably in installing the prior to the october flood 
as to the october flood,the trial court found that the installation of the was a public improvement.it further found that causation was established and that plaintiffs suffered damages.however,contrary to plaintiffs position,the trial court did not apply the strict liability standard of albers,supra,cal d instead,it applied the test of reasonableness set forth in belair,supra,cal d and locklin,supra,cal th.we agree with the trial court.
our standard of review is mixed.the question of whether to apply a standard of reasonableness under belair and locklin or a strict liability standard under albers is a legal issue we review de novo.see pacific bell city of san diego th.when the reasonableness standard applies,the question of whether a public agency acted reasonably is a inquiry.belair,supra,cal d at skoumbas city of orinda th.we review the courts factual findings under the substantial evidence standard.akins state of california th.the application of the appropriate legal standard to the facts properly found by the trial court is a legal question.see paterno state of california th,ali city of los angeles th.
following the december flooding,the county installed at the mouth of the canyon and down both sides of the paved portion of greenwood avenue.the installation was deliberately designed and placed by the county in an attempt to contain surface water and debris within a fixed channel.as such,it was a public improvement.see marin city of san rafael d,the construction and maintenance of storm drainage systems are matters of public policy,and such a system created by a public entity becomes a public improvement,disapproved on another point in bunch coachella valley water dist.cal th.
plaintiffs,relying on albers,supra,cal d,argue that the county should be strictly liable for the damages proximately caused by the installation of the.in albers,a major landslide in the palos verdes hills damaged the plaintiffs properties.id.at.prior thereto,the area was known by geologists and by the county of los angeles to be a slide area.in an effort to provide greater vehicular access to the area,the county acquired a road easement and began improvements.the landslide at issue was triggered as a result of pressure exerted by cubic yards of dirt that had been placed on the road easement and adjacent thereto.a number of the plaintiffs lost their homes and damage was caused to the water distribution system of a local company.finding an absence of negligence,the trial court ruled in favor of the county.id.at.the supreme court reversed.
the albers court,while recognizing certain exceptions established by archer city of los angeles cal d archer,overruled as stated in locklin,supra,cal th at page,and gray reclamation district cal,set forth a basic rule of strict liability.in interpreting the takings clause of the california constitution,the court stated we are of the opinion that the right assured to the owner by this provision of the c onstitution is not restricted to the case where he is entitled to recover as for a tort at common law.if he is consequently damaged by the work done,whether it is done carefully and with skill or not,he is still entitled to compensation for such damage under this provision.this provision was intended to assure compensation to the owner,as well where the damage is directly inflicted,or inflicted by want of care and skill,as where the damages are consequential,and for which damages he had no right of recovery at the common law.albers,supra,cal d at.
thereafter,in holtz,supra,cal d,a case involving subsidence of adjacent property as a result of excavation for the construction of the bart rapid transit system,the court again applied the concept of strict liability.however,it further observed in announcing our holding in albers while of course most fundamentally influenced by the loss distribution premise,we did not overlook the competing considerations which caution against an,absolute liability rule of inverse condemnation.recognizing that fears have been expressed that compensation,allowed too liberally,will seriously impede,if not stop,beneficial public improvements because of the greatly increased cost citation,we deemed it prudent to focus our policy inquiry on situations which shared a general factual similarity with that present in albers.id.at,fn.omitted.
the issue of strict,or absolute,liability was revisited in belair,supra,cal d,a case dealing with damage caused by flood waters following a levee break.in distinguishing albers and holtz,the court discussed at length the archer decision,which the albers court recognized as one of the exceptions to the rule of absolute liability in explaining the albers courts recognition of the archer exception,the belair court stated w e recognized in albers that strict inverse condemnation liability may not be appropriate in the case of flood control improvements belair,supra,at.the court continued on the one hand,a public agency that undertakes to construct or operate a flood control project clearly must not be made the absolute insurer of those lands provided protection.on the other hand,the damage potential of a defective public flood control project is clearly enormous.therefore,as we observed in holtz,the courts have consistently held that even when a public agency is engaged in such privileged activity as the construction of barriers to protect against floodwaters,it must at least act reasonably and.citations.citations.contrary to plaintiffs position,the fact that a dam bursts or a levee fails is not sufficient,standing alone,to impose liability.however,where the public agencys design,construction or maintenance of a flood control project is shown to have posed an unreasonable risk of harm to the plaintiffs,and such unreasonable design,construction or maintenance constituted a substantial cause of the damages,plaintiffs may recover regardless of the fact that the projects purpose is to contain the common enemy of floodwaters.citations.id.at.
the belair standard was clarified by locklin.there,the plaintiffs owned land that extended to the middle of a natural watercourse which drained a watershed of approximately acres.locklin,supra,cal th at.as a result of upstream development,the water course began carrying larger volumes of water which,in turn,caused significant erosion of the plaintiffs properties.the defendant governmental entities were aware of the problem and could have acted to prevent the erosion.id.at.each public entity was sued on the basis that their upstream improvements,including their storm drain system,as well as their failure to maintain the watercourse,increased the volume and velocity of the water in the natural watercourse,causing the plaintiffs damages.id.at.
in reaffirming the test of reasonableness set forth in belair,the locklin court stated when alterations or improvements on upstream property discharge an increased volume of surface water into a natural watercourse,and the increased volume velocity of the stream waters or the method of discharge into the watercourse causes downstream property damage,a public entity,as a property owner,may be liable for that damage.the test is whether,under all the circumstances,the upper landowners conduct was reasonable.this rule of reasonableness applies to both private and public landowners locklin,supra,cal th at.with respect to flood control projects,the court stated t he public agency is liable only if its conduct posed an unreasonable risk of harm to the plaintiffs,and that unreasonable conduct is a substantial cause of the damage to plaintiffs property.the rule of strict liability generally followed in inverse condemnation see albers,supra,cal d,is not applicable in this context.id.at.the departure from a strict liability standard was based on public policy b ecause strict liability would discourage construction of needed public improvements which affect surface water drainage,liability exists only if the agency acts unreasonably,with reasonableness determined by balancing the public benefit and private damage in each case.id.at.
for the reasons stated in belair and locklin we apply the reasonabless standard as opposed to the strict liability standard set forth in albers.first,the county installed the on greenwood avenue for the purpose of flood control to protect the residents from damage that could be caused by further flooding.as belair stated,a public agency that undertakes to construct or operate a flood control project clearly must not be made the absolute insurer of those lands provided protection.belair,supra,cal d at.second,as set forth in locklin,strict liability would discourage construction of needed public improvements which affect surface water drainage.locklin,supra,cal th at.here,the county installed the under exigent circumstances created by the combination of the old fire and the possibility of heavy rains in order to protect the residents of greenwood avenue.as set forth in the discussion regarding the flooding,if the county had taken no action to protect the residents there would be no basis for imposing liability on the county.if liability for acting,installing the could be imposed on the county based on strict liability,the county could well have decided to take no action.as a matter of public policy and common sense belair,supra,at,some protective action even if it should ultimately be insufficient should not be discouraged.we thus hold that the reasonable standard established in belair and clarified in locklin,not the strict liability standard applied in albers,is appropriate in this case.
in applying this standard of reasonableness,as explained in locklin,the plaintiff,among other things,must demonstrate that the efforts of the public entity to prevent downstream damage were not reasonable in light of the potential for damage posed by the entity conduct,the cost to the public entity of reasonable measures to avoid downstream damage,and the availability of and the cost to the downstream owner of means of protecting that property from damage.locklin,supra,cal th at.considerations in determining the reasonableness of the conduct in light of the underlying constitutional right that a property owner contribute no more than his share to the public undertaking are the overall public purpose being served by the improvement project the degree to which the plaintiffs loss is offset by reciprocal benefits the availability to the public entity of feasible alternatives with lower risks the severity of the plaintiffs damage in relation to capabilities the extent to which damage of the kind the plaintiff sustained is generally considered as a normal risk of land ownership and the degree to which similar damage is distributed at large over other beneficiaries of the project or is peculiar only to the plaintiff.id.at.
applying these factors to the present matter,there is substantial evidence to support the trial courts conclusion that the installation of the was reasonable.in october,the old fire significantly burned the mountains just north of greenwood avenue.two months later,surface water inundated the neighborhood following a rain as a result,plaintiffs properties sustained substantial damage.while numerous studies performed by the county in the years before the december rain had shown that the infrastructure at the base of the mountains was inadequate,there was no evidence that any of the plaintiffs properties had sustained any damage in the preceding years as a result of surface water because the december rain occurred during the rainy season,the county was faced with an exigent situation that called for prompt action to protect plaintiffs properties from further damage.theodore hromadka,the countys expert,indicated that at the time of the installation of the,the flood and storm season of january and february was just beginning.kenneth miller,a former director of public works for the county,testified that at the time of the december event,he considered it an emergency situation relative to protecting greenwood avenue from the threat of debris from future storms.hromadka further testified that given the intensity of the fire,the countys budget,and the quick time frame for dealing with the situation,the countys decision to install was eminently reasonable.
as a whole,the evidence demonstrated that the were installed for the public purpose of protecting the local neighborhood.the situation was exigent and there was no evidence presented that there were other feasible alternatives that would have provided better protection for plaintiffs properties additionally,given the flooding that occurred during the december rain,it is evident that similar damage would have occurred during the october storm if the county had not installed the.lastly,there was uncontroverted testimony that the installation of the benefitted the adjacent properties.in the absence of the,the damage to plaintiffs properties would have been greater than the damage that occurred.
thus,in considering the factors set forth in locklin,as applied to the present facts,there is substantial evidence supporting the trial courts decision that the countys conduct in installing the was reasonable.
lastly,we reject plaintiffs reliance on albers and the principle of strict liability.in viewing the multitude of cases cited by plaintiffs,only five appear to either explicitly or implicitly apply the concept of strict liability to damages caused by surface water four of the cases predate belair,and the remaining case akins state of california,supra,th is clearly distinguishable.as to the cases predating belair,their continuing validity in this context has been placed in doubt.as the court in bunch coachella valley water,supra,cal th,stated without expressly disapproving those court of appeal decisions finding strict liability for diverted surface waters,belair observed in dictum that its reasonableness analysis would most likely apply to future diversion cases when the government sought to prevent flooding on land potentially subject to it.the court doubted whether unintended property damage caused by diversion of water would elevate the test of inverse condemnation liability to absolute liability,rather than a reasonableness standard.belair,supra,cal d at.id.at.in light of belair and bunch,we decline to follow such cases.
akins,which belair,is readily distinguishable.there,in order to protect lower lying properties,the state of california created a dam that caused flo
