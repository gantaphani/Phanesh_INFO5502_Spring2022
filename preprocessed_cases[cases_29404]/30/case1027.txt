defenders of wildlife and the center for biological diversity collectively defenders appeal the grant of summary judgment to the army corps of engineers the corps.defenders challenged the decision of the corps not to consult with the fish and wildlife service the service on the effect on the arizona cactus ferruginous of two developments in arizona.the district court found that the corps determination that the developments would have no effect on the pygmy owl was not arbitrary or capricious.we affirm its judgment.
the cactus ferruginous,the bird at the center of our case,is described in national ass of home builders norton,cir,where a description of its habitat is also set out.in that case,we also described how the service came to designate the arizona as a discrete population segment dps,distinct from the in texas and in mexico.we held that the service had not demonstrated a rational basis in the listing rule for its finding that the arizona was a significant part of the taxon to which it belongs and therefore the service had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in designating the arizona as a dps.id.at.
the continental reserve permit.in december,the corps received a permit application under the clean water act,a section permit application,for the continental reserve project,a property being developed in the town of marana,arizona.continental reserve is a community with residences,a community park,a elementary school site,and large areas of undisturbed open space.
the service objected to the corps preliminary determination that the project would not affect federally listed species or their critical habitat and that formal consultation under section of the endangered species act esa,a,would not be required.the service contended that this particular project area serves as a movement corridor for the and likely provides nesting,roosting,and foraging habitat.
on march,the corps issued its environmental assessment,finding that the proposed activities would have no impact on the or adjoining habitat.on that same date,it issued the section permit to continental reserve.after the permit had been issued,the service continued to object,requesting formal consultation and notifying the corps that it did not concur in its no effect determination.
the entrada del oro permit.on november,grosvernor holdings grosvernor,a property owner,submitted a request to the corps for an individual section permit under the clean water act for the entrada del oro project.entrada del oro is a master planned community in pinal county,arizona,comprised of acres which will contain single family residences,parks,a school site,and open spaces.
on november,the corps issued its environmental assessment for the entrada del oro project.the corps noted that it had withdrawn its initial request for consultation with the service after the area had no longer been designated critical habitat,and that it had fully considered the service comments.on december,the corps issued grosvernor permit.the permit had special conditions that mandated,inter alia,regular surveys for in the future.after the entrada del oro permit had been issued,the service requested formal consultation to ensure that both the corps and grosvernor holdings are in compliance with the act.
proceedings 
defenders filed suit against the corps under the esa,a,and the administrative procedure act apa.defenders challenged the corps no effect determinations and its decisions to forgo section consultations with the service regarding the continental reserve and entrada del oro projects under the esa.
grosvernor filed a motion to intervene as of right under.a.the court granted the motion as to the remedial phase of the litigation,but denied it as to the liability phase.
the parties filed for summary judgment.on august,the court issued two orders granting the corps motions as to its permitting decisions for continental reserve and entrada del oro.the court noted that the no effect determination was a decision for the corps to make,not the usfws.the court found that 
based upon the best scientific and commercial evidence in the administrative record and the corps contemporaneous explanations for their no effect determination,it is clear that the corps considered the relevant factors based upon the voluminous data before it,reasonably rejected the undocumented assertions made by the usfws,and articulated a rational connection between the facts and its decision to make a no effect determination.
on august,the court entered final judgment against defenders.this timely appeal followed.
jurisdiction.grosvernor and amici challenge our jurisdiction arguing that the defenders lack standing.they have,however,as the district court held,sufficiently established their members interest in the arizona that the corps decisions arguably may affect the bird and what may be its habitat and that a contrary decision would have led to a remedy.even now the case is not moot because a court could design a remedy to provide protection for the bird.
the action agency responsibility.regulations under the esa provide 
requirement for formal consultation.each federal agency shall review its actions at the earliest possible time to determine whether any action may affect listed species or critical habitat.if such a determination is made,formal consultation is required,except as noted in paragraph b of this section.the director of the fish and wildlife service may request a federal agency to enter into consultation if he identifies any action of that agency that may affect listed species or critical habitat and for which there has been no consultation.when such a request is made,the director shall forward to the federal agency a written explanation of the basis for the request.
a.the service can request the action agency to enter into formal consultation.nothing in the regulations mandates the action agency to enter into consultation after it receives such a request.on the contrary,as the service has explained 
although the service will,when appropriate,request consultation on particular federal actions,it lacks the authority to require the initiation of consultation.the determination of possible effects is the federal agency responsibility.the federal agency has the ultimate duty to ensure that its actions are not likely to jeopardize listed species or adversely modify critical habitat.the federal agency makes the final decision on whether consultation is required,and it likewise bears the risk of an erroneous decision.
june.this court has come to the same conclusion.see southwest center for biological diversity forest service,cir.
the no effect rulings.our decision in national ass of home builders norton,was filed august,one day after the district court entered judgment in the instant case.our decision puts in doubt the status of the arizona as a significant part of its taxon and would seem to require its delisting as a dps we could rely on ass of home builders in affirming the judgment in this case.out of an abundance of caution,we review the district court decision de novo and hold that the decision rested on the firm foundation that no had been found to live within either project area.true,the service had once designated the entrada del oro area as critical habitat for the arizona but this designation was vacated by the district court in ass of home builders and thereafter the service did not designate it as critical,noting the lack of recent,verified locations and our inability to determine the presence of the primary constituent elements.at,table.similarly,the service nondesignation as critical of the continental reserve project area was properly read by the corps as a finding that the land was not essential to the functioning of unit as a corridor for movement of.
grosvernor appeal.our disposition of the case makes it unnecessary to decide grosvernor appeal from the judgment limiting its intervention.
for the reasons stated,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
in tersely affirming the district court judgment,the majority ignores the plain language of the endangered species act esa implementing regulations,trivializes the vital process of
