the panel affirmed in part,and reversed in part,the district court dismissal of plaintiffs claims arising from their citizen suit alleging that the environmental protection agency violated the endangered species act esa when it registered certain pesticide active ingredients and pesticide products without undertaking consultation with the national marine fisheries service and the united states fish and wildlife service collectively the service.
the esa requires federal agencies to consult with the service to ensure that their discretionary actions do not jeopardize endangered and threatened species,or adversely modify a listed species critical habitat.the federal insecticide,fungicide and rodenticide act charges the epa with the obligation to register and reregister pesticide active ingredients and pesticide products.
plaintiffs framed claims for relief with each claim centering on one pesticide active ingredient.with each pesticide active ingredient,plaintiffs identified four categories of agency actions which allegedly triggered the epa duty to consult under section a of the esa,and these comprised the.
concerning plaintiffs category one,which identified the epa issuance of the reregistration eligibility decisions as an agency action,the panel held that all category one were properly dismissed by the district court as either or jurisdictionally barred.specifically,the panel held that where,as here,the plaintiffs alleged that an agency failed to comply with the esa procedural requirements,the general statute of limitations period,set forth in a,applied.the panel also held that an esa section claim raised after the epa undertook public notice and comment must comply with the jurisdictional provisions of the federal insecticide,fungicide and rodenticide act,and a plaintiff must file a petition for review in the court of appeals within days of the entry of the contested final order.
concerning plaintiffs category two,which alleged that the epa continued discretionary control of the pesticide registration constituted agency action,the panel affirmed the district court dismissal of all category two because they failed to identify an affirmative agency action that would trigger a section consultation.
concerning plaintiffs category three,which alleged that the epa completion of pesticide reregistration for a specific pesticide active ingredient was an agency action,the panel held that the completion of the reregistration was simply a fact,and therefore it could not trigger section consultation.the panel affirmed the dismissal of category three.
concerning plaintiffs category four,which alleged that the epa approval of individual pesticide products was an agency action,the panel reversed the district court dismissal of all category four.the panel agreed with the district court that pesticide product reregistration was an affirmative agency action,but disagreed that those claims were barred by the collateral attack doctrine.the panel remanded for further proceedings.
judge bea dissented in part.judge bea agreed with most of the majority opinion,but dissented from the conclusion that the category four were not a collateral attack on the epa prior approval of the pesticides in those products.judge bea would affirm the district court dismissal of the category four.
paez,circuit judge 
the federal insecticide,fungicide and rodenticide act fifra charges the environmental protection agency epa with the obligation to register and reregister pesticide active ingredients and pesticide products in this case,the center for biological diversity and the pesticide action network north america collectively,cbd allege that the epa violated the endangered species act esa when it reregistered certain pesticide active ingredients and pesticide products without undertaking consultation with the national marine fisheries service and the fish and wildlife service collectively,the service as required by a esa section or section.the object of cbd lawsuit is to require the epa to undertake consultation with the service regarding the impact of the reregistration process of pesticide active ingredients and pesticide products on endangered or threatened species.
we must decide three core issues.first,we must reconcile the disparate limitations periods and jurisdictional provisions of the esa and fifra for citizen suits that challenge the epa failure to consult with the service as required by esa section when reregistering pesticide active ingredients and pesticide products.second,we must determine whether plaintiffs alleged any affirmative agency actions by the epa that triggered the epa obligation to undertake section consultation with the service.and third,we must decide whether any of cbd claims are barred by the collateral attack doctrine.
on each of these core issues,the district court ruled in favor of the epa the court,however,granted cbd leave to amend to add facts that would demonstrate that the reregistration of pesticide products,although affirmative agency actions,were not simply impermissible collateral attacks on prior reregistration eligibility decisions red analyses or conclusions.cbd declined to amend.at cbd request,however,the district court entered a final judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b for the claims for relief.cbd timely appealed.
although we agree with many of the district court rulings in this complex environmental case,we conclude that the court erred in its application of the collateral attack doctrine and in requiring cbd to amend the operative complaint.we therefore affirm in substantial part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
cbd filed a citizen suit in district court alleging that the epa had failed to comply with the esa consultation requirement in its ongoing involvement with pesticides.ctr.for biological diversity epa,wl,at cal,see esa,a consultation requirement,g citizen suit provision.relying on the esa jurisdictional provisions regarding citizen suits,cbd asserted that the district court had jurisdiction over the alleged claims.ctr.for biological diversity,wl,at g the district courts shall have jurisdiction to enforce any esa provision or regulation,or to order the secretary to perform such act or duty,g a.although cbd framed the complaint as an enforcement action under the esa,its section claims effectively challenged the epa final pesticide product reregistration decisions under fifra.in the course of reregistering pesticide products,the epa issues a red for each pesticide active ingredient included in the pesticide product.
the epa and intervenors collectively,defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under the esa,lack of subject matter jurisdiction under fifra,and lack of article iii standing.ctr.for biological diversity,wl,at.in its complaint,cbd alleged that the epa retains ongoing discretionary control and involvement over all of these pesticides,which constitute agency action subject to consultation under section a of the esa.ctr.for biological diversity,supp,cal.emphasis omitted.dismissing the complaint with leave to amend,the district court faulted cbd for failing to allege any affirmative agency action by the epa,as required by karuk tribe of california forest service,cir.en banc,that would necessitate consultation with the service.ctr.for biological diversity,wl,at.the district court held that m ere discretionary control and involvement is not enough to trigger esa section consultation.id.at.the court also addressed subject matter jurisdiction,standing,and the statute of limitations,but reserved resolution of these issues until cbd filed an amended complaint.see id.at.the district court directed cbd to allege a specific affirmative act by the epa that would trigger section consultation for each of the alleged pesticide active ingredients or pesticide products.id.at.
subsequently,cbd filed a hefty amended complaint in response,defendants moved for a more definite statement under rule e,asserting that they could not properly respond to the amended complaint because cbd allegations were too vague and ambiguous.ruling on the motion,the district court agreed with defendants that cbd amended complaint was vague and ambiguous because it failed to specify which affirmative acts by the epa triggered esa section consultation.the court ordered cbd to clarify its allegations and explained that t he affirmative agency actions must be clearly identified so defendants may fairly evaluate whether to assert a facial challenge to standing,statute of limitations or jurisdiction and t he affirmative acts must also appear on the face of the complaint.
in response to the court order,cbd filed another weighty second amended complaint,in which it alleged the precise actions by the epa that required section consultation.defendants again moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.defendants identified four bases for dismissal.first,defendants argued that the statute of limitations barred any challenge to a red issued prior to january.second,they argued that fifra jurisdictional provisions,a b,controlled,depriving the district court of jurisdiction for any reregistration decision made after notice and comment.third,defendants argued that ongoing discretionary control and involvement over pesticides do not constitute affirmative action that triggers section consultation.fourth,defendants argued that cbd allegations challenging individual product reregistrations were nothing more than an improper collateral attack on the underlying reds,and therefore barred.as explained below,the district court granted in part and denied in part defendants motion to dismiss.ctr.for biological diversity,supp.at.
to guide our discussion of the district court ruling as well as facilitate our own analysis,we briefly explain how cbd framed the claims for relief in the second amended complaint.
each claim centers on one pesticide active ingredient for each pesticide active ingredient,cbd identif ies four categories of agency actions which allegedly trigger the epa duty to consult under s ection a.ctr.for biological diversity,supp.at.in our discussion below,we refer to each of these categories as a category one,two,three,or four for relief.the four categories are identical for all claims for relief.category one identify the epa issuance of the red or amended red as an agency action,and provide a date on which the epa issued the red or amended it.id.category two allege that the epa continued discretionary control and involvement in this pesticide active ingredient and pesticide product registration constitute agency action.id.internal quotation marks omitted.category three allege that the epa completion of pesticide product reregistration for a specific pesticide active ingredient is an agency action.id.internal quotation marks omitted.each such provides the date for when product reregistration was completed.and,finally,category four allege that the epa approvals of pesticide products containing a pesticide active ingredient constitute an agency action and provide dates for when the epa approved each pesticide product reregistration.id.internal quotation marks omitted.in ruling on defendants motion to dismiss,the district court analyzed the four categories of separately.the court began with category one the issuance of the red or amended red and dismissed all as either or jurisdictionally barred.ctr.for biological diversity,supp.at.the district court concluded that because the esa does not provide a limitations period for section challenges,it would apply the general statute of limitations for civil actions contained in a.id.at.applying that statute of limitations,the court determined that fifteen of the alleged reds were id.
next,the court turned to whether there was subject matter jurisdiction for the sixteen category one that remained.id.the court concluded that because cbd claims were inextricably intertwined with the epa pesticide actions governed under fifra,they were subject to fifra more specific jurisdictional provisions id.citation omitted see am.bird conservancy fed.commc ns comm n,cir.american bird.in applying fifra jurisdictional provision,a b,the court reasoned that the review of any registration actions that follow a notice and public comment period falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of appeals,and therefore ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the remaining sixteen claims for relief.ctr.for biological diversity,supp.at see united farm workers epa,cir.ufw see also in re pesticide action network,cir.applying ufw reasoning where petitioners sought to challenge the epa pesticide safety determinations.because all of the remaining category one involved reds that the epa issued after a period of notice and comment,the district court dismissed them for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.ctr.for biological diversity,supp.at.
the district court then addressed and rejected all of cbd category two continued discretionary control.id.at.the court ruled that t he retention of discretionary control is necessary but insufficient to trigger the epa consultation with the service.id.at.the court reasoned,largely in line with our en banc opinion in karuk tribe,that although affirmative actions can be ongoing,cbd must allege an affirmative agency action and maintaining discretionary control and involvement in a pesticide registration is not sufficient.id.at.
next,the district court discussed and rejected all category three the completion of pesticide product reregistration for a particular pesticide active ingredient.id.at.the court concluded that completion of pesticide product reregistration is not an affirmative act of any sort it is a fact.id.at.the court therefore dismissed all category three.id.at.
finally,the district court addressed cbd category four reregistration of pesticide products.id.at.analyzing the statute governing reregistrations of pesticide products,g c,the district court agreed with cbd that pesticide product reregistration is an affirmative agency action that triggers esa section consultation.id.at.however,the court also held that any category four that fell within the statute of limitations and attacked a red analyses or conclusions was an impermissible collateral attack on the red and therefore barred.id.at.the court granted cbd leave to amend to clarify what new actions by the epa,aside from analyses and conclusions contained in the red,demonstrated that pesticide product reregistrations constituted an agency action for purposes of section consultation.id.at.cbd declined to amend.
following entry of a final judgment on claims for relief one through pursuant to rule b,cbd timely appealed 
we begin with a brief description of the relevant aspects of both the esa and fifra.the esa seeks to protect and conserve endangered and threatened species and their habitats,and it reflects a conscious decision by congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies.valley auth.hill,see also ass of home builders defs.of wildlife,home builders.it achieves that purpose,in part,by requiring federal agencies to consult with the service to ensure their discretionary actions do not jeopardize endangered and threatened species,or adversely modify a listed species critical habitat.a see also babbitt sweet home chapter of cmtys.for a great,karuk tribe,at.the esa implementing regulations broadly construe agency action to include licensing and permitting programs,c,as well as actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land,water,or air.id.d.

as part of the approval process,the epa conducts an analysis that considers the economic,social and environmental costs and benefits of the use of any pesticide.headwaters,talent irrigation,cir.quoting save our ecosystems clark,cir.in conducting that analysis,the epa must consider what are known as paragraph requirements provided in c.that statute provides the following 
the epa shall register a pesticide if it determines that,when considered with any restrictions imposed under subsection d of this section 
a its composition is such as to warrant the proposed claims for it 
b its labeling and other material required to be submitted comply with the requirements of this subchapter 
c it will perform its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on the environment and 
d when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice it will not generally cause adverse effects on the environment.
c.if the epa determines that a pesticide product does not increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on the environment and satisfies the paragraph requirements the epa shall register that pesticide product.c b i i,c.
in,congress passed legislation directing the epa to reregister each registered pesticide product containing any active ingredient contained in any pesticide product first registered before november,and it detailed a reregistration process pub,stat,codified as amended at a.that legislation also required pesticide registrants to notify the epa of their intent to reregister their products,to identify missing and inadequate data for such pesticide products and to provide a proposed plan for filling any gaps in the data provided for reregistration review b,d.after the registrant signals its intent to reregister a pesticide product,the epa conducts science reviews,develops a risk assessment and publishes it for public comment,and issues a reregistration eligibility decision red evaluating the active ingredient in the pesticide product.epa,evaluation of the pesticide product reregistration process opportunities for efficiency and innovation,at evaluation the red summarizes the risk assessment conclusions and outlines any risk reduction measures for the pesticide active ingredient to continue to be registered in the ctr.for biological diversity,supp.at internal quotation marks omitted see also g a.after the epa publishes a red,it then must reregister each of the individual pesticide products that contain the active ingredient.this final step in the process is the pesticide product reregistration.evaluation at.
against that legal landscape,we turn to the claims for relief at issue in this appeal.we begin with the category one the issuance of reds.we assume,but do not hold,that the epa issuance of a red is an agency action that triggers esa section consultation.we need not decide whether the issuance of a red is a triggering action because we hold that all category one were properly dismissed by the district court as either or jurisdictionally barred.
we begin with a discussion of the epa statute of limitations defense.neither fifra nor the esa provides a limitations period when a section citizen suit filed in a district court challenges the epa decision to register or reregister a pesticide active ingredient or pesticide product.the issue of which limitations period to apply in those circumstances is a question of first impression in the ninth circuit.cbd argues that no limitations period applies to its claims because the epa has a continuing duty to comply with section,and its failure to initiate consultation constitutes a continuing violation that excuses any limitations period.we disagree.
we have held that when a statute does not specify a limitations period,federal courts must apply the general statute of limitations that most closely addresses the basis for the plaintiff claim.for example,united states dae rim fishery,cir,held that the limitations period for claims sounding in contract and was governed by the statute of limitations set forth in a.similarly,wind river mining corp united states,cir,held that the statute of limitations set forth in a provided the limitations period for actions brought pursuant to the administrative procedure act apa,see.see also cty.cmty,salazar,cir.applying wind river to apa claims regarding licensing and construction nw.envtl.advocates envtl.prot.agency,cir.
where,as here,a plaintiff alleges that an agency failed to comply with the esa procedural requirements,we apply the general statute of limitations set forth in a wind river,at as a general statute of limitation,section should apply to actions that challenge a final agency decision on the basis of procedural irregularity.this holding comports with our previous case law,which provides that when a plaintiff brings a substantive esa claim under the apa,we apply the statute of limitations set forth in the substantive statute.see,ctr.for biological diversity salazar,cir.holding that the statute of limitations applied to claims challenging the application of a regulation to a specific circumstance turtle island restoration network dep t of commerce,cir.applying the act shorter statute of limitations period to a claim challenging the terms and conditions of a fishery permit jones gordon,cir.holding that the limitations period applied to a claim that an agency failed to comply with the procedural requirements of an environmental statute.
thus,we affirm the district court dismissal of the category one alleged in the fourth,eighth,tenth,fourteenth,sixteenth,seventeenth,eighteenth,nineteenth,thirtieth,and claims for relief.the district court properly dismissed those category one because the reds alleged in those claims had all been issued prior to january,over six years prior to the filing of cbd original complaint.in addition,we dismiss one of the first claim for relief as barred by the statute of limitations 
with respect to one of the claim for relief,however,we remand to the district court to resolve a factual dispute.the district court dismissed this as based on the red issuance date of september.ctr.for biological diversity,supp.at.however,the second amended complaint alleged an amendment to that red in june of.it is unclear from the record before the district court whether the amendment was sufficiently substantive to be an independent triggering action.the government acknowledged that the amendment added two minor labeling requirements,and we therefore remand one of the claim for relief for the district court to determine whether those additions to the red in constitute an affirmative agency action triggering section consultation.
next,we must decide whether there was subject matter jurisdiction for the district court to properly hear the sixteen remaining category one.
both the esa and fifra contain citizen suit provisions,but those provisions offer conflicting requirements for whether a case should be filed in the district court or in the court of appeals.the esa allows any person,including entities,to 
commence a civil suit on his own behalf to enjoin any person,including the united states and any other governmental instrumentality or agency to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment to the constitution,who is alleged to be in violation of any provision of this chapter or regulation issued under the authority thereof 
g.the esa citizen suit provision also states,the district courts shall have jurisdiction,without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties,to enforce any such provision or regulation,or to order the secretary to perform such act or duty g.
similarly,fifra allows private individuals and entities to seek judicial review of the epa registration and reregistration decisions,but it bifurcates which claims may be brought before the district court and which claims must be presented to the court of appeals.when a plaintiff seeks review of the refusal of the administrator to cancel or suspend a registration or to change a classification not following a hearing and other final actions of the administrator not committed to the discretion of the administrator by law,the suit must be filed in the district court.a.if the claim challenges the validity of any order issued by the administrator following a public hearing,then a petition for review must be filed in the united states court of appeals for the circuit wherein the petitioner resides or has a place of business,within days after the entry of such order id.b see also ufw,at holding that publication of notice and comment in the federal register constitutes a public hearing for the purposes of determining fifra jurisdiction.review of agency actions taken after a public hearing is committed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of appeals.b.
we have held that when two jurisdictional statutes draw different routes of appeal,the rule is to apply only the more specific legislation.am.bird,at citing cal.save our streams council,yeutter,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.in american bird,plaintiffs filed suit in the district court,arguing that the federal communications commission fcc had failed to engage in section consultation when it issued licenses for seven communications towers.at.the federal communications act and the esa provided separate judicial review provisions,and the communications act provisions vested federal courts of appeals with exclusive jurisdiction over actions to enjoin,set aside,annul,or suspend any order of the fcc.id.at citing a internal quotation marks omitted.
american bird explained that although the plaintiffs sought procedural relief,the heart of their claims challenged the fcc actions under the communications act.id.at.the court opined that plaintiffs claims,although nominally based in the esa,challenged the fcc grant of cell tower licenses.at american bird attempts to bypass congress system of review by characterizing its suit as a challenge to the agency compliance with federal environmental laws rather than to the agency ultimate order.american bird reasoned that when a section claim challenges an agency order issued pursuant to a substantive statute with a more specific judicial review scheme than the esa,courts must evaluate the plaintiff claims under the jurisdictional provisions of that substantive statute.id.at citing cal.save our streams council,at.although american bird resolved jurisdictional conflicts between the esa and the communications act,its reasoning applies to the disparate jurisdictional provisions at issue here.
when a plaintiff claims are inextricably intertwined between two statutes such as the esa and fifra and those statutes contain conflicting jurisdictional provisions,american bird requires plaintiffs to comply with the more specific statute.id.at.as the district court noted,when section consultation follows public notice and comment,that consultation informs the validity of the epa determination whether to reregister a pesticide.here,cbd section category one inherently challenge the validity of the epa final registration and reregistration orders.
thus,we hold that for the purposes of fifra,a section claim raised after the epa undertakes public notice and comment must comply with fifra jurisdictional provisions.a plaintiff bringing a section claim challenging the validity of the administrator fifra order after a period of notice and comment in the federal register must file a petition for review in the court of appeals within days of the entry of the contested final order 
on the basis of the district court record,we conclude that fifteen of the sixteen remaining category one were properly dismissed by the district court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in the second,third,fifth,sixth,seventh,ninth,eleventh,twelfth,thirteenth,fifteenth,twentieth,and claims for relief the issuance of the subject reds were all preceded by a public comment and notice period published in the federal register.further,one in the claim for relief is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction therefore,cbd should have filed a petition in the court of appeals to obtain judicial review of those.
in sum,we affirm the district court dismissal of all category one contained in claims for relief one through.
we turn to the category two,which allege that the continued discretionary control and involvement in a pesticide active ingredient and pesticide product registration constitute ongoing agency action.ctr.for biological diversity,supp.at internal quotation marks omitted.we disagree and therefore affirm the district court dismissal of all category two.
cbd argues that because the epa has an ongoing duty to comply with the esa,its failure to undertake section consultation serves as an ongoing violation of the esa.cbd reasons that the epa ongoing violation provides an adequate basis for a section claim,and consequently,a plaintiff should not be required to identify a separate and affirmative discretionary action for a section claim to accrue.as the district court noted,cbd construction is at odds with controlling precedent,which provides that an esa claim accrues only when an agency takes discretionary,affirmative action.karuk tribe,at inaction is not action for section a purposes.citing watersheds project matejko,cir.in karuk tribe,we held that our agency action inquiry is.first,we ask whether a federal agency affirmatively authorized,funded,or carried out the underlying activity.second,we determine whether the agency had some discretion to influence or change the activity for the benefit of a protected species.id.at.
cbd conflates an ongoing duty with an ongoing violation.an agency that retains regulatory authority over a program has a continuing obligation to comply with the esa.cottonwood envtl.law,at citing.toxics,at.in washington toxics coalition,we held that the epa was not excused from complying with the esa when it registered pesticides without section consultation.at because the epa has continuing authority over pesticide regulation,it has a continuing obligation to follow the requirements of the esa.see also forest guardians johanns,cir.explaining agencies ongoing duty to reinitiate esa consultation.similarly,in cottonwood environmental law center,we held that the forest service violated the esa when it failed to reinitiate consultation after the fish and wildlife service designated critical habitat on square miles of national forest land.at.
although the epa has an ongoing duty to comply with the esa,under karuk tribe,section consultation still must be triggered by an affirmative agency action.id.in other words,t he retention of discretionary control is necessary but insufficient to trigger an agency duty to initiate consultation.ctr.for biological diversity,supp.at.moreover,as the district court noted,although affirmative agency actions can be ongoing,the retention of discretionary control over previously issued pesticide licenses is not such an ongoing action.ctr.for biological diversity,supp.at citing karuk tribe,at see also.valley auth.hill.karuk tribe squarely controls this case because category two fail to identify an affirmative agency action that would trigger a section consultation,we affirm the district court dismissal of all category two alleged in claims for relief one through.see karuk tribe,at.
next,we turn to the category three that allege that the epa completion of all pesticide product reregistrations for a particular pesticide active ingredient is an affirmative agency action that triggers section consultation.ctr.for biological diversity,supp.at.we agree with the district court that the completion of pesticide product reregistration is simply a fact,and therefore it can not trigger section consultation.id.at.the date on which all reregistrations of pesticide products that contain a particular pesticide active ingredient have been completed,is simply that,a date.as the district court explained,cbd may not base their claims on the epa completion of product reregistration as opposed to the actual registration actions.id.at.as a result,we affirm the dismissal of all category three alleged in claims for relief one through.
this brings us to the final category four,in which cbd contends that the epa approval of individual pesticide products is an affirmative agency action triggering esa section consultation.id.at.these category four are complicated by the fact that defendants contend that cbd timely reregistration claims of pesticide products are nothing more than collateral attacks on the underlying reds that were already dismissed,and are therefore impermissible.as detailed below,we agree with the district court that pesticide product reregistration is an affirmative agency action,but we disagree that those claims are barred by the collateral attack doctrine and require further amendments to the second amended complaint.
as discussed supra at part and footnote,the epa uses a reregistration process,which includes a reregistration of pesticide products.b,g.at an earlier stage in the reregistration process,the epa publishes a red.g a see also evaluation at.after the epa issues the red,it collects both data and confirmatory data on the active ingredient as identified in the red.id.at see also g b i before reregistering a pesticide,the epa shall obtain any needed data regarding the pesticide.in order to ultimately reregister a pesticide product,the epa must weigh all of the data and determine whether each pesticide product comports with the paragraph requirements contained in section c.g c.
the process of gathering data after a red has issued can be lengthy sometimes more than ten years will have elapsed between the issuance of a red and the completion of reregistration of all pesticide products containing the red pesticide active ingredient.according to the evaluation,w ith regard to a red,on average,it took about months to reregister all products covered by a red and t he average maximum time needed for reregistering all products covered by a red was about months.id.at.importantly,as the statute and the epa own process demonstrate,it is clear that publication of a red for a pesticide active ingredient is not the agency final decision on reregistration of a pesticide product.id.at vi.a red does not contain all the research upon which the epa relies when reaching its final pesticide product reregistration decision.id.at.as such,the reregistration of an individual pesticide product is its own triggering action.
we note,consistent with our holding in section,that any claim based on a product reregistration that occurred before january,would be,and any claim involving a product reregistration after public notice and comment in the federal register would be jurisdictionally barred.the parties do not suggest that any of the category four for relief are barred by the statute of limitations or are jurisdictionally barred.nonetheless,we leave it to the district court to address any such issues the parties might raise on remand.
the collateral attack doctrine prevents litigants from relitigat ing the merits of previous administrative proceedings or evading established administrative procedures by raising a claim that is inescapably intertwined with a review of the procedures and merits surrounding an underlying agency order.americopters,llc faa,cir.internal quotation marks and citations omitted,alteration in original see also united states backlund,cir.applying the collateral attack doctrine to apa claims.at its core,the doctrine prohibits a plaintiff from using a later order that implements a prior agency action as a vehicle to undo the underlying action or order.americopters,at.
as noted,defendants argue,and the district court agreed,that the category four alleging the reregistration of pesticide products as independent triggering actions are simply collateral attacks on the issuance of the reds,which are or jurisdictionally barred.ctr.for biological diversity,supp.at.we disagree.
the collateral attack doctrine is not at issue here cbd does not seek to unravel a prior agency order,nor does it attempt to challenge any of the analyses or conclusions contained in the red s.id.at.cbd contends that the final reregistration of a pesticide product triggers the esa section consultation obligation because the epa does not rubber stamp the pesticide product reregistration in light of the red.the district court agreed,detailing the differences between the epa process for issuing a red and the separate process for approving a pesticide product.id.at.as a result,the district court declined to hold that as a matter of law,an attack on a product reregistration is a collateral attack on the red.id.at.we agree as discussed supra,see section,under the governing statute,g,a product reregistration incorporates data not available during the process for issuing a red,and necessarily involves a determination distinct from those made during the red process because a pesticide active ingredient and a pesticide product are not the same.
neither the district court nor the dissent disputes this distinction.diss.at.nonetheless,the district court and the dissent would require cbd to allege facts specific to each pesticide product demonstrating how each product reregistration raises new esa compliance issues.ctr.for biological diversity,supp.at diss.at.such specificity is unwarranted at this stage of the proceedings.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,internal quotation marks omitted.here,cbd has pled a facially valid claim under the esa because it has demonstrated that,as a matter of fact,the issuance of a red is an interim step in the process of reregistering the pesticide products and therefore the reregistering of a pesticide product involves multiple other steps,thus triggering its own consultation requirement.ctr.for biological diversity,supp.at.
cbd is not required to allege facts beyond what it already has alleged in its second amended complaint.cbd notified the epa of its intent to file suit,andthe second amended complaint alleges facts sufficient to support the proposition that pesticide product reregistrations are affirmative agency actions,distinct from the issuance of reds,that trigger a section consultation obligation neither the esa nor fifra requires more.they certainly do not require cbd to remind the epa to engage in esa consultation at every phase of the pesticide active ingredient and pesticide product reregistration process,nor do those statutes require cbd to contest a red to preserve claims challenging final pesticide product reregistration decisions.
consequently,in the context of this case,the collateral attack doctrine is inapposite.accordingly,we reverse the district court dismissal of all category four alleged in claims for relief one through.
we affirm the district court order in substantial part all category one,two,and three alleged in claims for relief one through were properly dismissed.we reverse the dismissal of all category four alleged in claims for relief one through in which the reregistration took place after january,and in which there was no public notice and comment in the federal register.we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded.
although i agree with most of the majority opinion,i respectfully dissent from the conclusion reached in part that the category four in the second amended complaint sac,which challenge the approval of pesticide products by the environmental protection agency epa,were not a collateral attack on the epa prior approval of the pesticides in those products.the majority focuses on the distinct processes the epa uses to approve pesticides and to approve pesticide products.however,the category four,as pleaded,are an impermissible collateral attack because those challenge the epa approval of products simply because those products contain the pesticides the sac alleges were improperly approved previously.
whenever the epa considers taking an agency action,the endangered species act esa section requires the epa to consult with the national marine fisheries service and the fish and wildlife service collectively,the service if that action may affect a listed endangered species or its habitat.see karuk tribe of california forest service,cir.citing a and a.in the sac,the center for biological diversity and the pesticide action network north america collectively,cbd,challenge the epa reregistration eligibility determinations reds for many different pesticides,alleging that the epa failed to consult with the service before issuing the reds.according to cbd,approving the pesticides through the reds may affect various listed endangered species or their habitats.
cbd structured the sac around each challenged pesticide.each claim for relief has four.the category one is the challenge to the red.the category two and category three challenge the epa continued discretionary control and involvement in the pesticide registration and the epa completion of product reregistration for the pesticide in question.i agree with the majority that the district court properly dismissed most of the category one as time barred or jurisdictionally barred and that the category two and three were properly dismissed because they did not challenge affirmative agency actions.
the final part of each claim for relief,the category four,challenges the epa approval of products containing the particular pesticide in question.as one of the category four states t he following specific epa actions on dichloropropene are subject to this complaint and require epa to consult under section a of the esa,a epa approvals of products containing this pesticide,which are listed with dates in the table at paragraph.notably,paragraph references all products in the epa online pesticide product label system that contain.thus,the category four challenge the epa approval of all products that contain a particular pesticide.
the sac refers to these pesticide product approvals as one of four actions involving a particular pesticide.the sac states that because all of the four actions may affect the listed species in exhibit a and their designated critical habitat,epa is required to initiate consultation with the service.unsurprisingly,exhibit a lists endangered species that may be affected by a particular pesticide,not endangered species that may be affected by particular pesticide products.thus,the sac does not differentiate between the four challenged actions.according to the sac,all of those actions may affect endangered species or their habitats because all of those actions involve a particular pesticide that may affect endangered species or their habitats.therefore,the sac does not specifically allege that the epa approval of particular pesticide products may affect endangered species or their habitats for any reason other than the fact that those products contain pesticides approved in the reds.
i agree with the majority opinion that the epa approval of pesticide products is an affirmative agency action because that decision involves gathering and considering data.however,the majority incorrectly reverses the district court dismissal of these by concluding that t he collateral attack doctrine is simply not at issue here because the epa processes for approving pesticides and then later approving pesticide products are distinct.however,these category four were a collateral attack on the reds based on how these were actually pleaded in the sac.therefore,i would affirm the district court dismissal.
the collateral attack doctrine prevents district courts from hearing claims that are inescapably intertwined with a review of the procedures and merits of an underlying agency order.americopters,llc,cir.this doctrine prevents litigants from relitigating the merits of previous administrative procedures or evading those procedures.id.
the category four challenge the epa approval of all products that contain specific pesticides approved in the reds based on the theory that those very pesticides may affect endangered species or their habitats.had the cbd alleged anything specific why the products qua products may affect endangered species,then the category four would not be a collateral attack on the reds.but since cbd challenge to the product approvals is based entirely on cbd allegation that the pesticides approved in the reds may affect endangered species or their habitats,the category four are an impermissible collateral attack on the reds.
the district court carefully analyzed whether these as pleaded were an improper collateral attack on the reds.ctr.for biological diversity epa,supp,cal.the district court noted,what is clear is what can not be challenged analyses and conclusions made in the red.what is being challenged here is less clear.id.at.the district court noted that the sac does not identity any facts that demonstrate the product reregistrations raised any new issues regarding the epa compliance with section of the esa that could not have been raised in a timely challenge to the epa issuance of a red.id.at.to cure this problem,the district court gave cbd leave to amend the sac,id.at,which cbd declined to do.
although cbd states in its opening brief that p roduct formulations often contain more than one active ingredient that together cause synergistic harm,the sac does not allege that particular pesticide products contain specific combinations of ingredients that cause harm to listed endangered species or their habitats.there are no allegations that the approved pesticides cause harm when they interact with other specific ingredients in particular products thus,the category four as pleaded challenge the epa approval of pesticide products simply because the pesticides in those products may affect endangered species.cbd is not entitled to a second opportunity to challenge the epa approval of the pesticides just because the epa later approves products that contain those pesticides.
the majority misses the mark by focusing on the fact that the reregistration of a pesticide product and the issuance of a red are distinct processes.as the majority states,t he epa does not rubber stamp the pesticide product reregistration in light of the red.although this observation is true because a pesticide product reregistration decision involves the consideration of data not involved in the red and is a distinct determination,t he relevant inquiry is not what the statute directs,but what the plaintiff challenges.grand canyon trust bureau of reclamation,cir.as the epa states in its brief,the epa does not dispute that a challenge to a product registration could raise new issues that would not be foreclosed by the collateral attack doctrine.here,however,the center failure to initiate claims do not raise any such issues.for example,cbd does not allege that the pesticide product reregistrations raised new esa compliance issues that could not have been raised in a challenge to the reds.cbd category four are inescapably intertwined with cbd challenge to the reds because those challenge the epa approval of pesticide products on the ground that those products contain the pesticide at issue in each claim for relief.
the district court realized that allowing cbd to challenge every product approval simply because those products contain a particular pesticide wou
