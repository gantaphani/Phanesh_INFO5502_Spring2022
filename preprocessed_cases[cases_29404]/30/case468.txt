the commonwealth of kentucky,acting through the secretary of the kentucky natural resources and environmental protection cabinet cabinet,appeals from the district court ruling that federal law preempts permit conditions imposed by the cabinet relating to the disposal of radioactive waste in a landfill operated by the united states department of energy doe.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the paducah gaseous diffusion plant the plant is an active uranium enrichment facility owned by the doe,located in mccracken county,kentucky.the cabinet regulates disposal of solid waste at the plant through the issuance of permits.in,doe submitted a permit application to the cabinet for the construction and operation of a contained solid waste landfill at the plant.in february,the cabinet issued a permit to doe authorizing the construction of the landfill.
after verifying that doe had completed construction in accordance with the approved plans,the cabinet issued another permit to doe on november,authorizing operation of the landfill.this operating permit contained conditions relating to the disposal of radioactive materials in the landfill.specifically,condition prohibited doe from placing in the landfill s olid waste that exhibits radioactivity above de minimis levels.condition prohibited doe from placing in the landfill solid waste that contains radionuclides until a waste characterization plan for radionuclides has been submitted to the division of waste management for review and approval.
doe appealed the imposition of these permit conditions through kentucky administrative process.on january,a state hearing officer issued a report recommending that the secretary affirm the cabinet imposition of the challenged permit conditions.doe filed objections and the cabinet responded.on february,the secretary entered a final order affirming and adopting the hearing officer report and recommendation.the secretary accordingly dismissed doe administrative appeal.
doe then filed a petition for judicial review of the cabinet final action in kentucky state court on march.under kentucky law,doe was required to file its petition for state court review of the cabinet action within thirty days of the cabinet final order.see.doe alleges that it filed its state court action to preserve its rights under state law.
on april,ten days after filing its state court action,doe filed the instant action in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.in its complaint,doe challenged the permit conditions at issue on the grounds that the atomic energy act of,preempts state regulations relating to the disposal of radioactive materials the conditions violate the federal government sovereign immunity from state regulation and the commonwealth failed to comply with its own statutes and regulations in imposing the conditions.on april,the cabinet filed a motion to dismiss doe complaint,arguing that the district court should decline jurisdiction over doe action based upon the discretion accorded it under the declaratory judgment act,and under the burford abstention doctrine,see burford sun oil.doe preemption and sovereign immunity claims fail to state a claim for which relief can be granted and the challenged permit conditions comport with kentucky law.
the district court denied the cabinet motion to dismiss on november.the court found that it was not required to decline jurisdiction over the case inasmuch as doe had presented a facially conclusive claim of federal preemption,the resolution of which did not require the court to interpret state law or make factual findings.the court further found that federal law preempts the cabinet attempt to regulate doe disposal of radioactive waste in the landfill.the court accordingly entered judgment for doe and dismissed the case.
on appeal,the cabinet argues that the district court erred in concluding that the challenged permit conditions are preempted by federal law and the district court should have abstained from hearing this case based upon the discretion accorded it under the declaratory judgment act and the burford abstention doctrine.
ii.discussion 
statutory and regulatory overview 
congress enacted the atomic energy act aea in to promote the development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes under a program of federal regulation and licensing.see pac.gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm n,d.congress has subsequently amended the aea to create a dual regulatory structure,whereby the federal government regulates the radiological safety aspects involved in the construction and operation of a nuclear plant,and the states retain their traditional responsibility in the field of regulating electrical utilities for determining questions of need,reliability,costs,and other related state concerns.id.at.
the aea regulates three different classes of radioactive material source material,special nuclear material,and byproduct material.see e,z,aa.source material includes uranium,thorium,and other materials that doe deems necessary for the production of special nuclear material.z.special nuclear material includes plutonium,enriched uranium,and other material capable of releasing substantial quantities of atomic energy.aa.byproduct material includes any radioactive material except special nuclear material yielded in or made radioactive by exposure to the radiation incident to the process of producing or utilizing special nuclear material,and the tailings or wastes produced by the extraction or concentration of uranium or thorium from any ore processed primarily for its source material content.e.
the aea grants doe and the nuclear regulatory commission exclusive responsibility for regulating source,special nuclear,and byproduct material.see b,i.pursuant to this authority,doe has developed and implemented an extensive regulatory regime for managing radioactive materials and limiting the release of radioactivity.see,general environmental protection program,doe order radiation protection of the public and the environment,doe order radioactive waste management,doe order establishing requirements for managing radioactive waste,including waste characterization,waste treatment,disposal,and environmental monitoring.these regulatory standards are designed to assure that the public,workers,and the environment are not exposed to unsafe levels of radiation.see doe order.
in,congress passed the resource conservation and recovery act rcra,which amended the solid waste disposal act of.congress enacted the rcra to end the environmental and public health risks associated with the mismanagement of hazardous waste.see sierra club united states dep t of energy.generally,the rcra prohibits the treatment,storage,or disposal of hazardous waste at private or governmental facilities without a permit issued by either the united states environmental protection agency epa or an authorized state.see a.the rcra expressly contemplates that state and local governments will play a lead role in solid waste regulation.see a.
under the rcra,hazardous waste is defined as solid waste,or a combination of solid wastes,that,for enumerated reasons,creates public health and environmental dangers.solid waste,however,does not include source,special nuclear,or byproduct material as defined by the atomic energy act of.indeed,the rcra expressly provides 
nothing in this chapter shall be construed to apply to or to authorize any state,interstate,or local authority to regulate any activity or substance which is subject to the atomic energy act of except to the extent that such application or regulation is not inconsistent with the requirements of such act.
preemption 
under the constitution supremacy clause,const.art vi,congress may preempt state law so long as it acts within its constitutionally delimited powers.see maryland,wheat.it is of the very essence of supremacy,to remove all obstacles to its action within its own sphere,and so to modify every power vested in subordinate governments,as to exempt its own operations from their own influence.the supreme court has established a general framework by which preemption questions are analyzed 
s tate law can be preempted in either of two general ways.if congress evidences an intent to occupy a given field,any state law falling within that field is preempted.if congress has not entirely displaced state regulation over the matter in question,state law is still preempted to the extent it actually conflicts with federal law,that is,when it is impossible to comply with both state and federal law,or where the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of congress.
silkwood,d.whether a federal statute preempts state or local law is a question of federal law,see musson theatrical,fed.express,cir,which we review de novo,see gte mobilnet johnson,cir.
the district court noted that while the rcra governs the disposal of hazardous waste,and the aea governs the disposal of radioactive waste,no statute specifically delegates authority to regulate a mixture of the two types of waste accordingly,the district court turned to the relevant federal agencies construction of the aea and rcra for interpretative guidance.see chevron,natural res.defense council,d requiring courts to give considerable weight to executive department construction of a statutory scheme it administers and deference to its administrative interpretations.the court found that,according to doe and epa rulings pertaining to mixtures of radioactive and hazardous waste,the aea governs the radioactive portion of the waste mixture and the rcra governs the hazardous portion.see epa notice state authorization to regulate hazardous components of radioactive wastes under the resource conservation and recovery act,fed.reg.july,doe final rule radioactive waste byproduct material,fed.reg.may,epa clarification notice clarification of interim status qualification requirements for the hazardous components of radioactive mixed waste,fed.reg.under this dual regulatory scheme,doe has exclusive authority to regulate the radioactive component of waste mixtures,whereas states authorized by epa under the the authority to regulate the hazardous portion.see in re westinghouse materials of ohio,no,wl,applying dual regulatory scheme to disposal of waste mixtures.based on the agencies interpretation of the aea and the rcra,the district court concluded that the cabinet attempt to impose conditions on doe disposal of radioactive materials in the landfill was preempted by federal law.
on appeal,the cabinet objects to the district court conclusion on several grounds.the cabinet first asserts that the challenged permit conditions are not preempted by the aea because the cabinet has the statutory authority under kentucky law to regulate solid waste disposal.thus,the cabinet contends that the challenged permit conditions do not constitute regulation of radioactive materials,but rather merely address the fact that doe solid waste may be contaminated with radionuclides.the cabinet further argues that the district court failed to support its conclusion with specific factual findings as to how the permit conditions conflict with the requirements of the aea.because the aea does not expressly address the disposal of solid waste contaminated with radionuclides,the cabinet argues,it was error to conclude that the aea preempts the permit conditions without finding actual conflicts between the state and federal requirements.
the cabinet arguments are not.as the supreme court unequivocally stated in pacific gas electric,the federal government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns,except the limited powers expressly ceded to the states.at.accordingly,the aea preempts any state attempt to regulate materials covered by the act for safety purposes.see id.here,the challenged permit conditions specifically limit the amount of radioactivity and radionuclides that doe may place in its landfill.the sources of such radioactivity and radionuclides are materials covered by the aea,source,special nuclear,and byproduct materials.the cabinet seeks to impose these conditions to protect human health and the environment.the permit conditions therefore represent an attempt by the cabinet to regulate materials covered by the aea based on the cabinet safety and health concerns,and are thus preempted.
the fact that the cabinet is authorized,under state law,to regulate solid waste disposal is irrelevant to our preemption analysis.thus,the cabinet reference to its state law authority to ensure that only solid waste is placed in the landfill misses the point the disposal limits imposed by the challenged conditions constitute regulation of materials covered by the aea.they are therefore preempted.similarly,the cabinet assertion that it has the right under state law to prohibit any radioactive materials from being placed in the landfill is incorrect.the supreme court rejected a similar argument in pacific gas electric 
respondents argue that although safety regulation of nuclear plants by states is forbidden,a state may completely prohibit new construction until its safety concerns are satisfied by the federal government.we reject this line of reasoning.state safety regulation is not preempted only when it conflicts with federal law.rather,the federal government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns 
while federal law does not preempt state regulation of solid waste,see city of philadelphia new jersey,d,states may not regulate the radioactive component of solid waste.as the district court correctly concluded,doe has exclusive authority to regulate the radioactive component of waste mixtures,whereas states authorized by epa under the the authority to regulate the portion.see in re westinghouse materials of ohio,wl,at applying dual regulatory scheme to disposal of waste mixtures.because the challenged permit conditions regulate materials covered by the aea,they are therefore preempted.
the cabinet relies on the tenth circuit decision in united states new mexico,cir,to rebut this conclusion.in new mexico,the united states challenged permit conditions imposed by the state addressing the presence of radionuclides in the incineration of hazardous waste at a doe facility.id.at.the case presented the question of whether the permit conditions were within the scope of the rcra waiver of federal sovereign immunity.id.at.the court held that conditions imposed by the state on doe hazardous waste incinerator were requirements under state law,and thus were applicable to the doe facility under the rcra.id.at.the court expressly noted,however,that doe did not raise the issue of whether the conditions were preempted by the aea as state regulation of radioactive materials rather,doe relied solely on its argument that the conditions were not requirements under the rcra waiver provision.id.at.thus,new mexico did not address the same issue presented in this case,whether state regulation of the radioactive component of solid waste is preempted by the aea.the cabinet reliance on new mexico in support of its preemption argument is misplaced.
the cabinet argument that the district court erred in failing to identify specific conflicts between the challenged conditions and federal law also must fail.as noted previously,the supreme court has stated that the aea preempts the field of state regulation of radioactive materials.pac.gas,at.when the federal government completely occupies a given field or an identifiable portion of it,as it has done here,the test of preemption is whether the matter on which the state asserts the right to act is in any way regulated by the federal government.id.at.quoting rice santa fe elevator.under such test,doe need not identify specific conflicts between the cabinet permit conditions and federal law in order to establish preemption.the district court failure to make specific factual findings regarding the conflict between the federal and state requirements was therefore not in error.
federal sovereign immunity 
doe also argues that the cabinet challenged permit conditions are invalid because the united states has not waived its federal sovereign immunity to state regulation of radioactive materials at
