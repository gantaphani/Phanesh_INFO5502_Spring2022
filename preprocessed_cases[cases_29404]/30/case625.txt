background 
factual history 
this case involves the vertac chemical plant site,a acre tract of land in jacksonville,arkansas the jacksonville site or the site,that was originally developed by the federal government in the as a munitions factory.in the late the site was sold to a company called corporation,which at first manufactured various pesticides but in began to make herbicides including dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and trichlorophenoxyacetic acid,synthetic hormones that kill weeds or brush by accelerating growth to the point of natural death.although these herbicides rapidly biodegrade into harmless substances,the manufacture of but not of creates a byproduct,dioxin,that is now viewed as hazardous to humans.while operated the site,an unknown quantity of these and other untreated chemical wastes from the production process flowed through cooling ponds on the west side of the plant into a nearby stream.other wastes were stored in numerous drums stacked in a field on the site.
hercules bought the site from in and continued to manufacture herbicides,including and,at the plant until.during this period hercules sold the bulk of its product to the united states department of defense as the defoliant agent orange,a herbicide used in vietnam to clear jungle undergrowth soon after hercules took over the site it buried the deteriorating drums of chemical waste left by in unlined trenches on the site.hercules did not learn of the toxicity of dioxin until march of,when a scientific study found that it could cause chloracne,a particularly persistent and disfiguring form of acne that typically affects the face,neck,and shoulders.dioxin was subsequently linked to cancer.
later in,hercules instituted a toluene extraction process designed to remove organic impurities from products.this process yielded residue stillbottoms containing extremely high levels of dioxin.hercules placed this residue in drums,some of which it buried at the site and some of which it disposed of at two nearby landfills.although hercules has acknowledged numerous leaks and spills during its operation of the site,the record indicates that hercules generally improved the safety and cleanliness of the site and complied with environmental regulations between and.
in,hercules ceased production at the site and leased the facility to transvaal,which later became vertac chemical vertac.when hercules ceased operations at the cite,it cleaned out all of its equipment and production vessels,buried its waste,and shipped empty drums.
initially,vertac continued the production of and and followed hercules practice of burying most of the waste.in,however,vertac began shipping its waste to landfills and began to store its stillbottoms above ground at the site with the hope that the waste might someday be recycled.in,hercules sold the site to vertac,which continued its operations until and abandoned the site altogether when it went into receivership in.by then there were nearly drums at the site that contained waste materials including,and dioxin.many of these drums had corroded and leaked,contaminating more soil,groundwater,and buildings at the site.contamination was also found in other areas of the site,at the landfills,in nearby neighborhoods,and in grounds adjacent to the site.
uniroyal was a customer of vertac and purchased and other products from vertac during the.in,vertac informed uniroyal that it lacked the funds to purchase enough tcb,a key ingredient in the manufacture of,to fulfill its regular contractual obligations to uniroyal.uniroyal consequently agreed to supply vertac with enough tcb to create some million pounds of that was to be shipped back to uniroyal.vertac did not purchase the tcb from uniroyal,but rather reduced the amount it ultimately charged uniroyal for the to reflect the value of the tcb that uniroyal had supplied.this arrangement a toll conversion agreement was embodied in two separate contracts and was carried out between march and march.the that was produced with uniroyal tcb represents less than one percent of the more than million pounds of and that were manufactured at the site over the course of its operation.
vertac was the last operator of the jacksonville site.after it abandoned the plant,the united states environmental protection agency epa took over the site,closed down all operations,and assumed cleanup responsibilities that have cost well over million to date.
procedural history 
the environmental cleanup undertaken at the site has resulted in extensive litigation over the past years in,the epa sued vertac and hercules under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra,et,the clean water act,et,and the refuse act,seeking to enjoin the continuing discharge of hazardous waste at the site.the arkansas department of pollution control and ecology arkansas sought similar relief under state law.after consolidating the cases,the district court granted a preliminary injunction ordering vertac to stop the chemical leakage from various disposal areas but denied relief against hercules,which was not in possession or control of the site at the time.united states vertac chemical,vertac i.several years later,the court approved consent decrees representing a negotiated remedial plan to address the containment and monitoring of waste.united states vertac chemical,vertac ii.the lawsuit was later converted into a cercla action.
although vertac stipulated that it was an owner and operator of the site liable to the government for response costs under cercla,it ultimately failed to comply with the consent decrees and eventually sold its assets to third parties,forcing the court in to appoint a receiver to handle the company affairs.united states vertac chemical,vertac iii,vacated,cir table united states vertac chemical.vertac iv,aff,cir.in an effort to identify all those potentially liable for environmental harm at the site,numerous additional parties,including the united states department of defense,were brought into the suit these parties filed various,counterclaims,and third party complaints many of the parties settled and entered into consent decrees 
beginning in,the district court issued a number of decisions that are the subject of the instant appeal.on october,it entered an order of partial summary judgment in favor of the united states.dist.order at,vertac v.the court found hercules jointly and severally liable under cercla for the release of hazardous substances at the jacksonville site,landfills,neighborhoods,and areas,and rejected hercules argument that the harm at the site was divisible.the court reiterated these conclusions on november,and again on may,when it denied motions for reconsideration brought by hercules.
the remaining claims in the case went to trial on november,before an advisory jury.the jury rejected hercules claim for response costs and contribution against standard chlorine of delaware,a party not involved in this appeal.uniroyal was found liable to the united states,arkansas,and hercules for remediation of wastes at the site and areas.the jury also found that the harm caused by uniroyal was divisible.thereafter,the district court filed an opinion in which it endorsed all of the jury findings except its conclusion regarding divisibility.united states vertac chemical,vertac viii.
the united states subsequently moved for summary judgment on the issue of cost recoverability,which the district court granted on october.the court rejected several arguments raised jointly by hercules and uniroyal in an attempt to establish that the epa response decisions were arbitrary and capricious.it declined to consider their takings and due process claims,which it characterized as illegitimate attempts to relitigate liability.united states vertac chemical,d,vertac ix.accordingly,on august,the court entered judgments of joint and several liability against hercules in the amount of plus interest and costs,and against uniroyal in the amount of plus interest and costs.
finally,on december,the district court addressed the issue of allocation of costs between hercules and uniroyal for the more than million for which they were both jointly and severally liable acknowledging that uniroyal and hercules are left holding the bag for vertac,who at least arguably caused the greatest amount of harm,dist.order at,vertac chemical,d,vertac x,the court determined that hercules share of the response costs should be percent and uniroyal share should be percent.id.at.a judgment reflecting these conclusions was entered on february.
on appeal,hercules challenges the entry of partial summary judgment and the court subsequent denials of its motions to reconsider.uniroyal challenges the district court adoption of the advisory jury liability verdict but not its rejection of the divisibility verdict.hercules and uniroyal together appeal the recoverability order.only hercules appeals the allocation decision.these appeals have been consolidated.
background 
cercla authorizes the federal government to respond to any threatened or actual release of any hazardous substance that may pose an imminent and substantial public health threat.cleanup decisions are guided by the national contingency plan ncp,which prescribes methods for investigating health and environmental problems resulting from a release or threatened release and establishes criteria for determining the appropriate extent of response activities.part in re bell petroleum,cir.although response activities are initially funded by the superfund,a fund financed through a combination of appropriations,epa fees,and industry taxes,b,cercla provides for the subsequent recovery of response costs from all parties responsible for the release of a hazardous substance.
to establish that a party is liable,cercla section a requires the government to prove that there has been a release or threat of release of a hazardous substance at a facility,as a result of which the united states incurred response costs that were necessary and consistent with the ncp,and that the defendant falls within one of four listed categories of responsible parties.a control data,cir.the categories are current owners or operators of a site at which a release or threatened release occurred owners or operators of such a site at the time of disposal of hazardous material generators who arranged for disposal at such a site and transporters of hazardous waste to such a site.id.cercla liability attaches n otwithstanding any other provision or rule of law,and subject only to three narrowly defined defenses a b.liability is strict and is typically joint and several.united states northeastern pharmaceutical chem,cir nepacco.where multiple defendants are involved,the initial liability finding is followed by a contribution proceeding to allocate damages among responsible parties.control data,at.
divisibility of harm 
one aspect of cercla that has long vexed courts is the role of causation in the statutory scheme.id.at describing the causation element as a problematic portion of the cercla calculus.this is because,a lthough the simplistic slogan make the polluter pay may have helped propel cercla into law,the statutory scheme does not take a simplistic view of who is and who is not a polluter.westfarm.partnership washington suburban sanitary comm n,cir citation omitted.indeed,at least at the liability stage,the language of the statute does not require the government to prove as part of its prima facie case that the defendant caused any harm to the environment.control data,at.rather,once the requisite connection between the defendant and a hazardous waste site has been established because the defendant fits into one of the four categories of responsible parties,it is enough that response costs resulted from a release or threatened necessarily the defendant release or threatened release a.thus,the government need not trace or fingerprint a defendant wastes in order to recover under cercla.united states monsanto,cir.considerations of causation explicitly enter into the statutory liability scheme only as part of the three statutory defenses not at issue in this case.id.at b.
many courts,however,have recognized the defense of divisibility of harm,a special exception to the absence of causation requirement that in effect brings causation principles back into the the backdoor,after being denied entry at the front door.united states alcan alum,cir alcan ii see united states township of brighton,cir bell,at alcan i,at picillo,cir monsanto,at.although we have not been squarely presented with the question whether a divisibility defense should be allowed under cercla,we have expressed our approval of the doctrine on several occasions.control data,at once liability is proved,all of the defendants are jointly and severally liable,unless a particular defendant can establish that his harm is divisible,a very difficult proposition.interstate power kansas city power light,cir remanding for liability findings and suggesting that the district court might find divisible harms united states dico,cir remanding for trial on liability because district court failed to distinguish between two geographically separate areas within single hazardous waste site.
the parties in this case do not dispute the general validity of the divisibility doctrine,and we find it to be both compatible with the text and the overall statutory scheme of cercla and a sensible way to avoid imposing on parties excessive liability for harm that is not fairly attributable to them.see alcan i,at.we thus proceed to a more detailed discussion of the doctrine.
the universal starting point for divisibility of harm analyses in cercla cases is the restatement second of torts,which provides for the apportionment of damages among two or more parties when at least one is able to show either distinct harms or a reasonable basis for determining the contribution of each cause to a single harm.restatement second of torts see township of brighton,at bell,at.at.we will follow the restatement,however,only to the extent that it is compatible with the provisions of cercla.see,at describing the restatement as one source for us to consult.thus,for example,although the restatement contemplates that plaintiffs bear the burden of proving causation,in a cercla case,once the government has established the four essential elements of liability the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate,by a preponderance of the evidence,that there exists a reasonable basis for divisibility.township of brighton,at,at.divisibility generally limits the scope of,but does not entirely eliminate,cercla liability since the doctrine is essentially a defense only to joint and several liability.control data,at bell,at.
we have previously observed that proving divisibility is a very difficult proposition,control data,at,and the restatement recognizes that some harms,by their nature,are normally incapable of any logical,reasonable,or practical division.restatement second of torts cmt.to subsection,quoted in bell,at.where this is the case,the restatement cautions against making an arbitrary apportionment for its own sake.see also united states colorado eastern,cir noting that the courts have been reluctant to apportion costs and that responsible parties rarely escape joint and several liability,at defendants hoping to escape joint and several liability must satisfy the stringent burden placed on them by congress.when a defendant is successful in demonstrating a reasonable basis for apportionment,approaches to divisibility will vary tremendously depending on the facts and circumstances of each case.evidence of divisibility will focus on determining the amount of harm caused by the defendant.bell,at.our description below of some of the most common approaches is by no means intended to be exhaustive,for we know that we can not define for all time what is a reasonable basis for divisibility and what is not.township of brighton,at.
distinct harms are those that may properly be regarded as separate injuries.see restatement second of torts bell,at.defendants may be able to demonstrate that harms are distinct based on geographical considerations,such as where a site consists of areas of soil contamination,akzo coatings,aigner,clarified on,or separate and distinct subterranean plumes of groundwater contamination,united states broderick investment.
other cases,by contrast,involve a single harm that is nonetheless divisible because it is possible to discern the degree to which different parties contributed to the damage.id.the basis for division in such situations is that it is clear that each defendant has caused a separate amount of harm,limited in time,and that neither has any responsibility for the harm caused by the other,such as where two defendants,independently operating the same plant,pollute a stream over successive periods of time.bell,at.single harms may also be treated as divisible in terms of degree,based,for example,on the relative quantities of waste discharged into the stream.id.at.divisibility of this type may be provable even where wastes have become and commingled,for commingling is not synonymous with indivisible harm.alcan ii,at see also bell,at.
evidence supporting divisibility must be concrete and specific.see united states alcan alum,alcan iii rejecting divisibility argument on remand because defendant took all or nothing approach,presenting no new evidence beyond what court of appeals had already considered,aff,cir table.the preliminary issue of whether the harm to the environment is capable of apportionment among two or more causes is a question of law.bell,at.then,o nce it has been determined that the harm is capable of being apportioned among the various causes of it,the actual apportionment of damages is a question of fact.id.at.
we also observe that the divisibility doctrine is conceptually distinct from contribution or allocation of damages.see redwing,at.at the allocation phase,the only question is the extent to which a defendant liability may be offset by the liability of another the inquiry at this stage is an equitable one and courts generally take into account the gore factors.see f providing that a court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate township of brighton,at control data,at.the divisibility of harm inquiry,by contrast,is guided not by,not by the gore by principles of causation alone.united states rohm haas,cir.thus,where causation is unclear,divisibility is not an opportunity for courts to split the difference in an attempt to achieve equity township of brighton,at.rather,i f they are in doubt,district courts should not settle on a compromise amount that they think best approximates the relative responsibility of the parties.id.in such circumstances,courts lacking a reasonable basis for dividing causation should avoid apportionment altogether by imposing joint and several liability.id.
iii.analysis 
hercules challenges the district court imposition of joint and several liability,raising various divisibility arguments that are specific to certain areas of the site,areas,neighborhoods,and landfills.in some of these arguments hercules urges us to reverse outright the entry of summary judgment against it and instruct the district court to deduct from the final judgment all response costs pertinent to the area at issue in others it asks us to hold simply that there is a reasonable basis for divisibility and remand to the district court to apportion the harm.we review the district court october,summary judgment decision vertac v de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.dico,at.we will affirm only if we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the united states is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.united states findett,cir.
we believe that the district court analysis of hercules divisibility arguments reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the doctrine of divisibility.these legal errors clouded the court view of the evidence supporting divisibility.for example,when the district court discussed divisibility in vertac v,it did so in summary fashion,stating merely that hercules has not set forth any facts establishing that the harm is clearly divisible,or that hercules waste did not,or could not,contribute to the release and the resulting response costs at the site.vertac v,dist.order at.the proper standard for determining divisibility,however,is that the defendant show either distinct harms or a reasonable basis for apportioning causation for a single harm.restatement second of torts.a defendant need not prove that its waste did not,or could not,contribute to any of the harm at a cercla site in order to establish divisibility,because it is also possible to prove divisibility of single harms based on volumetric,chronological,or other types of evidence.bell,at.a site may also be divisible if a defendant can establish that it consists of areas of contamination.akzo.at broderick.at.
accordingly,we reverse the summary judgment against hercules on the issue of liability vertac v and remand so that the district court can address the evidence supporting divisibility in light of the proper legal standards.in so holding,we reject the epa suggestion that evidence adduced subsequent to summary,evidence presented against uniroyal at the liability trial and evidence from the allocation demonstrates that hercules can not prevail on any of its divisibility arguments.by the same token,we deny hercules request that we reverse the district court decision outright and hold that certain harms were divisible,for we conclude that the question of divisibility is one to be determined in the first instance by the district court.
uniroyal challenges the district court conclusion that it fits within one of cercla four categories of responsible,that it is liable as an arranger under a.uniroyal does not contest the other three relevant statutory elements of cercla liability.we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.consolidated electrical mechanicals,biggs general contracting,cir.
in vertac viii,the district court noted that we have given a liberal interpretation to arranger liability.vertac viii.at.the court made this observation in light of our decision in united states aceto agricultural chemicals,cir,in which we declined to dismiss a cercla complaint alleging that a number of pesticide manufacturers were liable for supplying to a formulator materials used to create a final product where the suppliers retained an ownership interest in the materials throughout the formulation process as well as in the finished product,the generation of wastes was inherent in the formulation process,and wastes were in fact generated and disposed.id.at.in vertac viii.at,the district court found that uniroyal toll conversion agreement to supply tcb to vertac for formulation into closely tracked the legal standards set forth in aceto,and on appeal the epa argues that this case is nearly identical to aceto.we agree.
uniroyal first contends that the district court erred as a matter of law by focusing its analysis on ownership,and not on the authority to control the production and disposal process.uniroyal argues that in aceto,a case that considered no actual facts but only the prima facie validity of a complaint,ownership was deemed significant only insofar as it gave rise to a permissible inference of authority to control.here,by contrast,uniroyal suggests that the district court erroneously elevated mere ownership to the level of a sufficient basis for finding arranger liability.we conclude that this argument fails.
although we stated in aceto that it may be reasonably inferred that defendants had the authority to control the way in which the pesticides were formulated,id.at,this observation came as part of our discussion of rcra and was not necessary to our prior conclu
