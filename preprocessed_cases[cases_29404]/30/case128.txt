plaintiff appellant olin corporation olin appeals from a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant appellee american home assurance company american home in the united states district court for the southern district of new york griesa.olin brought this action against its insurers,including american home,regarding environmental contamination at olin sites in the united states.this appeal arises from proceedings related to olin morgan hill,california,manufacturing site.at issue is whether the million attachment point for american home excess policies for the years and could be reached by the alleged property damage at morgan hill.
for the reasons that follow,we vacate and remand.
background 
this case began in when olin brought a diversity action against its insurers seeking indemnification for environmental damage at olin manufacturing sites throughout the united states because each site raised its own factual and legal issues,the district court has addressed coverage on a basis.this appeal arises out of the most recent of these proceedings,concerning contamination at olin manufacturing site at morgan hill,california,between and.in the course of this proceeding,the district court granted summary judgment to american home,which issued two excess policies during this period,on the ground that the attachment point for these excess policies could not be met.that ruling is the basis of the present appeal.
olin morgan hill site 
olin began manufacturing signal flares at morgan hill,california,in olin used the chemical potassium perchlorate perchlorate in the manufacturing process.as part of this process,perchlorate was combined with other chemicals by various means including the use of cement mixers.this produced a large volume of perchlorate dust,which was dispersed throughout the site by wind and foot traffic.perchlorate powder on the ground was then dissolved by rainfall and carried via into dry wells at the site,where it seeped into the ground,contaminating the water table below the site.changes in olin manufacturing process in the decreased the volume of perchlorate spilled,but regular spillage appears to have continued in some quantity until at least.
throughout this period,the concentration of perchlorate in the water table below the site increased,generating an underground plume of perchlorate that gradually spread down the valley.this underground plume reached equilibrium in,meaning that the contamination of additional soil or groundwater ceased.by then,the plume extended approximately ten miles from the site.olin estimated that it would incur costs of more than million to fully remedy the damage caused by the underground perchlorate plume 
ii.the american home policies 
olin had an insurance program consisting of general commercial liability insurance and layered excess policies.two excess policies provided by american home are at issue here policy number and policy number the first of these covers the period of january,to january.the second covers the period of january,to january.each policy covers ten percent of up to million in damages in excess of million for the policy period thus american home has no coverage obligation unless the damages attributable to one of the policies exceed this million attachment point each policy also follows form to excess policies,which means that it adopts their terms and conditions.
the american home policy follows form to a policy issued by underwriters at lloyd lloyd.according to the terms of the lloyd policy,american home is obligated 
to indemnify the assured for all sums which the assured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the assured by law for damages,direct or consequential and expenses on account of property damage caused by or arising out of each occurrence happening anywhere in the world.
the lloyd policy defines property damage as loss of or direct damage to or destruction of tangible property other than property owned by the named assured.the policy defines occurrence as an accident or a happening or event or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which unexpectedly and unintentionally result in personal injury,property damage or advertising liability during the policy period and further specifies that a ll such exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from one premises location shall be deemed one occurrence.
the lloyd policy also contains a condition c prior insurance and non cumulation of liability.this provision,the principal subject of this appeal,states the following 
it is agreed that if any loss covered hereunder is also covered in whole or in part under any other excess policy issued to the assured prior to the inception date hereof,the limit of liability hereon shall be reduced by any amounts due to the assured on account of such loss under such prior insurance.
subject to the foregoing paragraph and to all the other terms and conditions of this policy,in the event that personal injury or property damage arising out of an occurrence covered hereunder is continuing at the time of termination of this policy,underwriters will continue to protect the assured for liability in respect of such personal injury or property damage without payment of additional premium.
the american home policy follows form to a policy issued by the home insurance company,which in turn mostly follows form to a policy issued by lloyd.that lloyd policy appears to be identical to the policy underlying the american home policy in nearly all relevant respects,employing the same definitions of occurrence and property damage and including an identical condition c.the difference between the two american home policies is that the home insurance company policy underlying the american home policy specifies that it only provides coverage for accidents or occurrences taking place during the period of the policy.no such language applies to the american home policy 
iii.proceedings related to the morgan hill site 
on june,olin filed a third amended complaint seeking indemnity related to the morgan hill site.olin sought coverage from american home under its policies.american home moved for summary judgment,arguing that the million attachment point was not reached for either policy.american home relied on our decision in olin insurance of north america,cir olin i,discussed further below,which provides for pro rata allocation of damage in cases of progressive environmental injury.under this approach,the total million in damages from the cleanup of the morgan hill site should be equally divided among the years in which property damage occurred.and under our decision in olin certain underwriters at lloyd london,cir olin ii,also discussed further below,property damage occurred from the time when contamination began until the time when the underground plume of perchlorate reached its maximum extent.assuming that contamination began in and the plume reached equilibrium in,property damage occurred in years.pursuant to olin i and olin ii,the total damage of million should be divided by,yielding a damage figure of million.since each american home policy had a coverage period of three years,the total property damage attributable to each policy from the perchlorate spill amounted to only million.thus neither policy attachment point of million could be reached.
olin did not dispute this basic analysis but argued that american home had ignored the effect of condition c on the policies.in olin view,the second paragraph of condition c requires american home to indemnify olin not only for damage occurring during the policy periods but also for any damage in subsequent years.this is because property damage arising from a covered occurrence was continuing at the time of termination of each policy,and thus american home liability for the policy includes all damage from to,and its liability for the policy includes all damage from to.using the pro rata approach of olin i,million in damage should be assigned to the policy,and million should be assigned to the policy.since these amounts far exceed the million attachment point,each policy would be reached.
the district court rendered an oral decision regarding the effect of condition c,and based on this decision it later granted american home motion for summary judgment on olin claims.we interpret the district court decision as turning on the definition of occurrence.in the district court view,condition c covers only damage resulting from an occurrence that takes place within the policy period.the district court appears to have concluded that the actual spilling of perchlorate on the ground was the occurrence here,with each spill of the chemical being a separate occurrence.on this basis,condition c would only implicate american home policy if the perchlorate spilled between and caused more than million of the million total damage,with the same being true for the policy regarding spills from to.the district court thus granted american home motion because olin had failed to raise a triable issue of material fact regarding whether the spills of perchlorate from to or to were sufficient to cause million in damage.on september,the district court entered final judgment under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure in favor of american home.olin proceeded to trial against the remaining insurers implicated in the morgan hill site and settled with the other excess insurers prior to a verdict olin timely appealed the district court dismissal of its claims against american home.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.kaytor boat,cir.summary judgment may be granted only where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.in making this determination,a court should draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.reeves sanderson plumbing,d.
i.this court prior olin decisions 
two of our decisions involving other olin sites are central to the issues of this case.olin i,involved the allocation of damages related to an olin fertilizer plant in williamston,north carolina.olin produced pesticides at that site from to.id.at.nearly two decades later,substantial contamination of the soil and groundwater of the site was discovered,requiring olin to incur more than million in cleanup costs.id.at.at trial,the jury found injury to property at the williamston site from through,raising the issue of how the total damages should be allocated under new york law to the various insurance policies in effect during this year period.olin argued for the joint and several approach,in which olin could select a particular year during the period of damage,collect damages up to the policy limits from the policies in effect that year,and the selected insurers could then seek contribution from other policies in effect during other years of the loss period.id.at.the insurers argued that liability should be allocated among the policies according to some objective factor.id.finding the language of the policies inconclusive on this question,we turned to public policy and equitable considerations and found these to clearly indicate allocation as the correct methodology.id.at.because the evidence in the case provided no basis on which to allocate liability for damages to any particular year or period,we affirmed the district court decision to allocate damages equally to each year in which the jury found damage had occurred.id.at.the new york court of appeals subsequently confirmed our prediction of new york law on this point,holding that in the absence of contractual language to the contrary,courts should use the pro rata approach to allocating liability for damages in cases of progressive environmental injury under these circumstances.consol.edison of allstate ins.
our second decision is olin ii.that case involved four olin sites near niagara falls,new york.id.at.as in the present case,chemical spills at these sites contaminated the soil,and subsequent groundwater flows spread this contamination.the contamination was not discovered for decades.when it was discovered,olin incurred substantial cleanup costs,which it sought to recover from some of the very same policies involved here we began by reaffirming our holding in olin i that in cases when continuous property damage takes place over a number of policy periods,the liability for that injury is allocated over the time during which property damage occurred.id.at.we also clarified that equally allocating damage pro rata is a default rule if the evidence allows for more specific assignment of liability to particular years,then responsibility should be determined in that way.id.at.the primary issue of olin ii,however,concerned the definition of property damage.given that olin i requires damage to be allocated equally among all years in which property damage occurred,the question of olin ii was whether property damage occurred only in those years in which active pollution took place that is,the placing of pollutants at a source where they will leach into the environment or whether property damage also occurred in those years when groundwater spread already spilled pollutants into new areas.id.at.because the insurance contracts did not adequately define property damage,we held that new york courts would likely conclude that property damage occurs as long as contamination continues to increase or spread,whether or not the contamination is based on active pollution or the passive migration of contamination into the soil and groundwater.id.at.
the effect of these two decisions on the instant case is clear.under olin i,in the absence of contractual provisions to the contrary or evidence indicating that ascertainable amounts of damage occurred in certain years,the million in property damage in this case should be allocated equally to each year in which the property damage occurred.and under olin ii,property damage occurred from the time when perchlorate contamination first began until the time when this contamination reached its maximum extent through the spread of the underground plume in the water table here,the parties assumed for the purposes of summary judgment that contamination began in and that the plume reached equilibrium in.thus under olin ii,property damage occurred in those years.dividing the total damage of million by the years in which damage occurred,million in damage should be allocated to each year between to this,however,does not resolve the principal issue of this appeal.olin i and olin ii were based,in part,on the specific language of the insurance contracts at issue there.olin contends that condition c in the two policies here obligates american home to indemnify it not only for the damage occurring within the three years of each policy,but also for damage that continued after the policies had terminated until the plume reached equilibrium in.
ii.law of the case,estoppel,and waiver 
before considering the effect of condition c,we first must decide whether olin is permitted to raise it as a basis for indemnification.american home argues that the law of the case doctrine prevents olin from making its condition c argument because we previously decided how liability for damage for progressive environmental injury should be allocated across multiple policies in olin i and olin ii,and condition c was present in some of those policies at oral argument,however,counsel for american home conceded that the interpretation of condition c was never raised or decided in those cases before either this court or the district court.as such,the law of the case doctrine is no bar to considering olin condition c arguments.see stichting ter behartiging van de belangen van oudaandeelhouders in het kapitaal van saybolt int l schreiber,cir.
amicus argues that olin is collaterally estopped from raising condition c,but this argument is also unavailing.collateral estoppel only prevents relitigation in a subsequent action of an issue of law or fact actually litigated and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction in a prior action.ali mukasey,cir internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.because the meaning of condition c was not actually litigated and decided in our previous opinions,collateral estoppel does not apply.
the estoppel claim raised by american home and onebeacon could also be framed as a waiver issue.however,the district court expressly found that olin had not waived its argument regarding condition c by failing to raise it earlier,because the effect of condition c was not an issue in earlier proceedings involving other olin sites.a district court determination that a party has not waived an argument by raising it earlier is reviewed for abuse of discretion.saybolt int l,at.neither american home nor onebeacon has shown that the district court abused its discretion in finding no waiver.see id.at.for these reasons,we see no merit to the contention that we are unable to consider the proper interpretation of condition c,and we now turn to that question.
iii.relevant principles of new york contract interpretation 
under new york law insurance policies are interpreted according to general rules of contract interpretation,world trade ctr,hartford fire ins,cir,abrogated on other grounds,wachovia bank schmidt,d.two of these rules are particularly relevant here.first,the words and phrases in a contract should be given their plain meaning,and the contract should be construed so as to give full meaning and effect to all of its provisions.lasalle bank ass nomura asset capital,cir internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.any interpretation of a contract that has the effect of rendering at least one clause superfluous or meaningless is not preferred and will be avoided if possible.id.citation omitted.second,contract terms are ambiguous if they are 
capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs,practices,usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.

iv.condition c 
condition c,the full text of which is quoted above,appears in both of the relevant american home policies through their following form with the underlying lloyd policies it consists of two paragraphs.we will refer to the first paragraph of condition c as the prior insurance provision and the second as the continuing coverage provision.it is the application of this second provision that is the primary issue here.it provides 
subject to the prior insurance provision and to all the other terms and conditions of this policy,in the event that personal injury or property damage arising out of an occurrence covered hereunder is continuing at the time of termination of this policy,underwriters will continue to protect the assured for liability in respect of such personal injury or property damage without payment of additional premium.
by virtue of its plain language,we see three requirements for the application of the continuing coverage provision.first,there must be personal injury or property damage.second,this personal injury or property damage must aris e out of an occurrence covered by the policy.and third,this personal injury or property damage must be continuing at the time of termination of the policy.when these three conditions are met,the plain language of the provision requires the insurer to indemnify the insured for personal injury or property damage continuing after the termination of the policy.we conclude that all three of these conditions are met.
first,property damage occurred during both the and the coverage periods.this conclusion follows from olin ii,which held that the spread of earlier contamination met the definition of property damage in the same policies at issue here.the parties have assumed for the purpose of summary judgment that the perchlorate plume began in and reached equilibrium in.no evidence was presented suggesting that the plume did not expand between and.thus we presume that the plume was spreading during this period,causing property damage.the parties agree on this point.
second,this property damage arose out of an occurrence covered by both the and the policies.the policies define an occurrence as an accident or a happening or event or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which unexpectedly and unintentionally result in personal injury,property damage or advertising liability during the policy period and specifies that a ll such exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from one premises location shall be deemed one occurrence emphasis added olin argues that based on this language,the continuous absorption of perchlorate into the soil and groundwater from to is a single,occurrence.that absorption was a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions that resulted in property damage.and because both the absorption itself and the property damage caused by it took place during the policy period of both the and policies,it is a covered occurrence for the purposes of each policy this accords with the plain language of the policy.it also is the correct application of new york law.appalachian ins,ramirez allstate ins,dep t.
american home agrees that the perchlorate contamination at morgan hill qualifies as a single,occurrence for purposes of determining applicability limits of liability and retentions.however,american home argues that a single,occurrence spanning the policy period does not satisfy condition c.we see no basis in the language of the policy for concluding that occurrence in condition c has a different meaning than occurrence elsewhere in the policies.indeed,the policies rule out such an interpretation by expressly stating that occurrence shall have the meaning provided by the policy wherever used herein.thus,if,as american home concedes,thirty years of constant perchlorate exposure on the same site that through the same process caused property damage by the slow expansion of the plume satisfies the definition of occurrence for the purposes of applying other provisions of the policy,it suffices for condition c.the second requirement of condition c is therefore met because the property damage discussed above arose out of an occurrence covered by the policy.
the third requirement of condition c is also met here the property damage occurring during the policy period was clearly continuing at the time of termination of each policy.for the purposes of summary judgment,the parties assumed that the property damage namely,the spread of the perchlorate plume began in and continued until.no evidence was presented that this damage was not continuing in when the first policy expired or that it did not continue until.the same is true for the policy.
american home and amicus onebeacon argue,however,that the damage was new damage rather than continuing damage.under this view,any additional damage occurring after the policy period is new and thus damage continuing at the time of termination of the policy means only prior damage that has not been fully remedied when the policy terminates.however,this interpretation deprives condition c of any effect,since even without condition c american home would be obligated to indemnify olin for damage occurring during the policy period that had not yet been remedied.see lasalle bank,at stating that contracts should be construed so as to give full meaning and effect to all their provisions internal quotation marks omitted.we conclude instead that damage continuing at the time of termination of the policy clearly contemplates property damage from the migration of chemicals in the expanding groundwater plume during the term of the policy and continuing after the policy terminated.this is consistent with olin ii,which characterizes such damage as both additional and continuing.see olin ii,at.
because the three requirements of condition c are met,that provision applies here.american home thereby could be obligated to indemnify olin up to the limits of its policies for all property damage caused by the perchlorate plume that occurred during and after the termination of each policy.since there is not yet any basis for attributing greater or lesser damage to individual years,we follow the district court in allocating million of damage to each year between and.the policy is thus exposed to years of damage,a total of million.the policy is exposed to nineteen years of damage,a total of million.because each of these figures exceeds the million attachment point,summary judgment was inappropriate.
american home main argument against applying the plain language of the continuing coverage provision of condition c is that this result would be contrary to the pro rata allocation rule applied in olin i and olin ii.however,those decisions simply provide that when insurance contracts do not adequately define how progressive environmental damage is to be apportioned across multiple triggered policies,and the evidence can not make that distinction,new york law requires damage to be allocated pro rata.new york law does not preclude parties from contracting to indemnify the insured for damage allocated to years after the termination of the policy.this is precisely what american home policies do here with condition american home has agreed to indemnify olin not only for damage taking place during the policy period but also continuing after the termination of the policy.the provision thus simply adds additional years of exposure,using the same pro rata allocation method for determining the amount of damage attributed to each year.
some state courts in other jurisdictions interpreting policies containing condition c have concluded that the language of those policies is inconsistent with the pro rata approach and have imposed joint and several liability among triggered policies in cases involving liability.see,hercules,aiu ins,chi.bridge iron certain underwriters at lloyd,london,dow corning cont l cas,wl,at,per curiam unpublished opinion.american home argues that these decisions support its view that the interpretation of condition c we adopt here is inconsistent with our pro rata decisions in olin i and olin ii.we agree with american home that new york state court decisions and those prior decisions of this court endorsing the pro rata approach foreclose us from interpreting condition c as imposing joint and several liability.however,the decisions from other jurisdictions endorsing joint and several liability did not principally rely on condition c to reach that outcome.instead,those decisions relied on language in the policies providing coverage for all sums which the assured shall be obligated to pay.see,hercules,at.this same all sums language appears in the american home policies,but both this court in olin i and the new york court of appeals in consolidated edison have expressly rejected the conclusion that such language requires joint and several allocation of damages and instead have endorsed the pro rata allocation method for policies with that language.see olin i,at consol.edison,at.thus the only difference in language between the american home policies here and the provisions of the policies considered by the olin i and consolidated edison courts is condition that is not enough to impose joint and several liability and reject pro rata allocation,given that the continuing coverage provision of condition c applies only to damages continuing after the termination of the policy and is silent regarding damages occurring before the policy period.thus condition c alone can not trigger joint and several liability lin lieu of the pro rata allocation methodology employed in olin i and consolidated edison.
our prior holdings regarding pro rata allocation and those of the new york state courts call for us to endorse the pro rata allocation method and allocate million in damage to each year from to.but the plain language of the continuing coverage provision of condition c extends liability temporally by providing that the insurer will cover damage allocated pro rata to years after the termination of the policy if that damage is continuing at the time of the policy termination and arises from an occurrence covered by the policy.thus the continuing coverage provision of the policy applies to all damage allocated to the years until the time when property damage ceases here.the same is true of the policy for the period of.we believe that this interpretation best harmonizes the plain language of condition c with the holdings of our court involving similar policies we also believe this honors the intent of the parties,because declining to enforce the continuing coverage provision of condition c while allocating damages pro rata may excuse excess insurers from providing coverage paid for by their insureds.allocating damages over a lengthy period typically results in attachment points for certain excess policies not being reached.giving effect to the plain language of condition c thus allows insureds to look to excess policies for some indemnification when those policies include condition 
american home argues that this interpretation of condition c would produce a result inconsistent with the other terms of the policies.specifically,the policy with the application of condition c covers property damage from the perchlorate plume for the period of to.this would be anomalous,it is argued,because perchlorate continued to be spilled at the site into the mid.thus under the policy,olin could potentially recover for property damage occurring in that was contributed to by chemicals spilled in,making american home liable for the release of chemicals that occurred long after the policy had terminated.however,this result follows not from our interpretation of whether the damage is continuing but rather from the fact that the american home policies define the constant,exposure of the soil and groundwater to perchlorate dust as one,occurrence,as well as from the holding of olin ii that the spread of the perchlorate plume is property damage.
we now turn to the final issue how the prior insurance provision of condition c applies to the two american home policies.american home contends that this provision prevents it from having any responsibility under either policy,because the damage caused by the perchlorate spill is covered in whole or in part by olin other policies,namely policies that provided coverage before the dates of the american home policies.olin has already recovered from some of these policies,but at levels below the american home policies attachment point.olin argues that american home misreads the prior insurance provision,which applies only to policies that are provided by the same insurer at the same level of coverage.since olin had no coverage at the million level provided by american home before the american home policy,these conditions are not met.but olin concedes that the prior insurance provision of condition c does apply to the american home policy,because the policy meets these two conditions.olin therefore argues that the most it can recover from the two policies is million,since olin recovery from the policy is reduced by the amount it recovers from t
