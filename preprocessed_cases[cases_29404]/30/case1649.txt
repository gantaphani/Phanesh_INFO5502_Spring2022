the orange county water district the district appeals a judgment in favor of mag aerospace industries,mag following a bench trial on the district claims under the hazardous substances account act hsaa health saf.code,et and the orange county water district act ocwd act west ann.wat.code app.ed.ch.and for declaratory relief code civ,and summary adjudication of the district common law claims for negligence,nuisance,and trespass.the district contends the trial court erred during the bench trial by granting mag motion for judgment under code of civil procedure section on the district hsaa claim the trial court erred under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b by scheduling a bench trial on the district equitable claims before a jury trial on the district legal claims,thereby depriving the district of its right to trial by jury the trial court erred by granting declaratory relief in favor of mag in the absence of a request by mag and the trial court erred by applying evidence code section to discount the conclusions of the district expert witness.the district does not challenge the judgment on its claim under the ocwd act.
for reasons we will explain,we affirm.although the trial court may have used an incorrect causation standard under the hsaa,any such error was harmless in light of the trial court factual findings,which the district does not challenge and which foreclose the district claim under the correct causation standard.the trial court also did not abuse its discretion under code of civil procedure section by adhering to california longstanding equity first rule and holding a bench trial on the district equitable claims before scheduling a jury trial on the district legal claims.the district remaining contentions are similarly unavailing because the district has not established any prejudicial error in the court declaratory judgment or its application of evidence code section.
factual and procedural background 
the district is a public entity established by the california legislature and empowered to manage,replenish,regulate,and protect groundwater supplies within its boundaries.ocwd act.the district has the power to t ransport,reclaim,purify,treat,inject,extract,or otherwise manage and control water for the beneficial use of persons or property within the district and protect the quality of groundwater supplies within the district,subd.j.in furtherance of these goals,the district may commence,maintain,intervene in,defend,and compromise any and all actions and proceedings to prevent diminution of the quantity or pollution or contamination of the water supply of the district,subd.
in,the district filed this lawsuit against mag and several other defendants to address current and threatened groundwater contamination in northern orange county.in its operative first amended complaint fac,the district alleged that mag owned and operated an industrial site at east valencia drive in fullerton,california the valencia site.the district alleged that mag and other owners and operators at the valencia site released hazardous wastes there,including the volatile organic compound pce tetrachloroethylene or perchloroethylene.the release of hazardous waste had caused or threatened to cause contamination to groundwater within the district geographic area.the district alleged injury in the form of investigation and remediation costs to address this contamination and threatened contamination,as well as the ongoing threat to public health,natural resources,and the environment posed by the hazardous waste releases.to recover its costs and address this threat,the district alleged causes of action against all defendants,including mag,under the ocwd act and the hsaa and under common law theories of negligence,nuisance,and trespass.the district also alleged a cause of action for declaratory relief,which claimed a n actual controversy exists concerning who is responsible for abating actual or threatened pollution or contamination of groundwater within the district by volatile organic compounds and sought adjudication of the respective rights and obligations of the parties.the district sought compensatory and punitive damages,attorney fees,costs,an order finding defendants liable for the full cost of remediation,an order declaring the contamination a nuisance and compelling defendants to abate it,and any other proper relief.
during a status conference,the court announced its intention to bifurcate trial on the district claims,with an initial bench trial on the district equitable claims under the ocwd act and the hsaa and for declaratory relief and a subsequent jury trial on the district legal claims for negligence,nuisance,and trespass.the district urged the court to try its legal claims first in front of a jury and expressed concern that holding a bench trial first would impair its right to a jury trial on its legal claims.the court acknowledged the district right to a jury trial but confirmed its inclination to hold a bench trial first.
the bench trial began in february.the district presented testimony from various percipient and expert witnesses.after the district,mag moved for judgment under code of civil procedure section.the district opposed.following a hearing,the court tentatively granted mag motion but allowed the district to reopen its case.code civ,subd.a.the district presented additional testimony,after which mag renewed its motion.the court granted the motion,finding in mag favor on the district claims under the ocwd act and the hsaa and for declaratory relief 
in its statement of decision,the court recited the procedural history of the district lawsuit,made factual findings based on the evidence presented a trial,and issued conclusions of law.the court found that the valencia site had been used for industrial purposes since.some of these uses involved pce,and testing in confirmed pce contamination in the soil at the site.
mag leased the valencia site from through.for six of these years,mag used pce there as well in an,concrete facility.mag engaged a service to dispose of spent chemicals.prior to the end of mag lease,the owner of the valencia site engaged a consultant to conduct another round of environmental testing.this testing again found pce in the soil,but,as the trial court explained,the sampling confirmed that concentrations of pce decreased as the samplings went deeper,to the point that the contaminant could no longer be detected.the lowest detected depth of pce contamination was feet below grade,and samplings at,and feet below grade revealed the absence of pce.
the testing showed that the groundwater under the valencia site began approximately feet below grade.it also showed,in the words of the trial court,that there was no direct pathway of pce from the soil surface to the groundwater and that a continuous stiff layer of nonpermeable silts and clays at about to feet below ground surface further impacted any such potential pathway.
the testing consultant installed five groundwater monitoring wells at the valencia site.one well,located near the site of a degreaser where mag used pce,detected pce in the groundwater below the valencia site.other wells detected another volatile organic compound in the groundwater,trichloroethylene tce.neither mag nor its predecessor used tce at the valencia site.
based on these results,the regional water quality control board for the santa ana region rwqcb requested further testing after mag left the site.this testing confirmed that the concentrations of pce in the soil at the valencia site were largely stable.the testing consultant concluded there was no need for remediation at the valencia site.it also concluded that offsite facilities located at higher elevations than the valencia site released various volatile organic compounds,including pce,and that these releases reached groundwater and contributed to the reported contamination and pollution beneath the valencia site.
the rwqcb issued a closure report concluding that the valencia site does not appear to pose a current,significant threat to the beneficial uses of groundwater.therefore no further action with respect to soil and groundwater investigation or remediation at this time is necessary.the district received a copy of the closure report as well as the testing consultant reports on the valencia site.
drawing on these facts,which we take from the trial court statement of decision and which the district does not challenge on appeal,the court made the following conclusions noticeably absent from the district and rebuttal case was any evidence of a causal connection between the shallow pce findings apparently in place well before mag operated at the valencia site and the already contaminated groundwater.at the close of its case,the district had not offered any credible evidence that observed pce contamination from the shallow soil at the valencia site from whatever source did or would at any time in the future migrate to the groundwater.t he evidence clearly establishes that the pce in the groundwater below the valencia site migrated there from multiple offsite sources.t he district failed to present evidence establishing its prima facie case that the valencia site or mag operations at the valencia site caused or threatened to cause groundwater contamination or pollution which required the district to incur remediation or costs.
the trial court determined that the district had not carried its burden of proof on its claims under the ocwd act or the hsaa.as to the hsaa,the trial court wrote,a necessary element of establishing liability is proof that a release or threatened release plaintiff to incur response costs.consequently,the plaintiff must establish a causal link between the release for which a defendant is responsible,and the response costs incurred by plaintiff.the trial court explained,there was no documented release of any volatile organic compound,including pce,by mag even if there were such a documented release,there is no evidence of a vertical pathway showing that pce migrated from the surface to the groundwater.it concluded,because there is no viable,admissible evidence that mag caused a release of pce into the environment,mag can not be liable under the hsaa.
the court criticized the district claim for declaratory relief as imprecise.however,to the extent the district was seeking a declaration that mag was responsible for future remediation costs,the court declined to do so because the district offered no evidence regarding its anticipated future costs relating to mag activities.the court also repeated its conclusion that the district evidence failed to demonstrate that mag could have or did cause groundwater contamination or pollution,or that its conduct threatened to cause contamination or pollution at the valencia site in the future.as a result,the district declaratory relief count and the requested relief are premised on inconclusive information.the court heading for this section stated,the district failed to establish a justiciable controversy between itself and mag.some capitalization omitted.
six months later,mag filed a motion for summary adjudication of the district remaining claims for negligence,nuisance,and trespass.mag argued that those claims were predicated on the same theories and evidence offered by the district during the bench trial and were therefore deficient for the same reasons.the district opposed,contending that the standards on summary judgment and on mag earlier motion for judgment were different.on reply,mag argued that the court factual findings following the bench trial on the district equitable claims were binding on the district remaining legal claims,thereby requiring summary adjudication of the latter claims.the court granted mag motion,finding that the dispositive factual issues had already been resolved against the district and those findings precluded recovery by the district on its remaining claims.
the court entered judgment in favor of mag and against the district on all of the district claims.the judgment included a declaration that mag has no liability to the district for damages,response costs,or other costs claimed by the district,or any future costs.the district appeals.
discussion 
the district first contends the trial court erred by granting mag motion for judgment on its hsaa claim.after a party has completed his presentation of evidence in a trial by the court,the other party may move for a judgment.the court as trier of the facts shall weigh the evidence and may render a judgment in favor of the moving party,in which case the court shall make a statement of decision,or may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence.code civ,subd.a.the purpose of code of civil procedure section is to enable the court,when it finds at the completion of plaintiff case that the evidence does not justify requiring the defense to produce evidence,to weigh evidence and make findings of fact.citation.under the statute,a court acting as trier of fact may enter judgment in favor of the defendant if the court concludes that the plaintiff failed to sustain its burden of proof.citation.in making the ruling,the trial court assesses witness credibility and resolves conflicts in the evidence.kinney overton th,kinney.because the trial court evaluates the evidence as a trier of fact,it may refuse to believe some witnesses while crediting the testimony of others.medrazo honda of north hollywood th,medrazo see jordan city of santa barbara th,in doing so,the court may refuse to believe witnesses and draw conclusions at odds with expert opinion.
the trial court ability to weigh the evidence and consider witness credibility distinguishes a motion for judgment from a motion for nonsuit during a jury trial,which also challenges a plaintiff evidence at the close of the plaintiff.when considering a motion for nonsuit,a trial court must deny the motion if the evidence presented by the plaintiff would support a jury verdict in the plaintiff favor.carson facilities development cal d.in other words,to avoid a nonsuit,a plaintiff must introduce evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case.fisher city of berkeley cal d,conte girard orthopaedic surgeons medical group,th.if a plaintiff makes out a prima facie case,a motion for nonsuit must be denied.when considering a motion for judgment during a bench trial,a trial court is not so limited.even if a plaintiff introduces evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case,the trial court may still conclude the plaintiff has not carried his or her burden of proof and grant judgment in favor of the moving defendant.for example,on a motion for judgment,the trial court may disbelieve the plaintiff evidence,draw adverse rather than favorable inferences therefrom,and credit contrary evidence introduced through or otherwise.
the standard of review after a trial court issues judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section is the same as if the court had rendered judgment after a completed trial that is,in reviewing the questions of fact decided by the trial court,the substantial evidence rule applies.medrazo,supra,th at.but,we are not bound by a trial court interpretation of the law kinney,supra,th at.we review legal issues under a de novo or independent standard.fink shemtov th.
the district does not challenge the court factual findings.we therefore accept them as established.if the district were challenging these findings,we would find any such challenge waived because the district did not set forth all material evidence supporting the court order.see holguin dish network llc th.
the district instead asserts that the court misinterpreted the elements of its claim under the hsaa.the relevant provision of the hsaa provides a private right of action as follows a person who has incurred response or corrective action costs in accordance with this chapter or the federal act may seek contribution or indemnity from any person who is liable pursuant to this chapter.health saf.code,subd.d.the federal act referenced in the hsaa is the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of,as amended cercla et.health saf.code.hsaa is the california counterpart to cercla.citation.although the hsaa incorporates many cercla concepts,it is not identical,national union fire ins.cal th,fn.
among the concepts incorporated from cercla are its liability provisions responsible party or liable person,for purposes of this chapter,means those persons described in section a of the federal act a.health saf.code,subd.a.cercla establishes four categories of potentially responsible persons.a.the relevant category here provides that any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of,from which there is a release,or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs,of a hazardous substance,shall be liable for the cost of removal or remedial action and other responses.a.therefore,under cercla and the hsaa,t o prevail in a private cost recovery action,a plaintiff must establish that the site on which the hazardous substances are contained is a facility under cercla definition of the term,section,a release or threatened release of any hazardous substance from the facility has occurred,a such release or threatened release has caused the plaintiff to incur response costs that were necessary and consistent with the national contingency plan,a and a b and the defendant is within one of four classes of persons subject to the liability provisions of section a a.carson harbor village,unocal cir,carson harbor en banc see gregory village partners,chevron.d,a claim under the hsaa has the same elements as a claim under cercla.
causation under cercla,and therefore under the hsaa,is addressed in the third element.as we will explain,this element departs from traditional tort theories of causation.for example,this element does not require a plaintiff to show that a particular defendant caused either the release or the incurrence of response costs in order to prove liability.kalamazoo river study group menasha cir,kalamazoo river.instead,potentially liable defendants or,in cercla terminology,potentially responsible parties are identified as classes of persons in the fourth element.these classes of persons include parties who might otherwise not be considered liable under traditional tort theories,current owners and operators of a contaminated facility.see a.
once these elements are proven,an hsaa defendant is strictly liable for recoverable costs health saf.code,subd.c unless the defendant establishes an applicable defense,subd.b or the circumstances justify apportionment,subds.a b.a similar scheme exists under cercla potentially responsible parties under cercla are strictly liable for cleanup costs citation,subject only to the statute narrow defenses for damages caused solely by acts of god,war,or third parties.westfarm associates washington suburban sanitary com.cir,see b.the hsaa largely incorporates cercla defenses.health saf.code,subd.b.
the district contends the trial court misinterpreted the third element causation and fourth element potentially responsible parties of its hsaa claim.we will address each in turn.
regarding the third element,the district argues that the court erroneously required the district to prove that mag released or threatened to release hazardous waste that caused the district to incur response costs the district is correct that it was not required to prove a causal connection between a release by mag and its response costs.
v irtually every court that has considered this question has held that a cercla plaintiff need not establish a direct causal connection between the defendant hazardous substances and the release or the plaintiff incurrence of response costs.united states alcan aluminum cir,alcan aluminum see state of shore realty cir,shore realty.the causation requirement under cercla and hsaa is independent of a given defendant.kalamazoo river,supra,at.it focuses on whether there was a release or threatened release at the facility at issue,not whether the defendant caused the release or threatened release.for purposes of the third element,a plaintiff need only prove that a release or threatened release occurred at the facility that caused the plaintiff to incur necessary response costs.carson harbor,supra,at.
whether a given defendant is liable is governed by the fourth element.this element makes clear that liability is based on the defendant relationship to the facility not the defendant relationship to the release or threatened release that caused the incurrence of response costs.see alcan aluminum,supra,at t he version of cercla ultimately passed by congress imposed liability upon a class of responsible persons without regard to whether the person specifically caused or contributed to the release and the resultant response costs.asarco llc nl industries.d,asarco once the connection between the defendant and a hazardous waste site has been established because the defendant fits into one of the four categories of responsible parties,it is enough that response costs resulted from a release or threatened release not necessarily the defendant release or threatened release.
the trial court statement of decision as to the third element is ambiguous.in its legal discussion,the court explained its understanding of the hsaa claim,in part,as follows a necessary element of establishing liability under cercla is proof that a release or threatened release plaintiff to incur response costs.consequently,the plaintiff must establish a causal link between the release for which a defendant is responsible,and the response costs incurred by plaintiff.it is unclear whether the latter sentence would require a plaintiff to show that defendant is responsible in a causal sense for a release or threatened release or responsible in the sense of being a potentially responsible party under the fourth element of a cercla or hsaa claim.
in other portions of the statement of decision,the court appears to have focused on whether mag caused a release that resulted in response costs,which is an incorrect standard.for example,the heading of its discussion of the district hsaa claim states,mag is entitled to judgment on the second cause of action because there is no evidence that mag released a hazardous substance which contaminated groundwater.some capitalization omitted.similarly,in its conclusion,the court wrote,because there is no viable,admissible evidence that mag caused a release of pce into the environment,mag can not be liable under the hsaa.these statements do not reflect the proper standard under the hsaa because they require the district to prove that mag caused a release,rather than someone caused a release from the valencia site at issue in the lawsuit.it therefore appears the trial court potentially applied the wrong legal standard on causation.the correct standard requires only that a release or threatened release occurred at the valencia site,from whatever source,and that release or threatened release caused the district to incur necessary response costs.
the district argues that the court applied the wrong legal standard and,had it applied the correct standard,it would have received a more favorable result.according to the district,the court would not have granted mag motion for judgment if it had used the correct legal standard.we disagree.the court factual findings show that it would have granted mag motion even if it had used the correct legal standard.
as we have noted,the response costs claimed by the district stem from its efforts to investigate and remediate groundwater contamination.because the district efforts are focused on groundwater,if a pce release at the valencia site did not cause groundwater contamination,that release could not have caused the district response costs.instead,the district response costs would be caused by other releases,at other sites,that caused contamination in groundwater.the district does not appear to contend,for example,that the release of pce into the shallow soil at the valencia site,in and of itself,caused it to incur response costs 
in its statement of decision,the trial court repeatedly found that a release from the valencia site from whatever source,mag or otherwise did not cause groundwater contamination or response costs incurred by the district noticeably absent from the district and rebuttal case was any evidence of a causal connection between the shallow pce findings apparently in place well before mag operated at the valencia site and the already contaminated groundwater.at the close of its case,the district had not offered any credible evidence that observed pce contamination from the shallow soil at the valencia site from whatever source did or would at any time in the future migrate to the groundwater.t he evidence clearly establishes that the pce in the groundwater below the valencia site migrated there from multiple offsite sources.t he district failed to present evidence establishing its prima facie case that the valencia site or mag operations at the valencia site caused or threatened to cause groundwater contamination or pollution which required the district to incur remediation or costs.
each of these factual findings bears directly on the correct legal standard under the hsaa,whether a release or threatened release from the valencia site,whatever the source,caused the district to incur response costs,and resolved the issue against the district.see carson harbor,supra,at santa clara valley water dist.olin.d,cases within the ninth circuit support the conclusion that a cercla prima facie case requires a plaintiff to show that a release caused the incurrence of some response costs.given the court factual findings,the court potential misinterpretation of the causation element of the hsaa was harmless.
in resisting this conclusion,the district claims that the required proof of causation under cercla and therefore the hsaa departs from traditional notions of causation.the district relies primarily on united states monsanto cir.monsanto.monsanto is inapposite.the portion the district relies upon does not consider causation under the third element of cercla liability.id.at.instead,monsanto considered the scope of the fourth element,specifically the potential liability of generator defendants under section a of title of the united states code.monsanto,supra,at.a generator defendant is liable if a plaintiff proves it is a person who by contract,agreement,or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment,or arranged with a transporter for disposal or treatment,of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person,by any other party or entity,at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances.a.
monsanto interpreted this provision to impose liability on defendants who generated hazardous substances at one site and arranged for disposal of the hazardous substances at another site,so long as the defendant hazardous substances were chemically similar to those released or threatened to be released at the disposal site.monsanto,supra,at fn.cercla plaintiffs must present evidence that a generator defendant waste was shipped to a site and that hazardous substances similar to those contained in the defendant waste remained present at the time of release.regardless of monsanto interpretation of the fourth element for generator defendants,the third element must still be satisfied.
and,in any event,the provision of the fourth element applicable to mag,section a of title of the united states code,is quite different.it imposes liability on any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of.a.as we will discuss in more detail post,a defendant liability under this provision is based on the defendant activities at the facility where the release occurred.ibid.monsanto analysis of a generator defendant liability when its hazardous wastes are transported to a common facility is therefore inapplicable.united states wade,also cited by the district,involved generator defendants,like monsanto,and it is unpersuasive for the same reasons.
similarly,the district reliance on cases rejecting the requirement of fingerprinting or tracing hazardous substances is unavailing.asarco,which the district cites approvingly,rejected the requirement that a plaintiff provide proof of fingerprinting or tracing a defendant hazardous waste to impose liability.asarco,supra,d at.but asarco conclusion applied only to tracing a specific defendant waste,a release of waste attributable to a specific defendant.ibid.as we have already discussed,a release need not be attributed to a specific defendant for that defendant to be held liable.what a plaintiff must do and what the trial court found the district had failed to do is prove a causal connection between a release or threatened release,from whatever source,and a plaintiff response costs.ibid.response costs must be caused by an actual or threatened release.the other authorities cited by the district likewise confirm this causation requirement.thomas fag bearings,thomas granting summary judgment because plaintiff could not show the release at issue caused groundwater contamination artesian water government of new castle county,artesian water cercla strict liability scheme does not diminish the necessity of demonstrating a causal connection between a release or threatened release and the incurrence of costs by a plaintiff.citations.plaintiff must therefore show that it incurred costs as a result of the release or threatened release of hazardous substances from the site.indeed,artesian water expressly confirmed that traditional tort principles of causation,including causation where multiple sources may have contributed to contamination,govern cercla causation requirement.artesian water,supra.at.cercla departure from traditional tort principles can be found in the omission of the defendant from that requirement,which,as we have discussed,focuses on whether a release caused plaintiff response costs,rather than whether a defendant caused plaintiff response costs.
in sum,although the trial court statement of decision included ambiguous language suggesting the court applied an incorrect legal standard by requiring the district to show that a release or threatened release by mag caused it to incur response costs,we conclude any error was harmless.the court found that any release from the valencia site,whether by mag or not,did not cause groundwater contamination or the district response costs.because such a causal connection is required under the hsaa,the court finding foreclosed the district claim and the trial court properly granted mag motion for judgment.
we note the trial court finding,in part,that the district failed to establish a prima facie case of causation under the hsaa has created some confusion in this appeal.in its briefing,the district summarizes evidence supporting the inference that the pce release at the valencia site caused contamination of groundwater and therefore the district response costs,evidence that would support a prima facie case of causation.based on our review of the record,the evidence at trial bearing on the element of causation was not undisputed.our standard of review,however,precludes us from reweighing this evidence on appeal.the trial court found that the release did not cause groundwater contamination,and the district does not attempt to show that this finding was not supported by substantial evidence or that the court was required to make the opposite finding as a matter of law.
given the procedural posture of this appeal,the authorities cited by the district regarding the requirements for it to establish a prima facie case,or for it to survive summary judgment,are inapposite.see,castaic lake water agency whittaker.d,concluding the plaintiff meets its burden on summary judgment if it provides evidence of a plausible migration pathway by which the contaminant could have traveled from the defendant facility to the plaintiff site,among other elements.even assuming the district had established a prima facie case at trial or offered evidence sufficient to survive summary judgment,on a motion for judgment the trial court was entitled to assess the credibility of the district evidence,weigh it against contrary evidence and inferences,and determine whether the district had met its burden of proof at trial.see med
