introduction 
appellant conejo wellness center,conejo is located in the city of agoura hills.conejo is a california cooperative corporation that operates as a nonprofit collective engaged in the distribution of medical marijuana to its members.respondent is the city of agoura hills agoura.
in the court below,conejo filed a complaint which sought injunctive and declaratory relief against agoura based on two agoura municipal ordinances ordinance,which expressly bans medical marijuana dispensaries as defined therein,and ordinance,which amends the agoura hills municipal code ahmc in various ways that affect medical marijuana dispensaries.conejo complaint alleged eight causes of action enactment of did not comply with section of the government code and the ordinance is therefore void violates the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et both ordinances are preempted by california law,specifically by the compassionate use act of cua health,and the medical marijuana program act of mmpa health,et violates,and specific conduct by agoura violated,state constitutional rights to substantive due process,procedural due process,and equal protection of the laws both ordinances violate the state constitutional rights to privacy and freedom of association violates state and federal constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws and laws which impair vested contract rights for a declaration that is unconstitutional and an injunction prohibiting its further enforcement and for a writ of mandate code civ,compelling agoura to permit conejo to operate as a nonprofit medical marijuana collective consistent with california law.
in response to conejo complaint,agoura filed a which sought both declaratory and injunctive relief.the initially alleged four causes of action for a permanent injunction to abate conejo continued operation as a public nuisance,based upon the following conejo failure to obtain proper permits and approvals from agoura conejo failure to obtain a valid business license from the county of los angeles conejo violation of ordinance and conejo violation of ordinance.agoura fifth cause of action sought declaratory relief based upon the first four causes of action.
the trial court dismissed conejo second cause of action on procedural grounds,a ruling conejo does not appeal.subsequently,the court granted agoura motion for summary judgment on the balance of the complaint.the court also granted agoura motion for summary adjudication of the third cause of action.agoura then effectively dismissed the balance of its thereafter,the trial court entered judgment against conejo on both its original complaint and agoura.as part of its judgment,the trial court permanently enjoined conejo from selling,providing,or otherwise making available marijuana at or from its current location or any other location within agoura 
conejo now appeals from the trial court orders granting summary judgment and summary adjudication,and from its final judgment enjoining conejo further distribution of marijuana.
background 
the issues raised by this appeal involve the interplay of various state and local laws,enacted at various times.what follows then,is not only a statement of the facts established by the record below,but also a chronology of the state and local laws involved.
agoura land use ordinances prior to the cua and mmpa 
at all times relevant to the issues raised by this appeal,conejo operated in an area described by agoura zoning laws as the business park manufacturing district manufacturing district.
in,agoura adopted ordinance,which amended the ahmc and enacted a series of land use statutes.of relevance here,the ordinance enacted ahmc sections and,which established a commercial use table identifying the specific land uses permitted within the manufacturing district,as well as within other commercial districts in agoura.section of the ordinance prohibited any use not expressly authorized by the commercial use table or interpreted by the city planning commission to be similar to an authorized use.the commercial use table enacted as part of ordinance did not list medical marijuana dispensary as a permitted use within the manufacturing district,or any other commercial district.in their briefs,neither side contends that the city planning commission at any time interpreted medical marijuana dispensary to be similar to an expressly authorized use.
while this litigation was pending in the trial court,agoura adopted ordinance,which renumbered and amended agoura land use statutes,and also enacted a new commercial use table.the changes,however,are not material to this litigation the new commercial use table does not list medical marijuana dispensary as a permitted use within any commercial district and the new ordinance still prohibits any use not expressly authorized or interpreted as similar to an authorized use by the city planning commission.see generally,ahmc see also.
in,california voters approved proposition,known as the cua,which is codified in health and safety code section the cua provides that no physician shall be punished,or denied any right or privilege,for having recommended marijuana to a patient for medical purposes,subd.c.the cua also immunizes specific persons from specific prosecutions under the health and safety code 
section,relating to the possession of marijuana,and s ection,relating to the cultivation of marijuana,shall not apply to a patient,or to a patient primary caregiver,who possesses or cultivates marijuana for the personal medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral recommendation or approval of a physician,subd.d.
the cua defines primary caregiver as the person designated by the patient who has consistently assumed responsibility for the patient housing,health,or safety,subd.e.
the cua also provides that n othing in this section shall be construed to supersede legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in conduct that endangers others,nor to condone the diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes,subd.b.it also expressly encourage s the federal and state governments to implement a plan to provide for the safe and affordable distribution of marijuana to all patients in medical need of marijuana,subd.b c.
in,the california legislature enacted the mmpa,codified in sections through.the mmpa was passed,in part,to clarify the scope of the cua and promote its uniform application among the counties within the state.stats,ch.
to accomplish these goals,the mmpa empowers the department of health services to create a voluntary program for the issuance of identification cards to qualified patients,subd.a.qualified patients are defined as those persons entitled to the protections of the cua,subd.f.
the mmpa then grants immunity from prosecution to an expanded list of offenses so long as the underlying conduct involves medical marijuana use 
subject to the requirements of this article,the individuals specified in subdivision b shall not be subject,on that sole basis,to criminal liability under s ection s possession,cultivation,possession for sale,sales,maintaining a place,providing a place,or nuisance,subd.a,italics added.
the mmpa establishes three groups of persons entitled to the immunity described above qualified patients,persons with identification cards,and the primary caregivers of such persons individuals who assist the aforementioned patients,card holders,and primary caregivers in administering medical marijuana and individuals who assist patients,card holders,and primary caregivers in acquiring the skills necessary to cultivate or administer medical marijuana,subd.b.
significantly,the mmpa also expressly extends immunity from prosecution under the same enumerated health and safety code sections to certain collective,conduct 
qualified patients,persons with valid identification cards,and the designated primary caregivers of qualified patients and persons with identification cards,who associate within the state of california in order collectively or cooperatively to cultivate marijuana for medical purposes,shall not solely on the basis of that fact be subject to state criminal sanctions under s ection s,or.
the mmpa,as originally enacted,also affirmatively provided that n othing in this article shall prevent a city or other local governing body from adopting and enforcing laws consistent with this article.stats,ch,former.the legislature amended this section,effective january,to read,in full,as follows 
nothing in this article shall prevent a city or other local governing body from adopting and enforcing any of the following a adopting local ordinances that regulate the location,operation,or establishment of a medical marijuana cooperative or collective.b the civil and criminal enforcement of local ordinances described in subdivision a.c enacting other laws consistent with this article,italics added stats,ch.
conejo creation and operation 
conejo began operation in april and incorporated as a cooperative in june.conejo operates as a nonprofit collective that maintains quantities of medical marijuana at its location for distribution to its members.
on september,agoura adopted ordinance,which added section to article ix of the ahmc.section,subdivision c,expressly states that operation of a m edical m arijuana d ispensary is not a permitted use anywhere in the c ity.as if to emphasize the point,the section further provides that 
i t shall be unlawful for any person or entity to own,manage,establish,conduct,or operate,or permit to be established,conducted,operated,owned or managed as a landlord or property owner,any m edical m arijuana d ispensary,or to participate as a landlord,owner,employee,contractor,agent or volunteer,or in any other manner or capacity,in any m edical m arijuana d ispensary,in the c ity.
ahmc section,subdivision b,defines a medical marijuana dispensary 
medical marijuana dispensary is any location,structure,facility,vehicle,store,residence,or similar facility used,in full or part,as a place at or in which marijuana is sold,traded,exchanged,bartered for in any way,made available,located,stored,placed,or cultivated,including any of the foregoing if used in connection with the delivery of marijuana.
other preexisting sections contained in article ix provide the enforcement mechanism for ahmc section.section deems any condition caused by or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of article ix a public nuisance.section makes any violation of article ix a misdemeanor punishable by six months in jail or a fine or both.
agoura conduct after enactment of ordinance 
prior to,agoura did not require nonprofit entities to obtain a city business registration permit.conejo,nevertheless,applied for a business registration permit on december,and submitted the application fee the same day.agoura did not formally act upon conejo application until february,when it rejected the application and refunded the application fee.
in january,agoura commenced an investigation of conejo that ultimately became a investigation.on october,the sheriff executed a search warrant at conejo location.deputies seized marijuana,paraphernalia,and paperwork.agoura city officials,including the assistant to the city manager,the city prosecutor,and a code enforcement officer,arrived at the location at some point during execution of the search warrant.
in june,conejo requested a building permit to expand its location.agoura assistant to the city manager rejected the request at the counter because conejo business was a nonconforming use.
on october,agoura adopted ordinance,which added section to article iv of the ahmc.section expressly prohibits any medical marijuana dispensary,as defined in section,from receiving compensation for the distribution of medical marijuana.
ordinance also made a number of changes to chapter of article vi of the ahmc it amended section to include nonprofit entities within the definition of a business it amended section to require an annual business registration permit prior to the operation of any business it added section,which expressly prohibits operation of a business without a valid business registration permit it added section,which prohibits the city manager from issuing a business registration permit to any business that is not a permitted use under the ahmc,and further identifies a section medical marijuana dispensary to be a nonpermitted use and it added section which prohibits business advertising of any sort until a valid business registration permit is obtained.
finally,ordinance added enforcement provisions for violations of sections contained in chapter ahmc section deems any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of chapter a public nuisance and section makes any violation a misdemeanor punishable by six months in the county jail,a fine,or both.
agoura conduct after enactment of ordinance 
on november,conejo applied for a business registration permit.the assistant to the city manager refused to accept the application at the counter because a medical marijuana dispensary was not a permitted use under the ahmc.
ahmc section 
as mentioned above,article ix and chapter of article vi of the ahmc contain enforcement provisions for violations of their sections.section of article i of the ahmc adds to those specific enforcement provisions by creating a general enforcement provision applicable to the ahmc as a whole subdivision a of section makes any violation of the ahmc generally a misdemeanor subject to six months in jail,a fine,or both,while subdivision c deems any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of the ahmc a public nuisance subject to summary abatement.

in the immediate case,the facts,as described above or elsewhere in this opinion,are not disputed by the parties.this case presents purely questions of law based upon undisputed facts.
ii.first cause of action government code section 
conejo contends,agoura concedes,and we agree that ordinance is a zoning ordinance because it bans medical marijuana dispensaries by expressly classifying them as a nonpermitted use anywhere in the city.in its first cause of action,conejo asserts that ordinance is also a zoning ordinance or,alternatively,that it amends a zoning ordinance,and for either reason is therefore void because agoura did not comply with government code section,which sets forth specific notice and other requirements for enactments or amendments of zoning ordinances.agoura does not contend that it complied with section,but argues instead that section does not apply because is neither a zoning ordinance nor an amendment of a zoning ordinance.we agree that section is inapplicable to.
government code section et.
government code section provides,in pertinent part 
a zoning ordinance or an amendment to a zoning ordinance,which amendment changes any property from one zone to another or imposes any regulation listed in section not theretofore imposed or removes or modifies any such regulation theretofore imposed shall be adopted in the manner set forth in s ections to,inclusive.
government code section,referred to in section,confers legislative power upon counties and cities to do the following regulate the use of buildings and land between industry,business,and residences regulate signs and billboards regulate the size of buildings,the size of lots,the percentage of a lot to be occupied by a building,and the intensity of land use establish requirements for offstreet parking and loading establish and maintain building setback lines and create civic districts,public parks,and public grounds,subds.a f.sections through,also referenced in section,require a noticed public hearing before the local planning commission,written recommendations from the planning commission to the local legislative body,a noticed public hearing before the legislative body,and formal approval,disapproval,or modification of the recommendations by the legislative body,before a municipality may enact or amend a zoning ordinance encompassed by section.
applicability of government code section to ordinance 
of relevance to conejo government code claim,ordinance does seven things it expressly prohibits a medical marijuana dispensary from receiving compensation ahmc it redefines business to include nonprofit entities ahmc it requires all businesses to obtain a business registration permit ahmc it expressly prohibits a business from operating without a business registration permit ahmc it prohibits the city manager from issuing a business registration permit if the business involves a nonpermitted use ahmc it expressly identifies a medical marijuana dispensary as a nonpermitted use ahmc and prohibits business advertising by any means or medium prior to obtaining a business registration permit ahmc.none of these provisions move property from one zone to another.moreover,none of these provisions impose regulations not theretofore imposed or modify regulations theretofore imposed that are subjects of the powers listed in government code section.consequently,on its face ordinance simply does not fall within the scope of government code section.
conejo attempts to get around this conclusion through three arguments.first,conejo seems to contend that insofar as ordinance prohibits a dispensary from receiving compensation,it modifies or amends the definition of a medical marijuana dispensary established by ordinance ahmc,subd.b.ordinance,conejo argues,bans only for profit dispensaries while bans nonprofit dispensaries as well.thus,conejo concludes,no modifies a regulation related to the use of buildings and land as between industry,business,and residences,bringing it within the scope of government code section,subdivision a,and thus also within the scope of government code section.
we disagree.ordinance does not redefine medical marijuana dispensaries for zoning purposes.ordinance,as originally enacted,prohibits the use of any location as a place at or which marijuana is sold,traded,exchanged,bartered for in any way,made available,located,stored,placed,or cultivated,including any of the foregoing if used in connection with the delivery of marijuana.ahmc,subd.b,italics added.as the italicized portion makes clear,from its inception,banned all dispensaries,whether or not for profit.ordinance does not in any way change or add to that fact.what does is expressly prohibit an already banned dispensary from receiving compensation,an issue not addressed by and an issue unrelated to the subjects encompassed by government code sections and.in other words,a medical marijuana dispensary violates by its existence,because agoura,for zoning purposes,has classified dispensaries as a nonpermitted use.a medical marijuana dispensary violates not by its existence,but by accepting compensation for its services.
conejo next argues that ordinance comes within the scope of government code sections and because it redefines a business to include nonprofit entities such as itself,requires all businesses to obtain a business registration permit,prohibits the city manager from issuing such permits for a nonpermitted use,and expressly identifies medical marijuana dispensaries as nonpermitted uses.although unclear,the argument seems to be that,by declaring dispensaries to be nonpermitted uses and therefore ineligible to obtain the business registration permit required of even nonprofit entities,goes beyond a business licensing scheme and becomes a zoning ordinance because it effectively prohibits nonprofit dispensaries such as conejo.thus,conejo apparently concludes,this portion of imposes or modifies a land use regulation listed in section,bringing it within the scope of section.
again,we disagree with conejo conclusion.requiring a business registration permit of all business entities,whether or not for profit,does not impose or amend any regulation within the scope of government code section.similarly,allowing the city manager to reject an application for any already nonpermitted use does not implicate any power listed in section.finally,even though ordinance expressly declares dispensaries to be a nonpermitted use,it does not become,as required by section,a zoning amendment that imposes any regulation not theretofore imposed or that removes or modifies any such regulation theretofore imposed ordinance had already declared dispensaries a nonpermitted use,and restatement of that fact does not add a regulation that did not already exist or modify an existing one.
conejo final argument is likewise not persuasive.conejo simply concludes,without any analysis whatsoever,that because ordinance prohibits a business from advertising by any means or medium before obtaining a registration permit,it necessarily regulates signs and billboards within the meaning of government code section,subdivision b.in connection with this argument,we agree with agoura an ordinance that restricts advertising generally to entities that have obtained a required local permit does not become a sign or billboard regulation in the context of zoning powers because it incidentally may affect those two advertising mediums.
iii.second cause of action ceqa 
as previously mentioned,on appeal conejo does not challenge the trial court dismissal of its second cause of action.we therefore do not address this issue.
iv.third cause of action preemption by state law 
in its third cause of action,conejo contends that the cua and the mmpa preempt ordinance,parts of ordinance,and the various ahmc provisions that make violation of these ordinances either misdemeanors or public nuisances subject to abatement.conejo also asserts preemption as an affirmative defense to the third cause of action alleged in agoura.
a.the law of preemption 
article xi,section of the california constitution grants local governments plenary police powers a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.subject to the limitation that it not act contrary to state law,the police power of a county or city is as broad as the police power exercised by the state legislature itself.birkenfeld city of berkeley cal d,accord,candid enterprises,grossmont union high school dist.cal d,candid enterprises.

conejo opening brief on the issue of preemption is not altogether clear.conejo,though,appears to argue that the cua and mmpa preempt agoura ordinances in various ways.first,conejo contends that ordinance expressly bans collective or cooperative medical marijuana dispensaries specifically allowed by the cua and mmpa.next,conejo argues that ordinance functionally bans such dispensaries in two ways by requiring that even nonprofit entities obtain a business registration permit and then categorically prohibiting the city manager from issuing permits to dispensaries and by prohibiting any compensation whatsoever including simple reimbursement for costs expended to dispensaries.finally,conejo argues that the cua and mmpa preempt the ahmc to the extent the ahmc punishes operation of a dispensary through sections that criminalize or deem a nuisance any violation of or.reduced to their essence,conejo arguments can be summarized as follows the cua and mmpa create a state right to cultivate,distribute,or otherwise obtain marijuana collectively,and thereafter to possess and use it,for medical purposes and the ahmc,through various provisions,conflicts with that right by prohibiting punishing its exercise.
preliminarily,we agree with agoura that the definition of a medical marijuana dispensary in ordinance ahmc,subd.b is broad enough to include conejo.we also find that the definition of a business,as amended by ordinance ahmc,is also sufficiently broad to include conejo.conejo does not contest these points in its opening brief.thus,it is not disputed that both ordinances either directly or indirectly prohibit conejo operation.based on the analysis that follows,we nevertheless reject conejo argument because its initial premise is incorrect neither the cua nor the mmpa creates the right conejo claims.
preemption by the cua 
the cua,by its express terms is a limited statute.it simply gives qualified patients and their primary caregivers only a defense to the state crimes of marijuana possession and cultivation when that possession or cultivation is for medical purposes based upon a physician written or oral recommendation.ross ragingwire telecommunications,cal th,ross people mower cal th.the cua,notwithstanding the statement in its introductory preamble that its purpose is to ensure that seriously ill californians have the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes,does not create a broad right to use marijuana without hindrance or inconvenience.ross,supra,at,quoting,subd.b a.the only right it creates is the right of a qualified patient or primary caregiver to possess or cultivate medical marijuana without thereby becoming subject to criminal prosecution under sections and.ross,at.
division two of this court succinctly summarized the extremely limited scope of the cua,in the context of a temporary local moratorium of medical marijuana dispensaries 
the nature of the right to use marijuana created by the cua has been examined in several california court decisions.in people mower cal th,the california supreme court rejected the defendant argument that the cua provided an absolute defense to arrest and prosecution for certain marijuana offenses and concluded that the statute provides a limited defense from prosecution for cultivation and possession of marijuana.citation.the defense accorded by the cua is limited to patients and primary caregivers only,to prosecution for only two criminal offenses health and safety code section possession and section cultivation.citation.in view of the statute narrow reach,courts have consistently resisted attempts by advocates of medical marijuana to broaden the scope of these limited specific exceptions.citation.for example,courts have determined that the cua did not create a constitutional right to obtain marijuana citation,and have refused to expand the scope of the cua to allow the sale or nonprofit distribution of marijuana by medical marijuana cooperatives.city of claremont kruse th,kruse.
the cua,then,does not create a right to cultivate,distribute,or otherwise obtain medical marijuana collectively.rather,it simply provides two specifically identified groups of persons with a limited defense to two specific state criminal statutes.it does not mention,let alone authorize,medical marijuana collectives or dispensaries.it does not expressly prohibit further legislation in the area of medical marijuana use and,as we have already observed,expressly acknowledges the potential validity of other legislation intended to prevent or regulate related conduct that might endanger the general citizenry,subd.b nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in conduct that endangers others,nor to condone the diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes.
based on the above,we find none of the three possible types of preemption.the referenced agoura ordinances are not coextensive with the cua and therefore do not duplicate it.neither do they contradict the cua since the cua does not create a right to cultivate,distribute,or otherwise obtain medical marijuana collectively,local prohibition of such conduct does not contradict it.finally,given its limited scope and express recognition of the validity of additional legislation in the area,the cua was not intended explicitly or implicitly to occupy fully the entire field of medical marijuana use.kruse,supra,th at people urziceanu th,the cua did not contemplate the collective cultivation or distribution of medical marijuana.
preemption by the mmpa 
as mentioned above,the mmpa significantly expands the list of state offenses to which the defense of medical marijuana use applies,and specifically includes sales of marijuana,subd.a.it also expands the groups of persons to whom the defense is available beyond qualified patients and their primary caregivers to include holders of identification cards and persons who assist members of these three groups in administering medical marijuana or acquiring the skills necessary to cultivate or administer medical marijuana,subd.b.finally,and perhaps most significantly for the purpose of this case,the mmpa extends immunity from prosecution under the listed penal statutes to qualified patients,identification card holders,and their primary caregivers who collectively or cooperatively cultivate marijuana for medical purposes.
though the mmpa can be seen as an expansion of the cua in some respects,the two are not qualitatively different.like the cua,the mmpa provides only limited criminal immunity for specified offenses to specific groups of people for specific actions.people mentch cal th,mentch kruse,supra,th at.the immunity created by the mmpa is available only if the sole basis of the prosecution is conduct specifically described in the mmpa.see,subd.a.the mmpa simply does not provide blanket immunity to the specified groups of people under all circumstances.see mentch,supra,at hill,supra,th at see also kruse,supra,at.
furthermore,the mmpa does not expressly forbid local regulation in the area of medical marijuana use and,in fact,expressly contemplates it.as mentioned earlier,the mmpa in its original form provided that n othing in this article shall prevent a city or other local governing body from adopting and enforcing laws consistent with this article.stats,ch,former.the legislature recent amendment of the mmpa,effective january,eliminates any doubt regarding the propriety of local legislation the mmpa now expressly permits civil and criminal enforcement of local ordinances that regulate the location,operation,or establishment of a medical marijuana cooperative or collective,subd.b.
this change to the mmpa,though it postdates the relevant proceedings below,remains relevant to our decision.prior to the amendment of section,the issue of regulating medical marijuana collectives or dispensaries through local civil and criminal ordinances had been raised in various appellate decisions,hill,supra,th at qualified patients city of anaheim th,kruse,supra,th at city of corona naulls th.when enacting new legislation or amendments to existing statutes,the legislature is presumed to be aware of relevant appellate court decisions.harris capital growth investors xiv cal d,harris,superseded by statute on another ground as stated in munson del taco,cal th.
the amendment to section expressly allowing local civil and criminal enforcement is consistent with the broad language of section as originally enacted and was added after the appellate decisions referenced above.we conclude that the amendment was the legislature response to these decisions,the purpose of which was to expressly clarify what the statute had always implicitly allowed.see harris,supra,cal d at in the area of statutory construction,an examination of what the legislature has done as opposed to what it has left undone is generally the more fruitful inquiry.marina point,wolfson cal d,adding statutory language which is consistent with earlier case law construing the statute amounts to legislative endorsement of that construction.
this legislative and judicial history compels a conclusion that none of the three bases for preemption exist here.the agoura ordinances are not coextensive with and therefore do not duplicate the mmpa.further,the agoura ordinances do not contradict the mmpa although the mmpa immunizes qualified patients,identification card holders,and primary caregivers from prosecution for violations of the listed state statutes based on cooperative or collective cultivation of medical marijuana,and further immunizes persons who assist members of these three groups in administering medical marijuana or in acquiring the skills necessary to cultivate or administer medical marijuana,it does not prohibit agoura ban of dispensaries.conejo argument misconstrues what the mmpa,by its express terms,actually does.the mmpa does not differ in kind from the cua.as stated earlier,although it further implements and expands upon the cua,it remains a statute that provides limited criminal immunities to specific groups of people under a narrow set of circumstances.see mentch,supra,cal th at kruse,supra,th at.nowhere does the language of its operative terms command or even expressly allow the existence of collectives or dispensaries.its operative terms do not affirmatively create any right,constitutional or otherwise,to cultivate or distribute medical marijuana through collectives or dispensaries.the mmpa does not preclude local action except in the area of according qualified persons affirmative defenses to enumerated penal sanctions.kruse,supra,at.the mmpa simply does not prohibit the express or functional ban of dispensaries created by local ordinances such as those adopted by agoura.in the language of preemption,the ordinances do not conflict with the mmpa 
nordyke king cal th,nordyke,is instructive.in nordyke,alameda county enacted an ordinance which banned the possession of firearms on county property.id.at.one of the primary consequences of the ordinance was the effective prohibition of gun trade shows on county property.id.at.plaintiffs,who were gun show promoters,sought to enjoin the ordinance,relying in part on penal code section.subject to certain exceptions,section,subdivision a,generally prohibits possession of firearms in state or local public buildings.section,subdivision b,exempts from the prohibition persons bringing firearms for lawful sale or trade into a gun show otherwise lawful under state law.nordyke,at.plaintiffs argued that subdivision b preempted the county from outlawing guns at public buildings being used for an otherwise lawful gun show.nordyke,at.the supreme court responded in no uncertain terms 
we disagree.the provision,subd.b merely exempts gun shows from the state criminal prohibition on possessing guns in public buildings,thereby permitting local government entities to authorize such shows.it does not mandate that local government entities permit such a use,and the nordykes cite no legislative history indicating otherwise.nordyke,supra,cal th at italics added.
in the immediate case,the mmpa similarly exempts certain persons from prosecution for certain state offenses based solely on the collective cultivation of medical marijuana.it does not affirmatively mandate that any local government allow such activity or the collective or cooperative distribution of marijuana so cultivated.
moreover,we need not undertake the legislative history analysis suggested by nordyke because the language of the mmpa is clear.see hoechst celanese franchise tax bd.cal th,see also lungren deukmejian cal d.the mmpa may have expanded the offenses to which an affirmative defense may be raised and it may have expanded that defense to encompass collective conduct,but it does not,by its clear language,do anything more.we thus find no preemption by contradiction of agoura express or functional ban of medical marijuana dispensaries.
finally,the mmpa does not preempt by field occupation the agoura ordinances.as mentioned earlier,the mmpa in both its original and amended form contemplates additional local regulation of medical marijuana.stats,ch,former,subd.b.by its own terms,then,the mmpa does not occupy the entire field of medical marijuana cultivation,distribution,or use.see hill,supra,th at kruse,supra,th at see also people ex rel.deukmejian county of mendocino,supra,cal d at preemption by implication of legislative intent may not be found when the legislature has expressed its intent to permit local regulations.
fourth cause of action substantive and procedural due process 
ordinance requires nonprofit entities to obtain a business registration permit and then categorically prohibits the city manager from approving such a permit for a medical marijuana dispensary.ahmc.conejo contends that because it lawfully operated as a medical marijuana dispensary prior to the enactment of,it has a vested property right in the continued operation of a dispensary from its leasehold.in its fourth cause of action,conejo asserts that the permit requirements of deprive it of this vested property right and thus violate substantive and procedural due process,as well as equal protection of the law.
on appeal,conejo does not challenge the trial court ruling on its equal protection claim in the fourth cause of action and we,therefore,will not address it further.conejo,though,does continue to assert that the permit requirements of ordinance violate both substantive and procedural due process.we disagree.
substantive due process and vested property interests 
the proper analysis of conejo substantive due process argument,we believe,is based on constitutional principles related to the taking clauses of the united states and california constitutions.see,hansen brothers enterprises,board of supervisors cal th,hansen.in hansen,the supreme court discussed the tension between local zoning ordinances and constitutional taking clauses 
a zoning ordinance or regulation which operates prospectively,and denies the owner the opportunity to exploit an interest in property that the owner believed would be available for future development,or diminishes the value of the property,is not invalid and does not bring about a compensable taking unless all beneficial use of the property is denied.citations.however,if the law effects an unreasonable,oppressive,or unwarranted interference with an existing use,or a planned use for which a substantial investment in development costs has been made,the ordinance may be invalid as applied to that property unless compensation is paid.
