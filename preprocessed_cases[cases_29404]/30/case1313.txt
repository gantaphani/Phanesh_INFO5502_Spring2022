plaintiff sierra club appeals the district court dismissal of its lawsuit against the united states department of energy doe and the united states army corps of engineers for lack of ripeness.sierra club contends its procedural claims alleging that the doe failed to comply with the national environmental policy act nepa and the endangered species act esa prior to issuance of a road easement are ripe for adjudication.we agree and reverse the decision of the district court with respect to those procedural claims.
the district court found the following background facts were established by the administrative record,and neither party disputed these facts 
in,the united states acquired the rocky flats facility,located immediately east of colorado state highway,between golden and boulder,colorado.from to,the rocky flats facility processed plutonium and produced nuclear warhead triggers.in,the government acquired additional surface rights to increase the size of the buffer zone buffer zone around the inner plant facilities.after this expansion,the site totaled acres.
in,the doe took over the administration of rocky flats.in early,plutonium processing ceased at rocky flats based,in part,on the ground contamination occurring in the area immediately surrounding the plant.many portions of the larger buffer zone,however,escaped contamination.
until,the owners of the rocky flats subsurface were precluded from accessing their mineral rights.the subsurface mineral rights owners leased their rights to western aggregates,wai,which operates an existing gravel pit and grading facility directly west of the buffer zone 
the buffer zone is not accessible to the general public.thus,the land is relatively untouched and pristine.the proposed mining area is located on a gravel plain that stores water in the spaces between the rocks.this relative abundance of water allows vegetation and wildlife to prosper in this area including one of twenty remaining xeric tall grass prairies in the world and a large population of the preble meadow jumping mouse the mouse.on may,the united states fish and wildlife service fws listed the mouse as a threatened species under the endangered species act.
aplt.app.at.two hundred acres of the buffer zone are used by the doe as a national wind technology center nwtc.
in,western aggregates,wai applied for and received an expansion of its mining permit from the colorado department of natural resources.the proposed expansion would expand the existing gravel mine to approximately acres located in the buffer zone,including a part of the land comprising the nwtc.jefferson county,colorado,conditionally approved wai rezoning application for the area 
the doe issued a road easement to wai,which gave rise to sierra club claims underlying this appeal.the easement allowed wai and its to build a road from highway across the nwtc to the proposed mining expansion and wai existing mining operations,thus facilitating the removal of the mined sand and gravel offsite.the use and occupation of the road were made subject to such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the manager of the golden,colorado,field office of the doe.pursuant to a memorandum of understanding accompanying the easement,wai agreed not to conduct any mining operations on that portion of the property comprising the nwtc for a period of twenty years after receiving approval from jefferson county to do so.the grant of easement contained a clause stating that t he construction,use,operation and maintenance of said easement shall be performed without cost or expense to the government under the general supervision and subject to the prior approval of the manager of the golden field office of the department of energy.id.at.further,the memorandum of understanding contained the following clause 
doe agrees that upon mutual agreement between wai and doe of appropriate terms and conditions,doe shall grant to wai an easement traversing the nwtc over which wai may construct,at no cost to doe,a roadway connecting wai existing facilities to highway on the north.the general location of this easement is more particularly described in attachment d which is incorporated herein by this reference.
sierra club filed this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the doe and the army corps of engineers,alleging they failed to take necessary steps to protect valuable wetlands,open space,and habitat for the preble meadow jumping mouse from the wai proposed expansion of its sand and gravel mine.the complaint contained eight claims for relief,although only two claims are involved in this appeal the doe did not comply with the nepa because it failed to prepare and issue an environmental impact statement for public review and comment prior to granting the easement to wai and the doe failed to consult with the fish and wildlife service fws before granting the easement,as required by the esa.
the parties submitted for summary judgment.the district court determined that sierra club allegations were not yet ripe for adjudication.with respect to the allegation that the doe had failed to comply with the nepa before issuing a road easement,the court noted that t here is no evidence,however,that the road has been or is being constructed.aplt.app.at.the court further stated 
at this point,wai proposed mining operation expansion is merely a potential event with multiple unmet conditions precedent.undoubtedly,nepa will require preparation of an eis if the permitting prerequisites are fulfilled and wai chooses to proceed with its proposal.thus,the claimed environmental harms remain contingent,not certain or immediate.
id.at.with regard to sierra club claim that the doe had failed to consult with the fws,as required by the esa,the court stated that,although the preble meadow jumping mouse was listed as a threatened species under the esa 
to date wai expansion efforts have been devoted principally to obtaining the necessary county and state permits and approvals.specifically,county approval is conditioned upon,inter alia,the completion of two hydrological and ecological studies.when and if these studies are completed,jefferson county then has discretion to modify its zoning approval based on the study results.as a result,the proposed mine expansion remains largely conditional.because the mouse population is fluid and subject to myriad events not related to this litigation,the effects of the proposed mining expansion are more accurately assessed when,if ever,wai proposal clears its many hurdles.
ultimately,the district court concluded that sierra club would not suffer significant hardship by the court withholding consideration because sierra club would have an opportunity to raise those same claims whenever the licensing process for the mining expansion was completed intervention would interfere with ongoing procedures and the issues presented would benefit from further factual consideration,as it was not clear whether the wai would ever proceed with its proposal,whether the proper licenses would be obtained,whether modifications to the plans would be made,or what environmental risks would ensue from the operations.therefore,the court found that sierra club claims should be dismissed without prejudice as not ripe for adjudication.
sierra club appeals only the district court dismissal of its procedural claims which alleged that the doe failed to comply with the nepa and esa in granting the easement.sierra club does not appeal the court dismissal of its other claims against the doe and the corps of engineers.
under nepa,an agency is required to prepare and circulate for review and comment an environmental impact statement before undertaking legislation and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.the agency must prepare a detailed environmental assessment to determine whether the project requires an environmental impact statement.if an environmental impact statement is prepared,it must detail the environmental impact of the proposed action,any unavoidable adverse environmental effects if the proposal is implemented,alternatives to the proposed action,the relati
