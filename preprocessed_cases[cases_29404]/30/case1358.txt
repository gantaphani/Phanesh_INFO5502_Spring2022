in this citizen enforcement action,the sierra club and other public interest plaintiffs collectively,sierra club allege violations of the clean air act,at plant wansley,a large power plant owned and operated by georgia power company georgia power.specifically,sierra club asserts that on thousands of occasions between and,plant wansley emissions exceeded limits prescribed by the plant operating permit issued under title v of the clean air act the title v permit.
the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of sierra club on counts one and two of the complaint.after review and oral argument,we reverse the district court finding of liability as a matter of law on those counts and remand for further proceedings regarding liability.
i.the clean air act 
untangling this dispute requires an understanding of both the state and the federal responsibilities under the clean air act.as such,we begin with an overview of the clean air act scheme of joint state and federal implementation.
state implementation plans sips 
the clean air act strives to protect and enhance the quality of the nation air resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population.b.the clean air act sets out a process for achieving this goal.in the first stage,the federal environmental protection agency epa sets national ambient air quality standards for various pollutants.in the second stage,each state creates and implements a plan,known as a state implementation plan or sip,to ensure its air meets the epa standards.see.
before implementing its plan,each state must submit a proposed sip to the epa for approval.a.to gain epa approval,the sip must include enforceable emission limitations and other control measures,means,or techniques as may be necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable clean air act requirements.a.each state sip must assure that national ambient air quality standards are achieved.a c.
each state must revise its sip periodically to account for new epa standards and new emissions reduction technologies.a h.like an entirely new sip,any sip revisions must be open to public hearing and comment and must be approved by the epa.a.the epa may also make what is known as a sip call,notifying a state of inadequacies in its current sip and requesting that the state submit a revised plan.see k.
georgia sip provisions are codified in the georgia rules for air quality control,see.comp.regs.ch,which for simplicity we refer to as the georgia rules.
b.the title v permit 
in,congress amended the clean air act to add title v,see,to assist in compliance and enforcement of air pollution controls.clean air act amendments of,stat.under title v,major stationary sources of air pollution are required to obtain an operating permit,which establishes the clean air act requirements for,among other things,emission limitations relevant to the particular polluting source.legal envtl.assistance,epa,cir.
the intent of title v is to consolidate into a single document the operating permit all of the clean air requirements applicable to a particular source of air pollution.the title v permit program generally does not impose new substantive air quality control requirements.rather,a title v permit enable s the source,states,epa,and the public to understand better the requirements to which the source is subject,and whether the source is meeting those requirements.operating permit program,july,codified at.
title v authorizes each state to design its own stationary source permitting program and to submit that program to the epa for approval.georgia title v permitting program began on an interim basis in.in,the epa granted final approval of georgia title v program effective august.see app.as with georgia other duties under the clean air act,the georgia title v program is administered by the environmental protection division epd of georgia department of natural resources.
when the state epd issues a title v permit,the terms of the permit must comply with georgia sip.see setting minimum requirements for state operating permit programs and standards for permits while the state epd is primarily responsible for issuing title v permits in georgia,each permit approved by the epd also must be submitted to the federal epa for review.see b see generally pub.interest research group,johnson,cir.the epa may object to the permit and send it back to the state epd to correct the problem perceived by the epa.id.at.if the epa declines to object to the submitted permit within days,any person may petition the epa requesting that the agency object.id 
citizen enforcement 
the clean air act gives any person the authority to bring a civil action on his or her own behalf against any person who is alleged to have violated an emission standard or limitation under this chapter.a.an emission standard or limitation is defined to include any other standard,limitation,or schedule established under any permit issued pursuant to title v or under any applicable state implementation plan approved by the epa administrator.f.accordingly,citizens may sue to enforce the terms of a stationary source title v permit.
t he citizen suit is meant to supplement rather than to supplant governmental action.am.canoe ass n,city of attalla,cir quoting gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay,d.as such,prior to initiating litigation,a citizen enforcer must notify the epa,the alleged violator,and the relevant state agency of the citizen intent to sue.b.the citizen enforcer may not sue until sixty days after sending the notice letters,and his lawsuit is barred if the epa administrator or state has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil action in a court of the united states or a state to require compliance with the standard,limitation,or order.b b.
ii.plant wansley 
plant wansley,located in heard county,georgia,is a large power plant facility that burns fossil fuels in seven principal emission units.two of these units are older,steam electric generating units that emit exhaust through a tall stack.these older units are referred to as and.
plant wansley title v permit limits the opacity of emissions from and to.permit condition this permit condition is a restatement of the identical requirement from the georgia sip,a requirement that appears in the georgia rules.see.comp.regs.b.the opacity limit has been part of georgia sip for the entire period relevant to this lawsuit.
plant wansley permit requires that the plant continuously monitor the opacity of its emissions and report all excess emissions to the epd.permit conditions.a.a,plant wansley has installed what is known as a continuous opacity monitoring system,or coms,on the two units.the coms,which is located at a height of feet within the stack,shines a light through the emissions to measure opacity.the coms summarizes the opacity data over intervals,so there is a different opacity measurement for every period.once plant wansley submits this data to the epd and epa,these emissions reports become public documents.
plant wansley coms data shows that during roughly intervals from to,the opacity of emissions emanating from or exceeded.based on this data,counts one and two of sierra club lawsuit allege that the emissions from and represent violations of the georgia sip and the terms of plant wansley title v permit.
in the district court,georgia power did not dispute the coms data and thus the fact that these exceedances occurred is not at issue.instead,georgia power contends that these exceedances were not clean air act violations because all exceedances occurred during periods of startup,shutdown,or malfunction ssm.the permit and the georgia rules each include an ssm provision that,according to georgia power,allows plant wansley to exceed the opacity limit during ssm.thus,we turn to the ssm rule and the plant ssm condition in plant wansley title v permit.
a.the georgia ssm rule 
georgia ssm rule was adopted as part of the georgia sip in and approved by the epa in since,the georgia ssm rule has not been revised and has been a continuous part of the georgia sip.
the georgia ssm rule expressly addresses exceedances that occur during ssm.according to the georgia ssm rule,e xcess emissions resulting from startup,shutdown,or malfunction of any source which occur though ordinary diligence is employed shall be allowed so long as the best operational practices to reduce emissions were used pollution control equipment was operated properly and the duration of excess emissions was minimized.comp.regs.a i emphasis added 
b.the ssm condition in plant wansley permit 
plant wansley title v permit,which became effective on january,also contains an ssm provision.although the ssm condition in plant wansley permit is derived from the ssm rule,the ssm condition is phrased slightly differently 
the ssm condition in plant wansley title v permit states that t he division,georgia epd may allow excess emissions in certain cases as described below.permit condition emphasis added.the permit then repeats the relevant language from the georgia ssm rule,stating that e xcess emissions resulting from startup,shutdown,or malfunction of any source which occur though ordinary diligence is employed shall be allowed provided that the best operational practices to reduce emissions were used pollution control equipment was operated properly and the duration of excess emissions was minimized.permit condition.a emphasis added 
district court order 
the district court concluded that even if the exceedances at plant wansley occurred during ssm,this fact offers georgia power no defense against sierra club lawsuit.sierra club georgia power,d.georgia power conceded that the exceedances took place,and therefore the district court ssm decision led the court to grant partial summary judgment in sierra club favor.id.at.because the district court found categorically that georgia power could not raise an ssm defense,the district court did not evaluate whether any or all of the alleged exceedances occurred during ssm 
the district court opinion focused on the ssm condition in the plant wansley permit,and in particular on its opening language stating that the epd may allow excess emissions in certain cases as described below.id.at.in the district court view,the condition plain language limits it to what epd may allow in certain cases.id.in other words,the district court accepted sierra club position that because the ssm condition refers explicitly to the epd and not to citizen enforcers,it does not offer georgia power a defense where the allegations of opacity violations are raised in a citizen enforcement action.
upon motion by georgia power,the district court certified its liability ruling for interlocutory appeal.see b.we subsequently granted georgia power petition for leave to appeal the partial summary judgment order.id.
iii.discussion 
as quoted earlier,georgia ssm rule,approved by the epa,states that ssm violations shall be allowed provided three conditions are met.comp.regs.a i.the ssm rule is categorical and unambiguous.the ssm rule does not limit the ssm defense to actions initiated by the epd,but simply provides a potential defense to alleged violations where the emissions exceedances at issue occur during ssm.quite clearly,the ssm rule applies to any enforcement action,whether initiated by the epd or,as in this litigation,by a private citizen.
despite the straightforward language in georgia ssm rule,sierra club contends that georgia power nonetheless can not invoke the ssm rule as a defense in this action.we address each of sierra club arguments and why the district court erred in adopting sierra club position.
epa current ssm policy does not revoke georgia ssm rule 
sierra club first argument is that georgia power may not invoke georgia ssm rule as a defense because georgia ssm rule provides a broader ssm defense than now allowed by the epa.the district court agreed,giving particular weight to the epa guidance policy on ssm provisions.sierra club georgia power,d at.
the epa guidance provides that sips may include only very narrow affirmative defenses for ssm exceedances and may not automatically exempt ssm emissions from enforcement.state implementation plans policy regarding excess emissions during malfunctions,startup,and shutdown,memorandum from steven herman,assistant adm r for enforcement and compliance assurance,to reg l adm rs,the guidance.it is clear that georgia ssm rule creates a broader ssm defense than that described in the guidance even so,sierra club reliance on the epa guidance is misplaced.
the first reason sierra club argument fails is that its position is utterly at odds with the epa clarification of its ssm policy.see memorandum from eric schaeffer,office of regulatory enforcement,to reg l adm rs,the clarification.the clarification explains that the epa guidance was not intended to alter the status of any existing ssm provision in a sip that has been approved by epa.similarly,the guidance was not intended to affect existing permit terms or conditions regarding ssm that reflect approved sip provisions,including opacity provisions.id.at.by the clear terms of the clarification,even assuming that the epa is now opposed to ssm defenses as broad as georgia ssm rule,the epa policy was only meant to apply prospectively,in the context of future rulemaking actions.id.at.
for this reason,the sixth circuit decision on which the district court heavily relied.dep t of envtl.quality browner,cir,is largely irrelevant.in that case,michigan sought epa approval for a sip revision,one that included a new ssm provision.id.at.although the epa rejected michigan ssm provision,it did so during the sip approval process,in the context of future rulemaking.see id.at clarification at.in contrast,georgia ssm rule has been in place since,and the approval of plant wansley title v permit did not in any way alter the general ssm provision in the georgia sip 
second,even if the epa had intended its ssm policy to alter the meaning of georgia existing ssm rule and similar provisions in other states sips,the epa would have been powerless to effect such a change absent formal sip revision.georgia ssm rule is a part of the georgia sip adopted by georgia and approved by the epa through the formal rulemaking process prescribed in the clean air act.see a.in contrast,the epa guidance concerning ssm provisions is not a regulation and is not due the same level of deference as formally adopted rules.united states mead,d.epa policy guidance can not trump the ssm rule adopted by georgia and approved formally by the epa.
if the epa believes that its current interpretation of the clean air act requires georgia to modify its ssm rule,the epa should require the state to revise its sip to conform to epa policy.see k outlining the sip call procedure under which epa may notify a state of sip inadequacies and require the state to submit a revised plan.because the epa has not done so,georgia ssm rule remains in effect regardless of the epa currently espoused policy.see n any provision of any applicable implementation plan that was approved or promulgated before november,shall remain in effect as part of such applicable implementation plan,except to the extent that a revision to such provision is approved or promulgated by the epa administrator pursuant to this chapter.
accordingly,considered without reference to plant wansley title v permit,the ssm rule of applicability clearly offers georgia power an affirmative defense to sierra club enforcement action,which georgia power may attempt to prove because plant wansley permit and the ssm condition therein did not become effective until january,at the very least the district court erred in precluding georgia power from raising an ssm defense to the violations alleged before that date.
plant wansley permit simply restates the ssm rule 
given that georgia ssm rule clearly allows georgia power to raise an ssm affirmative defense,sierra club alternatively focuses not on georgia ssm rule,but rather on the ssm condition in plant wansley title v permit.sierra club argues that the permit language,which differs slightly from the wording of georgia ssm rule,does not allow georgia power to raise the ssm defense.
sierra club emphasizes that although the ssm condition restates the ssm rule by providing that ssm exce
