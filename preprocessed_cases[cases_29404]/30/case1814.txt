sustainability of parks,recycling and wildlife legal defense fund sprawldef appeals following its unsuccessful attempt to secure an administrative hearing before the county of solano department of resource management the department in order to challenge proposed revisions to a solid waste facility permit for the potrero hills landfill.after the department denied sprawldef request for a hearing,sprawldef filed a petition for a writ of mandate to compel the department to hold the hearing under public resources code section sprawldef appeals from the trial court denial of the petition.
we hold that under section sprawldef was entitled to an administrative hearing.we therefore reverse the court order denying the writ petition.
background 
applicable procedures under the solid waste management act 
division,known as the waste management act act,was added to the public resources code in.stats,ch,valley vista services,city of monterey park th,d.the act is designed to protect the environment,improve regulation of existing landfills,ensure that new landfills are environmentally sound,improve permitting procedures for solid waste management facilities,and specify the responsibilities of local governments to develop and implement integrated waste management plans.id.at,d.
under the act,any person seeking to operate a solid waste facility must obtain a permit from an authorized local enforcement agency,tit.a permitted operator of a solid waste facility who wishes to make a significant change in the design or operation of its facility in a manner not authorized by its permit must apply to the local enforcement agency for a revised permit.the enforcement agency may only issue the permit if it finds that the proposed solid waste facilities permit is consistent with this division and any regulations adopted by the california integrated waste management board pursuant to this division applicable to solid waste facilities,subd.b.
the local enforcement agency lea is required to provide the california integrated waste management board the state board with a copy of the proposed permit at least days before it issues or revises it,and must decide whether it will issue the permit within days from receipt of the operator completed application.
within days of its receipt of the proposed permit from the lea,the state board must either concur or object to its issuance or revision,subd.a.subject to exceptions not applicable here,the state board is deemed to have concurred in a proposed permit if it fails to act within days after it receives the application,subds.a,a.
section requires the lea to hold hearings in certain circumstances when requested by permit applicants or members of the public.it states from the date of issuance of a permit that imposes conditions that are inappropriate,as contended by the applicant,or after the taking of any enforcement action pursuant to part by the enforcement agency,the enforcement agency shall hold a hearing,if requested to do so,by the person subject to the action.the enforcement agency shall also hold a hearing upon a petition to the enforcement agency from any person requesting the enforcement agency to review an alleged failure of the agency to act as required by law or regulation.a hearing shall be held in accordance with the procedure specified in section.
section,subdivision a specifies that t he hearing shall be initiated by the filing of a written request for a hearing with a statement of the issues.
b.the potrero hills permit 
potrero hills landfill,potrero hills operates its landfill in solano county.the department is the county designated lea.in october,potrero hills applied for a revised solid waste facility permit in order to extend its hours of operation and increase the daily tonnage it could accept for disposal.the department submitted the proposed permit to the state board on november.
on december,sprawldef petitioned the department under section for a hearing on the potrero hills permit due to the department alleged failure to act as required by law or regulation.the petition specifically identified the following issues.the lea failed to reject or condition the landfill permit application due to repeated violations of state minimum operating standards relating to consistent and unabated litter from landfill operations which has significant aesthetic impact as well as impact on the surrounding marshlands and grassland ecology,and the natural life of the marshlands and grasslands.the lea failed to reject or condition the landfill permit application due to defective leachate discharge operations at the landfill,including but not limited to the destruction of pumps and outflow systems by the weight of landfill tonnage.the lea failed to reject or condition the landfill permit to prevent or limit the impact of noise and lighting from both the landfill operations and trucking to the landfill which would detrimentally impact the habitat and viability of marshland species.the lea failed to reject or condition the landfill permit application on the basis that it misstated,improperly counted,or otherwise misrepresented materials counted as alternative daily cover,recycling or beneficial use,in violation of state regulations,statutes or policies.the proposed permitted level of tonnage accepted for disposal is therefore inaccurate and fails to properly state the expected landfilled tonnages into the facility.the lea failed to reject or condition the landfill permit application for failing to properly provide and describe slopes stability standards and construction.the lea failed to reject or condition the landfill permit application for failing to address the inconsistency of tipping fees in effect at potrero hills,among the lowest in northern california,with the landfill diversion goals of the solano county integrated waste management plan coiwmp and the goals of coiwmps of other counties such as contra costa,alameda,santa clara,san mateo,san francisco,marin,sonoma,mendocino,lake,and napa,which rely for financing on recycling surcharges or fees or business taxes and consequently suffer loss of public funds and ability to attain the goals of the california integrated waste management act.
the department rejected the request.in its december,letter to sprawldef,the department explained that section does not authorize such an administrative challenge to a proposed solid waste facility permit therefore,sprawldef petition is improper and no administrative hearing will be scheduled.the legislative history of the statute shows that the intent,in pertinent part,of the amendment adding the administrative hearing provision was to allow an applicant to request a hearing if the enforcement agency denies the permit or if the applicant determines that the terms and conditions imposed by the permit are inappropriate to revise provisions pertaining to the denial,suspension,or revocation of permits,and to revise and recast provisions pertaining to corrective action and cease and desist orders the department also maintained that sprawldef did not allege a failure to act as required by law or regulation as contemplated by section,and that the public,including sprawldef,has had ample opportunity to participate in the administrative process and object or otherwise comment on the proposed permit conditions at the various public hearings in front of the lea and the ciwmb.
the state board held hearings on the potrero hills application on december and december.three members voted in favor,one voted against,and one abstained.but the hearing resulted in no action because a concurrence or an objection requires four votes.accordingly,the state board was deemed to have concurred in the revised permit as a matter of law on december,subds.a.
sprawldef filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court to challenge the department refusal to hold the requested hearing.it sought four categories of relief a peremptory writ of mandamus to set aside and void any approvals of the permit and to order the county to comply with all provisions of the california public resources code and all other applicable laws prior to approval of the proposed permit a declaration that section is applicable and the department refusal to hold a hearing was improper an order immediately staying any operation of the landfill under the revised permit and injunctive relief as necessary to remediate any physical,legal or financial actions undertaken pursuant to the revised permit 
the department demurred to the petition on the ground that sprawldef did not name potrero hills as a respondent or real party in interest,and could not remedy this failure to join an indispensable party because the statute of limitations had run.the court tentative ruling was to sustain the demurrer.at the hearing on the demurrer,counsel for sprawldef offered to amend the prayer for relief in such a way as to completely remove the harm to the landfill on which the court bases its finding of indispensability.counsel then orally amended the petition to eliminate the claims for a stay and for injunctive and declaratory relief.in light of those amendments,the court overruled the demurrer.
after additional briefing and another hearing,the court agreed with the department view that section did not require the department to hold the hearing sought by sprawldef and denied the petition for writ of mandate.this appeal timely followed.
discussion 
sprawldef contends the department as the lea had a ministerial duty to honor sprawldef request and convene an administrative hearing under section.the department maintains that section authorizes only operators,not third parties,to petition for a hearing relating to the propriety of permit conditions.we conclude that sprawldef interpretation of the statutory right to a hearing is correct.we also reject the department threshold contention that the amended petition fails to state a claim for relief.
standard of review 
in reviewing the trial court ruling on a writ of mandate citation,the appellate court is ordinarily confined to an inquiry as to whether the findings and judgment of the trial court are supported by substantial evidence.citation.however,the appellate court may make its own determination when the case involves resolution of questions of law where the facts are undisputed.saathoff city of san diego th,d.this case presents a purely legal question the interpretation of section.
b.the petition,as amended,states a claim for relief 
the department argues that sprawldef oral amendments to the petition eliminated all of its claims for relief,thereby rendering the petition a legal and practical nullity and providing an additional ground for the trial court denial.we disagree.the petition sought four categories of substantive relief a writ of mandate to set aside and void the revised permit and order the department to comply with all applicable law before approving the application declaratory relief a stay order and injunctive relief to correct any actions taken by potrero hills under the revised permit.the following colloquy took place at the demurrer hearing the court well,first of all,i going to tell you what i going to do.if you willing to come off your plaintiff stay,the injunctive relief and declaratory relief claims,i lean towards overruling the demurrer.counsel for sprawldef i submit,then,your honor.the court all right.then the demurrer will be overruled based upon your dropping any claims for a stay or injunctive or declaratory relief.
counsel for the department continued to seek dismissal because potrero hills would be prejudiced even under the petition as so amended.the court disagreed.it said well,i can go ahead with out an indispensable party so long as it does cause any prejudice.and the fact that he willing to drop the plaintiff declaratory relief or the stay takes away the prejudice.
here,the department does not explicitly contend the court erred when it overruled the demurrer.its contention,rather,is less direct.first,it asserts without supporting legal authority that sprawldef prayer for a writ of mandamus was orally stricken from the petition along with the prayer for injunctive relief because s etting aside and voiding a permit that has been issued to potrero hills would constitute a form of injunctive relief directed at the operations of the landfill.not so.sprawldef voluntarily dropped its prayers for declaratory relief,injunction,and a stay in response to the court concerns.however,it did not drop or strike its separately stated request for a writ of mandamus nor did the court order that aspect of the prayer stricken.the record is quite clear that the prayer for a writ of mandate survived sprawldef oral amendments.
second,the department argues the amended petition fails to afford any real remedy because the landfill operator can not be joined as a party and the amended petition can not be construed to require any action that would prejudice the nonjoined indispensable party.the department point is not entirely clear,but it appears to mean the action can not proceed because doing so might result in prejudice to potrero hills.if so,the department misapprehends the law.failure to join an indispensable party is not a jurisdictional defect in the fundamental sense even in the absence of an indispensable party,the court still has the power to render a decision as to the parties before it which will stand.it is for reasons of equity and convenience,and not because it is without power to proceed,that the court should not proceed with a case where it determines that an indispensable party is absent and can not be joined.sierra club,california coastal com.d.in making the discretionary decision whether to permit such an action to proceed,the trial court must consider,inter alia,to what extent a judgment might be prejudicial to the absent party the extent to which the prejudice can be lessened or avoided,whether a judgment rendered in the party absence will be adequate,and whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.code civ,subd.b,italics added.code of civil procedure section thus envisions a circumstance where the possibility of some prejudice to an absent party does not mandate dismissal or,as the department suggests,preclude the court from ordering relief as between properly joined parties.
out of concern that any relief ordered in this case could prejudice potrero hills,we invited the parties to submit supplemental briefing.we asked them to address whether sprawldef failure to sue potrero hills or name it as a real party in interest and thereby provide it with notice of this suit constituted a violation of potrero hills due process rights and,if so,whether the due process violation independently compels affirmance of the trial court ruling.we now conclude that since the agency decision to deny sprawldef a hearing was a ministerial determination,any relief ordered in this case will not implicate potrero hills procedural due process rights 
while procedural due process requires reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard before the government may deprive a person of a significant property interest,only governmental decisions that are adjudicative in nature trigger procedural due process concerns.horn county of ventura cal d,calvert county of yuba th,d.in contrast,ministerial actions by government are generally not governed by these principles,because they are essentially automatic based on whether certain fixed standards and objective measurements have been met.calvert,supra,at,d rodriguez solis th,d.where a statute requires an officer to do a prescribed act upon a prescribed contingency,his functions are ministerial.where a statute or ordinance clearly defines the specific duties or course of conduct that a governing body must take,that course of conduct becomes mandatory and eliminates any element of discretion.rodriguez,supra,at,d.here,the department obligation to hold a hearing upon receipt of a petition challenging its alleged failure to act as required by law or regulation plainly falls within that category of governmental actions.
nor are we persuaded by the department assertion that the amended petition is a nullity because the landfill operator would not be bound by any order made by the court in its absence and could colla
