the american road and transportation builders association is a trade organization representing the transportation construction industry companies that build roads,public transit systems,airports and the like.in artba,as the group calls itself,petitioned the environmental protection agency to amend two regulations implementing e of the clean air act codified at e.epa had originally promulgated the provisions at and pt,subpt.a,app,july,june,and then readopted them in,december.after a bit of litigation over the agency failure to act on artba petition,epa formally opened it to public comment in,may,then rejected it in,october.shortly thereafter,artba sought review in this court.we now dismiss that suit for lack of jurisdiction,on the grounds that national mining association department of the interior,requires us to treat artba petition to epa as a challenge to the regulations it sought revised,and that judicial review of such a challenge is under clean air act b,b.
clean air act e prohibits states from imposing certain regulations on various categories of engines and vehicles.artba takes the position that epa rules interpreting e have the effect of allowing states to adopt precisely the kinds of regulations that the statute because the rules are insufficiently comprehensive,and partly because some of their content is inconsistent with the statutory language.so,for example,artba asked epa to amend one of its regulations,to make clear that among the laws preempted are fleet average standards,which prescribe emissions limits for an operator suite of vehicles in the aggregate.see engine mfrs.ass south coast air quality mgmt,d.the request that epa revise pt,subpt.a,app.a,by contrast,reflected artba view that that provision affirmatively deems permissible state regulations that the statute,properly construed,prohibits.in response to artba petition,epa offered a lengthy analysis disputing that further specificity was warranted where artba sought it,and defending the interpretations that artba argued were wrong.
in opposition to the present action,the agency suggests two reasons why our jurisdiction does not extend to artba suit.one is the issue mentioned above the other is a contention that artba can not establish constitutional standing.
article iii of the constitution requires artba,of course,to allege an injury that is fairly traceable to the agency conduct and redressable by this court.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.in epa view,artba has failed to do so with respect to each of the numerous putative harms it identifies,including among others injuries arising from state air quality remediation plans requiring epa approval.see clean air act a e i,a e i.this court decision in louisiana environmental action network browner,lean,the government claims,squarely defeats artba standing argument to the extent it hinges on injury attributable to any state regulation that epa must approve.respondent br.at.
the government drastically overreads lean.there several petitioners challenged an epa rule establishing procedures for deciding whether to approve state implementation plans under the clean air act.at.one complaint was that the rules might allow epa to approve a state regulation,and enforce it as a federal one,even though it was more stringent than any regulation the epa could have implemented on its own.id.at.the party seeking relief,however,identified no mind a state in which one of the relevant petitioners has adopted any more stringent rule which is or is about to be federalized by the epa.id.at.regarding the harms alleged as hypothetical,we found a want of standing.id.
thus lean is simply an application of the conventional understanding that highly speculative concerns do not satisfy article iii requirement it is not a holding that the injuries threatened by epa rules governing future assessment of proposed state implementation plans are per se unduly remote.the canonical actual or imminent threat of injury remains,of course,perfectly sufficient for standing purposes.see lujan,at.summers earth island,d.
artba,for its part,has pointed to no fewer than four state regulatory regimes that,it alleges,currently subject its members to burdensome laws that are not permitted under the clean air act,and that either have been approved by epa or are to be submitted for its approval.petitioner br.at.if the federal rules artba sought to have revised really do allow such state regulations,then the harms artba members are currently suffering as a result of state would plausibly suffer as a result of future epa sufficiently attributable to those federal rules to satisfy the fairly traceable prong of the standing inquiry.see animal legal defense fund,glickman,en banc.and in the event that we agreed with artba substantive views,we could order epa to reconsider its decision to stand pat on its existing rules.this is the remedy we typically afford meritorious petitions seeking review of agency decisions not to initiate rulemakings,and we have obviously never regarded such relief too speculative to satisfy constitutional standing requirements.see,massachusetts epa,d american horse protection ass lyng.standing,in short,is not artba problem.
what dooms the organization petition in this forum instead is subject matter jurisdiction.the section of the clean air act that simultaneously authorizes and limits judicial review of epa activity provides in relevant part 
a petition for review of any nationally applicable regulations promulgated,or final action taken,by the administrator under this chapter may be filed only in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia any petition for review under this subsection shall be filed within sixty days from the date notice of such promulgation or action appears in the federal register,except that if such petition is based solely on grounds arising after such sixtieth day,then any petition for review under this subsection shall be filed within sixty days after such grounds arise.
clean air act b,b.artba filed suit in this court within days of epa decision rejecting the organization petition for rules amendments.the question is whether that agency action opened a new filing if instead we are obliged to treat a petition to revise regulations as a challenge to their promulgation,with the result that the relevant chronological analysis runs from that earlier date.
the general rule is that it is a perfectly valid method of obtaining judicial review of agency regulations once the limitations period has run to petition the agency for amendment or rescission of the regulations and then to appeal the agency decision.nlrb union flra.one twist is that not all types of petitions for rulemakings are treated equally.if the request for new rules is predicated on an alleged procedural defect in the promulgation of the existing rules,then we view the petition as a direct challenge to the original will be if it falls outside the period in which judicial review of the promulgation is permitted.natural resources defense council nrc.on the other hand,agency denial of a petition for a new rulemaking which complains of substantive infirmities in existing rules is,for the most part,judicially reviewable irrespective of time limits dating from the rules enactment.professional drivers council bureau of motor carrier safety,this court has scrutinized regulations immune from direct review by reviewing the denial of a subsequent rulemaking petition which challenged the regulation on demonstrable grounds of substantive invalidity.emphasis in original,internal quotation marks omitted nlrb union,at a petitioner contention that a regulation should be amended or rescinded because it conflicts with the statute from which its authority derives is reviewable outside of a statutory limitations period.emphasis in original functional music,fcc.
we have subjected that general rule,however,to an exception.national mining association identified a circumstance in which an agency denial of a petition does not allow review of alleged substantive defects in the original rule,even under the deferential standards applicable to review of such denials,outside the sta
