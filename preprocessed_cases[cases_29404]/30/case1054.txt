we must decide whether the united states forest service issuance of a permit to operate a bison capture facility in montana violated the endangered species act or the national environmental policy act.
on the precipice of extinction in the early twentieth century,the yellowstone bison herd has been pulled back from the brink by careful management yet the annual migration of bison out of yellowstone national park western boundary poses risks to the health of nearby livestock in montana.see fund for animals,lujan.the bison may carry brucellosis,a bacterial organism that causes female bison to abort fetuses.id.at.brucellosis causes sterility and abortions in livestock and undulant fever in humans.id.there is no vaccine or cure for brucellosis,and more than billion has been spent on eradication efforts nationwide.id.more than percent of the yellowstone herd tested positive for brucellosis in.id.
after a,effort,montana eradicated brucellosis in.id.because the state is,it may ship livestock out of state without testing,saving to million per year.id.montana requires that all untested bison that enter the state be destroyed if they pose a transmission risk.
in order to protect montana status while maintaining a wild,population of bison and minimizing destruction,the montana department of livestock mdol,other state agencies,and the national park service,the united states forest service forest service,and other federal agencies,together formulated an interim bison management plan the bison plan in the bison plan provides for monitoring,brucellosis testing,removing infected and exposed bison,and the hazing,bison back into yellowstone.hazing can be done in a variety of ways on foot,on horseback,on snowmobiles,on vehicles,on motorcycles,in helicopters it also sometimes involves the shooting of cracker shells to induce the bison to move.
as part of its effort to comply with the bison plan,the mdol applied in for a special use permit the permit from the forest service to operate a facility in the gallatin national forest,just outside yellowstone western boundary,in an area north of the madison arm of hebgen lake known as the horse butte area.the facility,called the horse butte bison capture facility,is a temporary structure,consisting of several holding pens and work areas.although the primary facility measures approximately by feet,the entire facility occupies one to two acres of land.the permit authorized the mdol to operate the capture facility from november to april.
before issuing the permit,the forest service prepared a biological assessment ba in accordance with its obligations under the endangered species act esa.see c.that document assessed what it deemed the cumulative effects area for the proposed capture facility approximately square miles of public and private lands contained within the boundary north of the madison arm of hebgen lake and the madison river,east of hebgen lake,south of the grayling arm of hebgen lake and cougar creek,and west of y ellowstone n ational p ark generally described as the horse area.
within this area are three bald eagle nests,denominated horse butte,ridge,and narrows.bald eagles are considered threatened for purposes of the esa.see.under the montana bald eagle management plan and the greater yellowstone bald eagle management plan,areas within a mile and a mile radius of active and alternative nests are known respectively as zone i and zone ii.the eagle management plans restrict human activity in these zones.
because the preferred site for the proposed capture facility was within zone ii of the horse butte nest,the ba particularly examined the possible effects of the facility operation on that nest.the forest service ultimately concluded that the cumulative effects of existing human activities,the use of snowmobiles for recreation and hazing,and the operation of the facility necessitated a finding that the facility may to adversely effect bald eagles in the horse area.
acting under its obligation to consult formally with the united states fish and wildlife service usfws,the forest service transmitted the ba to the usfws on november.see a.the forest service then issued an environmental assessment ea of the effects of the proposed permit on december.the forest service again concluded,in its ea,that the horse butte nest site might be affected by increased levels of human activity resulting from the capture facility operation.
the usfws in turn issued a biological opinion biop on december.in the biop,the usfws determined that the capture facility was not likely to jeopardize the pacific region bald eagle population.but the usfws agreed with the forest service that some eagles may be adversely affect ed.as part of the biop,therefore,the usfws issued an incidental take statement the statement.the statement anticipated that the capture facility operation might lead to the reproductive failure of the horse butte nest and thus involve a take of threatened bald eagles under of the esa.see a b making it unlawful for any person to take any such listed species within the united states.under the esa,a take committed pursuant to an incidental take statement is not considered a prohibited taking.see o.as a term and condition of the statement,the usfws specifically incorporated bison hazing requirements appended to the ea and repeated earlier in the biop.
these restrictions banned helicopter hazing in zones i and ii from february to august.shooting was also prohibited in zone i.during snowmobile season,hazing activities in zone i were allowed only on designated trails,south of forest road,and by permission of the local gallatin forest ranger district.and trail hazing by snowmobile and horseback was permitted in zone ii,although it was to be kept to a minimum.atvs,motorcycles,and shooting were permitted only along forest road and the lookout road.outside of zones i and ii,helicopter hazing was prohibited in the horse butte area.
the forest service issued a decision notice and a finding of no significant impact fonsi on january,and awarded the permit to the mdol on march.
convinced that the bison hazing restrictions were being violated by the mdol,cold mountain,cold rivers,a nonprofit environmental and human rights organization based in missoula,montana,joined by the buffalo field campaign and the ecology center,collectively cold mountain,sent a notice of intent to sue for violations of the esa to state and federal officials on april,the forest service investigated cold mountain allegations of hazing violations,but determined that they were unfounded.
cold mountain then sued the mdol,the forest service,the national park service,and various federal officers in united states district court for the district of montana in may.cold mountain complaint alleged that the state and federal defendants had consistently violated the terms of the permit and the statement,resulting in a take of protected bald eagles under of the esa.the complaint also faulted the federal defendants for not conducting adequate environmental analysis under the national environmental policy act nepa,and alleged violations of the migratory bird treaty act mbta,the administrative procedures act apa itself,the national forest management act nfma,and the permit.cold mountain asked the district court to declare that the relevant statutes had been violated to void the permit to enjoin the operation of the capture facility to require the federal agencies to conduct analysis under the esa and nepa or,alternatively,to enforce the terms of the biop and to prohibit helicopter hazing in the horse butte area.
the district court granted summary judgment for the state and federal defendants on march.specifically,the district court concluded that no prohibited take of bald eagles had been established.the court also agreed with the forest service conclusion that the restrictions on helicopter hazing had not been violated.the court determined that the forest service ea was adequate,that the service decision not to prepare an environmental impact statement was reasonable,and that nepa was therefore not violated.the court granted summary judgment to the mdol on sovereign immunity gro
