the petitioners,husqvarna ab et husqvarna,seek review of the phase emission standards for new nonroad handheld engines promulgated by the respondent,the environmental protection agency epa,under the authority of section of the clean air act caa.husqvarna contends that the final rule is arbitrary and capricious because the epa failed to select the emission standards that represent the best balance of the factors identified in caa section.it also maintains that the regulatory alternative chosen by the epa is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.finally,husqvarna alleges procedural error stemming from inadequate notice and opportunity to comment.because each of these arguments lacks merit,we deny husqvarna petition.
background 
in the congress amended the caa and added section,which authorizes the epa to set emissions standards for nonroad engines and vehicles,stat.section required the epa to adopt emission standards by and to revise them as appropriate thereafter.the epa missed the statutory deadline and a lawsuit to enforce the statute was filed,which has resulted in the district court monitoring of the epa compliance.see sierra club whitman,civ.filed.
in establishing emission standards,the epa created two categories of small si engines nonhandheld and handheld the epa further divided handheld engines into three iii,iv and on engine size,with class iii encompassing the smallest and class v the largest handheld engines.the domestic handheld engine industry includes manufacturers,including husqvarna,stihl,john deere,shindaiwa,kawasaski,echo,ryobi and honda,which manufacture a total of engine families these manufacturers primarily use engines in handheld products because of their high ratios and low cost.a engine is an internal combustion engine that accomplishes the operations of intake,compression,expansion and exhaust in two piston strokes rather than four.
the epa has regulated emissions from handheld engines in two phases.see.in phase,the epa proposed new engine standards based in part on standards california had adopted for similar engines.in january the epa proposed phase emission standards for handheld engines that were slightly more stringent than those in phase.the proposed phase standards were expected to reduce hydrocarbons hc and oxides of nitrogen nox emissions by per cent beyond phase standards by the year.the proposal called for a reduction in emissions for class iii,iv and v engines to,and grams per respectively.in response to the proposal,the epa received input from manufacturers indicating that lower emission levels were feasible.see,and in late a portion of the handheld engine industry suggested that it would support final x standards of for classes iii and iv and for class v.
on december,john deere consumer products,deere,which appeared as an intervenor before this court,recommended that the epa consider stricter phase standards in light of its recent development of compression wave technology cwt,which promised to significantly reduce emissions from handheld engines.cwt uses compressed air to improve fuel injection in the combustion chamber of a engine,resulting in almost all of the fuel being combusted.deere stated that cwt was adaptable to all sizes of engines and could meet a x standard in.
on july,the epa published a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking supplemental proposal,which proposed emission limits of for classes iii and iv with between and and an emission limit of for class v with between and.july.in addition to cwt,the supplemental proposal identified three other scavenging miniature and that could be utilized by manufacturers to meet the phase standards.the supplemental proposal also contained an averaging,banking and trading abt program to give handheld engine manufacturers flexibility in meeting the more stringent phase standards.under the proposed program,manufacturers would declare a family emission limit fel for each engine family.see supra note.manufacturers need only ensure that average emissions from all of their engine families meet the emission standards for the given model year.they could also generate bankable emission credits based on the differences between the fel and the phase standards for the applicable model year.
many manufacturers,including husqvarna,commented on the supplemental proposal.the public comment period closed on september,although the epa agreed to consider additional comments filed within days therefrom.it also continued to meet with interested manufacturers after the close of the comment period.the final phase emission standards for handheld si engines were published on april.in the final rule,the epa adopted the x emission standards proposed in the supplemental proposal,but with an implementation schedule of four years instead of the five as proposed.the decision rested on the epa determination that rapid technological advances in the handheld engine industry warranted a more expeditious implementation.while noting that not all of the technologies have yet been demonstrated in production engines operated under typical conditions,the epa identified the following technologies as likely to meet the newly adopted standards class iii cwt efficiency catalyst stratified scavenging with lean combustion efficiency catalyst,class iv cwt cwt low efficiency catalyst stratified scavenging with lean combustion medium efficiency catalyst and class v cwt stratified scavenging with lean combustion.the epa explained that changes in equipment design could allay safety concerns about the use of catalysts.it also determined that the phase standards were.finally,the epa revised the abt program to avoid a delay in the shift to cleaner engines.husqvarna challenges all of these parts of the final rule.
ii.analysis 
our analysis is guided by the deference traditionally given to agency expertise,particularly when dealing with a statutory scheme as unwieldy and as the clean air act.appalachian power epa,see baltimore gas nrdc,d reviewing court must be at its most deferential when agency is making predictions,within its area of special expertise,at the frontiers of science.under section d of the caa,we reverse agency action found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.d a.questions of statutory interpretation are governed by the familiar test set forth in chevron,nrdc,d.the court first asks whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,in which case it must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the court moves to the second step and defers to the agency interpretation as long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.we will strike down the rulemaking for procedural error only if the errors were so serious and related to matters of such central relevance to the rule that there is a substantial likelihood that the rule would have been significantly changed if such errors had not been made.caa d d.
in challenging the epa handheld engine phase emission standards,husqvarna raises three claims.first,it asserts that the epa choice of the emission standards contravenes the best balance requirement of caa section.second,it maintains that the final rule is arbitrary and capricious because it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.finally,it argues that the epa failed to comply with the procedural requirements of caa section d.
caa section 
section a of the caa requires the epa to promulgate standards that shall achieve the greatest degree of emission reduction achievable through the application of technology which the administrator determines will be available for the engines or vehicles to which such standards apply,giving appropriate consideration to the cost of applying such technology within the period of time available to manufacturers and to noise,energy,and safety factors associated with the application of such technology.a.husqvarna maintains that the emission standards do not represent the best balance of these factors for the i
