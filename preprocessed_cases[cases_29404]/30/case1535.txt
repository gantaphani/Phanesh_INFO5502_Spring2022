in these consolidated cases,we consider challenges to the environmental protection agency national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter and ozone.petitioners originally raised a broad range of issues,including the constitutionality of the clean air act,the contours of epa authority to promulgate air quality standards,and the lawfulness of the challenged standards.we addressed many of these issues in an earlier ruling that the supreme court subsequently reversed in part and affirmed in part.on remand,only petitioners specific challenges to the air quality standards remain unresolved.rejecting the argument that the language and reasoning of our earlier decision determine the outcome of these remaining claims,and finding the challenged air quality standards neither arbitrary nor capricious,we deny the petitions for review except to the extent the supreme court and our earlier decisions require further action by epa.

these consolidated cases concern naaqs for particulate matter and ozone,two ubiquitous atmospheric pollutants.the term particulate matter,or pm,refers to all solid particles and liquid droplets found in air.office of air radiation,envtl.prot.agency,air quality index a guide to air quality and your health epa,air quality index.although these particles and droplets come in varying sizes,only particulate matter less than micrometers in fine pm or is relevant here.as originally filed,these cases also concerned coarse particulate matter,or particles and droplets between and micrometers in diameter,but we resolved all issues relating to this coarse particulate matter in our earlier ruling.see am.trucking ass ns epa,ata i,reh g granted in part and denied in part,ata ii,aff in part and rev in part,whitman am.trucking ass ns,d whitman.

on july,epa revised the primary and secondary naaqs for particulate matter and ozone.see particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.ozone naaqs,fed.reg.for particulate matter,the agency abandoned its approach of regulating both coarse and fine particles and droplets under the same standards.observing that the epidemiological evidence suggest s stronger associations of mortality and some morbidity effects with fine particles than with coarse particles,ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter,advance notice of proposed rulemaking,fed.reg,june,advance nprm,the agency adopted new,standards an annual primary standard of micrograms per cubic meter μg a daily primary standard of μ and secondary standards equal to the primary standards.particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at.
epa also made significant changes to the ozone naaqs.citing new information that suggests a positive correlation between prolonged exposures to relatively low levels of ozone and a wide range of health effects,ozone naaqs,fed.reg.at,the agency adopted new primary and secondary standards under which ozone concentrations may not exceed parts per million ppm,in place of the old,standards of ppm,id.at.
soon after epa issued the revised particulate matter and ozone naaqs,various parties,including american trucking associations,other businesses and business associations,environmental groups,citizens,and several states,petitioned for review of the revised standards.other parties intervened some supporting petitioners and others supporting epa,four additional states filed amicus briefs supporting epa,and senator orrin hatch and representative thomas bliley filed amicus briefs supporting petitioners.petitioners and supporting intervenors and amici challenged the naaqs from all sides,arguing among other things that the clean air act delegates excessive legislative authority to epa in violation of article i of the constitution and that the agency failed to consider certain relevant factors,including implementation costs,prior to setting the naaqs.invoking clean air act section d,which directs federal appeals courts to vacate agency action found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,d a,petitioners also challenged specific aspects of the new particulate matter and ozone naaqs the d claims.
we addressed most of these arguments in ata i and ii.with respect to the nondelegation argument,we agreed with senator hatch and representative bliley that neither the act requirement that epa set each primary standard at the level requisite to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety,ata i,at quoting b,nor the agency interpretation of that requirement in the challenged rules,see,identified an intelligible principle limiting epa rulemaking authority,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.but see id.at tatel,dissenting ata ii,at silberman,dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc id.at tatel,same.although we concluded that the clean air act,as interpreted by epa,effected an unconstitutional delegation of congress legislative authority,we struck down neither the act nor the challenged naaqs,choosing instead to remand the standards to the agency to give it an opportunity to identify a determinate standard that would limit its discretion.ata i,at see also ata ii,at.
having remanded the challenged naaqs for other reasons,we never addressed petitioners d claims.we did,however,address petitioners more general claims,holding that epa may not consider either the implementation costs or the indirect environmental consequences of naaqs prior to setting the standards,ata i,at has no obligation to comply with certain requirements of the national environmental policy act,the unfunded mandates reform act,or the regulatory flexibility act before issuing naaqs,id.at citing nepa,c d umra,and rfa,a,b should have considered any beneficial effects of ozone before revising the ozone naaqs,id.at has only limited statutory authority to enforce the new ozone naaqs,id.at see also ata ii,at need not identify the specific biological mechanism by which fine particulate matter affects human health,ata i,at and has no obligation to set secondary naaqs at levels sufficient to eliminate all adverse visibility effects of a pollutant,id.at emphasis added.
the supreme court granted certiorari with respect to four questions whether the clean air act violates the nondelegation doctrine whether epa may consider implementation costs in setting naaqs whether this court had jurisdiction to review the agency interpretation of the clean air act provisions governing implementation of the ozone naaqs and if this court had jurisdiction,whether the agency interpretation of those provisions was permissible.whitman,at.disagreeing with our nondelegation ruling,the supreme court held that the clean air act requirement that epa set air quality standards at the level that is requisite that is,not lower or higher than is protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety,fits comfortably within the scope of agency discretion permitted by court precedent.id.at.writing for the court,justice scalia next confirmed our view that economic considerations may play no part in the promulgation of ambient air quality standards,id.at.quoting lead indus.ass epa,see also ata i,at making the same point,and agreed with ata i that this court had jurisdiction to review epa interpretation of the act provisions governing implementation of the ozone naaqs,whitman,at.turning to the merits of the latter issue,the court found the agency ozone naaqs implementation policy to be unlawful and indicated that after this court final disposition of the parties d claims it is left to the epa to develop a reasonable interpretation of the nonattainment implementation provisions insofar as they apply to revised ozone naaqs.id.at.
the supreme court remanded the cases for us to consider petitioners d challenges to the particulate matter and ozone naaqs.on remand,three sets of petitioners filed additional briefs,two addressing the particulate matter naaqs and one addressing the ozone naaqs.with respect to the particulate matter naaqs,one group of petitioners,led by american trucking associations state and business petitioners,urges us to vacate the naaqs under section d because epa f ailed either to a rticulate and a pply the act requisite to protect standard as elucidated in whitman,state bus.pet rs br.at,or to determine levels at which the public health risk is acceptable,id.at.the second group of petitioners,led by citizens for balanced transportation environmental petitioners,believes that the daily primary standard is too lenient to protect against known adverse health effects of fine particulate matter and that the annual and daily secondary standards are insufficient to reduce visibility impairment.the third set of petitioners,again led by american trucking associations ozone petitioners,challenges the ozone naaqs on grounds similar to those raised by state and business petitioners in their attack on the particulate matter naaqs.
in considering these section d claims,we apply the same highly deferential standard of review that we use under the administrative procedure act,a.see,allied local reg l mfrs.caucus epa,to determine whether the agency rules are arbitrary and capricious,we apply the same standard of review under the clean air act as we do under the administrative procedure act.thus,we presume the validity of agency action as long as a rational basis for it is presented.lead indus.ass n,at.that said,however,we perform a searching and careful inquiry into the underlying facts.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in a similar case involving a challenge to ambient air quality standards,lead industries,we elaborated on this standard of review as follows 
it is not our function to resolve disagreement among the experts or to judge the merits of competing expert views.our task is the limited one of ascertaining that the choices made by the epa administrator were reasonable and supported by the record.that the evidence in the record may also support other conclusions,even those that are inconsistent with the administrator,does not prevent us from concluding that her decisions were rational and supported by the record.
id.at internal citations omitted.
before evaluating the merits of petitioners claims,we must address state,business,and ozone petitioners argument that the language and reasoning of ata i and ata ii govern the outcome of th ese case s.state bus.pet rs br.at.in essence,these petitioners argue that ata i and ata ii signal this court belief that epa failed to apply the clean air act requisite to protect the public health standard in setting the primary naaqs.b.because epa chose not to appeal this purported holding to the supreme court,petitioners reason,the holding has become the law of these cases and constrains our review of all remaining claims.
petitioners base this law of the case argument primarily on our statement in ata ii that although epa petition for rehearing argue d that of the clean air act contains a principle limiting the agency discretion namely,that the naaqs must be set at levels necessary for public health protection neither more nor less stringent than necessary,but requisite epa never identif ied this principle as a limit upon its discretion anywhere in the challenged rules.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in addition,petitioners point to a later passage in ata ii in which we declined to express an opinion upon the sufficiency of the newly identified limiting principle,choosing to wait until after the agency itself has applied the principle in setting a naaqs to determine whether the principle,in practice,fulfills the purposes of the nondelegation doctrine.id.at emphasis added.finally,petitioners cite the following sentences from ata i 
the agency explanations for its decisions amount to assertions that a less stringent standard would allow the relevant pollutant to inflict a greater quantum of harm on public health,and that a more stringent standard would result in less harm.such arguments only support the intuitive proposition that more pollution will not benefit public health,not that keeping pollution at or below any particular level is requisite or not requisite to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety,the formula set out by clean air act section b definition of a primary naaqs.
at.according to petitioners,these passages express our view that epa failed to follow the clean air act in setting the pm and ozone naaqs,and that the naaqs themselves are therefore arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.d a.
petitioners misread ata i and ata ii.both decisions address the broad claim that the clean air act effects an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.to evaluate that claim,we looked first to the act for an intelligible principle limiting the agency application of the factors it uses in determining the degree of public health concern associated with different levels of ozone and pm.ata i,at internal quotation marks omitted.finding none,we next looked to see whether the agency developed binding standards for itself.ata i,at emphasis added.again finding none,we remanded the naaqs to epa to give it an opportunity to extract from the act a determinate standard that would channel its rulemaking authority.id.at,see also ata ii,at affirming that holding.at no point in either ata i or ata ii,however,did we address the narrower question now before us did epa abuse its discretion or otherwise violate the clean air act in setting the challenged naaqs indeed,in ata i we emphasized this very distinction 
the agency cites prior decisions of this court holding that when there is uncertainty about the health effects of concentrations of a particular pollutant within a particular range,epa may use its discretion to make the policy judgment to set the standards at one point within the relevant range rather than another we agree.but none of those panels addressed the claim of undue delegation that we face here,and accordingly had no occasion to ask epa for a principle in making its policy judgment.
at.as this language makes clear,we recognized that the search for a binding principle guiding agency policy judgments differs in kind and degree from the familiar administrative law inquiry into whether an agency abused its discretion.when we stated that epa failed to appl y its newly identified limiting principle in setting the naaqs,therefore,we spoke in constitutional terms in our view,epa never agreed that it could not or in a later rulemaking would not promulgate a naaqs either more or less stringent than necessary.ata ii,at emphasis removed.we in no way implied,however,that the particulate matter and ozone naaqs themselves are either more or less stringent than necessary.
in short,ata i and ata ii address only whether the act or epa reading of the act adequately limits the agency discretion.here,we ask whether epa reasonably exercised that entirely different question that we now answer differently.
we start with petitioners challenge to the naaqs.fulfilling our obligation to undertake a substantial inquiry into the facts underlying challenged agency actions,lead indus.ass n,at quoting citizens to preserve overton park volpe,d,overruled on other grounds by califano sanders,d,we first summarize the agency rulemaking process with respect to both the primary and secondary naaqs and then consider state,business,and environmental petitioners specific arguments.
the rulemaking 
in late,epa issued a public notice of proposed rulemaking that announced possible changes to the particulate matter naaqs.particulate matter nprm,fed.reg.most relevant to these cases,epa said it planned to supplement the existing primary naaqs,which regulated both coarse particulate matter and under a single set of standards,by adding two new primary standards specific to fine pm an annual standard of μg and a daily standard of μg.id.epa sought comment on that proposal and on a range of alternative values for the new standards,from to μg for the annual standard,and to μg for the daily standard.id.at.according to epa,an annual standard of μg and a daily standard of μg would be maximally precautionary,at by comparison,an annual standard of μg and a daily standard of μg would reflect the judgment that the current scientific evidence has not demonstrated adverse public health effects from fine particle concentrations below those corresponding to the old,composite,pm standard,id.between those extremes,the proposed annual and daily levels of and,respectively,would reflect an effort to limit annual concentrations to somewhat below those where the body of epidemiological evidence is most consistent and coherent.id.at.
to facilitate public input on the proposed changes,epa established a telephone hotline and a system for submission of comments via the internet.particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at.in addition,agency staff conducted public hearings in communities across the country and held two national satellite telecasts.id.by the end of the comment period,epa had received more than comments.id.
in setting the final naaqs,epa considered these public comments,in addition to casac recommendations and agency staff thorough review of the latest scientific information on known and potential human health effects associated with exposure to pm.id.at.epa also considered an independent though partially research institute study of the correlation between particulate matter levels and mortality in six urban areas,the same institute extended analyses of the mortality data for philadelphia alone the philadelphia studies,see id.at,and agency staff quantitative assessment of other health risks in philadelphia and los angeles risk assessment,see id.at citing office of air quality planning standards,envtl.prot.agency,a particulate matter risk assessment for philadelaphia and los angeless risk assessment.epa emphasized,however,that it place d greater weight on the overall conclusions derived from the se pm air pollution is likely causing or contributing to significant adverse effects at levels below those permitted by the old on the more uncertain functions and quantitative risk estimates derived from them.id.
ultimately,epa adopted the proposed annual standard of μg,explaining that it would assess compliance based on the average of annual arithmetic mean concentrations at monitoring stations in a given area.see particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at.for the daily standard,epa chose a less restrictive level than it had originally proposed,setting the standard at μg,with a form or method of assessing on the average of the percentile of daily concentrations at each monitoring site.id.epa provided a lengthy explanation of its selection of these new standards,four aspects of which are relevant here its discussions of the need to revise the old naaqs for particulate matter the reasons for adopting both annual and daily standards the grounds for choosing and μg,respectively,as the levels for the new standards and the rationale behind the new daily standard rather peculiar form.
explaining the first need for the new began by documenting evidence of the old pm standards inadequacy.examination of an extensive epidemiological data base,epa observed,showed that children,as well as the elderly and other sensitive populations,were experiencing adverse,health including in areas and at times when the levels of the old standards were met.id.at.in addition,a majority of casac members recommended strengthening the health protection s provided by the old pm standard s.id.at.finally,a majority of commenters agreed that based on the available scientific information,the old pm standards were not of themselves sufficient to protect public health.id.at.
responding to more critical commenters,epa acknowledged that in several of the cited epidemiological studies,the effects of particulate matter were difficult to isolate from those of other air pollutants.the agency soundly rejected,however,the suggestion that such studies are in any way negative with respect to the conclusion that pm,alone or in combination with other pollutants,is associated with adverse effects at levels below those allowed by the current standards.particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at.this conclusion is based not only on the consistency of pm effects across areas with widely varying concentrations of potentially confounding copollutants,epa explained,but also on the extended analyses of the philadelphia studies,in which pm can reasonably be distinguished from potential effects of all pollutants except sulfur dioxide.id.moreover,various characteristics of fine particulate matter,including its greater ability to penetrate and remain indoors where sensitive population s reside,and to infiltrate to the airways and gas exchange regions of the lung,id.at,convinced the agency that even in philadelphia,pm rather than sulfur dioxide play ed an important direct role in the observed mortality effects,id.
turning to the specific characteristics of the new naaqs,epa gave only a brief explanation of its decision to adopt a primary standard with a averaging period the standard is consistent with most community epidemiological studies,which suggest that and pm concentrations correlate positively with adverse health effects.particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at.epa dismissed as insufficiently quantitative the few studies suggesting an association between health effects and minutes to hours pm exposures,noting that in any case,regulating pm concentrations would also reduce concentrations in most areas.addressing the studies reporting stronger associations between pm and average concentrations,epa decided that a standard would effectively prevent both and pm episodes.id.emphasis added.
epa then discussed the annual naaqs averaging time,explaining that it adopted the standard to reduce the likelihood of and cumulative pm exposures,which appear to pose larger risks than exposures.id.although epa recognized that either a multiyear or a standard would also be effective against exposures,it concluded that the annual standard would provide adequate protection against multiyear pm events and that the current evidence does not provide a satisfactory quantitative basis for setting a national fine particle standard in terms of a seasonal averaging time.id.at.
explaining its decision to establish both annual and daily standards,epa indicated that although either standard could be viewed as providing both protection from,the use of two standards with very different averaging times would serv e to address situations where the daily peaks and annual averages are not consistently correlated.particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at.in such situations,the annual standard would lower both short and concentrations,while the daily standard would protect against localized hot spots,and seasonal emissions,neither of which would be well controlled by a national annual standard alone.id.
epa next made a number of key points about the levels it selected for the new naaqs.implementing its view that the annual standard should do most of the work in mitigating the risks of,epa selected the level of the standard so as to protect against the range of effects associated with both short and exposures to pm.id.at.in those studies reporting statistically significant correlations between health effects and pm exposures of any duration,the mean annual pm concentrations ranged from to,while in those studies reporting nearly significant correlations,the mean annual concentrations ranged from to μg.id.at.p lacing greatest weight on those studies that were clearly statistically significant,therefore,the agency adopted an annual standard level of m below the range of annual data most strongly associated with both short and exposure effects,and in the lower half of the to μg range mentioned in the particulate matter nprm,fed.reg.at.although epa acknowledged it could not rule out the possibility of health effects at lower annual concentrations,it nevertheless decided not only that the evidence for such effects is highly uncertain,but that the likelihood of significant health risk decreases as pm concentrations approach background levels.particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at emphasis added.
having settled on a moderate level for the annual naaqs,epa selected the level of the daily standard to provide supplemental protection against peak concentrations that might occur over limited areas for limited time periods.id.this selection process posed difficult questions because in all of the available studies in which exposures correlated positively with adverse health effects,the concentration exceeded the new μg naaqs.epa thus had no way to evaluate the incremental risk associated with single peak exposures to in areas where the new annual standard is met.id.at.because it did not yet know how effective the new annual standard would be in reducing the risk of peak exposures,therefore,epa decided it could not justify a restrictive daily standard,instead selecting μg level at the upper end of the range recommended by agency staff and most casac members.id.
in justifying the chosen levels for the new naaqs,epa made one final point relevant to these cases.responding to commenters who advocated lower levels for both the daily and annual standards,epa emphasized that considerable uncertainty remains about whether is a threshold is,whether there is a concentration below which is harmless.see id.at.as a result,epa could not be sure that lowering the naaqs would produce corresponding reductions in health risks.t he inherent scientific uncertainties are too great to support lower levels for the naaqs,the agency explained.id.
epa also gave a lengthy explanation for the form of the primary standards.only one aspect of that form is relevant here the agency decision to base compliance with the daily standard on the average of the percentile of daily concentrations at each monitoring station.see particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at.this form permits monitoring stations to exceed the μg level of the standard two percent of the time,or about seven days each year assuming the stations monitor pm levels every day.epa justified these authorized exceedances on the ground that they will increase the stability of the standard by permitting states to design control programs without worrying about the effects of single high exposure event s that may be due to unusual meteorological conditions alone.id.at.in addition,epa pointed out that the clean air act provides for emergency state or federal action to address any such high exposure events.id.that said,epa rejected alternative forms such as a percentile form that would have allowed more exceedances per year,on the ground that a daily standard that permitted such a large number of days with peak concentrations above the standard level would not serve as an effective supplement to the annual standard.id.
turning finally to the secondary naaqs,epa focused primarily on the impact of particulate matter on visibility,an important welfare effect that has direct significance to people enjoyment of daily activities in all parts of the country.id.at.epa predicted that attainment of the new primary standards would improve visibility in the eastern united states.conceding that the new standards would have little or no effect in the west except in and near certain urban areas,id.at,epa observed that no single suite of secondary standards would solve visibility problems everywhere in the country because,due to regional differences in relative humidity,natural background pm levels,and other factors,a national secondary standard intended to maintain or improve visibility conditions in the west would have to be set at or even below natural background levels in the east,while a national secondary standard intended to achieve an appropriate degree of visibility improvement in the east would permit further degradation in the west,id.at.epa therefore decided simply to establish secondary naaqs identical to the new primary naaqs,and to establish a regional haze program under clean air act section,to improve visibility in those areas where the new national standards prove ineffective.id.at.
state and business petitioners claims 
state and business petitioners urge us to vacate the primary naaqs because epa did not apply any legal standard,much less the correct standard.state bus.pet rs br.at.in support of this argument,they cite two passages in the final rule.in one,petitioners claim,epa asserted that it had no obligation to determine a safe level of prior to adopting a primary naaqs.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in the other,epa allegedly acknowledged that its approach might result in regulatory programs that go beyond those that are needed to effectively reduce risks to public health.id.at quoting particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at emphasis added.as petitioners see it,these concessions prove that epa failed to set the primary naaqs at levels requisite that is,not lower or higher than protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety,as mandated by whitman,at.at.
petitioners argument suffers from two significant flaws.first,the final pm rule makes neither alleged concession.in the first passage,which petitioners cite as evidence that epa failed to identify a safe level of,the agency merely disclaimed any obligation to set primary naaqs by means of a process,identifying a safe level and then applying an additional margin of safety.instead,epa stated,it may take into account margin of safety considerations throughout the process as long as such considerations are fully explained and supported by the record.particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at.nothing in this statement implies that epa failed to determine safe levels for fine particulate matter indeed,the agency establishment of new primary naaqs demonstrates that it did reach a conclusion regarding safe daily and levels.state and business petitioners obviously disagree with that conclusion,but they have no basis for arguing that epa failed to identify levels of that the agency considers safe.
viewed in its proper context,epa other alleged concession that the new naaqs go beyond what is necessary to protect public equally chimerical.in the final rule,epa said only that a number of commenters to the proposed naaqs strongly supported standard levels more stringent than those proposed by the agency,but that setting such lower standards might result in regulatory programs that go beyond those that are needed to effectively reduce risks to public health.id.at emphasis added.this passage in no way supports petitioners argument that epa failed to set the primary naaqs at levels requisite to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety.whitman,at.at.instead,the passage documents epa rejection of lower standards,demonstrating that the agency not only recognized,but acted upon,its statutory obligation to set the primary naaqs at levels no lower than necessary to reduce public health risks.
petitioners argument that epa neither identified nor applied the proper legal standard also exaggerates the agency obligation to quantify its decisionmaking.the argument relies on two statements from the rulemaking and one from ata i epa assertion that it need not determine a safe level of before calculating a margin of safety,state bus.pet rs br.at quoting particulate matter naaqs.at internal quotation marks omitted the agency disavow al of certain specific risk estimates,id.at citing particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at and finally,the agency claim that there is no threshold amount of scientific information or degree of certainty required to promulgate or revise a naaqs,id.quoting resp t br.at.according to petitioners,these three assertions prove that epa failed to describe the standard under which it arrived at its conclusion regarding the appropriate level for the naaqs,as required by our decision in american lung ass epa.petitioners misread american lung ass n,however,if they think it requires epa,prior to setting primary naaqs,to identify perfectly safe levels of pollutants,to rely on specific risk estimates,or to specify threshold amounts of scientific information.
although we recognize that the clean air act and circuit precedent require epa qualitatively to describe the standard governing its selection of particular naaqs,we have expressly rejected the notion that the agency must establish a measure of the risk to safety it considers adequate to protect public health every time it establishes a naaqs.natural res.def.council,epa,vacated in part,vacating a later part of the court decision.such a rule would compel epa to leave hazardous pollutants unregulated unless and until it completely understands every risk they pose,thus thwarting the clean air act requirement that the agency err on the side of caution by setting primary naaqs that allow an adequate margin of safety.b.the act requires epa to promulgate protective primary naaqs even where,as here,the pollutant risks can not be quantified or precisely identified as to nature or degree,particulate matter naaqs.at see also ozone naaqs,fed.reg.at explaining that section b s margin of safety requirement was intended to address uncertainties associated with inconclusive scientific and technical information as well as to provide a reasonable degree of protection against hazards that research has not yet identified.for its part,american lung ass requires only that epa engage in reasoned,at,not that it definitively identify pollutant levels below which risks to public health are negligible.
thus,epa inability to guarantee the accuracy or increase the precision of the naaqs in no way undermines the standards validity.rather,these limitations indicate only that significant scientific uncertainty remains about the health effects of fine particulate matter at low atmospheric concentrations.as the exhaustive rulemaking process makes clear,see supra,epa set the primary naaqs notwithstanding that uncertainty,just as the act requires.
we are equally unpersuaded by state and business petitioners argument that epa should have considered whether reducing atmospheric concentrations of fine particles would increase levels of ozone or a different fine particle component,potentially increasing overall health risk s.state bus.pet rs br.at quoting advance nprm,fed.reg.at.petitioners apparently believe epa may not regulate one pollutant without determining how that regulation would affect the levels of all other pollutants with which the first could react.given the complexity of atmospheric chemistry,see advance nprm,fed.reg.at noting multiple nonlinearities and positive and negative feedbacks,however,imposing such a requirement would hamstring the agency,preventing it from complying with the clean air act mandate to set protective primary naaqs.we might feel differently about epa obligations in this regard had petitioners pointed to clear evidence that lowering atmospheric levels will necessarily increase levels of other pollutants.petitioners cite no such evidence,however,instead relying on an obscure passage from the advance nprm in which epa said only that the complicated interactions among different atmospheric pollutants,including pm,make integrated implementation of pollution controls far from a straightforward exercise.id.as epa observes,this general discussion of the interrelationship s among pollutants hardly constitutes a finding that regulating levels will increase health risks from ozone and other pollutants.resp t particulate matter br.at.
state and business petitioners remaining substantive claims merit little discussion.they argue that epa failed to determine whether attainment of the old particulate matter standard would leave unacceptable public health risk.state bus.pet rs br.at.as epa notes,however,the final pm rule explicitly states

ata i also forecloses petitioners confounder factors such as the presence of other pollutants in the ambient air,temperature,humidity,and indoor air pollution might account for some or all of the associations reported in the studies on which epa relied.state bus.pet rs br.at.t he growing empirical evidence demonstrating a relationship between fine particle pollution and adverse health effects,we said in ata i,amply justifies establishment of new fine particle standards.at.we could not have reached that conclusion had we agreed with the petitioners in ata i that epa s tudies failed adequately to address the confounding effect of other pollutants.pet rs br.at.even if we did not think ourselves bound by ata i,though,we would defer to epa entirely plausible reasoning regarding the confounder issue according to the agency,the consistency of pm effects across areas with widely varying concentrations of potentially confounding copollutants,together with agency staff extended analyses of the philadelphia studies,amply justify the conclusion that pm,alone or in combination with other pollutants,is associated with adverse effects at levels below those allowed by the current standards.particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at.
next,petitioners argue that the naaqs are arbitrary and capricious because epa conceded that public health risks would decline with more stringent standards only if the agency correctly assumed that there is a continuum of health risks down to the lower end of the ranges of air quality at issue,and the reported associations are,in fact,causally related to at the lowest concentrations measured.state bus.pet rs br.at quoting particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at.epa made this alleged concession,however,only in the context of rejecting standards more stringent than those proposed in the nprm,particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at the agency never conceded that the actual naaqs rely on questionable assumptions or associations.
petitioners mount several specific challenges to the daily and annual naaqs.to begin with,they contend that epa failed to justify the daily standard,but because this argument appears nowhere in their ata i briefs,see pet rs reply br.at we focus on the lack of justification for setting the annual standard at μg.see also id.at of the two new primary standards,the annual standard imposes the more stringent controlling requirement,we decline to consider it.see order of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit at may,the briefs shall address only preserved challenges not hitherto resolved by the supreme court or by this court.quoting whitman,at.at.challenging the annual naaqs,petitioners argue the record does not support setting the standard at μg.contrary to petitioners assertion,however,epa staff never recommended a higher,μg level.rather,staff recommended that epa consider a range of levels from to μg,making no specific recommendation within this range.office of air quality planning standards,envtl.prot.agency,review of the national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter policy assessment of scientific and technical information to.moreover,epa ultimately set the standard just below the range of mean annual concentrations observed in studies showing a statistically significant association between fine particulate matter and health effects.see supra.while we can not say those studies necessitated a standard level of,neither have we any basis for concluding that epa decision was unreasonable or unsupported by the record.we repeat that the evidence in the record may also support other conclusions,even those that are inconsistent with the administrator,does not prevent us from concluding that her decisions were rational and supported by the record.lead indus.ass n,at internal citations omitted.
this brings us finally to petitioners argument that epa denied the public essential procedural rights by failing to obtain and make public the data underlying certain key studies relating to the confounder issue.claiming neither that they were unable to obtain the studies,nor that the studies were improperly published or peer reviewed,petitioners instead urge us to impose a general requirement that epa obtain and publicize the data underlying published studies on which the agency relies.the clean air act imposes no such obligation it merely directs epa to include in any notice of proposed rulemaking data,information,and documents on which the proposed rule relies.d emphasis added.here,epa explained that it relied on the scientific studies cited in the rulemaking record,rather than on the raw data underlying those studies.particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at.in addition,agency counsel advised us at oral argument that on those few occasions when epa requested underlying data from an investigator,the agency included those data in the record,tr.of oral arg.at.more generally,we agree with epa that requiring agencies to obtain and publicize the data underlying all studies on which they rely would be impractical and unnecessary.particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at.as epa persuasively stated in denying petitioners original request for the information 
if epa and other governmental agencies could not rely on published studies without conducting an independent analysis of the enormous volume of raw data underlying them,then much plainly relevant scientific information would become unavailable to epa for use in setting standards to protect public health and the environment s uch data are often the property of scientific investigators and are often not readily available because of proprietary interests or because of confidentiality arrangements with study participants.
state and business petitioners challenge to the secondary naaqs hinges on the proposition that the identical primary naaqs are arbitrary and capricious.having just rejected the latter argument,we need not consider the former.
environmental petitioners claims 
environmental petitioners central argument regarding the primary naaqs is straightforward epa should have set a stricter daily naaqs rather than relying almost exclusively on the stringent annual standard.petitioners contend that because adverse health effects of occur after exposures,the naaqs must prevent most,if not all,such daily exposures in order to reduce health risks.envtl.pet rs br.at.a strategy that focuses on the annual rather than the daily standard,petitioners argue,will do little to prevent pollution events,in which concentrations exceed healthy levels for days or weeks.questioning the level of the daily naaqs,petitioners note that epa evaluated three possible levels,and μg,ultimately choosing the highest even though the risk assessment study indicates that in some cities,a lower daily standard would greatly reduce the risks of both short and exposures.risk assessment at.finally,with respect to the form of the daily standard,petitioners argue that focusing on the percentile value allows about seven days per year two percent of days to escape regulation.the μg annual standard,petitioners observe,will do almost nothing to limit levels on these seven otherwise unregulated days.
responding to these arguments,epa observes that there are significant uncertainties in identifying the extent of the incremental risk associated with single peak exposures to in areas where the annual standard is met.particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at.as we understand the problem,existing data are insufficient to permit epa to separate health effects of concentrations from those of peak concentrations because in all cities in which the agency found a positive correlation between exposures and adverse health effects,the concentrations exceeded the new annual naaqs.thus,epa can not determine what risks might have been associated with peak levels had the averages in these areas been below that selected for the new annual standard.id.this uncertainty,together with evidence suggesting that the risk over the course of a year associated solely with a limited number of peak exposures is considerably smaller than that associated with the entire air quality distribution,id.at,convinced epa to focus its attention on the annual naaqs.we think this expert judgment worthy of deference,at least until formerly polluted areas come into compliance with the new annual standard and new health effects data from those areas become available.
moreover,epa provides a convincing justification for its decision to place little faith in the quantitative results of the risk assessment,which petitioners cite for the proposition that setting a restrictive daily standard would provide benefits beyond those of the annual standard.although petitioners position finds some support in the numerical results of the risk assessment,see risk assessment at detailing the results of the study,which suggest that lowering the daily standard would reduce health effects even if the annual standard were held steady,epa contends that uncertainties in the assumptions underlying that study render the quantitative predictions insufficiently reliable to serve as the basis for establishing any more stringent standards than were warranted based directly on epa analysis of the epidemiological evidence.resp t particulate matter br.at see also particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at epa emphasizes that it places greater weight on the overall conclusions derived from the studies than on the specific functions and quantitative risk estimates derived from them.specifically,in the relevant portions of the risk assessment,agency staff apparently used a model that assumed imposition of a new daily standard would prompt states to restrict activities on all days,not just days that would otherwise exceed the standard.consequently,stricter daily standards in the model drove down both and concentrations.in other words,epa explains,even though the annual standard was held constant,the model drove all daily values,including those at or below the annual mean,to levels lower than those calculated from compliance with the annual standard alone,and it was this drop in annual levels,not the drop in daily levels,that produced the projected health benefits.resp t particulate matter br.at.not only do we owe deference to an agency determination regarding the reliability of scientific evidence,but petitioners give us no reason to question epa judgment regarding the reliability of the risk assessment.see troy browner,as we have said,we review scientific judgments of an agency not as the chemist,biologist,or statistician that we are qualified neither by training nor experience to be,but as a reviewing court exercising our narrowly defined duty of holding agencies to certain minimal standards of rationality.quoting ethyl epa.
we recognize that epa reasoning leaves two unanswered questions,but neither proves fatal.first,one might argue from epa discussion of the risk assessment results that the agency should have adopted a lower annual naaqs.on this point,epa persuasively explains that it discounted the quantitative predictions of the risk assessment in light of inherent scientific uncertainties,including the possibility of thresholds below which has little or no effect.particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at.in other words,although the model predicted that dropping levels below μg would reduce adverse health effects,those predictions relied on hence about the incidence of health effects at low particulate matter levels.
second,epa skepticism about the quantitative results of the risk assessment,together with the agency repeated assertions that the evidence does not justify a strict daily naaqs,lead one to wonder why a daily standard is even necessary.epa position on this issue seems incongruous,emphasizing on the one hand the need for a daily standard to provid e supplemental protection against peak exposures not addressed by the annual standard,particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at,and on the other the lack of evidence establishing that peak exposures not addressed by the annual standard pose incremental risks over and above those associated with high levels,id.none of the parties,however,challenges the daily naaqs in precisely these terms state and business petitioners focus on the annual naaqs,while environmental petitioners primarily cite the evidence supporting a stricter daily naaqs.even if the parties had raised this issue,however,we would neither vacate nor remand the daily naaqs.reviewing the record ourselves,we find support for the following explanation of the existence and form of the daily standard some daily naaqs is necessary to prevent deadly,episodes of the sort that occurred during the famous london fog,id.at but in areas that meet the new μg annual standard,such events,though theoretically possible,are unlikely,id.at so each year,states should be permitted to address one or a few such events through emergency episode plans rather than pollution control measures,id.at otherwise states would have to design their pollution control programs around single high exposure events that may be due to unusual meteorological conditions alone,rendering the programs less stable and hence,we assume,less programs designed to address average conditions,id.at.we can not fault this strategy.as justice breyer noted in his whitman concurrence,because a rule likely to cause more harm to health than it prevents is not a rule that is requisite to protect the public health,the clean air act must permit epa to consider whether a proposed rule promotes safety overall.at.at breyer,concurring emphasis added.therefore,to promote development of more effective pollution control programs,epa was entirely justified in permitting a few days to escape regulation under the daily naaqs.particulate matter naaqs.at.having no basis to question epa choice of seven rather than,for example,four or ten unregulated days,our deferential standard of review requires that we leave the daily naaqs in place.
finally,unlike state and business petitioners,environmental petitioners mount an independent challenge to the secondary standards,contending that epa expressly recognized the standards were inadequate to improve visibility in much of the western united states.see supra citing particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at.in ata i,however,we concluded that congress did not intend the secondary naaqs to eliminate all adverse visibility effects and,therefore,that the epa acted within the scope of its authority in deciding to rely upon the regional haze program to mitigate some of the adverse visibility effects caused by.at.moreover,epa provides a plausible explanation for its decision not to set lower secondary naaqs national standards adequate to improve visibility in the west would have to be set at or even below natural background levels in the east.particulate matter naaqs,fed.reg.at.petitioners give us no reason to question this explanation.
turning to the ozone standards,we again begin with a summary of the rulemaking process,and then consider petitioners challenges.
the rulemaking 
epa first announced its plan to revise the ozone naaqs in late,issuing a public notice of proposed rulemaking.ozone naaqs,fed.reg.at discussing naaqs for ozone proposed decision,fed.reg.proposed.in that notice,epa indicated that it intended to replace the existing,primary ozone standard of ppm with a new,standard.it sought comments on this change and also on three possible levels for the new,and ppm.according to epa,a level of ppm would afford about the same protection as the old,standard,id.at would replicate the lowest exposure level actually tested in clinical studies,id.at and would be highly precautionary in nature,id.at.
as in connection with the particulate matter naaqs,epa took account of casac recommendations,agency staff assessment of the available information regarding human exposure and risk,and tens of thousands of comments submitted in response to the nprm.id.at.epa also conducted risk assessments in nine representative urban areas the nine area study to estimate the correlation between ozone exposure and health risks for the general population and for two groups at higher risk,outdoor workers and a group epa calls outdoor children.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,epa developed quantitative risk estimates for those specific health effects for which sufficient data were available.id.finally,in deciding when certain observed physiological effects of ozone become so significant that they should be regarded as adverse to individuals health,epa looked to guidelines published by the american thoracic society.id.
in the end,epa adopted an,ppm standard.ozone naaqs,fed.reg.at.two aspects of this new standard require discussion here averaging time and level.
explaining its switch from a one to an averaging time,epa first noted that the standard reflected the the most serious health effects of ozone result from one to exposures.according to epa,however,new studies clearly demonstrate associations between a wide range of health effects and prolonged six to eight hour exposures to concentrations less than that of the old standard.id.at.citing the nine area study,epa indicated that an averaging time of eight hours not only reduces risk associated with exposures,id.at,but also limits cumulative exposure,id.at.the longer averaging time,moreover,reduces variability in ozone levels across geographic areas.id.at.epa also emphasized that casac unanimously agreed with the proposed change.id.at see also envtl.prot.agency,letter re casac closure on the primary standard portion of the staff paper for ozone casac ozone letter the panel was in unanimous agreement that the present one hour standard be eliminated and replaced with an eight hour standard.acknowledging some individual casac members comments to the effect that choosing between a one or eight hour averaging time is a policy choice not dictated by science,epa declined to view these individual statements during the course of casac review as in any way contradict ing or supersed ing the clear and unanimous agreement on the issue conveyed in casac closure letter.ozone naaqs,fed.reg.at.in epa opinion,the fact that an averaging time of eight hours results in a significantly more uniformly protective national standard than the current one hour standard is an important public health policy consideration that supports the selection of the former averaging time.id.at.
turning to the ppm level of the primary standard,epa first explained that because ozone is thought to pollutant,it is not possible to select a level below which absolutely no health effects are likely to occur.id.at.nevertheless,epa undertook to select a standard level that would reduce risk sufficiently to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety.id.in deciding among the proposed levels,and ppm,epa took into account a number of key observations and conclusions,including 
casac conclusion that the old standard provided little,if any,margin of safety,id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted 
numerous epidemiological studies attributing excess hospital admissions to ozone exposure at concentrations below that of the old standard,id.at 
evidence that an,ppm standard would constitute only a modest improvement over the old standard,
c lear evidence from human clinical studies that prolonged exposure to ppm of ozone,at moderate exertion,correlates positively with health effects like coughing,pain with inhalation,and reduced lung function,id.at 
clinical studies suggesting that w hile group mean responses at ppm the lowest exposure level tested are usually small or mild in nature,responses of some sensitive individuals are sufficiently severe to be considered adverse,
indications from the nine area study that statistically significant reductions in exposure and risk result from alternative eight hour standards as the level is lowered from ppm to ppm,but that there is no bright line that differentiates between acceptable and unacceptable risks within this range,id.at and finally,
evidence from the same study that a standard set at ppm would allow approximately percent to percent more outdoor children to experience decreases in lung function and pain with inhalation than would a ppm standard,id.at.
despite some inherent uncertainties,epa viewed these observations and conclusions,taken together,as indicating that the public health impacts of ozone at levels lower than the,ppm standard are important and sufficiently large as to warrant a standard set at a level of ppm.id.
acknowledging that numerous public comments advocated a level of ppm,epa offered several explanations for its decision to reject a more stringent standard.most important,epa pointed out that not one casac panel member supported a standard set lower than ppm,specifically after considering a range of alternative standards that included ppm.ozone naaqs,fed.reg.at.in addition,epa contended that the most certain adverse health effects of ozone are transient and reversible at low ozone levels,while the more serious impacts on health are less certain,in part because no human clinical studies have evaluated concentrations lower than ppm.finally,epa noted that a ppm standard would be closer to peak background levels that infrequently occur in some areas due to nonanthropogenic sources of ozone precursors.id.
one final aspect of epa discussion of the primary naaqs level is relevant here the agency response to certain comments questioning its reliance on specific field,epidemiological,and clinical studies.according to epa,the comments did not reflect an integrative assessment of the approach casac has historically urged the agency to rather a piecemeal look at each individual study.id.at.epa therefore dismissed the comments,arguing that such an incremental critique tends to miss the strength of the entire body of evidence taken together.id.
in setting the secondary naaqs,epa focused on ozone effects on vegetation,since these public welfare effects are of most concern at ozone concentrations typically occurring in the united states.ozone naaqs,fed.reg.at.the nprm identified two possible changes to the secondary standard replacing the old,ppm standard with an standard identical to the new primary standard,or adopting an entirely new seasonal standard that would regulate the cumulative sum of hourly ozone concentrations during the three consecutive months of the year with highest ozone levels.id.at.in deciding between these options,epa again took account of public comments,casac recommendations,and agency staff assessment of the available information.id.at.citing statements by casac panel members,id.at,epa first concluded that a secondary naaqs more stringent than the old,ppm primary standard,was necessary to protect vegetation from ozone,id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.i nadequate rural and remote ozone air quality data,however,limited epa ability to evaluate the potential benefits of a seasonal standard.id.g iven the present limits of the scientific evidence,the administrator has decided that it is not appropriate to move forward with a seasonal secondary standard at this time.ultimately,therefore,epa rejected the seasonal standard at least until better data become available,choosing instead to set the secondary standard equal to the primary standard.id.at.
ozone petitioners claims 
american trucking associations and the other ozone petitioners challenge the naaqs along several lines.to begin with,just as state and business petitioners argued with respect to the naaqs for particulate matter,ozone petitioners contend that epa neither identified nor applied any legal standard in setting the ozone naaqs.ozone pet rs br.at.petitioners cite epa statements that it need not identify a safe level of ozone,and that margin of safety determinations may not be amenable to quantification in terms of what risk is acceptable or any other metric,ozone naaqs,fed.reg.at,as evidence that epa failed to set the primary ozone naaqs at the level that is requisite to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety,whitman,at.at.as we discussed earlier,however,epa has no obligation either to identify an accurate safe level of a pollutant or to quantify precisely the pollutant risks prior to setting primary naaqs.see supra.rather,epa must err on the side of caution,just as it did the naaqs at whatever level it deems necessary and sufficient to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety,taking into account both the available evidence and the inevitable scientific uncertainties.
petitioners raise two specific arguments regarding the primary ozone naaqs.first,they assert that epa failed to determine whether attainment of the old,primary ozone standard would leave unacceptable public health risk,ozone pet rs br.at,and relatedly,that none of the alternative eight hour standards considered by epa is significantly more protective of the public health than the old one hour naaqs,id.at.we disagree.as noted earlier,not only is the record replete with references to studies demonstrating the inadequacies of the old standard,see supra,but epa discussed at length the advantages of a longer averaging time,including reduced risk of prolonged exposures to unhealthy ozone levels and increased uniformity of protection across different urban areas,see ozone naaqs,fed.reg.at.moreover,epa specifically cited casac consensus that an eight hour standard is more appropriate for a human standard than a one hour standard and its recommendation that the present standard be eliminated and replaced with an eight hour standard.casac ozone letter at see also ozone naaqs.at in proposing to change the averaging time of the primary standard from one to eight hours,the administrator was concurring with the unanimous recommendation of casac.given this record evidence,our deferential standard of review,and the clean air act requirement that epa must either follow casac advice or explain why the proposed rule differs from casac recommendations,d,petitioners can not seriously expect us to epa conclusion regarding the inadequacy of the old,standard.
though somewhat more persuasive,petitioners second specific challenge also falls short.they argue that in selecting a level of ppm rather than or,epa reached inconsistent conclusions regarding specific health risks,thus demonstrat ing that the agency decision to revise the naaqs lacks a rational basis and therefore is arbitrary and capricious.ozone pet rs br.at.in support of this point,petitioners challenge epa three justifications for selecting rather than that no casac member supported a standard below that health effects at ozone levels below are transient and reversible and that would be too close to peak background levels.see supra noting these arguments.as to the first point,petitioners observe that most members of the casac panel who expressed an opinion on standard level supported a level above ppm,and that casac ultimately concluded that there is no bright line distinguishing any of the alternative standards as significantly more protective of public health.ozone pet rs br.at quoting casac ozone letter at.in addition,petitioners point out,ata i expressly discredits the contention that ozone health effects are more transient and reversible at concentrations below ppm than at concentrations between and.at the record evidence does not make the categorical distinction the dissent says it does,and it is far from apparent that any health effects existing above ppm are permanent or irreversible.petitioners finally note that proximity to peak background levels is an indeterminate standard that points to no particular level for the primary naaqs.
although we think petitioners individual criticisms have some force,we are satisfied that in selecting a level of rather than or,for that matter,epa engage d in reasoned.american lung ass n,at.for one thing,casac inability to reach consensus is hardly dispositive epa is entitled to give significant weight to the fact that no committee member advocated a level of ppm,ozone naaqs.at,particularly as eight of the ten panel members who expressed opinions advocated a level of ppm or greater,while the remaining two simply endorsed the ppm range presented by the agency and stated that the final selection should be a policy decision,casac ozone letter at.also,although relative proximity to peak background ozone concentrations did not,in itself,necessitate a level of,epa could consider that factor when choosing among the three alternative levels.most convincing,though,is the absence of any human clinical studies at ozone concentrations below.see id.at.this lack of data amply supports epa assertion that the most serious health effects of ozone are less certain at low concentrations,id.at,providing an eminently rational reason to set the primary standard at a somewhat higher level,at least until additional studies become available.natural res.def.council,at declining to require epa to explain the risk it considered tolerable in setting the challenged naaqs because of the uncertainty of the data upon which the administrator needed to rest his assessment.overall,therefore,we disagree with petitioners that in selecting ppm rather than a lower or higher level,epa reached inconsistent conclusions.the agency could reasonably conclude that existing data support a standard below but do not yet justify a standard below.
this brings us,finally,to petitioners challenges to the secondary ozone naaqs.according to petitioners,the secondary naaqs are unlawful because epa failed to account for factors other than temperature,rainfall,and pests that affect.ozone pet rs br.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.this is unreasonable.epa had no more obligation to consider climatic conditions and pests in evaluat ing whether its new secondary standard would measurably improve crop yield,than to consider automobile accidents and malnutrition in evaluating whether its new primary standard would measurably improve public health.the clean air act directs epa to protect public welfare from adverse effects of ozone and other pollutants the agency can not escape that directive simply because ozone wreaks less havoc than temperature,rainfall,and pests.
citing various casac comments regarding the lack of relevant plant exposure studies,petitioners next argue that epa estimated the risks of ozone crude ly.id.quoting envtl.prot.agency,letter re closure by casac on the secondary standard portion of the staff paper for ozone second casac ozone letter internal quotation marks and citations omitted.casac,however,found more than enough data to justify revising the existing secondary naaqs.second casac ozone letter at i t was agreed that a secondary naaqs,more stringent than the present primary standard,was necessary to protect vegetation from ozone.moreover,nothing in the clean air act requires epa to wait until it has perfect information before adopting a protective secondary naaqs.rather,the act mandates promulgat
