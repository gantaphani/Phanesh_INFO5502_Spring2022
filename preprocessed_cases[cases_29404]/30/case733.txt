two environmental statutes everyone loves to hate are the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra.in combination,they make owners of contaminated property and contributors to contamination responsible for cleaning up toxic waste,and,if someone else cleans up the waste,liable for the costs of that clean up.this litigation illustrates the point.it involves seepage over several decades of a toxic dry cleaning chemical into the ground under a las vegas shopping center.there have been two district court actions leading to multiple appeals.
neighboring homeowners brought the first action,seeking injunctive relief against the property owners of the shopping center and operators of the dry cleaning facility.the nevada division of environmental protection ndep brought the other action to recover its clean up costs.the district court granted summary judgment for both sets of plaintiffs on all claims.the current owner and the former operators of the dry cleaning facility appeal.there are numerous procedural issues,but the principal legal contention is that application of cercla to this conduct that occurred solely in nevada violates the commerce clause.
we largely affirm the district court,including its rejection of that constitutional challenge.we vacate the grant of summary judgment under cercla against the current owner and remand so the owner may have an opportunity to make the additional showing that would be necessary to establish that it meets an exception to cercla liability.we reverse on procedural grounds the grant of summary judgment under rcra against the current owner and the operators because those defendants did not have an adequate opportunity to respond to plaintiffs claims.we also reverse the grant of summary judgment against one guarantor,because there is no evidence of spills during the term of his guaranty.
the statutes 
cercla and rcra,passed by congress within a few years of each other,both address the problem of environmental contamination from hazardous waste disposal,but they employ different means.congress passed cercla in,motivated by several environmental catastrophes,especially the infamous love canal disaster in niagra falls,new york,at.the statute authorizes governments or private parties to clean up polluted sites and seek compensation from the polluters.it is designed to ensure that the cost of clean up is borne by those responsible for the contamination.burlington santa fe ry.united states.in this case,ndep began a clean up of the contaminated site due to the inaction of the owners and operators,and then sued for the funds it had expended and those that it would need to expend in the future.
rcra,passed in,focuses on limiting waste production and ensuring that when waste is produced,it is treated and disposed of properly.it plugged a loophole in environmental law.before its passage,disposing pollutants into the water and air was regulated,but the land disposal of hazardous substances was not.h,at.rcra primary purpose was to reduce the generation of hazardous waste and to ensure the proper treatment,storage,and disposal of that waste which is nonetheless generated,so as to minimize the present and future threat to human health and the environment.meghrig kfc,quoting b.rcra,in,authorizes citizen suits for two types of injunctive relief an injunction ordering the responsible parties to clean up the contamination and an injunction ordering them to stop any further violations.see meghrig,at.at the time of the homeowners suit,the toxic spills had already occurred and the dry cleaning operations had ceased.the homeowners therefore sought an injunction ordering the owners and operators to clean up,test,and monitor the contaminated site.
facts and procedural background 
history of the site and its contamination 
maryland square shopping center the site,a las vegas shopping center,was from to home to a dry cleaning facility responsible for environmental contamination.maryland square llc maryland square,the current owner of the site,has owned it since.the site has had many prior owners,but only the herman kishner trust,a defendant,owned the site during the contamination period.during that period two companies leased the site and operated the dry cleaning facility.shapiro.investment sbic operated it from until.johnson group,the predecessor of dci usa,collectively dci purchased the dry cleaning business in and operated it until.
the history is summarized in the following chart showing the owners,operators,and known or alleged chemical spills 
herman kishner constructed the site in and transferred ownership to the herman kishner trust the following year.beginning in,the trust leased the dry cleaning facility to sbic,and sbic agreed in the lease to indemnify the trust for all claims arising from sbic actions,omissions,or negligence.sbic signed a replacement lease in in which it agreed to indemnify the trust for violations of law.sbic sold the dry cleaning business to dci in.as part of the sale,melvin shapiro,who formed and controlled sbic with his brother philip shapiro,personally guaranteed dci performance of the lease obligations,including the obligation to indemnify the site owner for any future violations of law.
the contamination at the site was produced by a chemical commonly used in the dry cleaning industry and called tetrachloroethylene pce.pce is a hazardous substance as defined by cercla and the nevada administrative code.admin.code.during its operation of the dry cleaning facility,sbic used,and spilled,pce.according to former sbic employees,from time to time a button trap would clog and amounts of pce would spill onto the concrete floor.sbic also admitted that a spill of roughly gallons of pce occurred during a filter change in.when pce spilled,it fell onto a concrete floor equipped with a trench style floor drain.the pce then went down the drain through the pipes beneath the floor and into the ground and groundwater.
ii.entry of the state of nevada and its clean up efforts 
the pce discharge was first reported to ndep on november,during a investigation by clark county school district.when maryland square purchased the property from the school district in,maryland square was aware of the contamination.maryland square demolished the building in,including the contaminated floor,but made no efforts to remove any contaminant beneath it.
after the initial discovery,ndep,on july,received a report from the environmental consultant performing clark county investigation.ndep oversaw further investigation of the site that revealed the presence of pce in the soil and groundwater.the highest pce concentrations were found in and around the floor drain and drain pipes beneath the former dry cleaning facility.the investigation also revealed a plume of groundwater emanating from the site and extending eastward into a nearby residential las vegas neighborhood.ndep then began its lengthy clean up of the soil.
the contaminated plume was a cause for concern.on the basis of a soil gas report submitted to ndep in,ndep determined that there was a potential for pce vapor intrusion into the neighborhood homes at concentrations that could materially increase the probability of cancer in exposed individuals.to address the risks posed by pce evaporating into the air,ndep offered to install subslab depressurization systems in the homes.ndep recognized,however,that it also needed to reduce the pce concentrations in the groundwater in order to prevent potential future exposures,because the plume was moving away from the site.ndep informed residents,property owners,and government officials of the pce contamination in the groundwater and the possible health effects.
ndep also notified the current and former owners and operators of the site that ndep considered them to be potentially responsible parties under cercla for clean up costs.ndep stated in those notices in that it already had expended approximately,that it intended to spend more funds to address human exposure to pce,and that it planned to seek recovery of its expenses.ndep has continued its clean up efforts over the following years,and removed the contaminated soil in.
iii.history of the litigation 
in late and early two suits were filed in the united states district court for the district of nevada against the owners and operators of the site.ndep sued them under both cercla and nevada state law.peter voggenthaler,with other neighborhood homeowners,sued under rcra.in the homeowners rcra suit,the owners filed against the operators for indemnity.
ndep action under cercla sought to recover the costs of cleaning up the site and a declaratory judgment entitling ndep to future clean up costs.ndep contended that all of the defendants,as owners or operators of a facility that had released toxic chemicals,were liable under cercla.each of the defendants offered a separate reason for why it was not liable,and several of the defendants contended that the application of cercla to conduct solely within nevada violates the commerce clause.ndep,under nevada state law,also sought recovery of clean up costs and injunctive relief to prevent further violations.the district court eventually granted summary judgment for ndep on all of its claims on may.
the homeowners filed their complaint under rcra seeking an injunction forcing all of the site owners to clean up the contamination,and contending that the owners were contributors under rcra.the homeowners did not seek relief under state law.the site owners all took the position that they were not responsible for the actual spills,even though they knowingly leased the site to a dry cleaning business and profited from the operation of that business.the district court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs and against all of the owners on july.
the current owner,maryland square,however,moved for rehearing after the entry of summary judgment on its rcra liability,contending that it was in a different position from the other owners because its ownership of the property did not begin until after the dry cleaning facility had closed down.the homeowners responded to the motion for rehearing,contending that maryland square nevertheless should be considered a contributor under rcra because its demolition of the building in had exacerbated the situation by exposing and disseminating the contamination.the homeowners relied on the expert report that had been attached to their summary judgment reply.
the district court,however,did not resolve the issue of maryland square liability raised in the reconsideration motion.instead,the court concluded in an october,order that it lacked jurisdiction because the motion involved the merits of the owners rcra liability,and the other owners had already filed a notice of appeal from the summary judgment order on rcra liability.that premature appeal was later consolidated by our court with the owners appeal of the rcra permanent injunction after the district court proceedings became final.
the district court then did enter a permanent injunction under rcra on december,ordering a clean up of the site.although the plaintiffs had moved for summary judgment on rcra liability against only the owners,the district court not only granted that motion,but,sua sponte,also entered judgment and ordered injunctive relief against operator sbic as well,even though plaintiffs had not moved for such relief.
the owners leases to the operators contained indemnification provisions.the owners therefore moved for judgment in the rcra litigation on their for indemnity against sbic and melvin shapiro as operators.the district court granted the motion as to both on october.although only sbic actually operated the business,the court held melvin shapiro liable on the basis of the guaranty he signed on the transfer of the business from sbic to dci.the court rejected his position that the guaranty acted only prospectively and did not take effect until after the spills occurred.
we consider multiple appeals in each action.
discussion 
application of cercla to soil and groundwater contamination in nevada does not offend the commerce clause 
maryland square appeal challenges the application of cercla to the contamination of the site as violating the commerce clause,because the pce disposal physically affected the site and a nearby neighborhood within the state of nevada.the district court summarily rejected this claim.maryland square relies primarily on the supreme court opinions in united states lopez,and united states morrison,the two commerce clause decisions of the last twenty years invalidating congressional enactments.neither involved environmental issues.lopez concerned regulation of conduct near a school and morrison involved violence against an individual.
the constitution states that the congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,and with the indian tribes.const.art.i,cl.this grant of authority has been separated into three broad categories.perez united states.under its commerce power,congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate or foreign commerce,the instrumentalities of interstate commerce or persons or things in commerce,and those activities affecting commerce.id.these categories were recognized in both lopez and morrison.maryland square contends that none of the three categories apply,but two of them do.
the application of cercla to contaminated soil and groundwater is proper under the second and third categories as regulation of articles in commerce and activities affecting commerce.groundwater may be regulated as an article of commerce,because any item that may be bought or sold,indeed all objects of trade,are articles of commerce.see fort gratiot sanitary landfill,michigan dep t of natural.the supreme court has expressly held that groundwater is an article of commerce,because it can be traded.sporhase nebraska,ex rel.douglas.there,the state of nebraska,in defending a state law limiting the interstate sale of nebraska groundwater,tried to contend that groundwater was not an article of commerce.id.at.according to nebraska,groundwater was not an article of commerce because nebraska residents did not enjoy an unlimited ownership interest in the groundwater they withdrew and because groundwater was essential to its citizens survival.id.at.the supreme court rejected this argument,citing nebraska efforts to limit the sale of groundwater within the state as proof that groundwater is an object of trade.id.at the claim that nebraska ground water is not an article of commerce goes too far it would not only exempt nebraska ground water regulation from analysis,it would also curtail the affirmative power of congress to implement its own policies concerning such regulation of groundwater.
maryland square position in this case,that groundwater found within a state can not be an article of interstate commerce,is the same as the position the court rejected in sporhase.indeed,the supreme court emphasized that the federal government has a significant interest in groundwater because groundwater is found in multistate aquifers and facilitates irrigated farming that supplies markets worldwide.id.at.congress,by making the protection of groundwater and surface water a main priority of cercla,acted on that federal interest.see c.
in addition,we deal with a dry cleaning establishment that created the contamination as part of its commercial operation,and resulted in clean up costs that burdened commerce.the clean up,as well as the business itself,substantially affect interstate commerce.application of cercla is supported for those reasons as well.the eleventh circuit in united states olin corporation,cir,recognized the economic burden of clean up costs in rejecting a challenge to cercla very similar to the one in this case.the chemical manufacturer in olin contended that its disposal of hazardous substances did not affect interstate commerce because the substances never left the site.id.at.the court rejected that contention,stating that congress,in passing cercla,recognized the growing economic costs of handling and disposing hazardous substances and that these costs were associated with both and disposal.id.also recognizing that hazardous substance clean up affects interstate commerce,the second circuit in freier westinghouse electric corporation,cir,rejected a commerce clause challenge to an amendment to cercla affecting the statute of limitations for claims resulting from exposure to hazardous substances.in upholding this amendment as an integral part of cercla regulatory scheme,the court stated that the generation and disposal of waste in connection with the operation of a business are economic activities properly regulated under the commerce clause.id.at.
the supreme court decisions in lopez and morrison concerning activity are not relevant here,for the court holding in both depended upon the conclusion that the activities sought to be regulated were not commercial activities.see lopez,at the criminal statute prohibiting the knowing possession of a firearm in a school zone had nothing do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise morrison,at violent crimes are not economic activity.
the supreme court has consistently held that congress,under the commerce clause,can regulate commercial activities,even where the economic impact of the individual defendant actions were far smaller than in this case,as with home cultivation of medical marijuana.gonzales raich.the court has made no de minimus exception.courts will not excise,as trivial,individual instances of a class of activities that is within the federal power.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.
ii.maryland square has not shown that it qualifies for an exception to cercla liability,and it is clearly responsible for reimbursement under nevada state law 
maryland square contends that even if cercla may be constitutionally applied,maryland square nevertheless should not be liable because it qualifies as a bona fide prospective purchaser under cercla.it also challenges its liability under the nevada state law requiring the owners of a contaminated site and those responsible for the hazardous spill to reimburse the state after it cleans up the contamination.we deal with each contention in turn.
maryland square did not establish that it qualifies as a bona fide prospective purchaser under cercla 
cercla is a strict liability statute in that it does not require a party to act culpably in order to be liable for clean up.cal.of toxic substances control hearthside residential,cir.our court has described the four elements that create liability.stevens creek associates barclays bank of,cir.a plaintiff must establish the site containing the hazardous substances is a facility under cercla a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance has occurred from that facility the plaintiff incurred response costs as a result of that release or threatened release and those costs were necessary and consistent with the national contingency plan and the defendant is in one of the categories of entities subject to the liability provisions of cercla a.id.
maryland square does not contest the first three elements.the site is a facility under cercla because hazardous substances were disposed there.a hazardous substance was released when the operators spilled pce down the drain,through the pipes and into the environment.ndep response was necessary because no party had taken responsibility for the clean up.a.
maryland square contends it falls within r,the bona fide prospective purchaser exception to liability.this provision exempts from liability those who in good faith purchased a property they did not contaminate,but only provided they meet certain conditions.it states that 
a bona fide prospective purchaser whose potential liability for a release or threatened release is based solely on the purchaser being considered to be an owner or operator of a facility shall not be liable as long as the bona fide prospective purchaser does not impede the performance of a response action or natural resource restoration.
the statute further provides,however,that a defendant must meet eight separate criteria to qualify as a bona fide prospective purchaser.a h.an owner seeking to qualify as a bona fide prospective purchaser must establish,among other things,that it purchased the property after the hazardous substances were spilled,a,made all appropriate inquiries before it purchased the property,b,provided all legally required notices about the hazardous substances,c,and took steps to stop any ongoing spill,prevent future spills,and limit the exposure from past spills,d.
regulations further spell out the steps an owner must take to qualify.an owner seeking to establish that it made all appropriate inquiries,for example,must show that the examination was performed by an environmental professional,as defined in,that particular kinds of information about the property,its history and its value were collected,and that various sources were consulted.all of these steps must be taken prior to the purchase,but no more than a year before the purchase date.the owner,furthermore,must interview past owners and operators,search for environmental cleanup liens,review government records,inspect the property,and obtain a declaration by the environmental professional no more than days before the purchase date.id.
maryland square attempted to establish it satisfied these requirements by submitting the supplemental affidavit of paul roberts,maryland square manager.the district court did not consider this submission because it was not notarized,and for that reason concluded that maryland square had failed to meet its burden.
the affidavit should have been notarized,but the district court did not give maryland square an opportunity to correct that deficiency.nor did the court consider the contents of the submission to determine whether they would have been sufficient if notarized.the parties on appeal assume the truth of the statements and address the merits of maryland square contention that the facts stated would show it qualifies as a bona fide prospective purchaser.
roberts submission stated that the seller,clark county school district,disclosed the pce contamination during the sale negotiations and that maryland square then retained counsel and hired entrix,an environmental consulting firm,to review and report on the ndep files concerning the site.after purchasing the site,maryland square hired an environmental contractor to demolish the building.the submission does not indicate that maryland square took any remedial steps,such as removing the soil after demolishing the building,but says only that maryland square followed the progress of the previous owners in drafting and submitting plans to clean up the site,and that maryland square had some mainly undescribed correspondence with ndep.
the statements in the submission are insufficient to establish maryland square satisfied the requirements for bona fide prospective purchaser status.they do not establish maryland square met requirements of d to prevent further harm,because maryland square failed to limit human and environmental exposure to a contamination already present.the submission acknowledges maryland square purchased the site with knowledge of the contamination,and subsequently demolished the building,an action that exposed the contaminated soil to the elements,but identifies no steps that it took to remove the contaminated soil or limit the spread of pce.ndep was then forced to remove the contaminated soil six years after the building was destroyed,thereby creating a situation contemplated by congress when enacting cercla reimbursement of a government entity forced to clean up a site because the owner refused to take action.see a a.
in addition,maryland square submission does not discuss the numerous regulatory requirements for making appropriate inquiries.see b,et.the submission,without providing necessary supporting information,merely states that maryland square retained entrix,to review files and prepare a report.it does not indicate if entrix employed a qualified environmental professional,the substance of the report,or any description of the assessment conducted.see,et.maryland square submission was woefully insufficient to establish it was a bona fide prospective purchaser within the meaning of cercla.
the district court,however,rejected the submission on the basis of its form rather than its substance,and did not give maryland square a chance to make any additional showing.we therefore vacate the district court grant of summary judgment against maryland square so that it may have an opportunity to cure the formal and substantive deficiencies of its prior submission and establish that it has met the statutory and regulatory requirements to qualify as a bona fide prospective purchaser.
maryland square is liable to the state under nevada law because it owned the property and failed to remove the contaminated soil 
pursuant to nevada law,nevada has established an account from which it may spend money to respond to a hazardous spill,manage the clean up of a contaminated site,and remove the hazardous substance.under the statute,money from the account for the management of hazardous waste may be spent to pay the costs of responding to a leak or spill if the person responsible did not promptly clean it up.id.once this money has been spent,the statute instructs ndep to demand reimbursement from various people,including any person who owns or controls the area used for the disposal of the waste,material or substance.id.this must include the current owner.
maryland square,as the current owner,tries to maintain it is not responsible under the statute because it did not own the site at the time of the pce disposal.however,the state statute contains no exceptions,nor does it limit the reimbursement obligation to those responsible for the spill.
maryland square also challenges the grant of injunctive relief under nevada revised statutes,on the ground that it was not responsible for any discharges of pce.under this statute,ndep may seek an injunction to prevent the continuance or occurrence of any act or practice which violates any provision of nrs to id.ndep contends that maryland square violated,a state statute that encompasses not only discharges,but also the failure to clean up a spilled contaminant that may enter the state waters.the statute makes it unlawful to a llow a pollutant discharged from a point source or fluids injected through a well to remain in a place where the pollutant or fluids could be carried into the waters of the state by any means.d.maryland square allowed pce to remain in the soil for six years,and the pce did enter the waters of the state.the district court,therefore,correctly granted summary judgment on ndep claim for injunctive relief as well.
iii.ndep was entitled to summary judgment against the operator,sbic,on the cercla and state law claims 
ndep sued sbic under cercla because sbic operated the dry cleaning facility and disposed of the pce.among the categories of entities that cercla holds liable are operators of a facility where there was a disposal of hazardous substances.cercla liability may be assessed against any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of.a.disposal means the discharge,spilling,leaking,or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water so that such solid waste or hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters,including ground waters.sbic principal challenge to its cercla liability is that it did not operate the facility at the time of disposal because it leaked the contaminant onto the floor,not into the natural environment.
sbic does not dispute the facts.it operated the dry cleaning facility at the site between and august.sbic lease agreement for the facility called for it to be built with a trench style sewage drain adequate for sbic business.sbic admits that it used pce in its operations and that it regularly spilled pce on the concrete floor,and once spilled roughly gallons of pce during a filter change in.
sbic argues that spilling pce onto the floor,rather than directly onto the land or water,does not count as a disposal.sbic argument,therefore,is that the statute must be interpreted to require a disposal directly into the groundwater or onto the land.this interpretation is contrary to the language of the statute.a disposal under the statute includes any discharge or spill of waste into or on any land or water so that the waste may enter the environment emphasis added.because the phrase enter the environment is qualified by the word may in the definition of disposal,the statute can not be interpreted to cover only spills that go directly and immediately into the groundwater.the statute contemplates that some spills may never enter the environment.the definition covers more than direct spills.sbic interpretation conflicts with our practice of construing cercla liberally to achieve the goals of cleaning up hazardous waste sites promptly and ensuring that the responsible parties pay the costs of the clean up.carson harbor,unocal,cir.
the only other courts to consider an interpretation like sbic requiring disposal to be directly onto the land or into the water have rejected it.see amland props.aluminum of,concluding that a disposal inside a plant was a disposal on any land lincoln properties,higgins,no.s,wl,at,stating that a release into the environment need not be direct.their reasoning is sound.sbic cites no contrary authority on point.
because we conclude that ndep has established sbic liability for past costs under cercla,ndep is also entitled to a declaratory judgment for future costs.city of colton am.promotional events,cir.in city of colton,we held that a plaintiff who establishes liability for past response costs under cercla is entitled to a declaratory judgment on liability for future costs.id.citing g.
sbic also,and on a similar basis,challenges the district court grant of summary judgment on ndep state law claim under,which authorizes injunctive relief to prevent the continuation or reoccurrence of other statutory violations.sbic contends that it did not operate the facility at the time the pce actually touched the soil or groundwater.this fact is not relevant.ndep has charged that sbic violated,which makes it unlawful to d ischarge from any point source any pollutant into any waters of the state.a,d.a drain pipe is a point source.sbic spilled pce into the drain of the facility.the pce was thus discharged through the drains as the point sources.sbic is therefore liable for the resulting contamination of the groundwater.
iv.the district court did not decide the issue raised by maryland square motion for reconsideration,so remand is required to determine whether maryland square has rcra liability for exposing the contamination to the elements 
the homeowners sought an injunction under rcra to require all of the owners of the site,including maryland square,to clean up the contamination.an entity may be held liable under rcra if it is an active contributor to the contamination on the site.liability may be assessed against 
any person who has contributed or who is contributing to the past or present handling,storage,treatment,transportation,or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.
a b.maryland square original position was the same as the other owners of the site ownership of the site was insufficient to establish liability.the district court rejected the site owners contention and granted summary judgment for the homeowners.
maryland square then moved for rehearing and advanced a new theory.it contended that it was in a different position from the other owners because it acquired the property after the dry cleaning facility had closed down.the homeowners opposed the motion for rehearing on the ground that even if maryland square did not own the site when the spills happened,maryland square demolition of the building in exposed the contaminated soil,exacerbating the problem and making maryland square a contributor.the homeowners relied on the expert report that they had attached to their summary judgment reply and that explained the effects of the demolition.
the district court did not res
