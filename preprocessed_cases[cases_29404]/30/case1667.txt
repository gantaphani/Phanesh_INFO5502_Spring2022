real parties in interest and respondents mitchell kapor and freada kapor klein secured permits from respondent city of berkeley city to build a large home on a large lot in the berkeley hills,and appellants berkeley hillside preservation and susan nunes fadley challenged the project under the california environmental quality act ceqa,pub.resources code,et the first time we considered this challenge,we concluded,contrary to the city determination,that the project presented unusual circumstances,thus triggering an exception to ceqa categorical exemptions,tit,subd.c see,et,guidelines for implementation of ceqa guidelines and requiring the preparation of an environmental impact report eir.the supreme court reversed,held that a potentially significant environmental effect is not alone sufficient to trigger the unusual circumstances exception,and provided detailed guidance on the applicable standards of review in a challenge to an agency determination that the unusual circumstances exception is inapplicable.the court remanded to us so that we could properly analyze whether the exception applies.having done so,we now conclude that sufficient evidence supports the city conclusion the project is categorically exempt from further ceqa review.we therefore affirm the trial court order denying appellants petition for a writ of mandate.
factual and procedural background 
kapor and kapor klein want to build a large house on a lot they own on rose street.the lot is on a steep slope approximately percent grade in a heavily wooded area.in may,their architect applied to the city for a use permit to demolish the existing house on the lot and to build a square foot house with an attached square foot car garage.the residence would be built on two floors,would include an lower level,and would cover about percent of the lot.berkeley hillside preservation city of berkeley cal th,berkeley hillside.
the city zoning adjustments board board,after holding a public hearing and receiving comments about the project,approved the use permit in january.it found the project exempt from ceqa review under two different categorical ceqa exemptions,which are classes of projects that have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment,subd.a.the first exemption,class,includes construction and location of limited numbers of new,small facilities or structures,including o ne residence,or a second dwelling unit in a residential zone,and up to three residences i n urbanized areas.guidelines,subd.a.the second exemption,class,applies to a project characterized as development meeting the following conditions it is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations it occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses its site has no value as habitat for endangered,rare or threatened species and can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services and its approval would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic,noise,air quality,or water quality.guidelines,accord,berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at.
guidelines section,subdivision c provides an exception to ceqa categorical exemptions.it provides a categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.we refer to this as the unusual circumstances exception.the board found that the exception did not apply because the project as proposed and approved would not have any significant effects on the environment due to unusual circumstances.
the board approved a use permit to demolish the existing dwelling on the lot,a use permit to construct the proposed unit,an administrative use permit to allow a foot average height limit for the main building with feet being the maximum usually allowed,and an administrative use permit to reduce the setback of the front yard to feet with feet usually required.the board imposed various standard conditions on the proposed construction,including requiring the permit applicant to secure a construction traffic management plan,comply with storm water regulations for small construction activities,and take steps to minimize erosion and landslides when construction takes place during the wet season.
several residents of the city,including appellant susan nunes fadley,filed an appeal with the berkeley city council,arguing in part that ceqa categorical exemptions do not apply because the proposed project unusual size,location,nature and scope will have significant environmental impact on its surroundings.they asserted that the proposed residence would be one of the largest houses in berkeley,four times the average house size in its vicinity,and situated in a canyon where the existing houses are of a much smaller scale.they submitted evidence that,of berkeley over residences,only exceed square feet,only exceed square feet,and only one exceeds square feet.they also asserted that the proposed residence would exceed the maximum allowable height under berkeley municipal code and would be inconsistent with the policies of the city general plan,and that an eir environmental impact report is appropriate to evaluate the proposed construction potential impact on noise,air quality,historic resources,and neighborhood safety.in response,the city director of planning and development stated that residences within feet of the project have a greater ratio and that berkeley dwellings exceed square feet,nine exceed square feet,and five exceed square feet.
the city council received numerous letters and regarding the appeal,some in support and some in opposition.among the appeal supporters was lawrence karp,an architect and geotechnical engineer.in a letter dated april,karp stated he had reviewed the architectural plans and topographical survey filed with the board,and had visited the proposed construction site p ortions of the major fill for the project are shown to be placed on an existing slope inclined at about h v to create a new slope more than v t hese slopes can not be constructed by earthwork and all fill must be benched and keyed into the slope which is not shown in the sections or accounted for in the earthwork quantities.to accomplish elevations shown on the architectural plans,shoring and major retaining walls not shown will have to be constructed resulting in much larger earthwork quantities than now expected the massive grading necessary would involve extensive trucking operations the work that would be necessary has never before been accomplished in the greater area of the project outside of reservoirs or construction on the university of california campus and tilden park the project site is located alongside the major trace of the hayward fault and it is mapped within a state designated landslide hazard zone and the project as proposed is likely to have very significant environmental impacts not only during the construction but in service due to the probability of seismic lurching of the oversteepened fills.
in a second letter addressing the investigation of geotechnical engineer alan kropp,karp stated no fill slopes were shown in kropp plan and the recommendations for retaining walls do not include lateral earth pressures for slopes with inclinations of more than v or for wall heights more than feet the project architectural plans include and elevations that are inconsistent with the site plan and limitations in kropp report all vegetation will have to be removed for grading,and retaining walls totaling feet in height will be necessary to achieve grades.vertical cuts for grading and retaining walls will total about feet feet for bench cutting and feet for wall cutting.a drawing in the kropp report depicts site drainage to be collected and discharged into an energy dissipater dug into the slope,which is inconsistent with the intended very steep fill slopes and the project as proposed is likely to have very significant environmental impacts not only during construction,but in service due to the probability of seismic lurching of the oversteepened fills.
in response,kropp stated that the project site is in an area where an investigation is required to evaluate the potential for landslides,and that he had conducted the necessary investigation and found there is,in fact,no landslide hazard.kropp also stated that,in raising concerns about fill,karp had misread the project plans.according to kropp,the only fill placed by the downhill portion of the home will be backfill for backyard retaining walls and there will be no fill placed for the project.the current ground surface,along with the vegetation,will be maintained on the downhill portion of the lot.because there will not,as karp claimed,be any steep,fill constructed,karp concerns do not apply to the proposed construction.a civil engineer,jim toby,also submitted a letter stating that he saw no evidence in the project plans that fill will be placed directly on steep slopes and that karp contrary assertion is based on a misreading of the plans.
in support of the permit approval,the city director of planning and development submitted a supplemental report stating a geotechnical report was prepared and signed by a licensed geotechnical engineer and a certified engineering geologist.this report concluded that the site was suitable for the proposed dwelling from a geotechnical standpoint and that no landslide risk was present at the site.should this project proceed,the design of the dwelling will require engineering to obtain a building permit.berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at pp.
the city council took up the appeal at a meeting on april.after hearing from speakers,including karp and kropp,the council adopted the board findings,affirmed the permit approval,and dismissed the appeal.the city planning department later filed a notice of exemption stating that the project was categorically exempt from ceqa under guidelines sections,subdivision a small residences,and development projects,and that the unusual circumstances exception guidelines,did not apply.
fadley then filed a petition for writ of mandate in the trial court,joined by appellant berkeley hillside preservation,which is a unincorporated association of city residents and concerned citizens who enjoy and appreciate the berkeley hills and their environs and desire to protect the city historic,cultural,architectural,and natural resources.berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at.appellants briefly contended that the city erred in finding that the project was categorically exempt from ceqa review but acknowledged that the deferential substantial evidence standard of review applied.they contended that the unusual circumstances exception to the categorical exemptions applied,because the project may result in significant environmental impacts due to unusual circumstances.following a hearing,the trial court denied the petition.it first concluded that the administrative record contained substantial evidence to support the city application of the class and class categorical exemptions.it next found that the unusual circumstances exception guidelines,subd.c did not preclude application of those categorical exemptions because,notwithstanding evidence of potentially significant environmental effects,the proposed project does not present any unusual circumstances.appellants appealed to this court.
similar to their strategy in the trial court,appellants conceded that the deferential substantial evidence standard applies to the city initial choice of applicable categories,and thus did not challenge,as an evidentiary matter,the findings that those exemptions applied.they did argue in passing,however,that as a legal matter,the exemptions could not be applied in this situation because the city had imposed mitigation measures directed at the increased traffic in the area,which precluded a finding of a categorical exemption.most of appellants argument focused on whether there was a fair argument of a significant effect on the environment based on potential geotechnical impacts,detrimental effects on aesthetics and views,inconsistencies with the city general plan and zoning,and traffic impacts.according to appellants,these potential environmental impacts constituted an unusual circumstance that triggered the exception to categorical exemptions under guidelines section,subdivision c.
this court agreed with appellants that the potential geotechnical effects of the project could affect the environment and thus the unusual circumstances exception to the applicable categorical exemptions applied.in light of that conclusion,the court did not address appellants argument that the board adoption of a plan was a mitigation measure that precluded a finding of a categorical exemption.
the supreme court reversed,concluding it was apparent that neither the trial court nor this court had correctly analyzed whether unusual circumstances precluded the application of categorical exemptions.berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at.the court remanded the case to this court,and the parties have filed supplemental briefs.
discussiona.legal framework and standard of review announced in berkeley hillside.
in this court previous opinion,we held that where there is a fair argument that proposed activity may have an effect on the environment,that is itself an unusual circumstance triggering the unusual circumstances exception to ceqa categorical exemptions.the supreme court held that our conclusion was incorrect.it noted the approach was inconsistent with the legislature direction to the secretary of the natural resources agency secretary,in adopting categorical exemptions to ceqa,to make a finding that the list or classification of projects do not have a significant effect on the environment.berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at,quoting former,italics added.t he legislature,through the guidelines,intended to enumerate classes of projects that are exempt from ceqa because,notwithstanding their potential effect on the environment,they already have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment,subd.a.the guidelines implement this intent,by setting forth the classes of projects that the secretary,acting i n response to the legislature mandate,has found do not have a significant effect on the environment.guidelines.thus,construing the unusual circumstances exception as requiring more than a showing of a fair argument that the proposed activity may have a significant environmental effect is fully consistent with the legislature intent.berkeley hillside,at pp,original italics.
t o establish the unusual circumstances exception,it is not enough for a challenger merely to provide substantial evidence that the project may have a significant effect on the environment,because that is the inquiry ceqa requires absent an exemption.such a showing is inadequate to overcome the secretary determination that the typical effects of a project within an exempt class are not significant for ceqa purposes.on the other hand,evidence that the project will have a significant effect does tend to prove that some circumstance of the project is unusual.an agency presented with such evidence must determine,based on the entire record before it including contrary evidence regarding significant environmental effects whether there is an unusual circumstance that justifies removing the project from the exempt class.berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at,original italics.a party invoking the exception may establish an unusual circumstance without evidence of an environmental effect,by showing that the project has some feature that distinguishes it from others in the exempt class,such as its size or location.in such a case,to render the exception applicable,the party need only show a reasonable possibility of a significant effect due to that unusual circumstance.alternatively,under the supreme court reading of the guideline,a party may establish an unusual circumstance with evidence that the project will have a significant environmental effect.that evidence,if convincing,necessarily also establishes a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.guidelines,subd.c.ibid.
our review of the city decision that unusual circumstances are not present is governed by section,which provides that this court inquiry is whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.see berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at.b oth prongs of section abuse of discretion standard apply on review of an agency decision with respect to the unusual circumstances exception.the determination as to whether there are unusual circumstances guidelines,subd.c is reviewed under section substantial evidence prong.however,an agency finding as to whether unusual circumstances give rise to a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment guidelines,subd.c is reviewed to determine whether the agency,in applying the fair argument standard,proceeded in the manner required by law.id.at.
whether a particular project presents circumstances that are unusual for projects in an exempt class is an essentially factual inquiry,founded on the application of the tribunal experience with the mainsprings of human conduct.citation.accordingly,as to this question,the agency serves as the finder of fact citation,and a reviewing court should apply the traditional substantial evidence standard that section incorporates.citation.under that relatively deferential standard of review reviewing courts,after resolving all evidentiary conflicts in the agency favor and indulging in all legitimate and reasonable inferences to uphold the agency finding must affirm that finding if there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,to support it.berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at.
where there are unusual circumstances,it is appropriate for agencies to apply the fair argument standard in determining whether there is a reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.guidelines,subd.c.as to this question,the reviewing court function is to determine whether substantial evidence support s the agency conclusion as to whether the prescribed fair argument could be made.berkeley hills,supra,cal th at.this bifurcated approach to the questions of unusual circumstances and potentially significant effects comports with our construction of the unusual circumstances exception to require findings of both unusual circumstances and a potentially significant effect,original italics.
substantial evidence supports finding of no unusual circumstances.
applicability of categorical exemptions.
in reviewing the city decision once again,we begin with appellants concession that the record contains substantial evidence supporting the applicability of the relevant categorical exemptions.again,although appellants argued to the city council that the project is not categorically exempt,they have not pursued this argument in any judicial forum given the deferential standard of review,and this position has not changed on remand from the supreme court.that is,they do not contend the administrative record lacks substantial evidence to support the city determination that the class and class exemptions apply to the proposed construction.see fairbank city of mill valley th.we therefore start from the understanding that the board finding that the proposed construction belongs to a classification of projects that do not have a significant effect on the environment is supported by substantial evidence berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at,which in turn means there is substantial evidence the project involves a residence in an urbanized area guidelines,subd.a and it also is consistent with the applicable general plan as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations,is located within city limits on a site of no more than five acres surrounded by urban uses,is situated in an area that has no value for threatened species and can be adequately served by public services,and will not result in any significant effects relating to traffic,noise,air quality,or water quality guidelines.
where this court previously erred was in accepting appellants concession but then proceeding to separately analyze the unusual circumstances exception to the exemptions,without sufficiently appreciating how the two are related.this led to the analytical mistake of using the de novo standard of review to consider whether unusual circumstances were present.we concluded as a matter of law that the size of the proposed structure a square foot home with an attached square foot,car garage combining for a total of just over square feet was unusual within the meaning of the unusual circumstances exception.again,however,we in fact review an agency decision that a particular project does not present circumstances that are unusual for projects in an exempt class under the relatively deferential standard of review.berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at.a fter resolving all evidentiary conflicts in the agency favor and indulging in all legitimate and reasonable inferences to uphold the agency finding whether a particular project presents circumstances that are unusual for projects in an exempt class,we must affirm that finding if there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,to support it,italics added.
on remand,appellants continue to argue that the project presents unusual circumstances based on its size,environmental setting,and its inconsistency with berkeley general plan.they acknowledge that we review the city determination of unusual circumstances for substantial evidence,but they do not sufficiently address this in the context of their previous concession that substantial evidence supports the city determination that the class and class exemptions apply.appellants focus on all the characteristics of the project that distinguish it from the typical berkeley house there are only a handful of residences in the city that are more than square feet,it will be located in a landslide hazard zone,it will be architecturally inconsistent with other homes in the area,and it will adversely affect views.but to concede that substantial evidence supports the applicability of the class and class exemptions on this record,thereby putting the proposed project within a class that presumptively does not have an effect on the environment,is to concede,in effect,that there is no feature distinguishing it from the exempt class 
as parties challenging the applicability of a categorical exemption,appellants had the burden below to produce evidence supporting an exception to the exemption.see berkeley hillside,supra,cal th at.what their argument boils down to here again on remand is that they presented evidence the proposed home will be unusual in the sense it will not be typical.even assuming they met their burden of production with this argument,they fail to come to terms with the stringent standard of review that berkeley hillside directs us to apply at this stage of the proceedings.our focus at this point is to resolve all evidentiary conflicts in the city favor,indulge in all legitimate and reasonable inferences to uphold the city finding,and affirm that finding if there is any substantial evidence,even if contradicted,to support it.id.at.we do not hesitate to do so in light of appellants concession that substantial evidence supports the applicability of the relevant exemptions here.
the proper resolution of this case in light of the supreme court guidance is clear upon close scrutiny of each of appellants individual arguments.we now turn to those arguments.
size of proposed home.
when they challenged the board approval of the project to the city,appellants argued the project was not a standard single family home for two people.they claimed that public statements by kapor and kapor klein about planned philanthropic activities at the home indicated the residence might fall outside the city definition of home occupation and might be used for activities other than normal residential occupancy by two people.the city director of planning and
