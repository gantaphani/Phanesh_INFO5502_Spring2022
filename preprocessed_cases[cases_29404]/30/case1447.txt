the environmental protection agency epa issued a final rule increasing the stringency of the oxides of nitrogen nox emission standards applicable to newly certified commercial aircraft gas turbine engines under of the clean air act caa or act.see control of air pollution from aircraft and aircraft engines emission standards and test procedures,final rule.arguing that the final rule did not go far enough,the national association of clean air agencies nacaa,a national trade association that represents state and local governmental agencies responsible for achieving and sustaining clean air,petitions for review.specifically,nacaa argues that epa interpretation of the does not require the agency to subordinate all other concerns to emissions reduction and reach a an impermissible construction of the act.petitioner also argues that the final rule is arbitrary and capricious because it relies upon an insufficient time rationale,fails to establish a firm timeline for tightening standards in the future,considers safety concerns with little explanation,and departs from epa practice of setting production dates.epa defends the final rule and argues that nacaa lacks standing to challenge it.
although we conclude that nacaa has standing,we find no merit in the petition for review.we hold that epa interpretation of is not manifestly contrary to the caa and that the agency did not otherwise act arbitrarily and capriciously in promulgating the final rule.most of the arbitrary and capricious claims raised by nacaa are not properly before the court,because they were never raised with epa.nacaa preserved claim that the final rule departs from epa practice of setting production dates lacks merit because the final rule provides a reasoned explanation for the agency change in course.because we find that none of nacaa claims are meritorious,we deny the petition for review in all respects.
background 
the clean air act establishes a joint state and federal program for regulating the nation air quality.envtl.def.epa,internal quotation marks omitted.the caa requires epa to promulgate,review,and revise national ambient air quality standards naaqs,specifying maximum levels of certain air pollutants in the ambient air.see.states,in turn,are required to adopt state implementation plans sips that provide for implementation,maintenance,and enforcement of naaqs envtl,at quoting a.states that fail to comply with th is requirement are subject to various sanctions appalachian power epa,per curiam citing.
section of the caa requires the administrator of epa to study and investigate emissions of air pollutants from aircraft,considering such emissions effect on air quality and the technological feasibility of controlling them.a.the administrator shall then,from time to time,issue proposed standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from aircraft engines which in his judgment causes,or contributes to,air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.id.a a.after holding public hearings,the administrator must issue such regulations with such modifications as he deems appropriate.id.a.section also authorizes the administrator to revise such regulations from time to time,but mandates that he not change the standards if such change would significantly increase noise and adversely affect safety.id.a b,a see also id.c establishing additional procedure focused on aircraft safety.furthermore,a ny regulation prescribed under shall take effect after such period as the administrator finds necessary to permit the development and application of the requisite technology,giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such period.id.b.this power to set standards resides in epa alone no state or political subdivision thereof may adopt or attempt to enforce any standard respecting emissions of any air pollutant from any aircraft or engine thereof unless such standard is identical to the federal standard.id.
epa does not regulate on a blank slate.b y virtue of being a party to the chicago convention on international civil aviation,stat,the united states is a member of the united nations international civil aviation organization icao.wardair canada.dep t of revenue,d.as long as a participating nation adopts domestic aircraft emission standards that are equal to or more stringent than icao environmental standards,aircraft belonging to that nation are permitted to travel through the airspace of other countries without any restriction.final rule.at.but any one of the approximately contracting nations can ban use within its airspace of any aircraft that does not meet icao standards.id.in,icao first adopted standards governing emissions of nox,a precursor to the formation of ozone and cause of acid rain,eutrophication,plant damage,and visibility impairment.id.at.in,icao approved a proposal to tighten the icao standards by.see id.at.epa altered its regulations to adopt the icao standards in.id.icao approved an additional nox reduction in.id.
on september,approximately three months before the icao standards were set to take effect,epa published a notice of proposed rulemaking declaring its intent to adopt standards equivalent to the nox standards of icao,and thereby bring the united states emission standards into alignment with the internationally adopted standards.see control of air pollution from aircraft and aircraft engines emission standards and test procedures,nprm.after epa held a public hearing on the nprm and after the close of the written comment period,icao again lowered permissible nox emissions,this time by approximately,and slated the new standards to take effect after december.final rule.at.the final rule,issued in november,amends epa regulations to reflect the icao standards a reduction from the previous epa standards,not the more stringent reduction approved by icao during the pendency of the rulemaking.id.at.
the final rule recognizes that the new standards will not impose any additional burden on manufacturers,because percent of all engine models currently in production already meet the icao standards.id.at.the final rule also acknowledges icao standards and states that m ore stringent standards will likely be necessary and appropriate in the future.id.at.but it reasons that assess ing the costs and emission benefits of more stringent standards would have required additional time that epa did not then have since it had already gone past the implementation date of the icao standards.id.at.the final rule ultimately justifies its adoption of the icao standards as aimed at assuring that progress is not reversed in the future and as part of an ongoing phased approach to address ing emissions from aircraft engines.id.at.
in a similar vein,the final rule extends the icao standards only to newly certified engine models,not to newly manufactured engines of already certified models.id.at.although the final rule recognizes that epa has historically adopted production for previous standards,it distinguishes the unique case of aircraft engine emissions.id.at.because icao did not apply its standards to newly manufactured engines of already certified models,id.at,the final rule reasons that to apply the reduction to those engines a production could be disruptive to the production planning of engine manufacturers,id.at.moreover,to develop a record that fully analyzes the emissions benefits if any and the implementation costs of wider applicability would unacceptably slow down th e rulemaking.id.at.the final rule concludes i n the interests of expediency and of bringing domestic law into conformity with obligations under the chicago convention albeit tardily,the most appropriate course for now is to simply update epa regulations to track the icao standards in terms of both stringency levels and scope of applicability.id.
the final rule interprets of the caa to authorize this ongoing phased approach 
epa interprets its authority under section to be somewhat similar to those provisions that require us to identify a reasonable balance of specified emissions reduction,cost,safety,noise,and other factors.however,we are not compelled under section to obtain the greatest degree of emission reduction achievable as per other provisions of the caa,and so epa does not interpret the act as requiring the agency to give subordinate status to factors such as cost,safety,and noise in determining what standards are reasonable for aircraft engines.rather,epa has greater flexibility under section in determining what standard is most reasonable for aircraft engines,and is not required to achieve a result.
id.at internal citation omitted.the final rule also notes that there is an added emphasis in on the consideration of safety.therefore,it is reasonable for epa to give greater weight to considerations of safety in this context than it might in balancing emissions reduction,cost,and energy factors under other caa provisions.id.internal citations omitted.epa promulgated the final rule on november.
on january,state and territorial air pollution program administrators and association of local air pollution control officials filed a petition for review of the final rule.the two organizations have since merged to form nacaa.
ii.analysis 
at the outset,we must address epa contention that nacaa has failed to demonstrate standing to challenge the final rule,and that this court thus lacks jurisdiction to entertain the petition for review.see byrd epa,citing steel citizens for a better env t,d.associations such as petitioner have representational standing under article iii if at least one of their members has standing,the interests the association seeks to protect are germane to its purpose,and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of an individual member in the lawsuit.am.library ass fcc.since epa does not contest that nacaa satisfies the germaneness and element s of representational standing,and because we too have no reason to believe that nacaa fails to satisfy these latter two requirements,nuclear energy,epa,per curiam quoting sierra club epa,we focus solely upon whether at least one of nacaa members has standing to sue in its own right,natural res.def.council epa.
the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing has three elements injury in fact,causation,and redressability.grassroots recycling network,epa,quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.although epa makes a halfhearted attempt to contest the final two elements,see respondent br.at,t he only thing at issue in this case is the prong of article iii standing,for causation and redressability are obvious if petitioner can demonstrate injury,am.library ass fcc.in order to demonstrate injury,petitioner must show that there is a substantial probability that epa final rule will harm the concrete and particularized interests of at least one of its members.am.library ass n,at internal quotation marks omitted.
through references to the administrative record and an affidavit submitted with its opening brief,nacaa adequately demonstrates that,by failing to further tighten restrictions on nox,the final rule makes it more difficult for state air pollution control agencies to establish sips.in other words,since the federal naaqs cap the total allowable nox,when epa allows higher nox emissions from aircraft engines,state agencies have no choice but to impose greater restrictions on other sources of nox.and if nacaa member agencies fail to meet the applicable standard,their states are exposed to federal sanctions.epa essentially concedes these facts,but disputes their jurisdictional significance,arguing that since the burden at most can be understood as affecting the mix of controls a state may need to impose,the final rule does not require states and local agencies to do anything as regulators that they were not already directed to do.respondent br.at.
we have little difficulty concluding that nacaa has satisfied the requirement of article iii standing.in west virginia epa,petitioners sought review of epa rules requiring various states to revise state implementation plans as to nox emissions and establishing emission limits for major nox sources.the effect of the rules was to lower the states emission budgets.budgets represent the amount of allowable nox emissions.we found that t he lower the emissions budget,the more difficult and onerous is the states task of devising an adequate sip.id.at.we therefore held that the state petitioners in that case had demonstrated injury where epa lowered states total nox emissions budgets,requiring states to revise their sips to impose additional controls.id.
the standing issue in this case is controlled by our rationale and judgment in west virginia.here,by allegedly raising or failing to lower the emissions allocated to one source,the final rule requires states to impose stricter controls on emissions from other individual sources.in other words,the final rule makes it more difficult and onerous for the states to devis e an adequate sip.id.because there is a substantial probability that epa action will harm the interests of nacaa state agency members,nacaa has standing to challenge the final rule and we have jurisdiction to consider the merits of the petition.see also massachusetts epa,d stating that states are entitled to special solicitude in standing analysis.
standard of review 
since epa acted pursuant to delegated authority,we review its interpretation of according to the principles enunciated in chevron natural resources defense council,d.chevron instructs us to accord agency interpretations of statutes they administer varying degrees of deference.under chevron step one,we always first examine the statute de novo,employing traditional tools of statutory construction.id.at.if the intent of congress is clear,we accord the agency interpretation no deference,for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.but if congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue,id.at,we proceed to chevron step two.under step two,i f congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.such legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.where a legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit rather than explicit,ins,d quoting chevron,at,we must uphold any reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of that agency,am.paper,epa,quoting chevron,at.
even where epa construction satisfies chevron,we still must ensure that its action is not otherwise arbitrary and capricious.see d a see also bluewater network epa,r eview under the caa arbitrary and capricious standard is the same as that required by the administrative procedure act,a.the arbitrary and capricious standard is h ighly deferential,and it presumes the validity of agency action.fcc,internal quotation marks omitted.we must uphold an agency action where it has considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,allied local reg l mfrs.caucus epa,quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the state farm mut.auto.ins,d,and has not relied on improper factors,state farm,at.t he ultimate standard of review is a narrow one.we are not empowered to substitute our judgment for that of the agency.citizens to overton park,volpe,d.and,w e give particular deference to epa when it acts under unwieldy and statutory schemes like the clean air act.bluewater network epa,internal quotation marks omitted.
chevron review 
there can be no doubt that epa acted pursuant to an express delegation authority in adopting the disputed final rule.an express delegation arises when congress has expressly delegated to an agency the authority to prescribe regulations containing such classifications,differentiations,or other provisions as,in the judgment of the agency,are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of the authorizing statute,to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof,or to facilitate compliance therewith.household credit,pfennig,d internal quotation marks omitted.that is precisely what congress has done
