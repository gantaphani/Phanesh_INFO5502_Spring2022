the issue in this case is whether the northwest interstate compact on radioactive waste allows its member states to exclude radioactive waste from disposal at a utah site.
energysolutions is the owner and operator of a facility for the disposal of radioactive waste located in clive,utah.utah is a member state of the northwest compact,and required energysolutions to obtain permission pursuant to the compact for the importation and disposal of waste from a decommissioned reactor in italy.the member states,including utah,voted to deny this approval,based on exclusionary authority it claimed through the federal statute approving the terms of the compact.energysolutions contends the clive facility should not be subject to the authority of the northwest compact.it claims the compact has limited authority only over regional disposal facilities,which does not include the clive facility.
the district court concluded the northwest compact does not regulate the disposal of waste at the clive facility.we disagree.the terms of the compact control in this situation,and the member states were within the bounds of their authority when they denied permission regarding this waste.
exercising our jurisdiction under,we reverse and remand.
background 
because of the complicated interplay among the statutes relevant to this case,a short review of their legislative history is helpful.we therefore begin with a discussion of the statutory background and a description of the factual history relevant to the dispute.
statutory background 
we live in a world full of low level radioactive waste.new york united states,d.many important industries and manufacturing processes generate radioactive waste llrw,and representative types of this waste include contaminated medical clothing and equipment,tools,and the remains of animals exposed to radiation during laboratory testing.see nrc waste,http last visited august.llrw is the least radioactive type of radioactive waste,see,but precautions must still be taken for its safe disposal.
despite these common origins and the resulting large volumes of waste,by the end of the,the entire nation had only three functioning disposal sites for llrw.new york,at.two of those sites were forced to close temporarily in,raising the specter of llrw with no place to go.id.at the same time,the scarcity of disposal sites raised the spectre that host states would become the nation dumping grounds for llrw.id.at white,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
policymakers agreed it was essential to encourage states to build more llrw disposal facilities,or at the very least,provide incentives for the existing disposal sites to remain open.hosting a disposal site,for example,would be less onerous if the host state could limit the amount of waste crossing its borders.but,due to the constitutional restrictions on state protectionism,a host state could not prevent waste from entering its disposal site based on the state of its origin,and therefore give preference to waste generated within its own borders.under the constitution dormant commerce clause,the clearest example of an abuse is a law that overtly blocks the flow of interstate commerce at a state borders.city of philadelphia new jersey,d.
because more disposal sites were required,and few states were willing to risk building a site for waste generated mostly in other states,congress in enacted the radioactive waste policy act,stat.act.this legislation gave states the authority under the constitution compact clause,const.art.i,to enter into interstate agreements,or compacts,to deal with llrw on a regional basis,and statutorily preempted dormant commerce clause concerns.after a transition period,compacts would have the force of federal law to exclude llrw generated outside of the compact region,starting in.
rather than creating a uniform federal law to directly regulate llrw disposal,the act encouraged states to draft their own agreements regarding this waste.these customized compacts could deal with regional concerns and encourage compromises between states that would be mutually beneficial.the act thus stated it was the policy of the federal government that each state is responsible for providing for the availability of capacity either within or outside the state for the disposal of radioactive waste generated within its borders.act a a.beyond this statement,the act provided no incentives to enter into a compact,nor did it include any penalties for a failure to provide the capacity to handle the waste.
perhaps unsurprisingly,as the effective date of the statute approached,the only compacts that had been formed were predicated on the three already existing disposal sites.new york,at.no new llrw disposal sites had been opened in the interim,and the nation once again faced the possibility of having nowhere to dispose the waste generated in the states that were not members of a regional compact.id.
congress took action again.this time it enacted a more detailed statute,providing penalties for states failing to provide disposal capacity,as well as increased financial benefits for states complying with a series of benchmarks related to creating new llrw disposal sites.this second legislative attempt is known as the radioactive waste policy amendments act of,stat,title i codified at act.in addition to the carrots and sticks related to the benchmarks the act provided more specific definitions for terms not defined in the act.see.
at the same time,congress passed the omnibus radioactive waste interstate compact consent act,stat,title ii codified at note consent act.the consent act provided congressional approval for several interstate compacts already ratified by member states,including the northwest compact,id,and the rocky mountain radioactive waste compact,id.
given this legislative history,we turn to the statute that created the northwest compact,since it contains the complete agreement among the states at issue here.next,we will discuss the act,since its modifications and limitations make sense only in the context of their application to an existing compact.
northwest compact 
in january,congress explicitly gave its consent to the states of alaska,hawaii,idaho,montana,oregon,utah,washington,and wyoming to enter into the northwest interstate compact on radioactive waste management.consent act.in so doing,congress declared that each of the compacts set forth in subtitle b including the compact is in furtherance of the radioactive waste policy act act.id.emphasis added.but the consent is not is granted subject to the provisions of the radioactive waste policy act,as amended,the act,and only for so long as the regional commission,committee,or board established in the compact complies with all of the provisions of such act.id.
under the northwest compact,a member state can regulate disposal at a facility,which is defined as any site,location,structure,or property used or to be used for the storage,treatment,or disposal of waste,excluding federal waste facilities.id,art.ii.another provision of the compact,article regional facilities provides that n o facility located in any party state may accept waste generated outside of the region comprised of the party states,except as authorized by party states,art.iv.we use the term exclusionary authority to describe this ability to exclude waste.
article v goes on to establish the northwest waste compact committee northwest committee.the northwest committee is comprised of one official from each party state,designated by that state governor.additionally,
the committee may enter into arrangements with states,provinces,individual generators,or regional compact entities outside the region comprised of the party states for access to facilities on such terms and conditions as the committee may deem appropriate.however,it shall require a vote of all such members,including the affirmative vote of the member of any party state in which a facility affected by such arrangement is located,for the committee to enter into such arrangement.
since the northwest compact is subject to the provisions of the act,we turn next to it.
the act encourages states to form regional compacts to provide for the disposal of llrw.the act does so by setting forth in some detail the states responsibilities for disposal,see c,allowing host states to charge a surcharge for the disposal of waste,see id.e d,and establishing penalties for states that do not make the required progress toward establishing disposal capacity,see id.e d.
additionally,the act made important modifications to the act.one key change was to recognize the unworkability of the deadline that allowed disposal facilities to exclude waste as of january.with the deadline,the states who were not members of compacts containing disposal sites would soon have had no place to send their llrw.in light of this pressing concern,the act created a more gradual transition period,lasting from january,to january,during which states and compacts were required to take steps towards providing disposal capacity,and host states could begin collecting higher surcharges for disposal.see id.
by enacting the act,congress repealed the act.its language in doing so was arguably ambiguous,but the effect of the language was not.congress stated that the act is amended by striking out sections,and and inserting in lieu thereof the act act.the act only had four sections,all of which were struck and replaced by the act.
several additional portions of the act are relevant to our discussion.first,the act defines a regional disposal facility as a radioactive waste disposal facility in operation on january,or subsequently established and operated under a compact.second,the act explicitly limits the effect of regional compacts on federal law 
except as expressly provided in sections to j of this title,nothing contained in sections to of this title or any compact may be construed to limit the applicability of any federal law or to diminish or otherwise impair the jurisdiction of any federal agency,or to alter,amend,or otherwise affect any federal law governing the judicial review of any action taken pursuant to any compact 
factual and procedural background 
the act,regrettably,has been less than entirely effective in reaching its goal of encouraging new llrw disposal sites.in general,most interstate compacts not organized around an already existing disposal site have fallen victim to a basic trend a state is recognized as the host state for the compact the designated host state begins the process of locating an acceptable site for llrw disposal political obstacles prevent the host state from making progress toward this goal and finally,the host state,unable to comply with its obligations under the compact,withdraws or is removed by the other member states.see,alabama north carolina,d north carolina is sued after withdrawing from southeast interstate radioactive waste compact entergy arkansas,nebraska,cir outlining nebraska difficulties with the central interstate radioactive waste commission nuclear waste dump group cans michigan,july,available at wlnr discussing vote to expel michigan taken by the midwest interstate radioactive waste commission.
in contrast to these difficulties,we can look to the clive facility,owned and operated by energysolutions this facility is the only llrw disposal site that began operations after the and acts.and according to data provided by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc,the clive facility processed over percent of the national volume of disposed llrw from to.see nrc waste disposal statistics,http last visited august.
utah,where the clive facility is located,is a member of the northwest compact.in,utah issued the necessary licenses to allow the clive facility to begin disposal of llrw.in doing so,utah specifically required the clive facility,through a condition in its license,to obtain permission from the northwest committee before disposing of any radioactive waste energysolutions shall not accept radioactive waste generated outside the region unless the approval provisions of articles iv and v of the compact are met.after its opening,the clive facility on a few occasions sought and received permission from the northwest committee to accept llrw.on other occasions,the northwest committee denied permission for waste,and energysolutions accepted this determination.see,ja letter from envirocare,energysolutions predecessor in interest,acknowledging the northwest compact does not allow for the receipt of the type of waste a potential client wished to dispose of at the clive facility,and therefore that waste was not acceptable at our facility.
the clive facility is not the only llrw disposal site located within the boundaries of the northwest northwest compact was formed around the disposal site in richland,washington at the time utah issued the clive facility license,it was clear the richland facility was,and would continue to be,the primary regional disposal facility for the northwest compact,a term defined in the act.as a practical matter,this meant the richland facility would be used to dispose of all llrw generated within the northwest compact region,while the clive facility would accept waste as approved by the committee.
this case arose from a dispute over the disposal of waste from italy.in,energysolutions entered into an agreement to decommission a series of nuclear power plants located in italy.as part of this plan,energysolutions would permanently dispose of the resulting waste categorized as llrw in its clive facility.energysolutions applied to the nrc for permission to import this waste into the united states.rather than approve the request,the nrc indicated it would defer to the judgment of the northwest compact.see aple.br.at.facing political opposition from utah,the northwest committee voted unanimously to deny permission to import this waste.see ja utah governor directing compact representative to vote against any proposals for foreign waste to come in to utah 
energysolutions filed suit against the northwest compact,claiming the northwest compact does not have statutory authority over the clive facility federal law preempted the decision to exclude llrw and the decision to exclude llrw violated the dormant commerce clause.the state of utah and the rocky mountain compact intervened as defendants.
on for summary judgment,the district court ruled in favor of energysolutions on the first and did not rule on the second two claims,since the ruling on the first rendered the others moot.see energysolutions,llc nw interstate compact on radioactive waste,ts,wl may.the district court concluded the llrw interstate compacts,including the northwest compact,only had the authority explicitly granted them in the and acts.because the district court concluded the clive facility was not a regional disposal facility as defined in the act,it held the northwest compact did not have the authority to exclude waste from the clive facility.
this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the dormant commerce clause forbids states from discriminating against articles of commerce based on the article state of origin.see city of philadelphia,at.the doctrine applies even to items that are not intrinsically valuable and find their primary worth in the price one will pay for their,for instance,id.at,or llrw,new york,at.the dormant aspect of this doctrine indicates it is only applicable when congress has not acted in regard to the interstate commerce at can and does waive the restrictions of this doctrine by explicitly consenting to state regulation of interstate commerce.see maine taylor,d it is well established that congress may authorize the states to engage in regulation that the commerce clause would otherwise forbid.but state regulation of interstate commerce is only permissible when congress has made its intent to allow such regulation unmistakably clear.id.at quoting timber,wunnicke,d.
the district court concluded the act,as amended by the act,is the source of authority for states to enter into interstate compacts pursuant to the compacts clause.energysolutions,wl at.examining these two statutes,the district court was unable to find unambiguous intent by congress to grant the nearly unlimited exclusionary authority claimed by the northwest compact.id.at.we review de novo both the district court statutory interpretation,and its grant of summary judgment.elephant butte irrigation dist.u.dep t of interior,cir internal citations omitted.
interpretation of an interstate compact begins with the compact itself 
the district court erred in looking only to the and acts to determine congressional authorization for the burdening of interstate commerce.instead,the proper place to begin this analysis is in the compact itself.
congressional approval of the northwest compact,through the consent act,transformed it from mere agreement into federal law.w here congress has authorized the states to enter into a cooperative agreement,and where the subject matter of that agreement is an appropriate subject for congressional legislation,the consent of congress transforms the states agreement into federal law under the compact clause.cuyler adams,d.therefore,we treat the northwest compact like any other federal statute,and interpret it accordingly.and we must also bear in mind that a compact when approved by congress becomes a law of the united states,but a compact is,after all,a contract.it remains a legal document that must be construed and applied in accordance with its terms.texas new mexico,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
in applying these principles,the district court ran afoul in several ways.first,it erred in concluding the act has any ongoing application to the grant of congressional authority under the regional compacts.unlike the act,the act did contain an express grant of permission for states to exclude waste but the act replaced the act entirely the act consists of only four sections,and the act begins by stating it is amending the act by striking out sections,and of the act and inserting in lieu thereof the text of the act act.since the act has completely replaced it,the act is no longer in effect,and the district court legal analysis began in the wrong place when it centered on the earlier,now abrogated,legislation.the starting point in discerning congressional intent is the existing statutory text,and not the predecessor statutes.lamie trustee,d internal citation omitted.
second,the district court assumed the consent act could only grant authority already contained in the and is,that the individual agreements consented to by congress could not grant any additional authority.energysolutions urges us to adopt this interpretation.but an enabling statute,such as the or act is not necessary for states to form an interstate compact.congress may consent to an interstate compact by authorizing joint state action in advance,in an enabling statute,or by giving expressed or implied approval to an agreement the states have already joined.cuyler,at.if no enabling statute is necessary,then a congressionally approved compact need not find a statutory basis for its powers elsewhere.thus,the district court should have credited the language of the compact in the first instance,rather than resorting to the act and the act.
congress extended broad authority to member states by consenting to the northwest compact.by statutory grant,congress expressly found the compact is in furtherance of the radioactive waste policy act the act,ratifying the understanding that the various statutes work in harmony.in further confirmation of this understanding,the consent of congress is hereby given to each and every part and article of the compact.id.the compact then goes on to provide exclusionary authority to the northwest committee over any site,location,stricture,or property used or to be used for the storage,treatment,or disposal of waste.id.
this interpretation is reinforced by a recent supreme court case reviewing a regional llrw compact.alabama north carolina,d in this case,the court was faced with the task of interpreting the southeast compact,an llrw compact approved at the same time as the northwest compact.avoiding any linkage to the act,the court based its holding on the language of the compact itself and congress power to consent under the compact clause,art.i,cl.although the precise issue in our case was not raised before the court,the holding supports our conclusion that consent to create these authorities arises from the consent act,not the act.turning to the southeast commission regulatory authority,the court underscored that t he terms of the compact determine that question.id.at.similarly in this case t he terms of the compact the terms of the act.in fact,the court does not cite to the act at all.instead,the court treats the compact much as it would any other contract,even going so far as to rely on traditional canons of construction to interpret its meaning.see id.at citing,among other sources,restatement second of contracts.
instead of comparing the southeast compact with the act,the court compares its terms with those of other interstate compacts,approved by congress contemporaneously.id.at citing texas new mexico,at internal punctuation omitted.ultimately,the court declined to read an implied remedial power into the compact that lacked one,when congress had explicitly approved such a power in contemporaneous compacts.id.although not exactly analogous to the question here,we share the court reluctan ce to read absent terms into an interstate compact given the federalism and concerns that would arise were we to rewrite an agreement among sovereign states,to which the political branches consented.id.at.energysolutions preferred interpretation effectively eliminates through misdirection the exclusionary authority of the compact over the clive facility.
finally,the district court and energysolutions rely on the general provisions of the act to conclude the northwest compact does not have exclusionary authority over the clive facility.as we discuss in more detail below,these provisions are ambiguous at best.for instance,energysolutions argues the act is the only source of exclusionary authority but glosses over the fact the act rejected the language in the act that was an explicit grant of authority,and replaced it with language that merely placed conditions on the grants of authority found in a compact.see footnote,supra.yet energysolutions insists this conditional language supercedes direct language to the contrary contained in the compact.
on that same point,energysolutions argues f b of the act,which grants exclusionary authority over any radioactive waste disposal facilities within the borders of a compact during the transition period,is evidence congress intended to grant this authority only during that time.with the expiration of the transition period,the northwest compact would no longer have any authority over the clive facility.we disagree with this interpretation.while some compacts may have had narrower grants of exclusionary authority in their compacts than the northwest compact,congress could have determined it important to give them broader statutory authority during the transition period.this provision does not suggest in any way that congress affirmatively withdrew its consent to the exercise of exclusionary authority over these types of facilities after the transition period ended.in fact,through the consent act congress explicitly consented to each and every part and article of the northwest compact,including its exclusionary authority.we can not construe vague provisions in the act to supplant the clear specific mandate of the compact.
in sum,the district court erred in relying on the act,and the general provisions of the act do not prevent the compact from exercising exclusionary authority.in the consent act,congress affirmatively waived any dormant commerce clause objections that otherwise would have prevented the party states from complying with the terms of the northwest compact 
b.the northwest compact grants exclusionary authority over the clive facility 
we now turn to whether the northwest compact grants exclusionary authority over the clive facility.we focus on the text of the northwest compact to determine the scope of its authority.statutory construction must begin with the language employed by congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative
