six environmental organizations sued the national marine fisheries service nmfs for declaratory and injunctive relief to challenge four biological opinions which had the effect of clearing the way for proposed timber sales in the umpqua river watershed in southwestern oregon.the district court granted substantial relief and the defendant agency,together with intervening timber operators,appeal.
the pacific coast federation of fishermen associations,and five other organizations representing fishermen and environmental concerns are collectively referred to as pacific coast.their principal claim is that the no jeopardy opinions issued by nmfs filed in seattle,where the agency has its regional headquarters,were arbitrary and inadequately supported by the best available science as required by the endangered species act esa.at the heart of the controversy is the impact of proposed timber sales on the umpqua river cutthroat trout and the oregon coast coho salmon douglas timber operators dto and the northwest forestry association were allowed to enter the cases as.the cases have been consolidated for this appeal.
pacific coast alleged that nmfs acted arbitrarily and capriciously in reaching the conclusion that the proposed timber sales are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the listed species.the district court found that nmfs had acted arbitrarily and capriciously by assessing aquatic conservation strategy acs compliance only at the watershed level,by failing to evaluate degradations,and by failing to fully and sufficiently incorporate the watershed analysis consistently with the best available science requirements set by the esa.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of pacific coast.both nmfs and dto filed timely appeals.
the dto assert that the publication of the challenged biological opinions by nmfs is not a final agency action within the meaning of the administrative procedures act,and,therefore,that the district court did not have jurisdiction.the dto also challenge the venue in the western district of washington,asserting that the appropriate defendants are the bureau of land management blm and forest service,whose proposed timber sales prompted this litigation,and whose headquarters are in portland,in the district of oregon.
jurisdiction 
the nmfs issued four biological opinions stating that timber sales in the umpqua river basin were not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the umpqua cutthroat trout and the oregon coast coho salmon.the proposed sales are within the range of the northern spotted owl,and therefore fall within the region covered by the northwest forest plan nfp.the united states forest service usfs and the blm adopted the nfp in.the plan was designed to provide a comprehensive management program for million acres of federal forest lands throughout the range of the spotted owl.see seattle audubon society lyons,aff cir.one of the key components of the nfp is the acs,a comprehensive plan designed to maintain and restore the ecological health of the waterways in the federal forests.
there are four components to the acs key watersheds the best aquatic habitat,or hydrologically important areas,riparian reserves buffer zones along streams,lakes,wetlands and mudslide risks,watershed analysis to document existing and desired watershed conditions,and watershed restoration a program to restore aquatic ecosystems and watershed health.the acs also has binding standards and guidelines that restrict certain activities within areas designated as riparian reserves or key watersheds.additionally,acs has nine objectives designed to maintain or restore properly functioning aquatic habitats.
when a timber sale or other project is proposed for the nfp region,it is initially subject to an internal planning process by the action agency,either the usfs or the blm.the action agency then creates a team of biologists and other resource management specialists to incorporate the nfp requirements,including acs standards and guidelines.a biologist on the team uses a matrix of pathways and indicators the mpi and a checklist developed by nmfs to assess the project effect on listed species.the mpi and checklist help the biologist to analyze different habitat indicators and determine whether they are properly functioning,at risk,or not properly functioning.the biologists also determine whether the proposed action is likely to restore,maintain,or degrade the indicator.projects that receive either zero or only one degrade checkmark are considered not likely to adversely affect listed species.
those projects determined likely to adversely affect listed species,those that received one or more degrade checkmarks,are referred to a level team.this team is made up of biologists from various agencies.it reviews the proposed project for acs consistency.the team can suggest changes in the plan to bring it into acs compliance.
if the level team agrees that the project complies with acs,it then forwards the project to nmfs for formal consultation.otherwise,the team elevates the review to a level team,and the project undergoes the same review process.failure to reach a consensus elevates the project to a level team.once one of these three teams approves the project,it goes to nmfs for esa consultation.
the nmfs must review the project pursuant to section of esa,which requires federal agencies to insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any species listed as threatened or endangered under the esa.a.then,nmfs must issue a biological opinion.
pacific coast sued earlier to challenge the first nmfs opinions with regard to several of the same proposed timber sales in pacific coast federation of fishermen associations,national marine fisheries service,no,may,pcffa i.pacific coast challenged in the district court nmfs programmatic biological opinion and three other biological opinions.
reviewing the programmatic biological opinion in pcffa i,the district court held that nmfs may assume that projects that are consistent with acs are unlikely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species.jurisdiction in that litigation was not challenged,and there was no appeal.
the court invalidated the biological opinions in the earlier case because the opinions lacked a basis on which nmfs could conclude that the degrade checkmarks indicated on mpi would have only minor and transitory effects.the agency reinitiated the consultation process after clarifying the documentation required to show acs consistency and articulating guidance on the proper use of mpi in the analysis at the various scales.using these new procedures,nmfs issued the four biological opinions challenged in this case.
pacific coast brought this action under esa.the district court found jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim under and under the administrative procedure act.this court reviews questions of jurisdiction de novo.see ecology center,forest service,cir.
the dto assert that the proper defendants are usfs and blm and that claims against those entities can be brought only in the district of oregon.they also assert that usfs and blm are indispensable parties that should have been joined,and that in their absence the district court acted without a complete administrative record.
final agency action 
the dto argue that the challenged biological opinions are not final agency actions.see.only final agency decisions are subject to review under the apa.see ohio forestry ass n,sierra club,d,and ecology center,at.the nmfs has not joined in the jurisdictional challenge.
the dto argue that pacific coast has chosen the wrong target in an effort to stop all logging in a large part of western oregon by seeking to overturn the opinions of nmfs which are only interlocutory in the decision making process of the forest service and blm,whose respective plans to approve the timber sales in the umpqua river watershed are the real target of this suit.we do not accept that characterization.
the dto attempt to distinguish bennett spear,d,in attacking jurisdiction in these cases.the supreme court held in bennett that a jeopardy opinion was final agency action because it effectively stopped further proceedings by the action agency.the court reasoned that a jeopardy opinion has direct and appreciable legal consequences,id.at,because it alters the legal regime to which the action agency is subject,id.at.in the case before us,nmfs issued a no jeopardy opinion,which became this agency final action.we have found no authority for the proposition that while a jeopardy opinion is reviewable as a final agency action,a no jeopardy opinion is not final and reviewable.
this court,following bennett spear,applied the test for ascertaining finality of agency action in ecology center,united states forest service,at.we held that for an administrative agency action to be considered final,the action should mark the consummation of the agency decision making process and the action should be one by which rights or obligations have been determined or from which legal consequences flow.see id.at.
this opinion satisfies the first part of our test because the issuance of a biological opinion marks the consummation of nmfs consultation process.see id.the opinion meets the second part of the test because it alters the legal regime and has direct and appreciable legal consequences.as a practical matter,the opinion and its accompanying incidental take statement grant immunity to the proposed actions of other agencies required to obtain an nmfs opinion before proceeding with their own actions,which these plaintiffs seek to block.
we are satisfied that the trial court had jurisdiction,and that blm and the forest service were not necessary parties.venue,accordingly,was properly placed in the western district of washington.
the merits 
agency decisions under esa are governed by the administrative procedure act,which requires an agency action to be upheld unless it is found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a friends of the earth hintz,cir.this deferential standard is designed to ensure that the agency considered all of the relevant factors and that its decision contained no clear error of judgment.arizona thomas,cir quoting citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d.agency action should be overturned only when the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mutual auto.ins,d.essentially,we must ask whether the agency considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.natural resources defense council united states dep t of the interior,cir quoting resources,robertson,cir,in turn quoting pyramid lake paiute tribe of indians united states dep t of the navy,cir.a biological opinion may also be invalid if it fails to use the best available scientific information as required by a.see greenpeace action franklin,cir.
pacific coast argued,and the district court agreed,that nmfs acted arbitrarily and capriciously by ignoring project effects and limiting its acs compliance analysis to the watershed scale,focusing on a evaluation of acs compliance that effectively masks all impacts that may have adverse effects on listed species,failing to consider activities on federal lands that might adversely affect salmonid species,tiering to blm or usfs determinations of acs consistency for projects in riparian reserves where no aquatic benefits have been identified,and failing to adequately consider,fully incorporate,or adequately explain deviations from the watershed analysis recommendations,which are designed to accomplish acs objectives.
one preliminary matter must be addressed to avoid confusion.the nmfs argues that pacific coast and the district court inappropriately have required nmfs to serve as a review board or oversight committee for blm and usfs determinations of acs consistency.this argument appears significant,but in fact lacks substance.the nmfs is required under nfp to determine whether or not a project is likely to adversely affect a listed species.the nmfs is not required by nfp to determine acs consistency.however,in pcffa i,the district court held that nmfs was permitted to assume that implementation of projects under usfs land and resource management plan lrmp or blm resource management plan rmp would result in no jeopardy to the listed fish species if those projects were conducted in accordance with acs.therefore,because nmfs is allowed to equate acs consistency with a no jeopardy finding,nmfs chooses to inquire into acs consistency.presumably,other methods of reaching a jeopardy determination are available to nmfs.the coincidence of acs consistency inquiries is immaterial.the nmfs primary obligation is to determine a project effect on listed fish species.the action agencies,as part of their analyses,must also determine acs consistency.that they are able to discharge dissimilar duties by the same means does not allow either party to fail to undertake its responsibilities.
watershed scale acs consistency 
in determining acs consistency for the timber projects challenged in this case,nmfs analyzed the projects consistency with acs at the watershed level.a watershed,or fifth field,generally covers between to square miles of land.this equates to between and acres.the largest watershed considered with reference to projects at issue here is square miles,or acres.by contrast,a project site generally covers only a few sections square miles or fractions of sections.the nmfs conducts its analysis of the program by assessing the affects of any project level degradation on the entire watershed.any degradation that can not be measured at the watershed level is considered to be consistent with both acs standards and objectives and therefore warrants a no jeopardy finding.
pacific coast contends that the watershed measure effectively masks all project level degradation.this argument raises two questions whether,because a acre project represents only to of a watershed,any degradation would be perceptible at the watershed level and whether any effect was given to the cumulative degradation in an acs.in pcffa i,the court held that nmfs can not reach a no jeopardy determination without analyzing whether the projects are in fact complying with acs.see pcffa i at.the court found that evidence of site specific degradation and the lack of mitigation showed that nmfs rationally could not find the proposed actions consistent with acs mandate that agencies maintain and restore aquatic systems within the range of the northern spotted owl.id.it is clear from the court order that application of acs at the project level explained how nmfs could assume,for that project,that a proposed action would not jeopardize listed fish.the emphasis on evaluation is evident in the district court opinion in pcffa i,at.
the nmfs contends that the proper level to evaluate acs consistency is the watershed,because nfp and acs are aimed at maintaining and restoring millions of acres of forest lands.given that overall protection of forest and water resources is the concern of both nfp and acs,it does not follow that nmfs is free to ignore site degradations because they are too small to affect the accomplishment of that goal at the watershed scale.for some purposes,the watershed scale may be correct,but nfp does not provide support for so limiting nmfs review.the purpose of acs is to maintain and restore ecosystem health at watershed and landscape scales to protect habitat for fish and other species and resources and restore currently degraded habitats.this general mission statement in nfp does not prevent project site degradation and does nothing to restore habitat over broad landscapes if it ignores the cumulative effect of individual projects on small tributaries within watersheds.the agency also must determine how the proposed project or management action maintains the existing co
