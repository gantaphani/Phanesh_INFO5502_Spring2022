the owners of a power plant failed both to obtain a preconstruction permit and to install certain technology before making changes to the plant.the environmental protection agency and several states say the owners were required to do so.but the did not cry foul until more than a decade after the changes,well after the owners had sold the plant.now the epa wants to force the former owners to obtain the missing preconstruction permit and to install the missing pollution controls on a plant they no longer own or operate.and they seek damages and an injunction against the current owners who neither owned nor operated the plant when it was allegedly modified illegally.the relief now sought would require us to distort plain statutory text to shore up what the epa views as an incomplete remedial scheme.that we can not do,and so we will affirm the district court dismissal of their claims.
a.the homer city generation power plant goes online in,and congress enacts the clean air act.
in the,the pennsylvania electric company penelec and the new york state electric gas corporation built the homer city generating station the plant,a power plant in indiana county,pennsylvania.the plant first two burners went online at the end of the decade.id.at that time,the clean air act was little more than a federally funded research program on air pollution,the epa did not exist,and the few enforceable standards in place did not affect the plant construction and operation.see air quality act of,stat.expanding studies into air pollutants,emissions,and control techniques clean air act amendments of,stat.clean air act of,stat.air pollution control act of,stat.providing funds for federal research into air pollution.
congress enacts the clean air act,which grandfathers pollution sources like the plant out of its requirements until they are modified.
the clean air act of sets up the modern framework.
while the plant ramped up operations over the next two decades,congress enacted three amendments to the clean air act transforming it into the comprehensive regulatory scheme it is today.it is necessary,then,to take a minor detour through those legislative changes.
these amendments reach back to when congress converted the act from a federal research program on air pollution into the federalist enforcement framework still in place today.clean air act of.the version charged the epa with setting national maximum permissible levels of common pollutants for any given area called national ambient air quality standards,or naaqs pronounced knacks.see a b requiring the epa to choose levels that allow an adequate margin of safety required to protect the public health quoting b.the epa designates nonattainment areas within each state where a regulated pollutant levels exceeds the naaqs so called because the areas are not attaining the epa standards.d.
the states then take primary responsibility if they want for choosing how to meet the naaqs within their borders.see train natural res.def.council,d.they do so by creating state implementation plans,or sips.in their sips,states choose which individual sources within their borders must reduce emissions,and by how much.eme homer city generation epa.for instance,a state may decide to impose different emissions limits on individual power plants,natural power plants,and other sources of air pollution,such as factories,refineries,incinerators,and agricultural activities.id.a state must submit its sip to the epa for review and approval whenever the naaqs are updated,see a,and each sip must meet certain requirements,see id.a.
the amendments create the prevention of significant deterioration psd permit program.
the framework merely prevented pollution sources from exceeding the naaqs.it did not prevent new construction or modifications that would gray out areas with clean air as long as the pollution did not exceed the naaqs.see craig oren,prevention of significant deterioration control compelling versus site shifting,iowa.at least that was the consensus before federal courts interpreted the clean air act as requiring the epa to prevent deterioration of the nation air quality,no matter how presently pure that quality in some sections of the country happens to be.sierra club ruckelshaus,aff,per curiam,aff by an equally divided court sub nom.fri sierra club,d per curiam powell,recused.to enforce that interpretation,congress created a program for reviewing the effect of new pollution sources on existing air quality before they are constructed.oren,prevention of significant deterioration,iowa.at.
congress divided this aptly named new source review program into two permit programs.for areas with unclean air called nonattainment areas because they are not attaining the naaqs the nonattainment new source review program ensures that new emissions will not significantly hinder the area progress towards meeting the naaqs.for areas with clean air attainment areas the prevention of significant deterioration psd program ensures that any new emissions will not significantly degrade existing air quality the psd program stands at the center of this case.
the psd program requires operators of pollution sources in attainment areas to obtain a permit from the state or the epa before constructing or modifying a major emitting facility which emits significant air pollution even with pollution controls installed.see a setting permitting requirements,defining major emitting facility.this permitting process tak es into account energy,environmental,and economic impacts and other costs,b,k,to determine the best available control technology bact for controlling every regulated pollutant at the facility to a specified limit,a in keeping with the clean air act federalist framework,congress required states to implement the psd program in their sips.see a d i ii,a j.
the amendments add an program.
such was the clean air act until.that year,congress passed its third and latest round of major amendments.in addition to other practical problems that arose after the amendments,citizens,regulators,and even the owners and operators of pollution sources had difficulty knowing which of the clean air act many requirements applied to a particular pollution source.sierra club johnson sierra club cir,cir henry waxman,an overview of the clean air act amendments of,envtl.after all,the only requirements easily discoverable were those expressly listed in the preconstruction permits issued under the new source review program any other applicable requirements under the clean air act were scattered among separate records,permits,and other documents,if they were recorded at all.sierra club,at waxman,an overview of the clean air act amendments of,envtl.at.
congress fixed that problem by enacting title see operating permit program.at explaining that title v goals are i ncreased source accountability and better enforcement.title v requires all major sources of air pollution to obtain operating permits that consolidate into a single document the operating permit all of the clean air requirements applicable to a particular source of air pollution.sierra club,at quoting sierra club.power,cir see,stat,codified at a.title v does not generally impose new substantive air quality control requirements,sierra club,at,but does require the source to obtain an operating permit that assures compliance with all applicable requirements,b.among the many requirements included in an operating permit are psd emission limits if applicable.sierra club,at.as with the psd program,title v operating permit program became a required element of sips.see.
penelec and nyseg modify the plant during the but do not apply for a psd permit,though they later apply for a title v permit.
none of these comprehensive reforms initially affected the operation of the homer city generation power plant by penelec and nyseg.congress had grandfathered pollution sources,including the plant,out of the psd requirements until those sources we re modified in a way that increases pollution.sierra club,at see also united states cinergy,cir.
but the plant sidelined status came to a halt in the.in,and,penelec and nyseg allegedly made various changes to the plant boilers that increased net emissions of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter those changes were allegedly major modifications triggering the psd permitting requirements and requiring the use of bact.but at the time,penelec and nyseg believed their changes were routine maintenance exempted from the psd program.oral arg.tr.at see e the following shall not,by themselves,be considered modifications under this part maintenance,repair,and replacement which the administrator determines to be routine for a source category.so they did not apply for a psd permit and instead continued to operate the modified plant as though it were still exempt from the psd program and emissions controls.in,penelec and nyseg applied for an operating permit as required by title because they never received a psd permit containing emissions limits for the plant their title v operating permit application did not include any requirements or emissions limits.
epa announces an unprecedented initiative to enforce the clean air act.meanwhile,the former owners sell the plant to the current owners,after which pennsylvania approves the plant title v permit.
while penelec and nyseg waited for pennsylvania and the epa to issue its title v operating permit,the epa rolled out a new enforcement initiative that eventually ensnared the plant operations.in,the epa jointly announced what they called an unprecedented action civil enforcement actions against seven electric utility companies and the tennessee valley authority for clean air act violations dating back more than twenty years at power plants across ten states.margaret claiborne campbell angela jean levin,ten years of new source review enforcement litigation,nat.resources env t.that action was merely the first in what would become the largest,most contentious enforcement initiative in epa history to retroactively target violations of the new source review program 
a ll involve virtually identical allegations.in each case,epa alleges that the replacement of parts,typically boiler components or portions or components,at existing electric generating units amounted to major modifications of those units,triggering new source permitting and regulatory requirements.according to epa,failure to obtain preconstruction permits constitutes a continuing violation,rendering ongoing operation of the units unlawful.
the same year as the epa announcement,penelec and nyseg sold the plant to eme homer city generation,two years later,eme homer city needed to raise capital,so it entered a transaction with homer city owner lessors through homer city ols eme homer city sold the plant to the homer city ols,who simultaneously leased it back to eme homer city.as a result,penelec and nyseg became the former owners and operators former owners,and eme homer city and the homer city ols became the current owners and operators current owners.despite these transfers,no one sought a psd permit or installed bact.
in,the pennsylvania department of environmental protection finally approved the title v permit application for which the former owners had applied nine years earlier and issued the title v permit to the current owners.because there was no psd permit,the issued title v permit did not include any psd requirements or bact requirements.
e.in,as part of that initiative,the epa and the states sue the former and current owners.
by,the plant had become one of the largest air pollution sources in the nation,annually releasing nearly tons of sulfur dioxide,which contribut es to premature mortality,asthma attacks,acid rain,and other adverse effects in downwind communities and natural areas.with its pollution catching the epa attention,the plant became a target of the agency new enforcement initiative.
in,the epa notified the current and former owners of their alleged violations as required by the clean air act before eventually suing them in the western district of pennsylvania in january according to the epa,the former owners had violated the psd program by modifying the plant without a psd permit and without installing emissions controls before modifying the plant and title v by submitting an incomplete application that omitted the plant modifications and proposed bact controls.the current owners,on the other hand,had allegedly violated the psd program by operating the plant after it had been modified without bact controls installed or a psd permit and title v by operating in accordance with their facially valid but inadequate operating permit inadequate because it failed to include any of the applicable psd permit requirements or require the use of bact.the epa sought injunctive relief against the former and current owners as well as civil penalties against the current owners for their past five years of operation.
that was only the beginning.new york,new jersey,and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection filed motions to intervene as plaintiffs,which the district court granted.see.these states alleged the same violations as the and raised claims that concededly rise or fall with the federal claims.
the former and current owners moved to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.the district court granted that motion in its entirety and dismissed the epa claims in october.see.in a nutshell,the district court held that the statute of limitations had expired on the psd claims against the current owners because the psd program imposes only prerequisites to construction and modification,not ongoing conditions of operation.and because the current owners were not the ones to modify the plant,they could not be liable for violating the psd requirements and thus injunctive relief was also unavailable against them.the district court also declined to enjoin the former owners because they no longer owned or operated the plant and thus posed no risk of violating the psd program in the future.
as to the title v operating permit claims,the current owners could not be liable because title v does not transform the psd requirements into operating duties and does not permit a collateral attack on a facially valid permit.likewise,the former owners could not be held liable because all that title v prohibits is operating a source out of compliance with the operating permit.the former owners never owned or operated the plant after the title v permit was issued.
the epa and states appealed 
the epa asks us to reverse the district court dismissal of its psd claims and title v claims against the former and current owners.we will affirm the district court dismissal in its entirety.
psd claims 
against the current owners 
the epa contends that the current owners violated the psd program by operating the plant while failing to use bact and satisfy the psd requirements.as relief,the epa seeks the maximum daily civil for each day that the current owners operated the plant for the five years preceding this lawsuit the statute of limitations for civil penalties.they also want a permanent injunction ordering the current owners to obtain a psd permit and install bact.
the district court dismissed these claims,reasoning that failure to comply with the psd program is a violation that occurs only at the time of construction or modification here,at the latest.consequently,it concluded that the current owners did not violate the psd program because they did not modify the plant the former owners did but if,as the epa urges,the psd program imposes operating duties,then a new violation occurs each day that the current owners operated the plant without bact or a psd permit subject,of course,to the statute of limitations.the claims against the current owners thus rise or fall on the answer to a single question does the psd program prohibit operating a facility without bact or a psd permit 
we agree with the unanimous view of the other courts of appeals that have addressed this question.the psd program plain text requires the answer be no.under a,n o major emitting facility may be constructed or unless it meets various psd requirements,including obtaining a psd permit and installing emission controls.that provision prohibits construct ing a facility without obtaining a psd permit or using bact,and while construction is defined to include modifications,see c,it does not include operation.and a does not exactly try to hide its exclusive link to construction and modification after all,the section is titled preconstruction requirements not preconstruction and operational requirements.in short,n othing in the text of even hints at the possibility that a fresh violation occurs every day until the end of the universe if an owner that lacks a construction permit operates a completed facility.united states midwest generation,llc,cir see also sierra club otter tail power,cir agreeing with the eleventh circuit that operating a modified facility without a psd permit is simply not articulated as a basis for a violation quoting parks conservation ass.valley auth.parks cir,cir.instead,t he violation is complete when construction or modification commences without a permit in hand.midwest generation,llc,at.
section omission of any reference to operation takes on dispositive significance given that other parts of the clean air act establish operational conditions by employing plain and explicit language.otter tail power,at.two examples suffice e makes it unlawful to operate a facility in violation of new source performance standards.title v similarly prohibits any person from operat ing a source except in compliance with a title v operating permit and notes in the very next sentence that nothing in title v shall be construed to alter the applicable requirements of the psd program that a permit be obtained before construction or modification.a emphasis added.congress choice to explicitly refer to operating conditions elsewhere,but not in a,can only be deliberate,especially in such comprehensive legislation.barnhart sigmon coal,d when congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.we can not override that choice.see otter tail power,at where congress has intended to establish operational conditions under the clean air act,it has clearly said so.but it has not done so for the psd program.
the psd program enforcement provisions confirm this.the epa and states can take such measures as necessary to prevent the construction or modification of a source to which the psd requirements apply.emphasis added.the act authorizes citizen suits against any person who proposes to construct or constructs or,by definition,proposes to modify or modifies a facility without a required psd permit or violates any condition of a psd permit.a emphasis added.nowhere do these provisions authorize enforcement against a person who operates a source without satisfying applicable psd requirements 
the epa responds by identifying other provisions that purport to turn the psd requirements into operational conditions.it points to a,which authorizes citizen suits for violations of an emission standard or limitation,which is defined to include any requirement to obtain a permit as a condition of operations,f.but a merely creates a private cause of action against a person who is required to but does not obtain a permit as a condition of operations.it does not say that a psd permit is,in fact,a condition of operations.
the epa takes the next logical step,arguing that obtaining a psd permit and not just the psd requirements themselvse is itself a condition of operations,notwithstanding all the plain text to the contrary.the agency argument is simple obtaining a psd permit is a condition of operating a source because psd permits impose some operational conditions on the sources they govern.for example,a requires the permit to set forth emission limitations that will govern operation.subsection a requires that the source be subject to emission controls.and subsection a sets ongoing monitoring requirements during operation.
but ockham razor reminds us that simplicity in argument,without more,is no barometer of merit.as the eighth circuit explained,e ven though the preconstruction permitting process may establish obligations which continue to govern a facility operation after construction,that does not necessarily mean that such parameters are enforceable independent of the permitting process.otter tail power,at.in other words,just because the psd program requires a source to obtain a permit that sets some operating conditions does not mean that the psd program requires a source without a permit to comply with operating conditions.indeed,even the epa own regulations distinguish between unlawful modifications and unlawful operations 
any owner or operator who constructs or operates a source or modification not in accordance with the psd application or with the terms of any approval to construct,or any owner or operator of a source or modification who commences construction without applying for and receiving approval under the psd program,shall be subject to appropriate enforcement action.
r emphasis added.had the epa wanted to make operating without a required psd permit unlawful,the last half of this regulation would use the term operates just like the first half does any owner or operator of a source or modification who commences construction or operates a source or modification without applying for and receiving approval under the psd program.but the regulation does not say that.
alternatively,the epa argues that a is merely a rule of timing that starts the psd permitting requirements at the time of construction or modification.yet a does not say that a violation starts when a major emitting facility is constructed or modified without meeting the psd requirements.rather,a prohibits modifying and constructing facilities without satisfying the psd requirements.more to the point,this timing argument is just a repackaging of its contention that a imposes operational conditions.
similar reasons doom the epa argument that bact is a freestanding requirement that applies to operating sources regardless of whether a source obtains a psd permit before construction or modification.for this proposition,the epa quotes a statement that a proposed facility is subject to the best available control technology for each regulated pollutant emphasis added.that language might seem to create an ongoing obligation to use bact regardless of a psd permit terms or existence.except that the subsection says more than the language epa quotes.under a,n o major emitting facility may be constructed unless the proposed facility is subject to the best available control technology for each regulated pollutant.the bact requirement is simply part of prohibition on construction not operation.otherwise,a would declare that n o major emitting facility may be constructed or operated unless the proposed facility is subject to bact.as is,though,the bact requirement is not a freestanding operational requirement.otter tail power,at.and as the seventh circuit illustrated,it would not violate even i f the owners ripped out or deactivated the best available control technology after finishing construction,though it might violate some other law.midwest generation,llc,at see alaska dep t of envtl.conservation epa,d describing subsections a and a as creating an express preconstruction requirement to include a bact determination in a facility psd permit.
even if we take the epa argument on its own terms and ignore the construction limitation preceding subsection,the argument ignores the word proposed.a.after all,if the bact requirement is interpreted as a freestanding requirement separate from the psd permitting process,then facilities that never obtained psd permits would have to apply bact as a condition of operations after construction is completed.but if construction is completed,then the facilities are no longer proposed facilities,making that word meaningless.see corley united states,d o ne of the most basic interpretive canons is that a statute should be construed so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.subsection is no more than a congressional mandate to require constructed and modified facilities in attainment areas to use bact rather than an alternative emissions standard such as the lowest achievable emission rate laer,which does not require a analysis and applies to nonattainment areas exceeding the naaqs.
apart from any issue of statutory interpretation,a freestanding bact requirement would not survive in the real world.bact determinations are products of the permitting process,tailored to each facility on a basis using analysis specific to each pollution source.otter tail power,at quoting see also b similar.there is no statutory or regulatory provision outside of some individual states sips for obtaining a bact determination outside of the psd permitting process.without an issued psd permit,there are no bact emission limits to violate.tellingly,the epa can not explain what the bact limits are for the plant in this case because the permitting process has not occurred.see reply br.at bact is typically specified during the permitting process but the precise bact standard for a particular source need not be for an operator to violate the bact obligation.
without supporting statutory text,the epa falls back on and the states primarily rely upon policy arguments.given the clarity of the statute,these concerns have no place in the process of statutory interpretation.rodriguez united states,d where,as here,the language of a provision is sufficiently clear in context and not at odds with the legislative history,there is no occasion to examine the additional considerations of policy that may have influenced the lawmakers in their formulation of the statute.alterations in original internal quotation marks and citations omitted.but lest one be concerned that the epa parade of horribles may come to pass,such fears are inflated.first,it is not true that a company that modifies a facility without obtaining a psd permit or installing bact pollution controls would be subject to a maximum total penalty of only the maximum daily fine.br.at states br.at.like rome,facilities are not built or modified in a day.it is possible that the maximum daily fine accrues each day the owner or operator spends modifying or constructing the facility from the beginning of construction to the end of construction.an owner or operator who modifies a facility every day for a year without satisfying the psd requirements presumably commits a violation every day and is subject to one year worth of daily fines or more than million.
but even assuming that the epa is correct that only a single daily fine applies,that penalty is not laughably inadequate to encourage psd compliance.id.congress has endowed the epa with other tools to deter would be violators from injunctive remedies that include terminating new construction and requiring extensive modifications,see,to criminal penalties against those who knowingly violate the clean air act,including by failing to obtain a psd permit before construction or modification,see c.and its enforcement arsenal is not limited to violators.if a state the clean air act or its own sip,the epa can take action to bring the sip into compliance and can even directly revise the sip if necessary.a.
nor is the epa unable to know which sources are modified or constructed.to be sure,sources are not required to report or obtain a psd permit for routine maintenance that they believe falls below a major modification.but that does not consign the epa to playing by guessing which sources should be the target of its enforcement efforts.the epa is statutorily empowered to require any source owner or operator,regulated party,or any person who the administrator believes may have information necessary for implementing the clean air act and determining violations that is,nearly anyone in the united states on a,periodic,or continuous basis to keep records,make reports,and submit to inspections,monitoring,and emissions sampling,and provide such other information as the administrator may reasonably require.a.states,as the clean air act primary enforcers,have similarly broad investigative powers.given the breadth of these powers,we see no reason why the epa and states lack authority to require the advance reporting of some or all proposed changes to facilities,whether or not they rise to a modification.
at the end of the day,there may or may not be a reasonable explanation for congress choice not to impose the psd requirements as operational conditions.on one hand,the clean air act was not designed solely for the purpose of saving the environment at all costs.like any legislation,it is a congressional compromise between competing the clean air act case,between interests seeking strict schemes to reduce pollution rapidly and other interests advancing the economic concern that strict schemes would retard industrial development.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.as a result,congress designed the clean air act to protect the nation air quality and to protect the reasonable expectations of facility operators and the significant investment of regulatory resources made by state permitting agencies.otter tail power,at.that compromise might well be reflected in the omission of psd requirements as operational conditions if the epa does not object within five years of the completion of a facility modification,then it loses the right to seek civil penalties under the statute of limitations,but can still obtain an injunction requiring the owner or operator to comply with the psd requirements.but when more than five years have passed since the end of construction and the facility has been taken over by new owners and operators,the clean air act protects their reasonable investment expectations.
on the other hand,perhaps the omission of psd requirements as operational conditions was simply an oversight.congress pieced together the clean air act over decades as it reacted to the latest regulatory obstacles.and there is some evidence that whenever the topic of the psd permitting process arose,congress simply assumed that a psd permit would be issued before construction or modification began.see,at,reprinted in,at,at,reprinted in,see also julie martin,note,enforcement for construction without psd permit and bact compliance,envtl,explaining that because of congress assumption,the clean air act does not explicitly address the possibility of a facility construction and eventual operation without the requisite permission to install uncontrolled emissions sources.either way,we can not modify the statute if an intentional choice reflecting a compromise,we can not adjust the bargain congress has struck if an oversight,we can not usurp legislative authority to fix the omission.see,rodriguez,at deciding what competing values will or will not be sacrificed to the achievement of a particular objective is the very essence of legislative choice and it frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that whatever furthers the statute primary objective must be the law.
aside from the federal statutes and regulations,the epa turns to the pennsylvania sip as a source of freestanding psd requirements but pennsylvania sip merely parallels the clean air act psd requirements and does nothing to transform the psd permitting requirements into operating conditions.for example,prohibits a person from caus ing or permit ting the construction or modification not operation of an air contamination source unless the pennsylvania department of environmental protection has approved the source plan for construction or modification.and like the epa own regulation at r l,the pennsylvania sip requires sources to operate in compliance with their application for plan approval and the conditions in the plan approval issued by the department which does not prohibit operation without an approved plan or psd permit.to be sure,the pennsylvania sip does authorize the department to issue an operating permit to an existing and operating source that is out of compliance with the clean air act or the regulations thereunder.a.but that provision,which allows the department to issue corrective operating permits for sources lacking required psd permits,hardly requires the owners and operators to apply for psd permits as a condition of operation.
the pennsylvania sip omission of any language imposing an operational duty to obtain an approved plan or psd permit aligns this case with the eighth and eleventh circuits decisions,both of which refused to infer ongoing obligations from sips with similar language.otter tail power,at parks,at.that same omission distinguishes this case from the sixth circuit decision in national parks conservation association tennessee valley authority,which interpreted the tennessee sip unique language as establish ing that the duty to obtain a construction permit containing the proper emissions limits is ongoing,even.parks conservation ass.valley,cir see also midwest generation,llc,at t he s ixth c ircuit decision rests on tennessee statutes and implementation plans that require certain sources to use bact.
in short,a unambiguously prohibits only constructing or modifying a facility without meeting psd requirements the current owners have done neither they have only operated the plant.as a result,the district court correctly dismissed the and injunctive relief sought against the current owners 
against the former owners 
that leaves the psd claims against the former owners.although the epa has been less than forthcoming about what its proposed injunction would accomplish,it has offered two possibilities ordering the former owners to install bact at the plant,and ordering the former owners to purchase emissions credits and retire them unused,effectively reducing the amount of sulfur dioxide that facilities elsewhere in the nation can emit.the district court dismissed this request for a permanent injunction,concluding that mandatory injunctions are available only for ongoing violations and the former owners alleged psd violations constituted wholly past failures to obtain permits that did not constitute continuing violations.we will affirm that dismissal on a narrower ground.the text of the clean air act does not authorize an injunction against former owners and operators for a wholly past psd violation,even if that violation causes ongoing harm see tourscher mccullough,cir w e may affirm the district court decision on any ground supported by the record.
the clean air act authorizes the epa to bring a civil enforcement action when any person has violated a permit or sip,has violated any requirement in certain subchapters of the clean air act including the psd program,or attempts to construct or modify a major stationary source in any state that the epa administrator has found out of compliance with the new source review program.u.a,b.that same provision limits a district court jurisdiction to awarding certain kinds of relief.district courts have jurisdiction only to restrain such violation,to require compliance,to assess such civil penalty,to collect certain fees owed the united states,and to award any other appropriate relief.id.b.each type of relief in this list except for civil is necessarily.a district court,for example,can not collect fees that were owed to the united states in the past but are no longer owed.and with time travel yet to be discovered,it is impossible to restrain a violation that occurred twenty years ago.likewise,courts can not require compliance from defendants who are not currently violating the clean air act and who can not violate the act in the future because they no longer own or operate the source.gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay,d interpreting the clean water act provision,which authorizes citizens to seek civil penalties against a person who is in violation of the act,and concluding that this phrase makes plain that the harm sought to be addressed by the citizen suit must lie in the present or the future,not the past.
the only remaining term in the statute any other appropriate relief might initially appear to give district courts broad authority to fashion injunctive relief against former owners and operators.but this general can not be read so broadly as to authorize an injunction for completed violations.under the canon of ejusdem generis,a general term any other appropriate relief following a series of specific items restrain such violation,require compliance,and so on is confined to covering subjects comparable to the specifics it follows.hall street,llc mattel,d see also.state dep t of soc.health servs.guardianship estate of keffeler,d interpreting other legal process as limited to some judicial or mechanism transferring property to discharge liability to be consistent with the preceding terms levy,attachment,and garnishment circuit city stores,adams,d interpreting any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce after seamen and railroad employees as covering only transportation workers.
of course,congress does not intend every seemingly phrase to be read narrowly.see ali fed.bureau of prisons,d w e do not woodenly apply limiting principles every time congress includes a specific example along with a general phrase.from time to time,a broadly worded statutory term is intended to be just that broad.for example,congress sometimes inserts technically unnecessary examples along with a general description of those examples not because it intends the general term to be narrow,but instead out of an abundance of caution to ensure the general term will be interpreted as capturing those examples.fort stewart sch.fed.labor relations,d see also circuit city stores,at souter,dissenting declining to apply ejusdem generis where the statute indicates a special reason for emphasizing specific examples of a statutory class that negate s a narrow interpretation of the general term.in addition,just as we typically use ejusdem generis to ensure that a general word will not render specific words meaningless,csx.dep t of revenue,d,the opposite is also true general phrases can not be so narrowly construed that they become meaningless,see christopher smithkline beecham,d citing united states alpers.and finally,not every general or vague phrase following an enumerated list is a.some statutes use a general phrase not as a residual category intended to be a more general description of the preceding terms,but instead use each of the terms,including the general phrase,as independent and unrelated statutory categories.see ali,at declining to apply ejusdem generis to the disjunctive phrase any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer watt nuclear,d declining to apply ejusdem generis to the phrase coal and other minerals.
yet sometimes a is just a.that is true here.any other appropriate relief follows a list of specific items separated by commas.ali,at.as the word other demonstrates,this general phrase is a residual category of the same type as the preceding items namely,kinds of relief.id.the specific types of relief do not overlap or otherwise suggest that they are mere examples of any appropriate relief.consequently,any injunctive relief available under this residual phrase must be limited to ongoing violations,consistent with the specific injunctive remedies that precede epa disagrees,insisting on a broad and flexible interpretation of any appropriate relief.wielding a separate canon of interpretation,the epa argues that remedial statutes like the clean air act must be interpreted broadly to effectuate their remedial purposes.as an initial matter,we doubt that such a broad interpretive rule can be justified on its own terms.see.dep t of revenue piccadilly cafeterias,d rejecting this canon application to a statute that congress had more than a single purpose in enacting internal quotation marks and citation omitted.as the supreme court has consistently reminded courts,no legislation pursues its purposes at all costs.pension benefits guar.ltv,d quoting rodriguez,at see also ftc actavis,d roberts,dissenting dolan united states,d roberts,dissenting woodford ngo,d stevens,dissenting.that principle applies even to remedial statutes and what laws are not designed to remedy some problem.i t frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that whatever furthers the statute primary objective such as remedying environmental harms must be the law.rodriguez,at.
but even if such an interpretive rule were a justifiable one,it would not trump the textual clues to the contrary.not all interpretive rules are created equal.some are descriptively justified,establishing rules about how congress and the public use language as well as regularize ing the courts approach to some recurring sources of ambiguity in english syntax.caleb nelson,statutory interpretation see also stephen ross,where have you gone,karl llewellyn should congress turn its lonely eyes to you,vand,proposing this distinction cass sunstein,interpreting statutes in the regulatory state,harv,similar.examples of those heuristics include the presumptions that words used in a statute are to be given their ordinary meaning,burns alcala,d,that identical words used in different parts of the same statute have the same meaning,ibp,alvarez,d,that statutory text should not be interpreted in a way that makes part of it redundant,unnecessary,or meaningless,ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d,that adjectives and other modifiers refer only to the last antecedent,see jama immigration customs enforcement,d,and most relevant here that a general should be interpreted in light of any preceding specific terms.others are normatively justified,designed to achieve certain policy goals that courts have identified.nelson,statutory interpretation a t least some of the canons put thumbs on the scale in favor of certain substantive policies,telling courts how to proceed when their information about the enacting legislature likely intent has run out.the most familiar example is the rule of lenity.and the remaining canons are hybrids whose scope can be fully explained only by a combination of descriptive and normative justifications.see nelson,statutory interpretation,cataloguing the various canons and offering the saving canon and doctrine as two examples of hybrid canons.
consistent with our focus on determining the meaning of the text itself,we turn to our descriptive canons first whenever we confront a statute we must interpret.see id.at t here is fairly widespread agreement that descriptive canons occupy a higher place in the interpretive hierarchy than normative canons.id.at to the extent that a single canon serves both descriptive and normative goals,moreover,courts should try to avoid letting the canon normative aspirations swamp the descriptive force of other canons.if our descriptive tools settle the meaning,then our task is complete.in such a case,we do not even consider interpretive tools partially or purely based on normative goals.see,united states wells,d the rule of lenity applies only if,after seizing everything from which aid can be derived,we can make no more than a guess as to what congress intended.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
such is the case here.our descriptive tools of interpretation clarify any vagueness in the phrase any other appropriate relief.as we have explained,the canon of ejusdem generis requires us to interpret this as permitting relief,consistent with the preceding types of relief in the list.allowing the epa canon to trump ejusdem generis would amount to little more than disguising a interpretation as a canon.the psd program other enforcement provision confirms the prospective nature of injunctive relief allowed.section authorizes injunctive relief as necessary to prevent the construction or modification of certain major emitting facilit ies.an injunction to remedy modifications completed in the past without a psd permit can not prevent the construction.
and even if the phrase any other appropriate relief can include injunctions against former owners and past violators,the requested injunctions in this case are not appropriate.whatever the breadth of that phrase,it would not be appropriate for a district court to award relief that is impossible to fulfill.ordering the former owners to install bact on a plant they no longer own,operate,or have access to is just the sort of impossible relief that would not be appropriate.that is especially so given that a mandatory injunction is an extraordinary remedial process.morrison work.brandeis,united states bigan,cir same.
the epa tries to cure this impropriety in two ways.first,it proposes that the district court enjoin the current owners to cooperate with the former owners to install bact.or,the epa suggests,the district court can order the former owners to pay the current owners for the cost of bact and order the current owners to install it.
both of these proposals suffer from the same flaw.as we have already held,the current owners can not be held liable for violating the psd or bact requirements.if the current owners can not be held liable,then the district court has no authority to enjoin them at all.see ciba geigy bolar pharm,cir holding that a plaintiff must first establish a successful claim on the merits against a party before being eligible to obtain injunctive relief against that party.without the cooperation of the current owners,the former owners would not be able to comply with a court order directing them to install pollution control measures,because they no longer control the plant.reliant energy mid atlantic power holdings,llc,wl,at.given these constraints on remedying the former owners past alleged violations of the psd program and the epa failure to allege a continuing violation or the likelihood of a future violation,injunctive relief against the former owners will not redress the public injury.steel citizens for a better env t,d.
second,the epa proposes that the district court order the former owner to purchase and retire emissions credits to offset pollution elsewhere in the nation.this proposal fares no better.such injunctive relief is the equivalent of awarding monetary relief and could not reasonably be characterized as an injunction.united states midwest generation,d,aff on other grounds by,see in re arthur treacher franchisee,cir w e have never upheld an injunction where the claimed injury constituted a loss of money,a loss capable of recoupment in a proper action at law.it would amount to little more than an around the statute of limitations on any civil fine,penalty,or forfeiture,pecuniary or otherwise.
in fact,the inspiration for this suggested relief comes from title iv of the clean air act a program regulating acid rain and deposition and an entirely different one than the former owners allegedly violated.had congress intended to authorize an marketplace for the psd program title ii like the one established for the sulfur dioxide allowance program title iv,it would have done so.since congress deliberately omitted such an allowance program from the psd program,we will not import it under the guise of injunctive relief.
indeed,when congress has wanted to authorize mandatory remedial injunctions in other environmental statutes,it has done so expressly.see a extending liability under cercla to any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substances owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of b broadly authorizing orders to mitigate the damage to the public health or welfare caused by a discharge.congress chose not to extend such remedial authority to the clean air act.
finally,and tellingly,the epa concedes that in the years of the clean air act,no court has ever approved such an injunction against former owners.see oral arg.tr.at.we decline to be the first.
title v claims 
in addition to its psd claims,the epa alleges that the current and former owners violated the title v program.the former owners title v application was allegedly incomplete because it did not include applicable psd requirements or bact controls.and the current owners facially valid permit is supposedly inadequate because it omits the same requirements even though the epa approved the application,issued the permit,and recently renewed the permit without objection.the district court dismissed these claims on the merits,concluding that title v does not make incomplete applications and permits civilly actionable.we agree with the district court dismissal,but for a more fundamental reason the district court lacked jurisdiction over these claims see in re flat glass antitrust,cir explaining our independent responsibility to confirm our appellate jurisdiction and the district court jurisdiction quoting in re ford motor,cir.
as the seventh,eighth,and ninth circuits have held,title v channels challenges to applications and permits into an administrative review process that is reviewable exclusively by the courts of appeals,not collaterally in civil or criminal enforcement actions in the district courts.otter tail power,at romoland sch.dist.inland empire energy,llc,cir united states am,cir see also pub.interest research,johnson,cir a n enforcement proceeding does not relieve the epa of its obligations under the permitting process.we begin with,which establishes a comprehensive system for the epa review of title v applications and proposed permits.congress entrusted state permitting authorities with initial responsibility to make bact determinations case by case.alaska dep t of envtl.conservation,at quoting.title v requires these state permitting authorities to submit permit applications and proposed permits to affected states and the epa for review.a l.the permitting authority must give the states an opportunity to review the application or proposed permit and submit written recommendations if the authority declines to adopt any state recommendation,it must notify that state and the epa and explain its reasoning.id.as to the epa review,the administrator has a duty to object to any permit that contains provisions she determines to be not in compliance with the clean air act.id.b l.if the administrator objects,then the permit may not be issued unless it is revised to meet the objections.id.b,c.and if the permitting authority has already issued the permit,then the administrator must modify,terminate,or revoke such permit,and the permitting authority may only issue a permit revised to satisfy the objection.id.if the epa does not object,then any person may petition the administrator within days after the expiration of the day review period to object on the public behalf.id.b.the administrator must then grant or deny the petition within days.id.any denial of such petition shall be subject to judicial review under.id.
section b,in turn,authorizes direct review of the administrator decision in the courts of appeals.id.b a petition for review of any other final action of the administrator under the clean air act including any denial or disapproval by the administrator under title v may be filed only in the united states court of appeals for the appropriate circuit otter tail power,at romoland,at.such review may take place only in the court of b divests the district courts of jurisdiction over the administrator decision.b action of the administrator with respect to which review could have been obtained under paragraph shall not be subject to judicial review in civil or criminal proceedings for enforcement.consequently,congress created a use it or lose it provision for reviewing the epa failure to object to a proposed title v permit.romoland,at.if review of the administrator decision not to object to a title v application or permit could have been obtained through this process,then that challenge can not be brought in an enforcement proceeding.
here,the epa claims that the current owners title v permit,though facially valid,is missing applicable psd requirements and bact controls.and the epa but not the states claims that the former owners title v application was incomplete because it omitted those same requirements.but each of these claims amounts to an allegation that the permit is not in compliance with the requirements of the clean air act,claim s which could have been pressed during the permitting process.otter tail power,at.if the epa administrator believed the application or permit was deficient,title v required her to object during the permitting process.b.yet twice she chose not to either during the original permitting process from to or again when the current owners permit was renewed in.and those failures to object could have been directly reviewed in this court through the exclusive process established by title consequently,b divests the district court of jurisdiction over the epa collateral challenges to the former owners application and the current owners permit 
the epa musters three cases that purportedly support such collateral challenges in enforcement proceedings.opening br.at see sierra club epa sierra club cir,cir citizens against ruining the env t epa,cir sierra club,at.but those cases say no such thing.none of them addresses provision or even whether a district court has jurisdiction over collateral challenges to title v permits and applications in enforcement actions.they instead interpret one of the statutory triggers for the epa administrator duty to object to a title v application or permit during the administrative review process whether a private petitioner has sufficiently demonstrated that the application or permit does not comply with the clean air act such that the administrator must object.see b.in fact,in each of these cases,the party seeking review of the administrator failure to object did so by petitioning for direct review in the court of appeals consistent with our interpretation of.see sierra club,at citizens against ruining the env t,at sierra club,at.
the elimination of jurisdiction over collateral challenges to title v permits and applications is further confirmed by congress omission of any civil cause of action for submitting incomplete applications or operating under a validly issued but incomplete permit.the epa has authority to bring a civil enforcement action against a person who,among other things,has violated,or is in violation of,any other requirement or prohibition of various subchapters,including title v.b.the plain text of title v,in turn,lists only two ways in which it can be violated operating without a title v permit or violating the terms of a title v permit while operating a source.see id.a making it unlawful for any person to violate any requirement of a permit issued under this subchapter,or to operate a source except in compliance with a permit issued by a permitting authority under this subchapter.
what that text does not include as a violation,however,is operating in accordance with a facially valid but inadequate title v permit.as the seventh circuit has explained,there is simply no indication that congress expressly or by implication meant to authorize the epa to bring an enforcement action against current owners,who have been operating under a permit valid on its face and never before challenged.am,at see also united states cemex,d,the court sees no possible interpretation of this language that would permit a cause of action for the failure to obtain a proper operating permit.to be sure,as the epa points out,title v requires permits to include enforceable emission limitations and other such conditions as are necessary to assure compliance with applicable requirements of the clean air act.a.but just because the statute requires complete permits does not mean that incomplete permits are actionable in an enforcement action.indeed,a failure to make it unlawful to transgress this requirement requires us to conclude that such conduct is not a civilly enforceable violation of title see sebelius goer,d where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
nor does title v make submitting an incomplete permit application unlawful.the plain text of a does not list submitting incomplete permit applications as a violation of title of course,as the epa points out,title v requires a permit application to include a compliance plan describing how the source will comply with all applicable requirements in the clean air act.b.again,the fact that congress chose to include this requirement
