more than three years after signing a consent decree with the united states to pay for the environmental remediation of a contaminated industrial site in arcanum,ohio,rsr corporation filed this lawsuit seeking contribution for the costs from commercial metals company.because the district court properly determined that rsr filed this contribution action after the limitations period,see g,we affirm.
from through,harold shane reprocessed car,truck and industrial batteries at a facility in arcanum,ohio.shane received the batteries from several suppliers,including rsr and commercial metals.toxic byproducts of the facility activities included battery acid and a lead oxide sludge,both of which seeped into the ground and eventually threatened local water supplies.ja.
in,the epa placed shane facility on the national priority list,and the federal agency began cleaning up the site.see amendment to national oil and hazardous substance contingency plan national priorities list,codified at pt,app x b.in,the united states filed a lawsuit against shane under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla seeking to recover response costs incurred by the united states in cleaning up the site.ja see a t he owner and operator of a facility shall be liable for all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the united states government.
over the next nine years,the scope of the litigation expanded to include other potentially responsible parties.rsr entered the litigation as a defendant in november.see a a ny person who arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at any facility shall be liable for all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the united states government.as the burgeoning litigation proceeded,the united states continued to clean up the site,eventually incurring more than in response costs.
on february,the united states filed a proposed consent decree between itself and shane,which the district court accepted and entered seven months later.on march,the district court approved a de minimis consent decree,resolving the liability of many minor polluters at the arcanum site.and on august,the united states filed with the district court a proposed consent decree among itself,rsr,two major contributors and one de minimis contributor,and the court entered the consent decree in april.
consistent with the april consent decree,rsr and its agreed to reimburse the united states for in past response costs,to finance and perform the remedial work needed to finish cleaning up the arcanum site,ja,to post a bond for the estimated cost of the remaining remedial work,to undertake further response actions to the extent necessary,ja,and to reimburse the united states for up to in future response costs.in return,the united states agreed not to sue or take administrative action that would impose additional liability on rsr and its,ja,and the defendants received the right to seek contribution from other potentially responsible parties.attached to the consent decree was a final volumetric ranking of contributors to the contamination at the site,showing rsr as the largest and commercial metals as the largest of the known contributors.ja.the consent decree also provided that the district court would retain jurisdiction over the parties until the complete remediation of the site.
on july,rsr and its finished cleaning up the site at a total cost of.
on january,rsr filed this contribution action against commercial metals,and the district court consolidated the action with the shane litigation.commercial metals moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds,and the district court granted the motion.
cercla grants the president broad power to command government agencies and private parties to clean up hazardous waste sites.key tronic united states,d.the statute permits the united states to issue enforcement orders as may be necessary to protect public health and welfare and the environment.a.and it authorizes a number of causes of action designed to obtain the prompt remediation of waste sites and the fair apportionment of remediation costs reimbursement actions for a ny person who receives and complies with the terms of an enforcement order,id.b b abatement actions to prevent the actual or threatened release of a hazardous substance,id.a governmental cost recovery actions that allow the united states,a state or an indian tribe to recover all costs of removal or remedial action incurred from potentially responsible parties,id.a a private cost recovery actions that allow any other person to recoup any other necessary costs of response incurred consistent with the national contingency plan,id.a b see united states atl.research,d contribution actions to allocate response costs among liable parties using equitable factors,f and an assortment of other actions not relevant here.
appreciating the risk that litigation might impede a swift and effective response to hazardous waste sites,anspec,johnson controls,cir,congress authorized the united states and potentially responsible parties to launch efforts first,then recover the costs from other responsible parties settlements,consent decrees and,if need be,judgments.see,b authorizing settlements to reimburse parties for certain remedial actions id.d authorizing consent decrees to enforce cleanup agreements id.h authorizing settlements for recovery of costs incurred by the united states government from responsible parties id.g authorizing settlements for cost recovery from de minimis responsible parties see also,id.b a authorizing those who compl y with enforcement orders to seek reimbursement from the united states id.a authorizing actions to recover costs incurred in a cleanup effort.
the statutory authority of government entities and private parties to bring and contribution actions later,however,does not last forever.an initial action for recovery of the costs for a remedial action,for example,must be filed within years after initiation of physical construction of the remedial action,and subsequent cost recovery actions may be maintained at any time during the response action,but must be commenced no later than years after its completion.id.g b.a potentially responsible party may bring a contribution action during or following any civil action under the statute enforcement and provisions,id.f see cooper,aviall,d,or after resolving its liability to the united states in an administrative or judicially approved settlement,f b.such an action for response costs or damages must be filed within years of 
a the date of judgment in any action for recovery of such costs or damages,or 
b the date of an administrative order under section g of this title relating to de minimis settlements or h of this title relating to cost recovery settlements or entry of a judicially approved settlement with respect to such costs or damages.
as rsr complaint indicates,it filed this action pursuant to f the contribution provision.ja.rsr right to seek contribution from commercial metals and other potentially responsible parties arose from the consent decree,which required it to pay the united states in past response costs,to pay up to in future response costs incurred by the united states,and,most critically,to finance the costs of the remedial work,ja.see f b a person who has resolved its liability to the united states or a state for some or all of a response action or for some or all of the costs of such action in an administrative or judicially approved settlement may seek contribution from any person who is not party to such a settlement.not only did the statute give rsr a right to seek contribution at this point,but the consent decree itself also contemplated such actions.see ja providing that rsr and its will notify the united states of any suit or claim for contribution brought by them for matters related to this consent decree.
rsr has never disputed that its complaint amounted to a contribution action,see f,as opposed to a cost recovery action,see id.a b.and g of cercla requires that an action for contribution for any response costs or damages commence within three years of the entry of a judicially approved settlement with respect to such costs or damages.id.g.rsr acknowledges that the consent decree constitutes a judicially approved settlement resolv ing rsr liability to the united states for the purpose of authorizing a contribution action.see id.f b.and we see no reason why it does not also constitute a judicially approved settlement for the purpose of limiting when that action may be determining in other words when the right to bring that action accrues for purposes.to conclude otherwise would allow a judicially approved settlement to authorize a contribution action to recover the costs imposed by that settlement without placing any limit on when that action must be brought.am.cyanamid capuano,cir explaining that the reference to such costs or damages in g a refers to the costs or damages contained in the judgment mentioned earlier in the sentence and identifies a particular claim or payment.because rsr waited more than three years to bring its contribution action after the april consent decree,its complaint lies outside of the limitations period and must be dismissed.
rsr resists this interpretation on the ground that cercla contains a general statute of limitations in g with four narrow exceptions in g,and that none of the exceptions applies here because rsr entered into only a cleanup agreement with the united states.br.at.the statutory text,however,does not set forth a general statute of limitations with exceptions but instead sets forth different limitations periods for different causes of action.see g limitations period on a ctions for natural resource damages id.g a limitations period on the initial action for recovery of the costs of a removal action id.g b limitations period on the initial action for recovery of the costs of a remedial action id.g limitations period on any subsequent action for further response costs id.g limitations period on any action for contribution id.g limitations period on any action based on rights subrogated by reason of payment of a claim id.g limitations period on indemnification actions.
equally unavailing is rsr contention,seconded by the dissent,that the underlying agreement between rsr and the united states is not a judicially approved settlement under g b.here is the key language of the statute in context 
no action for contribution for any responses costs or damages may be commenced more than years after 
a the date of judgment in any action under this chapter for recovery of such costs or damages,or 
b the date of an administrative order under section g of cercla relating to de minimis settlements or an administrative order under section h relating to cost recovery settlements or entry of a judicially approved settlement with respect to such costs or damages.
id.g.as rsr and the dissent see it,the with respect to such costs or damages language in subparagraph b refers only to costs or damages arising from g or h administrative orders.
that is not,however,the natural way to read the provision.the point of this section of the statute,as the introductory clause indicates,is to establish a time bar for contribution actions for any response costs or damages.subparagraph a says that the time bar applies to such costs or damages arising from judgment s,while subparagraph b says that it applies to such costs or damages arising from de minimis settlements reflected in an administrative order under g,cost recovery settlements reflected in an administrative order under h and judicially approved settlement s.in other words,just as the phrase such costs or damages in subparagraph a limits the time bar on contribution actions to those costs or damages contained in the judgment mentioned,am.cyanamid,at,so the same phrase in subparagraph b limits the time bar on contribution actions to those costs incurred in the settlement,id.at.
a contrary reading would work considerable damage to the statute,as it would mean that there is no time bar on contribution actions arising from judicially approved settlements of recovery actions initiated by private parties,individual states or indian tribes.here is why.while g and h authorize the united states to settle actions administratively,the united states is not the only entity entitled to bring a action.individual states,indian tribes and private parties who incur cleanup costs may also seek cost recovery as distinct from contribution under a.see a atl.research.at.if,as rsr reads the statute,the provision relating to judicially approved settlement s refers only to settlements under g or h,then the clock would never start as to settlements arising from actions initiated by these other parties.rather than focus on who settled the action,in short,the statute asks us to focus on what was settled.united states navistar int l transp,cir rejecting reading of another cercla limitations provision that would lead to the awkward result that actions brought by private parties to recover response costs would be subject to a different statute of limitations trigger when no government agency is involved in the.
to suggest that the consent decree covered only compensation for past response costs,as rsr suggests,also would be inaccurate.rsr was the largest polluter at the arcanum site,and its expected liability was based on rsr contribution of almost tons of hazardous materials at the rate per pound established for de minimis contributors.the quid pro quo for seeking less reimbursement from rsr was rsr agreement along with its to assume liability finance and perform the remedial work at the arcanum site,ja,to post a bond to guarantee their performance and to reimburse the united states for up to in future response costs.while a party submitting to an administrative order requiring cleanup under a may seek reimbursement for its costs from the superfund,see b,rsr and its waived any such right,having agreed not to assert any direct or indirect claim for reimbursement from the hazardous substance superfund.ja.in view of the apportionment of liability for past and future response costs among the united states,rsr and its,the consent decree was a settlement under h as well as a cleanup agreement under d.because the consent decree established rsr liability,its contribution action regarding those costs accrued on the date of the consent decree april,and expired three years later.
rsr insists that it could not have resolved its liability to the united states in the consent decree before the completion of the remedial action.reply br.at.but rsr promise of future performance was the very consideration it gave in exchange for the united states covenant not to seek further damages.rsr and its in other words resolved their liability to the united states by agreeing to assume all liability the united states for future remedial actions.and even if the covenant regarding future response costs did not take effect until the remedial action was complete,the statute of limitations for contribution actions runs from the entry of the settlement,g b,not from the date that each provision of that settlement takes effect.
rsr also suggests that commercial metals waived this defense.but commercial metals raised the issue through its motion to dismiss on grounds,and the consolidation of this case with the shane litigation contrary to rsr suggestion did not moot the motion.if there is any waiver on this score,it is one of rsr doing it never raised the issue below.see wyckoff,standard fire ins,cir.
the dissent also contends that our interpretation fails to respect congressional intent as evidenced by the legislative history of the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of,stat.because congress did not evince any intent to codify a uniform statute of limitations for all contribution actions.dissent at.but the legislative history suggests that is just what the national legislature had in mind,see,pt.i,at this section establishes a statute of limitations for the filing of an action for contribution for response costs or damages,and indeed that history does not distinguish among types of judicially approved settlements when discussing that limitations period,see id.the statute of limitations for contribution actions begins to run at the date of judgment for recovery of response costs or damages or the date of entry of a judicially approved settlement with respect to such costs or damages.the face of the amendments,more importantly,reveals a design to codify one limitations period for contribution actions and another period for subsection authorizes contribution actions,entitled f contribution another places a limitations period on contribution actions,see g entitled g period in which action may be brought and contribution whereas a third imposes a limitations period on actions,see id.g entitled actions for recovery of costs.
to the extent the dissent means to be saying that limitations on contributions actions will undermine cercla goal of cleaning up industrial waste sites,that is not the case.the principal purpose of limitations periods in this setting is to ensure that the responsible parties get to the sooner rather than later.see,pt.i,at early contribution actions ha ve the effect of bringing all responsible parties to the bargaining table at an early date.
nor does this interpretation conflict with decisions of the first and tenth circuits.see dissent at.in american cyanamid capuano,cir,the plaintiff filed a contribution action for costs during negotiations with the united states over the recovery of those costs.pointing to g a,the defendant claimed that a judgment against the plaintiff for costs triggered the limitations period for any contribution action that the plaintiff might bring regarding the site.in rejecting this argument,the first circuit held that such costs or damages in g a referred only to the costs or damages contained in the judgment mentioned in that subparagraph,not to any response costs or damages that could arise in the future.at.our holding follows that approach,because we likewise construe such costs or damages in g b to refer only to those costs or damages imposed by the judicially approved settlement.see am.cyanamid,at cercla allows a settling prp to seek contribution within three years of that settlement for costs incurred in the settlement.those costs here included the costs incurred under rsr obligation to finance and perform the remedial work at the arcanum site.ja.
the plaintiff in sun,cir,sought recovery under a and f for costs it incurred remediating a brownfield site.the tenth circuit held the government had never filed a civil action against the plaintiff but only issued a unilateral administrative plaintiff action was an initial action for recovery of costs and thus was covered by the statute of limitations for actions g.see sun,at internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,sun agreed with our resolution of the only question before us if the prp incurred its cleanup costs pursuant to a civil action under or,it will have three years from the date of judgment or settlement in which to bring its contribution claim.id.at.
the dissent also rejects our reading of the text on the ground that it is simply not practical because future cleanup costs can not be accurately estimated or determined in time to bring a contribution action.dissent at.but there is little question that congress intended to impose a limitations period on actions under cercla,see g period in which action may be brought,and intended a limitations period to apply even before a site was fully cleaned up,see id.g b initial action to recover remedial costs must commence within years after initiation of physical construction.
to the extent the dissent means to raise a fairness concern,this is not the case to raise it.rsr knew that the cleanup of the arcanum site was expected to cost up to when it signed the consent decree,and the effort turned out to be far cheaper than expected,costing only.if anything,rsr expected need for contribution was greater before the cleanup began,not afterwards.
for these reasons,we affirm.
the majority finds that a statute of limitations set forth in g b applies to this contribution action.the majority reaches this conclusion by misconstruing the statute of limitations,which does not apply to this action.i would reverse the district court decision and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings.
under cercla,
a n initial action for recovery of the costs referred to in section of this title must be commenced 
a for a removal action,within years after completion of the removal action and 
b for a remedial action,within years after initiation of physical construction of the remedial action.
g.section g sets forth a statute of limitations which applies only to initial actions seeking recovery of costs for remediation.contribution actions are governed by a separate provision.under g,
n o action for contribution for any response costs or damages may be commenced more than years after 
a the date of judgment in any action under this chapter for recovery of such costs or damages,or 
b the date of an administrative order under section g of this title relating to de minimis settlements or h of this title relating to cost recovery settlements or entry of a judicially approved settlement with respect to such costs or damages.
g emphasis added.the plain statutory language indicates that congress identified specific circumstances which would trigger the statute of limitations contained in g.section g lists four events that trigger the running of the statute of limitations the entry of a judgment a g de minimis settlement a h cost recovery settlement and a judicially approved settlement.am.cyanamid capuano,cir see also centerior serv.acme scrap iron metal,cir same.
the parties agree that united states shane,no,wl,is the initial cercla action,and that there is no district court judgment that would trigger the statute of limitations under g a.the parties also agree that the consent decree in shane was not a g de minimis settlement or h cost recovery settlement.there is only one category remaining which would trigger the statute of limitations the entry of a judicially approved settlement with respect to such costs or damages.g b emphasis added.this court must determine whether this statutory language refers exclusively to g de minimis settlements and h cost recovery settlements,or if it applies more broadly to other contribution actions.
in this case,plaintiff argues that 
t he substance of the district court error is that it held that the phrase in g,with respect to such costs,modifies any response costs and means the same thing as any response costs,while plaintiff assert s that with respect to such costs modifies g and h settlements and means that the limitations period logically applies to such costs that there contained within these settlements and not future unknown costs.
plaintiff br.at.the district court erred in finding that the statute of limitations applied to all judicially approved cercla settlements,and the majority incorrectly reaches the same conclusion.i strongly believe that the majority interpretation of the statute goes beyond the plain language of the statute and contravenes congress express intent.since the entry of a judicially approved settlement with respect to such costs or damages,g b,should be interpreted to mean a judicially approved settlement for costs or damages under g or h,the statute of limitations simply does not apply in this case.this interpretation of g b is consistent with the plain language of the statute and congress express intent.
at least two circuit courts of appeals have interpreted the language at issue in this case.see sun,cir see also am.cyanamid,at.these cases support a finding that the statute of limitations does not apply in this case.
in sun,the tenth circuit construed,noting that a close reading of the statute makes it clear that not all contribution claims have the same statute of limitations.at.the court found that 
i f a suit proceeds to conclusion,the limitations period begins running on the date of judgment.g a.if the parties settle,the limitations period begins running on the date of the administrative order embodying the settlement for g de minimis settlements or h cost recovery settlements,or on the date of entry of a judicially approved settlement
