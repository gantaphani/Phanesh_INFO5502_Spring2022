the federal aviation administration faa authorized shuttle america airlines shuttle america to provide scheduled passenger service to new york laguardia airport laguardia from hanscom field hanscom,a general aviation airport that lies miles northwest of boston abutting the towns of bedford,concord,lexington,and lincoln.the preservationist organizations,three of the four towns bedford is an intervenor,and stewards of several nearby historic review of the faa decision on the ground that the agency did not adequately consider the adverse effect of the additional shuttle america flights on historic and natural resources near hanscom.
hanscom has been a major aviation facility since,when the commonwealth of massachusetts first acquired the site to accommodate the army air corps.in the massachusetts port authority massport converted a portion of the site into a general aviation facility serving corporate aviation,flight schools,air charter operations,light cargo,and private business and recreational flights.the air force uses the remainder as hanscom air force base.in,there were about general aviation and military flights defined as a departure and an arrival at hanscom.
in recent years,massport and the faa have expanded commercial passenger service at hanscom,seeking to lessen congestion at boston logan international airport.these steps have concerned community groups who fear that the increased noise,air pollution,and surface traffic from the additional flights will harm the natural and historic resources near hanscom.these sites include minute man national historic park,walden pond,and the homes of eminent american authors such as ralph waldo emerson and louisa may alcott.the main access road to hanscom is a part of route,which runs through the heart of minute man national park.
in july,massport backed a plan to let shuttle commuter airline then operating out of several airports on the east scheduled passenger service at hanscom.to this end,shuttle america asked the faa to add hanscom to the list of airport destinations in its operating specifications.massport asked the faa to upgrade hanscom operating certificate to a full part certificate,which allows use of planes with greater than seats.see generally part.
the faa granted both requests in september,and shuttle america immediately commenced passenger service out of hanscom,with four daily flights.the faa determined that it did not need to perform an environmental analysis for the two approvals because they were categorically excluded from review under the national environmental policy act of nepa,et.it also concluded that the categorical exclusion under nepa obviated the need for consultation under section of the national historic preservation act of nhpa.
the advisory council on historic preservation,which is authorized to enforce nhpa,see,questioned the faa reading of nhpa,and petitioner save our heritage unsuccessfully sought reconsideration and rehearing of both the part certification and the addition of hanscom to shuttle america operating specifications.however,no party sought timely judicial review of either of the faa decisions such review is now.a 
in may,shuttle america applied for the operating specifications amendment at issue in this amendment to add laguardia to its list of approved airport destinations.it proposed to make seven flights between hanscom and laguardia,with the possibility of eventually expanding the service to ten flights a day.the faa expressed doubt that nhpa consultation was required,but in light of the advisory council earlier concerns,it decided it would be prudent to consult provisionally with the massachusetts historical commission,which the commonwealth had designated as its nhpa consulting agency.after conducting an environmental analysis,the faa proposed a finding that the additional flights to laguardia would have no potential adverse effect on historic properties.
petitioners save our heritage and the towns sent the faa detailed criticisms of its proposed finding,and the massachusetts historical commission also refused to concur.after providing additional documentation in an unsuccessful effort to persuade the commission,the faa terminated the consultation and,on october,issued the amendment the laguardia amendment.shuttle america began commercial service from hanscom to laguardia with five flights per day,later reaching a peak of seven daily flights in january 
on direct review,a,petitioners now ask us to set aside and enjoin the laguardia amendment on the grounds the faa decision violated nepa,nhpa,and section f of the department of transportation act of,c originally codified at f.the statutory requirements are described below.the gist of the faa position is that its effects the addition of seven to ten flights a day would have no significant environmental the amendment from or otherwise satisfied these requirements.
at the threshold,the faa and supporting intervenors raise two objections to our consideration of the case.the first is that the petitioners lack article iii standing,and the second is that the petitions are effectively attacks on prior agency orders.because the first challenge is constitutional,we start with it.
the basic requirements for article iii standing are that the petitioner is someone who has suffered or is threatened by injury in fact to a cognizable interest,that the injury is causally connected to the defendant action,and that it can be abated by a remedy the court is competent to give what constitutes a cognizable interest can present vexing problems,see chemerinsky,federal jurisdiction,at ed,but here the faa and supporting intervenors concede that aesthetic and environmental injury are cognizable,see sierra club morton,d.
rather,the objections to standing are threefold.the first,and least persuasive,is the suggestion that even if some individuals or organizations are adversely affected by the increased flights,none of the petitioners or identified members of petitioner organizations have shown that they are among those injured.admittedly,a specified petitioner or identified member must be within the affected group.see friends of the earth,laidlaw envt l,d.
here,the petitioners comprise nonprofit environmental or preservationist associations such as save our heritage the towns located near hanscom and at least two petitioners that own nearby historic sites the walden woods project,which owns part of the walden woods site and operates a thoreau research and educational facility on it and the louisa may alcott memorial association,which manages the writer home.it is sufficient for the case to proceed if at least one petitioner has standing.legal found.bar,cir.
there is little reason to doubt that the two nonprofit landowners walden woods project and the alcott association would be affected by both noise and air pollution,given their function and proximity to hanscom and it is likely,although unnecessary to decide,that the three towns themselves would have a direct interest,in traffic congestion we need not resolve whether the petitioner associations have established standing based on the rather sparse allegations of injury to the interests of their individual members.see int l union,united,aero.agric.implement workers of am.brock,d.
next,the faa says that there is no actual or threatened adverse effect on any petitioner because,according to the faa findings,the small number of additional flights will have no significant environmental impact.at first blush,this appears to be a question of the merits rather than one of standing the petitioners certainly allege substantial effects and challenge both the faa contrary findings and the procedures used to reach them.
we need not rule out the possibility of cases where the claim of impact is so specious or patently implausible that a threshold standing objection might be appropriate.see,town of norwood,at florida audubon soc y bentsen.but beyond that,we think that the likelihood and extent of impact are properly addressed in connection with the merits and issues of harmless error.breyer stewart,administrative law and regulatory policy ed bell hood.a reasonable claim of minimal impact is enough for standing even though it may not trigger agency obligations.
third,the faa points out that the order here under review did not increase the number of flights that shuttle america is authorized to operate at hanscom.given prior orders that are now beyond review,shuttle america was and is entitled to fly an unlimited number of flights to its other,airports regardless of the outcome of this case.thus,says the faa,the order permitting flights to laguardia can not be the cause of the alleged injury to petitioners,because it could fly the same number of flights even if the order were overturned.
if the same number of flights carrying the same number of passengers would be flown regardless of the present order,the order would hardly be the cause of any impact due to more flights or ground traffic.but as a matter of common sense,shuttle america likely sought authorization for laguardia because it would generate some additional traffic over and above its existing demand.shuttle america has not shown or offered to show that the number of flights and the amount of car traffic would be identical even without the authorization.petitioners asserting standing are not required to negate every possibility that the outcome might be the same under highly unusual circumstances.
the faa makes a separate and quite different threshold objection.it says that petitioners are making attacks on prior orders.it points out that the statute imposes a limit on direct review,a,and,no petition for review having been filed within that time,it argues that it is not open to petitioners now to challenge the orders entered in september allowing shuttle america to operate from hanscom and hanscom to handle commercial flights using larger planes.
no doubt much of the impact on nearby natural and historic sites,assuming the allegations are true,stems from these earlier orders and not from the authorization to add a limited number of flights to laguardia.nevertheless,the petitioners are entitled to claim that an additional impact will be felt from the laguardia flights,over and above the effects of the prior orders.whether or not the plausible added effects are so slight as to justify the shortcuts taken by the faa is a merits issue yet to be addressed but it does not make an attack on this alleged incremental impact an attack on the wrong order.
only to the extent that petitioners are actually seeking redress from the effects of the present orders are their petitions timely,and this limitation must be borne in mind in considering the arguments.admittedly,there is some language in the briefs that appears to attack the earlier orders because of alleged infirmities in its findings or procedures.but the possibility that some of the petitioners arguments are does not defeat those actually directed to the more recent order.
this brings us to the merits.although the claims can be segmented in several ways,the underlying issues basically reduce themselves to two whether the faa erred substantively in concluding that the additional to ten new round trips a have a de minimis environmental impact and whether,regardless of impact,the faa erred procedurally in failing to consult further with governmental agencies concerned with historic preservation.we begin with the substantive issue which arises,in slightly different frameworks,under three different statutes.
the most familiar is nepa,which requires agencies to develop a detailed environmental impact statement an eis before undertaking major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.the nepa regulations permit agencies to conduct a less demanding environmental assessment to determine whether an eis is required if not,the agency must explain its determination in a finding of no significant impact.
in a regulation whose validity is not in dispute,the faa effectively concedes that the laguardia amendment qualifies as a major federal action.dep t of,fed.aviation admin.order d,policies and procedures for considering environmental impacts,app,e however,a categorical exclusion excuses the faa from preparing either an eis or an environmental assessment for operating specifications and amendments thereto which do not significantly change the operating environment of the airport.faa d,app,h.
this exclusion is itself qualified by an extraordinary circumstances provision which requires at least an environmental assessment for an otherwise excluded action if the action is,inter alia,likely to have an effect that is not minimal on properties protected under section of nhpa or section f of the transportation act of,or likely to be highly controversial on environmental grounds.faa order d.petitioners rely on both of these exceptions and argue that the additional flights have more than minimal effects and were highly controversial.
nhpa and section f impose different requirements than nepa,in the service of somewhat more focused interests but the requirements of concern one possible qualification regarding an obligation to turn as with nepa on whether the agency action poses a plausible environmental threat.a brief description of the two statutes makes this clear.
nhpa,heavily relied on by petitioners,is designed to protect certain historic properties,which indisputably include sites near hanscom.section of the statute requires that prior to a proposed federal undertaking,the agency must take into account the effect on such properties and allow the advisory council on historic preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment.the act thus imposes both a substantive obligation to weigh effects in deciding whether to authorize the federal action and a procedural obligation to consult.see generally part.
the grant of a permit such as the laguardia authorization can certainly qualify as an undertaking.c y see also sugarloaf citizens ass fed.energy reg.comm n,cir.but even if the approval of the laguardia flights is assumed to be an undertaking,the substantive obligation to take into account the effect of the flights on historic properties is beside the point if there is no potential adverse effect.see a.to that extent,the question under nepa and under nhpa is the same whether the faa erred in finding that any impact of the newly authorized flights on the surrounding area was de minimis.
the last of the three f of the department of transportation even more stringent where it applies.it protects certain public parks and historic sites,again indisputably including some near hanscom,from any transportation program or project requiring the use of such park or land,unless certain quite restrictive tests have been met.to proceed in the teeth of such a use,the agency must find that there is no feasible alternative to using that land and that the program or project includes all possible planning to minimize harm.c.
at first blush,one might think that section f could have nothing to do with authorizing new flights from an existing,physically unaltered airport but the statute has been read to apply not only to a physical use or occupancy of protected parks or land but also to activities that will have a serious indirect impact on the protected park or constructive use.p iii morongo band of mission indians fed.aviation,cir.once again,the faa finding that the laguardia flights would have only a de minimis effect would avoid the statute if the finding were to be upheld.adler lewis,cir.
what,then,underpins the faa finding of de minimis impact in this case the starting point is that independent of the laguardia flights,hanscom handled just under flights in,and the disputed laguardia flights would add,at a maximum,ten more flights per day.the more realistic estimate of seven flights,according to the faa,would produce an annual increase in hanscom flights of about number that absent special circumstances would approach the trivial.
this figure might at first appear to understate the potential environmental effect because most existing hanscom flights are private aircraft,which are somewhat smaller and carry fewer passengers than even the modest passenger turboprop planes used by shuttle america.on the other hand,some of the resulting ground traffic occurs in periods where existing levels are light,and the new flights use turboprop aircraft considerably quieter than the corporate jets and other civilian aircraft currently using the airport.thus,certain effects of the additional flights may be less than the already small percentage increase in the number of flights.
but we need not rely on such inferences because here the faa directly studied the three types of potential effects from the additional flights noise,fuel emissions,and surface traffic from passenger travel to and from the airport.as background for considering the effects,the faa extrapolated from massport generic environmental impact report the geir,actually completed in,which projected and extensively assessed the noise,emissions,and traffic effects of future hanscom operations under zero,modest,and robust growth scenarios for commercial aviation.it also relied on a surface traffic study performed in for the adjacent hanscom air force base.
the faa summarized its findings in two letters on september,and october,to the massachusetts historical commission.the faa first compared the actual number of flights in prior to the laguardia authorization with the geir projections under the modest growth scenario,and found that the geir forecast was nearly exact approximately flights.this both confirmed the accuracy of the geir and,since the geir indicated no significant environmental concerns under the modest growth scenario,showed that baseline conditions were acceptable.
the faa then conducted its own studies,which found that the additional laguardia flights would not exacerbate environmental conditions.as to noise,the faa found that the additional flights would have a percent or less increase in the dnl db noise contour,which indicates noise levels compatible with all land uses,see part,app.a,tbl,under a test in which a percent increase is deemed significant.it also found that the dnl db noise contour would continue to remain almost completely on airport property and that most of minute man national park and walden woods would fall outside the dnl db line it thus concluded that the area around hanscom should not experience appreciable increases in aircraft noise or overflights as a result of the added air traffic.
for air quality effects,the faa used a model that took account of emissions both from aircraft accounting for factors such as equipment type and including,taxi,and idling time and surface vehicles both passenger traffic and ground support equipment.the faa concluded that the potential emissions associated with the laguardia flights were below de minimis levels as to both of the two critical pollutants and that the new flights would not undercut the state implementation plan for air quality.
as for surface traffic,the faa found that none of the flights would affect peak morning traffic and only one would affect peak evening traffic.estimating that each flight would generate additional vehicle trips,it concluded that,at worst,the peak evening flight would increase traffic at several intersections on route by only about percent,which the faa deemed minimal and within the geir projection already found to be tolerable.as for noise increase,it found that the increased traffic volume would raise the peak level by less than db,which is not a perceptible increase.see p iii.
remarkably,in their lengthy submissions,petitioners make no direct attack on the aircraft noise or air pollution conclusions.petitioners say only that any reliance on the geir was inappropriate because it was prepared for unrelated operations and is out of date.but in fact,the faa verified the geir accuracy by finding that the actual growth at hanscom as of coincided almost exactly with the geir modest growth scenario whose environmental effects had already been considered.
the faa surface traffic analysis gets more attention,but even here their discussion is limited to a few pages and is confined to three brands of criticism highly general claims that the agency analysis is inadequate,that the faa should have discussed hour traffic or other intersections criticisms of the agency factual assumptions,that the faa underestimated the number of vehicle trips that each passenger would take or abstract statements of disagreement by other entities,claims by the national park service that increased traffic would have serious detrimental impacts.
under settled doctrine,the faa factual findings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence,c,and its reasoning is tested for reasonableness under an arbitrary and capricious standard.a penobscot air,fed.aviation,cir.further,it is up to those who assail its findings or reasoning to identify the defects in evidence and the faults in reasoning.lomak petroleum,fed.energy reg.comm n.
where the agency is dealing with a very complicated and technical subject,this takes a lot of work by lawyers in culling the record and organizing the information for the reviewing court,but it can be done.here,the faa final a tiny percentage increase in flights would have a de minimis presumptively inviting but,in principle,can be overcome by a sustained and organized rebuttal.nothing offered by petitioners approaches such an effort.gauzy generalizations and criticisms,in the face of specific findings and a plausible result,are not even a start at a serious assault.
there is one obvious concern,and it is not about the impact of this extremely modest increase in shuttle america flights.conceivably,shuttle america or another airline could appear with a succession of proposals,each modest in size and in impact and yet the cumulative effect of the faa approvals could be major even though no one approval was significant in itself.either a clear plan for such successive steps or proof that such a succession was foreseeable could conceivably require an overall prospective assessment,b.
but we are not faced with any such developed claim in this case,nor do the known facts suggest any such thing.at the time of shuttle america application,commercial service at hanscom had been a repeated failure,and there was no reason to believe,at that point,that demand would dramatically increase.now,shuttle america has reduced its operations and is under the protection of the bankruptcy court.if shuttle america or other airlines undertake a series of proposed expansions,it will be time enough to consider whether new and projected activities need to be considered together.
petitioners say that even if the minimal effects finding stands,the faa own regulations still required at least an environmental assessment under nepa because the proposed action was highly controversial on environmental grounds.faa order d b.the faa regulations,read literally,indicate that this test is met if the action in question is opposed on environmental grounds by a federal,state,or local government agency or by a substantial number of the persons affected.faa order d.although the federal and state agencies did not formally oppose the laguardia flights instead simply asking for more study,the four adjoining towns flatly opposed the new flights.
citing a number of cases,the faa argues that whether a project is environmentally controversial does not depend on whether vocal opponents exist but on whether reasonable disagreement exists over the project risk of causing environmental harm.see,found.for am.wild sheep dep t of,cir.otherwise,says the faa,projects could be bogged down by a heckler veto despite the lack of a genuine environmental threat.the faa says that its own assessment here that the project is not objectively controversial is entitled to deference.
the faa approach certainly makes sense on policy grounds,but it is in some tension with the wording of its own regulation,which seems to make official opposition to the proposed action the trigger.by contrast,the decisions on which the faa relies interpret controversial as used in other regulations,where the term modifies effects phrasing more helpful to the faa reading.see,id.interpreting b.
we need not decide whether the latitude allowed to the agency in interpreting its own regulations,see thomas jeffers
