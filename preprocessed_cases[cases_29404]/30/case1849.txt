in this case we construe health and safety code section section,which defines eligibility for a fund for reimbursement of cleanup costs related to leaks from underground storage tanks usts.
plaintiff murray kelsoe sought a writ of mandate in the trial court to set aside a decision of defendant california state water resources control board board declaring him ineligible for the fund because he lacked a permit for his usts on january,years before his claim for reimbursement,even though he had a permit since.the board decision is based on its interpretation of section.the trial court agreed with that interpretation in denying kelsoe mandate petition.
as we explain below,the board should have considered whether plaintiff was entitled to a waiver of the requirement for a permit on january.such a permit waiver would allow plaintiff current claim for reimbursement.accordingly,we reverse for the limited purpose of consideration of a permit waiver.
