defendant melvin weintraub appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut janet bond arterton,district judge convicting him,after a jury trial,of criminal violations of and conspiracy to violate the clean air act caa or the act,c,c b,and regulations promulgated thereunder.
background 
in november,weintraub,a real estate developer and the primary shareholder of morelite development construction,morelite and liberty realty associates,llc liberty collectively the corporate defendants,began negotiations with the city of new haven,connecticut the city for the purchase of an abandoned office building located at temple street in new haven,with an eye to renovating the building and converting it into residential apartments.prior to weintraub involvement,the city had engaged a consulting firm to evaluate the building for renovation or demolition,and that firm in turn had hired mystic air quality associates,mystic to perform an environmental analysis of the building.in reviewing the dilapidated property,mystic prepared a report describing the presence of a considerable amount of asbestos both in floor tiles throughout the building and in insulation in the building basement.an appraiser hired by the city estimated the building value to be,after accounting for the building poor condition and the estimated high cost of asbestos removal.the city provided weintraub with the appraisal and the consultant report,which included the mystic report.in,weintraub and the city agreed that liberty would purchase the property from the city for.
morelite hired defendant salvatore napolitano to oversee operations at temple and john dawson as a to demolish the building interior.dawson was not licensed by the state to perform asbestos abatement.nevertheless,throughout the demolition,employees under dawson supervision scraped up floor tiles and removed insulation from the basement.they placed the material in plastic garbage bags,which were then taped closed.at least some of the bags were dumped illegally by another defendant,arthur harris,at unauthorized sites including a local park and amtrak property.
soon after demolition began,in february,a state health inspector began investigating reports that asbestos was being thrown from the windows of the building.during his investigation,the inspector noticed that floor tiles had been removed and issued a warning letter that directed the defendants to hire a licensed contractor.napolitano responded by hiring eagle environmental,eagle to survey the quantity and quality of asbestos in the building.in march,eagle issued a report that confirmed the mystic report finding of significant amounts of asbestos and stated that abatement work should be performed by a licensed contractor.napolitano tried to bribe eagle to provide paperwork indicating that the asbestos had been successfully abated,but eagle refused.
in april,after receiving a copy of the eagle report but no evidence of proper abatement,the city building inspector sent a letter to weintraub asking when the unsafe conditions of the building would be eliminated.thereafter,the building inspector and liberty lender continuously pressured weintraub to produce documentation of proper asbestos abatement.in june,with weintraub knowledge,napolitano procured forged documents showing that abatement had been completed and provided the documents to the lender and building inspector.based on that representation,the lender released the capital that weintraub had sought,enabling liberty to close on its purchase of the building in july.
both before and throughout the demolition process,weintraub knew of the asbestos at temple street.he received the mystic report,which included an itemized accounting of the asbestos present in the building.he signed a demolition permit indicating that asbestos abatement would be required.he held numerous conversations with city personnel and his own employees regarding the asbestos in the building.he closely monitored morelite expenditures for the disposal of removed asbestos.he was told on several occasions of the need to employ the services of a licensed asbestos abatement contractor.he made a variety of statements regarding the legality of the asbestos removal.he evidenced knowledge of wrongdoing by complaining to the building inspector that the inspector should not communicate with him in writing about the building asbestos problem.he also tried to persuade city personnel to make false statements about the defendants compliance with asbestos regulations.and finally,he participated in the unsuccessful effort to procure phony abatement certifications from eagle.
on september,a grand jury returned an indictment against all of the defendants.this was supplanted on march,by a superseding indictment against weintraub,dawson,the corporate defendants,and several other individual defendants.napolitano,who had agreed to cooperate with the government,was named but not charged in the superseding indictment.count one of the superseding indictment charged that the named defendants conspired to violate the caa,c,by unlawfully removing and disposing of asbestos.counts two through eight charged substantive violations of the caa,the national emission standard for hazardous air pollutants for asbestos and accompanying work practice standards promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency epa under the caa,see h b,and causing,aiding,or abetting such violations,under.the substantive counts alleged improper handling and removal of material and failure to notify epa and the connecticut department of environmental protection dep,as required by epa regulations.prior to trial,the government voluntarily dismissed count eight,which alleged a failure to notify the dep.
a jury trial was held in september.at the close of the prosecution case,weintraub moved pursuant to.a for judgment of acquittal on counts three to five.liberty made the same motion with respect to counts two to seven.the district court denied the motions without prejudice to renewal.the jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts against weintraub and the corporate defendants.all of the defendants renewed their rule motions and moved for a new trial pursuant to.the district court dismissed counts four and five against weintraub,finding insufficient evidence that he knew that the asbestos had not been properly wetted during removal,and count two against liberty,on the basis that the corporation had not been formed at the time that it was allegedly required to report to epa.the court denied all new trial motions.
on may,the district court sentenced weintraub to imprisonment for months and one day,to be followed by three years supervised release,and a fine.dawson was sentenced to months incarceration,to be followed by three years of supervised release and a fine.each corporate defendant received five years probation and a fine and was ordered to pay,jointly and severally,restitution of,to cover medical monitoring for workers exposed to asbestos.finally,the district court sentenced all of the defendants jointly and severally to restitution of,payable to the city of new haven and amtrak.weintraub,dawson,and the corporate defendants appealed.in summary orders filed simultaneously with this opinion,we dispose of the appeals of weintraub 
discussion 
weintraub alleges a host of errors in the district court,most of which do not merit discussion.weintraub most serious claim is that the district court erred in instructing the jury on the level of scienter that is required to prove a criminal violation of the clean air act and its accompanying regulations in particular,weintraub argues that the district court improperly failed to instruct the jury that the government was obligated to prove weintraub knowledge of the facts underlying the essential threshold elements of the asbestos friability of asbestos containing materials and the threshold amount requirements.because weintraub failed in the district court to preserve this claim of error for appeal,we review it for plain error.we find that the district court scienter instruction was not erroneous,and that,even if it were,the error was not plain.we accordingly affirm the judgment of the district court.
regulatory framework 
before turning to the circumstances of the case at hand,we briefly describe the regulatory framework that underlies it.section of title of the united states code authorizes the regulation of hazardous air pollutants,one of which is asbestos,see b,and directs the epa to adopt national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps specific to each hazardous air pollutant and industrial source category emitting such pollutants,see c,d and.if the epa determines that promulgation or enforcement of a neshap under d for a particular source category would not be feasible,however,the agency is empowered to adopt a standard.see h.because asbestos is not typically emitted through a conveyance designed and constructed to emit or capture it,h a,such as a pipe or smokestack,but rather escapes from more diffuse sources such as open construction or demolition sites,epa adopted a standard for the handling of asbestos in building demolition and renovation.see.the standard imposes,handling,and disposal requirements for covered demolition and renovation operations involving asbestos.
the standard does not cover all material acm or all demolition and renovation operations.the standard applies only to r egulated material racm,defined as 
a friable asbestos material,b category i nonfriable acm that has become friable,c category i nonfriable acm that will be or has been subjected to sanding,grinding,cutting,or abrading,or d category ii nonfriable acm that has a high probability of becoming or has become crumbled,pulverized,or reduced to powder by the forces expected to act on the material in the course of demolition or renovation operations regulated by this subpart.
in turn,friable asbestos material is defined as any substance including more than one percent asbestos as determined by polarized light microscopy,see pt,subpt.e,app.e,and which when dry,can be crumbled,pulverized,or reduced to powder by hand pressure.collectively,category i and ii nonfriable acm are defined as acm containing more than one percent asbestos as measured by polarized light microscopy in particular industrial materials such as floor tiles or other materials that can not be reduced to dust by hand pressure.see.
the standard will apply to a demolition or renovation operation only if specified threshold quantities of racm are present.the work practice standard applies to a renovation only if 
the combined amount of racm to be stripped,removed,dislodged,cut,drilled,or similarly disturbed is a t least linear meters linear feet on pipes or at least square meters square feet on other facility components,or a t least cubic meter cubic feet off facility components where the length or area could not be measured previously.
the caa creates strict civil liability for violations of or regulations adopted thereunder,which include the asbestos standard.see b.the caa also holds criminally liable a ny person who knowingly violates any requirement or prohibition of section of this title,including a requirement of any rule,order,waiver,or permit promulgated or approved under such section.c emphasis added.the meaning of the phrase knowingly violates in this context is at the heart of this appeal.
ii.plain error 
on appeal,weintraub challenges the district court jury instructions on the level of scienter required to be proved to establish that he knowingly violated the standard,though he did not preserve this claim below.no party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict,stating distinctly the matter to which that party objects and the grounds of the objection.if an appellant,aggrieved by a district court jury instruction,failed to make such a particularized objection in the district court,we review the instruction only for plain error.see.b united states olano,d.we will reverse only if there has been error,that is plain,that affect s substantial rights,and the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states knoll,cir citing,inter alia,united states olano,d internal quotation marks omitted.in general,i t is the rare case in which an improper instruction will justify reversal of a criminal conviction when no objection has been made in the trial court.henderson kibbe,d.
although the defendants did propose a jury instruction on scienter,they did not present the argument that weintraub now asserts on appeal that the jury could convict only if it found knowledge of friability and the threshold quantity required by the asbestos regulations.while the defendants proposed instruction that a person acts knowingly when he acts with an awareness of a fact or circumstance rendering his conduct illegal,could arguably be read to encompass the theory they press on appeal,it was insufficiently particular to raise the question now presented and thus preserve it for appeal.by failing to draw the district court attention to the problem that weintraub now complains of,the defendants deprived the district court of the opportunity to correct its putative error.
weintraub also argues that counsel properly objected during the charge conference.to the contrary,defense counsel not only did not seek the instruction that weintraub now argues for,they affirmatively accepted the government formulation.counsel for the government stated that our concern is that the government does have to prove that the defendant knew that it was percent asbestos containing material and all that other stuff,to which counsel for liberty responded,agreed.the court then summarized that the scienter standard required that the defendant knew generally that the material was asbestos containing material,to which the defendants attorneys responded variously y eah,y es,and t hat works.weintraub counsel then specifically clarified that asbestos containing material meant only that the material involved in fact contained asbestos,not that it met the standard definitions t hat the material was asbestos containing material means you had to know it was asbestos.these statements,far from reasonably suggesting an objection of the sort weintraub now advances,indicate counsel acceptance of the instruction eventually given by the district court.united states civelli,cir counsel further comments during colloquy with the court only compounded his earlier failure to object,for his comments were expressions of acquiescence,not exception.we consequently review for plain error.
the first requirement of plain error review is that the district court in fact must have erred.see olano,at.here,we believe that the district court jury instruction adequately conveyed the degree of scienter required by the caa,because it with defense counsel suggestion at the charge the jury find that weintraub knew that material involved in the renovation contained asbestos.
scienter required by the clean air act 
weintraub argues that the phrase knowingly violates in c requires specific knowledge of the facts that meet the threshold requirements of the standard the friability of the asbestos and the minimum quantities that are required to trigger the standard.we conclude that such detailed knowledge need not be shown.
to determine what congress meant when it used the phrase knowingly violates,we begin with the text of the statute.see disabled in action hammons,cir.the phrase is commonly used in criminal provisions,but many courts have found it and similar formulations ambiguous.see,united states video,d liparota united states,d united states international minerals chemical,d united states bronx reptiles,cir united states figueroa,cir united states ahmad,cir.see generally wayne lafave austin scott,criminal law b,at ed.it may plausibly be read to require either knowledge that the conduct in question violated the law or knowledge of the facts and circumstances that amount to a violation,without specific knowledge of the law.
on its face,the phrase appears to suggest that the government must prove that the defendant knew that he was violating the law.this reading is precluded,however,by the supreme court decision in united states international minerals chemical,in which the supreme court held that the phrase knowingly violates did not require knowledge that the defendant conduct was unlawful.the court found no evidence of congressional intent to abrogate the bedrock common law principle that ignorance of the law is not a defense.see int l minerals,at.we have reached a similar conclusion with respect to the similarly worded criminal provisions of the clean water act cwa,c a knowingly violates,and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra,d in knowing violation.see united states hopkins,cir construing the cwa united states laughlin,cir construing rcra.the only other circuit court to have construed knowingly violates in the caa,notably also in a case involving the asbestos standard,applied international minerals to conclude that the act does not demand knowledge that one conduct is illegal.see united states buckley,cir.
instead,we hold that the phrase knowingly violates requires knowledge of facts and attendant circumstances that comprise a violation of the statute,not specific knowledge that one conduct is illegal.courts have applied a canon of statutory interpretation to read criminal statutes that are silent or ambiguous as to the required standard of mens rea,to demand knowledge of enough facts to distinguish conduct that is likely culpable from conduct that is entirely innocent.see carter united states,d the presumption in favor of scienter requires a court to read into a statute only that mens rea which is necessary to separate wrongful conduct from otherwise innocent conduct.quoting video,at.liparota,at.reading statute to avoid criminaliz ing a broad range of apparently innocent conduct united states sanders,cir.i t has become clear that knowledge may suffice for criminal culpability if extensive enough to attribute to the knower a guilty mind,or knowledge that he or she is performing a wrongful act.quoting figueroa,at,cert.denied,d hanousek united states,d thomas and,dissenting from denial of certiorari stating that we should be hesitant to expose countless numbers of construction workers and contractors to heightened criminal liability for using ordinary devices to engage in normal industrial operations.s cienter requirements should be presumed to require no more knowledge than necessary to put a defendant on notice that he is committing a act.figueroa,at id.at requiring sufficient knowledge to recognize that they have done something culpable.
we emphasize that knowledge of wrongdoing and knowledge of illegality are different things the former requires knowledge only of facts that in a reasonable person would create an expectation that his conduct was likely subject to strict regulation.determining the extent of the mens rea required by a statute thus involves a commonsense evaluation of the nature of the particular device or substance congress has subjected to regulation and the expectations that individuals may legitimately have in dealing with the regulated items.staples united states,d.the touchstone is the defendant settled expectations about the regulated conduct video,at.united states laporta,cir,rev on other grounds,sicurella united states,cir.
our understanding of the appropriate standard is informed by two supreme court decisions applying the scienter requirement of one statute to two different sets of facts.compare united states freed,d,with staples,d.the national firearms act proscribes,inter alia,receiv ing or possess ing a firearm which is not registered to him in the national firearms registration and transfer record.d.in,the freed court held that hand grenades,which are included in the definition of firearms,were obviously dangerous,closely regulated weapons that justified an inference of notice of wrongdoing one would hardly be surprised to learn that possession of hand grenades is not an innocent act.freed,at.the court concluded that the defendant could be convicted without proof that he knew the grenades were unregistered.knowingly possessing the grenades was sufficient to distinguish the defendant conduct from an innocent act.see id.
years later,in staples,the court applied the same analysis to the possession of a machine gun,but reached a nearly opposite result based on the different expectations of regulation associated with guns.the court found that the long history of substantially unregulated possession of guns in the united states meant that a possessor would not reasonably expect that possession to be closely regulated.the court consequently decided that the government was obligated to prove that the defendant knew that his gun was,in fact,capable of being fired automatically and thus was a machine gun,unregistered possession of which violated the act.simple knowledge that it was a gun was inadequate to create an expectation that its possession could be criminal.see staples,at.knowledge that the weapon was automatic was necessary to distinguish between regulated and traditionally unregulated weapons and hence between likely culpable and likely innocent conduct.although,like grenades,guns are dangerous,because the latter have historically been unregulated or lightly regulated,a defendant who knew only that he possessed a gun would not reasonably expect regulation.
in the instant case,weintraub challenges his conviction on four counts,both substantively and as objects of the charged conspiracy count two,causing a renovation of a building containing racm without notifying epa,in violation of c b and b count three,causing wrecking and dismantling that broke up the asbestos containing materials,in violation of c and c count six,causing asbestos containing materials to be placed in containers that were not and did not possess the required warning labels,in violation of e and a and count seven,dispos ing and caus ing to be disposed asbestos containing materials at one or more sites that could not legally accept asbestos for disposal,in violation of c and b.
but for the presence of asbestos,each count describes conduct that is basically innocuous and largely unregulated.as a general matter,one who renovates or demolishes a building does not have to notify epa or comply with federal regulations when handling or disposing of supplies or waste materials.under normal circumstances,one would not expect regulation of such innocent activities.it is the presence of asbestos that distinguishes such activity from that which a reasonable person would expect to be prohibited or heavily regulated.asbestos is thus the crucial element separating legal innocence from wrongful conduct.video,at.
weintraub contends that the category of asbestos is analogous to the category of guns at issue in staples and that therefore the government must demonstrate knowledge that the asbestos was racm,as it had to demonstrate knowledge that the weapon was automatic in staples.we disagree.unlike the generic category of guns in staples,the category of asbestos is easily sufficient to trigger an expectation of regulation in a reasonable person and to distinguish in his or her mind innocent from wrongful conduct.in staples,the supreme court emphasized the tradition of substantially unregulated possession of firearms in this country as countering the inference that a possessor of a firearm should reasonably anticipate regulation.one would need to know that the weapon could fire automatically before one would suspect his possession to be wrongful.see staples,at.likewise,in video,which involved a prosecution for trafficking in child pornography,the court found that,because the first amendment protects possession and distribution of pornography generally,one would not anticipate criminal liability for the distribution of what one knew only to be pornography.rather,the court concluded,one would need to know additionally that the pornography involved depictions of children to expect that its distribution would invite prosecution.see video,at.
in contrast,a reasonable person settled expectations about asbestos are quite different.as a general matter,asbestos is strictl
