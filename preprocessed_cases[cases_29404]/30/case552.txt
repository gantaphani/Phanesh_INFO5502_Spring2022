northshore mining company,the united states of america,and the state of minnesota and the minnesota pollution control agency each appeal from the district court order holding that those portions of a injunction regulating air emissions from northshore taconite pellet operation at silver bay,minnesota,were moot.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
background 
federal litigation and injunction 
in february,the united states filed suit against the reserve mining company reserve,seeking injunctive relief limiting the air and water emissions discharged from reserve iron ore processing facility in silver bay,minnesota.the united states alleged that the silver bay facility was discharging harmful mineral fibers fibers into the waters of lake superior and into the air above the great lakes in violation of various federal and state statutes and federal and state common law 
after a day bench trial,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting injunctive relief to the plaintiffs.see united states reserve mining,modified and remanded sub nom.reserve mining epa,cir en banc.the district court found that the fibers discharged into the air by reserve silver bay facility were similar or identical to amosite asbestos,a known carcinogen.although the court recognized that medical science had not yet determined what would constitute a safe level of airborne asbestos fibers,the court was satisfied that the amount of fibers discharged by the facility posed a serious health hazard to the people exposed to it.id.at.thus,the district court concluded that reserve air emissions constituted a nuisance under federal and state common law and violated minnesota air pollution control regulations.id.based on these violations of state and federal law,the court enjoined the silver bay facility discharge of fibers into the air,beginning at,the following day,april.id.at.the injunction had the practical effect of requiring the closure of the facility.
reserve immediately filed a motion to stay the district court injunction pending an appeal on the merits,which this court granted,conditioned upon a showing by reserve that it is taking prompt steps to prepare and implement an appropriate plan for abatement.reserve mining united states,cir.shortly thereafter,this court sitting en banc modified the injunction in part and remanded the case to the district court.reserve mining epa,cir en banc.we agreed with the district court conclusion that the silver bay facility air emissions violated minnesota air pollution control regulations and constituted a nuisance under minnesota state law.id.at.we disagreed,however,with the district court conclusion that the air emissions constituted a nuisance under federal common law because the evidence did not show that the emissions had interstate effects.id.at.additionally,we modified the district court injunction as it related to air emissions,requiring that 
reserve must use such available technology as will reduce the asbestos fiber count in the ambient air at silver bay below a medically significant level.according to the record in this case,controls may be deemed adequate which will reduce the fiber count to the level ordinarily found in the ambient air of a control city such as paul.
id.at.the parties refer to this requirement as the control city standard.we allotted reserve a reasonable time to design and implement measures to bring its facilities into compliance with the modified injunction.id.at.
post injunction developments and state regulation 
following our en banc decision,reserve proposed over million in improvements and new construction to bring its silver bay facility into compliance with the terms of the modified injunction.in mid,however,the mpca resisted reserve proposed remedial measures by denying reserve the permits necessary to construct and operate these improvements.reserve sued in state court to compel the mpca to issue the permits.the minnesota supreme court ultimately resolved the dispute in reserve favor and remanded the matter to the state trial court for further proceedings.reserve mining herbst.
the mpca complied with the minnesota supreme court order by issuing the requisite construction and operating permits however,in doing so,the mpca incorporated the injunction control city standard into the operating permits.the permits required that the ambient air shall contain no more fibers than that level ordinarily found in the ambient air of a control city such as paul and that the fibers in the ambient air shall be maintained below a level which is injurious to human health or welfare in violation of minnesota statute section.reserve mining.pollution control agency,alterations omitted.reserve objected to the mpca operating permit language in the remanded state action,and after the mpca unsuccessfully tried to remove the dispute to federal court,see reserve mining.pollution control agency,remanding the case to state court because t he question of standards and regulations imposed by state law is separate from the federal imposed ambient air standard,the state trial court amended the permits by modifying the control city standard,see reserve mining,at.on appeal,the minnesota supreme court reinstated the original control city standard in the operating permits.id.at.
after reserve completed the improvements to the silver bay facility,the mpca took air samples from silver bay and paul in and to determine the cities respective fiber counts.the test results showed that the fiber count in silver bay was less than that in paul,thereby satisfying the control city standard in the injunction and the state permits.in october,the parties stipulated to an administrative dismissal of the federal lawsuit,providing,however,that the federal district court would retain jurisdiction over the injunction.in,reserve sold its silver bay facility to the northshore mining company northshore.the subsequent mpca permits issued to northshore contained the control city standard.
in,believing that the fiber count in paul had decreased since,the mpca informed northshore that it was going to resume testing in silver bay and paul to ensure continuing compliance with the control city standard.in december,northshore filed an administrative permit application with the mpca,seeking to strike the control city standard from its state permits.in its application,northshore argued that the control city standard was no longer necessary for two reasons the and tests demonstrated the effectiveness of the earlier abatement actions,and even if the current fiber count in silver bay was then greater than that in paul,the current silver bay fiber count was nevertheless below a medically significant level.the mpca denied the application in february because northshore request was a major permit amendment that required a more extensive application procedure.in may,northshore appealed to the minnesota court of appeals,which affirmed the mpca decision.northshore mining.pollution control agency,no,wl.may,unpublished.northshore submitted a major permit amendment application in august,and its efforts to secure the amendment are ongoing.
injunction revisited 
in july,while its appeal was pending before the minnesota court of appeals,northshore filed a motion with the federal district court seeking clarification of and relief from the injunction control city standard under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court denied northshore motion,concluding that northshore lacked standing to bring its claim under rule b because it had not demonstrated that its alleged injury would be fully redressed by a favorable ruling.united states northshore mining,wl,at,unpublished.the district court reasoned that the control city standard had become an independent state standard as a result of its inclusion in northshore mpca permits thus,a favorable decision concerning the injunction would not affect northshore duty to comply with the state permits.id.at.the district court went on,however,to consider sua sponte the continuing need for the injunction,holding that 
the injunction no longer has any force or effect.the injunction has been effectively incorporated
