in this case,we are called upon to decide whether the california department of forestry and fire protection cdf properly granted an exemption allowing the harvesting of less than three acres of timber without environmental review,when one of the mitigation measures to two prior timber harvesting plans for the same property was that the trees in question remain in place to protect a neighboring property from excessive wind.the trial court decided cdf properly granted the exemption,and entered judgment on the pleadings in plaintiff paul katzeff action for violations of the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.et,violations of the nejedly forest practice act of et the fpa,and nuisance.we reverse.
background 
this action was brought against cdf,gregg kuljian,and ed powers collectively respondents in april,seeking to set aside cdf approval of an exemption allowing the conversion of less than three acres of timber on kuljian property.according to the first amended complaint and petition for writ of mandate the complaint plaintiff and kuljian own adjoining parcels of property.in,cdf approved a timber harvest plan thp on kuljian land the property the thp cdf concluded that the thp as proposed would allow wind to be funneled and accelerated,creating a threat of damage to katzeff property and home.accordingly,as one of the conditions of approval,cdf required that no trees be removed from within feet of katzeff home unless prior approval is obtained from katzeff.
cdf approved another thp for the same location years later,in the thp.noting the apparent effectiveness of the wind buffer,cdf again required the landowner to refrain from cutting down trees within feet of katzeff house.
some years later,powers sold the property to kuljian.kuljian could not afford to pay the purchase price,and so as a condition of the sale,he agreed to seek a conversion exemption pursuant to section,subdivision g,and to give powers the right to log and sell the timber in the application for the conversion exemption,kuljian stated he intended to convert the timberland to an orchard.in april,cdf accepted and thereby approved the conversion exemption.
in his first cause of action,katzeff alleged that the conversion exemption violated the fpa and ceqa in that it would destroy a mitigation previously deemed necessary.in his second cause of action,he alleged that kuljian did not have a bona fide intent to convert the land to an orchard.the third cause of action alleged a claim for private nuisance.
powers moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the complaint did not state a cause of action.code civ,subd.c b.the trial court granted the motion and dismissed the action in its entirety.katzeff appealed

requirements of fpa and ceqa 
timber harvesting operations in this state must be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the forest practice act.the fpa was intended to create and maintain a comprehensive system for regulating timber harvesting in order to achieve two goals to ensure that w here feasible,the productivity of timberlands is restored,enhanced,and maintained and to ensure that t he goal of maximum sustained production of timber products is achieved while giving consideration to values relating to recreation,watershed,wildlife,range and forage,fisheries,and aesthetic enjoyment.citation.the fpa requires timber owners or operators on private land to submit a timber harvest plan specific to the site and planned logging activity to cdf for approval before harvesting cdf approval of timber operations is generally subject to ceqa,but under section,the fpa regulatory scheme has been certified for exemption from ceqa requirements for preparation of an environmental impact report eir before approval of a project.citation.under the terms of section,subdivision c,that certification expressly exempts the timber harvesting plan process from the provisions of chapters and and section of ceqa,subd.c.chapters and deal,in large part,with the various requirements of an eir at both the state level chapter and the local level chapter.section sets forth the time within which an action challenging a public agency decision under the provisions of ceqa must be filed.citation.ebbetts pass forest watch california of forestry fire protection cal th,ebbetts pass.
division five of the first appellate district explained the relationship between the requirements of the fpa and ceqa in friends of the old trees department of forestry fire protection th,as follows under the fpa and its implementing regulations,hereafter forestry rules rule et,logging is subject to the department approval of a site specific thp.citations.the thp preparation and approval process is the functional equivalent of the preparation of an environmental impact report eir contemplated by ceqa.citation.w ith the exception of certain specific provisions of ceqa relating to the procedural elements of the eir process,ceqa and its substantive criteria for the evaluation of a proposed project environmental impact apply to the timber harvesting industry,and are deemed part of the fpa and the forestry rules.citations.the supreme court has reiterated that timber harvesting is not exempt from adhering to the broad policy goals of ceqa.to the contrary,the court held that in approving timber harvesting plans,the administrative body must conform not only to the detailed and exhaustive provisions of the fpa,but also to those provisions of ceqa from which it has not been specifically exempted by the legislature.citation.significantly,the fpa and the forestry rules establish a statutory and regulatory framework that,construed together with ceqa,confers on the department the obligation to see that cumulative impacts and alternatives to the project,as well as other specified environmental information,be taken into consideration in evaluating thp.id.at.moreover,cdf has not only the authority but also the duty to approve,disapprove,and impose mitigation measures on timber harvest plans ebbetts pass,supra,cal th at.
as explained in environmental protection information center,johnson d,a thp is an informational document designed to serve as an abbreviated environmental impact report,setting forth proposed measures to mitigate the logging operation potential adverse impact on the environment.cdf and public review of the thp prior to approval is intended to ensure that the adverse environmental effects are substantially lessened,particularly by the exploration of feasible less damaging alternatives to the proposed harvesting project.section a part of ceqa,provides that the secretary of the resources agency may certify a regulatory program of a state agency as exempt from the requirement of eir preparation,if the program requires that a project be preceded by the preparation of a written project plan containing sufficient environmental impact information.to be certifiable,the agency regulatory program must be governed by rules and regulations which require that no project shall be approved if there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen any adverse impact on the environment,subd.d i 
destruction of mitigation measure 
katzeff first cause of action alleges that cdf violated both the fpa and ceqa by approving a conversion exemption that would destroy a mitigation it had previously deemed necessary under those statutory schemes.katzeff argues that cdf actions constituted improper piecemealing of a project,and that an agency may not delete a mitigation required by ceqa without supplemental environmental review.respondents take the position that the approval was a ministerial act not subject to ceqa and that it bore no relationship to the mitigation measures required by the and thp.they also argue that the thp have long since expired,and with them their mitigation requirements.
several statutes and rules bear upon the parties arguments.section forbids anyone to conduct timber operations unless a thp has been submitted to cdf section,subdivision a provides that a thp is effective for no more than three years,unless extended pursuant to specified procedures.forest practice rules,rule provides that the effective period of the plan is the period following the date the plan is determined to be in conformance or otherwise becomes effective pursuant to prc.timber operations shall commence no earlier than the expected date of commencement stated in the plan,except under certain conditions.the thp at issue here were approved in and.there is no dispute that the right to conduct timber operations under these thp has expired.
conversion exemptions are governed by section and forest practice rules,rule.as we have explained,section allows the state board of forestry and fire protection,upon determining that the exemption is consistent with the purposes of the fpa,to exempt from the fpa requirements anyone whose activities are limited to,among other things,t he conversion of less than three acres to a nontimber use,subd.g see.rule establishes the requirements for such exemptions.under rule a,the conversion exemption is applicable to a conversion of timberland to a use only,of less than three acres in one contiguous ownership,whether or not it is a portion of a larger land parcel and shall not be part of a thp.the notice of conversion exemption,which initiates the process,is required to contain certain material,including the names and addresses of the landowner,timber owner,and others a legal description of the land at issue certain maps and a statement by the owner of the land to be converted certifying that the operation is a conversion to nontimberland use,certifying that there is a bona fide intent to convert,specifying what the use will be after the conversion,and certifying that the landowner has not obtained a conversion exemption in the previous five years,unless a waiver had been granted.fp rules,rule a.as relevant here,timber operations conducted under rule are exempt from the conversion permit and thp requirements of the rules related to the conversion of timberland.
the presenting issue here is whether a conversion exemption that would destroy a mitigation required under thp may be approved without additional environmental review.the parties have drawn our attention to no case precisely on point,and our own research has disclosed none.
katzeff contends this case is analogous to orinda board of supervisors d orinda.there,a developer sought to build a project that included office,commercial,retail and theater space in downtown orinda,on a site occupied by a historic theater and bank building that would have been demolished by the project as proposed.id.at.while environmental review of the project was proceeding under ceqa,the building inspection department issued an unconditional permit for demolition of the theater and bank building.division three of the first appellate district concluded that this procedure violated ceqa because the demolition was a phase of the overall project as such,it was subject to the same ceqa review as the rest of the project,and the demolition permit could not be issued until the entire ceqa process was completed and the overall project lawfully approved.orinda,at.the court reasoned a public agency is not permitted to subdivide a single project into smaller individual subprojects in order to avoid the responsibility of considering the environmental impact of the project as a whole.the requirements of ceqa,can not be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into pieces which,individually considered,might be found to have no significant effect on the environment or to be only ministerial.citation.citation.ibid.the court noted that the demolition of the building had been considered part of the project from the outset,and that m ost important,both the board and the planning commission imposed conditions on the demolition of the theatre and bank building as part of their approval of the project if demolition could be segregated from other development activities and made nonreviewable,the requirements of ceqa would be avoided altogether id.at.
several points in orinda are significant here.first,orinda states the principle that a project can not be divided into smaller parts that individually will not have a significant effect on the environment.second,this rule is applicable even if one of the smaller parts might require only ministerial,rather than discretionary,approval.third,where conditions are imposed on a project,those the policies behind be avoided by applying for another approval apart from the larger project.orinda,supra,d at.
here,respondents contend,issuance of the conversion exemption was a ministerial action that required no environmental review.under orinda,however,even if we accept the argument that the exemption was ministerial,an applicant can not avoid environmental review of a portion of a larger project simply by securing a separate ministerial permit,particularly where the permit would undo the protective effects of conditions imposed on a project approval.
we recognize that orinda is not precisely on point because the demolition permit there was issued while the overall project was under review,while here the conversion exemption took place years later.but if that distinction were dispositive,any mitigation required by ceqa or the fpa could be nullified simply by the passage of time.as katzeff points out,under this line of reasoning,the wind buffer mitigation could permissibly be destroyed virtually as soon as it became is,after the landowner had completed operations under the the landowner could simply seek a conversion exemption as soon as the right to conduct timber operations under the thp had expired.the conflict between this result and the intent of ceqa is as noted in another context,e xpiration of the approval was an abstract occurrence that had no effect on the project environmental impacts.moss county of humboldt th.
we see no principled distinction between a conversion exemption sought immediately after the right to harvest under a thp has expired,and one sought a decade later.whether or not the legal right to harvest timber has expired,the environmental effects of the harvest are presumed to remain.the wind buffer was required in order to mitigate the effects of the timber harvest on katzeff property,and respondents offer no basis for a conclusion that the mitigation expires as a matter of law once the time to complete the timber very action that creates the need for the expired.
lincoln place tenants city of los angeles th lincoln place is also instructive on this question.the owners of an apartment complex built in sought to demolish the apartments and replace them with new structures.id.at.as mitigation for the loss of the historical and architectural value of the apartments,the eir recommended that before demolishing them,photographs should be taken of typical interiors and exteriors,drawings should be made of each type of unit and the site plan,and the structures should be offered for sale and removal to a new location.id.at.the city adopted the eir.id.at.afterward,however,the state historical resources commission nominated the apartments for inclusion in the national register,and while the nomination was pending,the owners applied for and obtained permits to demolish five of the structures on the property.id.at.the owners took the position that the demolition was not part of the building project,which was an entitlement to build not an entitlement to demolish therefore,according to the owners,they only had to comply with the conditions on the redevelopment project when they began building.the court of appeal rejected this distinction as disingenuous at best,noting that under ceqa a project is the whole of an action,which has a potential for resulting in a direct or indirect physical change in the environment,and that ceqa requirements can not be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into pieces which,individually considered,might be found to have no significant effect on the environment or to be only ministerial.lincoln place,at,fn.omitted.thus,on these facts,the court continued,it can not be argued ceqa does not apply to the demolition on the ground demolition permits are ministerial acts.lincoln place,at,fn,citing,subd.b and friends of westwood,city of los angeles d discussion of ministerial and discretionary acts.the court noted that demolition of the existing apartments had always been part of the owners plan and that the city had incorporated the mitigation measures into the project as conditions of approval,and went on having placed these conditions on the demolition segment of the redevelopment project,the city can not simply ignore them.mitigating conditions are not mere expressions of hope.lincoln place,supra,th at.
the court in lincoln place further noted that a lthough the city can not ignore the mitigating conditions it imposed on the project it can modify or delete them.after a project has been approved and while it is still being developed a mitigation measure or condition of approval may be changed or deleted if the measure has been found to be impractical or unworkable.lincoln place,supra,th at.for this,the court relied on napa citizens for honest government napa county bd.of supervisors th,which recognized that ceqa requires an agency to take steps to ensure that mitigation measures will actually be implemented as a condition of development,and not merely adopted and then neglected or discarded.however,the court in napa citizens went on to conclude that nothing in the law required that a mitigation measure,once adopted,is binding for all time.id.at.rather,when an earlier adopted mitigation measure has been deleted,the deference provided to governing bodies with respect to land use planning decisions must be tempered by the presumption that the governing body adopted the mitigation measure in the first place only after due investigation and consideration.we therefore hold that a governing body must state a legitimate reason for deleting an earlier adopted mitigation measure,and must support that statement of reason with substantial evidence,italics added see also mani brothers real estate group city of los angeles th,no need for supplemental eir rather than addendum to eir where substantial evidence supported city conclusion mitigation measures no longer necessary.although the decision in napa citizens was made in the context of a land use plan,the court in lincoln place concluded that the rules adopted in napa citizens apply to all projects that come within ceqa.lincoln place,supra,th at.
we likewise presume that cdf adopted the mitigation measure at issue only after due investigation and consideration.in fact,the administrative record indicates that this is the case.the wind impact analysis prepared in connection with the thp discusses the risk that,as a result of the project,storm winds would become funneled and accelerated on the southeastern corner,near katzeff house,and would deflect off the residual trees along the southern edge of the harvest area and will be directed to the corner.the analysis reviews the literature on this phenomenon and the ways to minimize its effects,and recommends a buffer strip as a mitigation measure,based on conversations with professors of silviculture at the university of california,berkeley and at humboldt state university.
consistent with the reasoning of the cases we have discussed,we conclude that where a public agency has adopted a mitigation measure for a project,it may not authorize destruction or cancellation of the or not the approval is reviewing the continuing need for the mitigation,stating a reason for its actions,and supporting it with substantial evidence.there may be good reasons for cdf to conclude that the wind buffer is no longer necessary to protect katzeff house from the effects of the harvesting done pursuant to the and thp.while the passage of time may have eliminated the need for the mitigation,it does not on its own render the mitigation inoperative,and cdf must justify its decision to allow the buffer strip to be cut down 
accordingly,we conclude the trial court erred in dismissing the first cause of action.
bona fide intent to convert 
in the second cause of action,katzeff alleges that kuljian did not have a present,bona fide intent to convert the land to an orchard,and that the planting of the orchard was not the purpose of the conversion.according to the complaint,kuljian could not afford to pay the full purchase price for the property,and the real parties accordingly agreed that kuljian would seek a conversion exemption for the land in question and powers would retain the rights to the timber.the complaint also alleges that cdf failed to determine that kuljian had a bona fide intent to convert the timberland under the criteria set forth in rule,and that its approval of the conversion was not based on substantial evidence and was unlawful.
forest practice rules,rule,which governs conversion exemptions,requires that a registered professional forester submit to the director a notice of conversion exemption timber operations containing a statement by the owner of the timberland to be converted certifying,among other things,that after considering the owner own economic ability to carry out the proposed conversion and the feasibility evaluation required by ccr a that there is a bona fide intent,as defined in ccr b,to convert.fp rules,rule a e.rule a requires the timberland owner,using the services of a registered professional forester,to provide information that the conversion is feasible,based on the extent of vegetation removal and site preparation required for the conversion,and the suitability of the soils,slope,aspect,and microclimate for the stated nontimber use.rule b defines bona fide intent as a present,sincere intention of the applicant to conform with and successfully execute the conversion plan,as determined by the director in accordance with provisions of rule.
the administrative record shows that cdf received the notice of conversion exemption on march.the application included kuljian certification that the project was a conversion,that he had the economic means to carry it out and bona fide intent,specifying the use of the land after conversion,and certifying that kuljian had not obtained such an exemption previously.see fp rules,rule a e.it also included a letter by registered professional forester tom kisliuk discussing the extent of the vegetation removal and site preparation required for the conversion,concluding that the soils,slope,aspect,and microclimate of the site were suitable for the proposed orchard,and supporting that conclusion with a discussion of the soil type,the slope,effects of weather,erosion hazards.see,rule a.kisliuk also certified that he had prepared a notice to be mailed by the landowner and that the notice was posted at least five days before the submission of the notice of conversion exemption,as required by rule a included in the application was a sample of kuljian letter to neighboring landowners including katzeff,informing them of his plans to seek the conversion exemption.cdf accepted the conversion exemption on april,which authorized kisliuk to begin timber operations on the site.
on april,while cdf approval was pending,katzeff wrote to donald morse of cdf and expressed his concerns about the effects of the loss of the wind buffer zone.on april,after the conversion exemption had been accepted,katzeff sent an email message to morse,informing him that logging had begun,again expressing his concern about i
