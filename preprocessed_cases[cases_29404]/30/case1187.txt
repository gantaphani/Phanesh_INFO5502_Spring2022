this appeal concerns the authority of the army corps of engineers the corps and the environmental protection agency epa over a form of agricultural activity called deep ripping when it occurs in wetlands.we conclude that the clean water act applies to this activity and affirm the district court findings that borden ranch violated the act by deep ripping in protected wetland swales.we reverse the district court findings of liability with respect to isolated vernal pools in light of solid waste agency of cook county united states army corps of eng rs,d,and remand for a recalculation of the civil penalties.
facts and procedural background 
in june of,angelo tsakopoulos,a sacramento real estate developer,purchased borden ranch,an acre ranch located in california central valley.prior to tsakopoulos purchase,the relevant areas of the ranch had been used primarily as rangeland for cattle grazing.the ranch contains significant hydrological features including vernal pools,swales,and intermittent drainages.vernal pools are pools that form during the rainy season,but are often dry in the summer.swales are sloped wetlands that allow for the movement of aquatic plant and animal life,and that filter water flows and minimize erosion.intermittent drainages are streams that transport water during and after rains.all of these hydrological features depend upon a dense layer of soil,called a restrictive layer or clay pan,which prevents surface water from penetrating deeply into the soil.
tsakopoulos intended to convert the ranch into vineyards and orchards and subdivide it into smaller parcels for sale.vineyards and orchards,however,require deep root systems,much deeper than the restrictive layer in the relevant portions of borden ranch permitted.for vineyards and orchards to grow on this land,the restrictive layer of soil would first need to be penetrated.this requires a procedure known as deep ripping,in which long metal prongs are dragged through the soil behind a tractor or a bulldozer.the ripper gouges through the restrictive layer,disgorging soil that is then dragged behind the ripper.
under the clean water act,an individual seeking to fill protected wetlands must first obtain a permit from the corps.since,tsakopoulos and the corps have disagreed about the corps authority to regulate deep ripping in wetlands.tsakopoulos initiated deep ripping without a permit in the fall of,and the corps granted him a retrospective permit in the spring of,when tsakopoulos agreed to various mitigation requirements.in the fall of,the corps and the epa informed tsakopoulos that he could deep rip in uplands and that he could drive over swales with the deep ripper in its uppermost position,but that he could not conduct any deep ripping activity in vernal pools.the next spring,the corps discovered that deep ripping had occurred in protected wetlands and promptly issued a cease and desist order.from july through november,tsakopoulos again initiated deep ripping on various parcels of land without a permit.the corps concluded that more protected wetlands had been ripped and again issued a cease and desist order.
in may of,the corps and the epa entered into an administrative order on consent with tsakopoulos that was intended to resolve his alleged clean water act violations.under the agreement,tsakopoulos set aside a preserve and agreed to refrain from further violations.
in december of,the corps and the epa issued a regulatory guidance letter that distinguished deep ripping from normal plowing activity.the letter stated that in wetlands destroy s the hydrological integrity of these wetlands and therefore requires a permit under the clean water act.
in march of the corps concluded that tsakopoulos had continued to deep rip wetlands without permission.that april,epa investigators visited the ranch and observed fully engaged deep rippers passing over jurisdictional wetlands.epa then issued an administrative order to tsakopoulos.
tsakopoulos responded by filing this lawsuit,challenging the authority of the corps and the epa to regulate deep ripping.the united states filed a counterclaim seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties for tsakopoulos alleged violations of the clean water act.
both parties filed motions for summary judgment.the district court ruled that the corps has jurisdiction over deep ripping in jurisdictional waters.however,the court found disputed facts with respect to whether such deep ripping had actually occurred.these facts were litigated in a bench trial that began on august,and concluded on september.the district court heard evidence from over twenty witnesses and received hundreds of documentary exhibits.
the district court subsequently entered findings of fact and conclusions of law determining that tsakopoulos had repeatedly violated the clean water act.the court found separate deep ripping violations in drainages,and violations in a single vernal pool.the district court gave tsakopoulos the option of paying a million penalty or paying and restoring four acres of wetlands.tsakopoulos chose the latter option.after denying a motion for more specific findings of fact,the district court entered its final order in favor of the united states.
tsakopoulos then brought this timely appeal.we have jurisdiction under.
corps jurisdiction over deep ripping 
the clean water act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant into the nation waters.a.the nation waters have been interpreted to include wetlands adjacent to navigable waters.see united states riverside bayview homes,d.the act defines discharge as any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.a point source is any discernible,confined and discrete conveyance from which pollutants are or may be discharged.a pollutant is defined,inter alia,as dredged spoil,biological materials,rock,sand,and cellar dirt.it is unlawful to discharge pollutants into wetlands without a permit from the army corps of engineers.a,d.
discharge of a pollutant 
tsakopoulos initially contends that deep ripping can not constitute the addition of a pollutant into wetlands,because it simply churns up soil that is already there,placing it back basically where it came from.this argument is inconsistent with ninth circuit precedent and with case law from other circuits that squarely hold that redeposits of materials can constitute an addition of a pollutant under the clean water act.rybachek united states envtl.prot.agency,cir,considered a claim that placer mining activities were exempt from the act.we held that removing material from a stream bed,sifting out the gold,and returning the material to the stream bed was an addition of a pollutant.id.at.the term pollutant encompassed the materials segregated from gold in placer mining.id.
our reasoning in rybachek is similar to that of the fourth circuit in united states deaton,cir.in deaton,a property owner alleged that the corps could not regulate sidecasting,which is the deposit of dredged or excavated material from a wetland back into that same wetland.id.at.the property owner asserted that sidecasting results in no net increase in the amount of material present in the wetland and therefore could not constitute the addition of a pollutant.id.at.the fourth circuit squarely rejected this argument,in language that is worth quoting in full 
contrary to what the deatons suggest,the statute does not prohibit the addition of material it prohibits the addition of any pollutant.the idea that there could be an addition of a pollutant without an addition of material seems to us entirely unremarkable,at least when an activity transforms some material from a nonpollutant into a pollutant,as occurred here once earth and vegetable matter was removed from the wetland,that material became dredged spoil,a statutory pollutant and a type of material that up until then was not present on the deaton property.it is of no consequence that what is now dredged spoil was previously present on the same property in the less threatening form of dirt and vegetation in an undisturbed state.what is important is that once that material was excavated from the wetland,its redeposit in that same wetland added a pollutant where none had been before.
id.at.as the court concluded,congress determined that plain dirt,once excavated from waters of the united states,could not be redeposited into those waters without causing harm to the environment.id.at see also avoyelles sportsmen league,marsh,cir holding that the word addition may be reasonably understood to include redeposit.
these cases recognize that activities that destroy the ecology of a wetland are not immune from the clean water act merely because they do not involve the introduction of material brought in from somewhere else.in this case,the corps alleges that tsakopoulos has essentially poked a hole in the bottom of protected wetlands.that is,by ripping up the bottom layer of soil,the water that was trapped can now drain out.while it is true,that in so doing,no new material has been added,a pollutant has certainly been added.prior to the deep ripping,the protective layer of soil was intact,holding the wetland in place.afterwards,that soil was wrenched up,moved around,and redeposited somewhere else.we can see no meaningful distinction between this activity and the activities at issue in rybachek and deaton.we therefore conclude that deep ripping,when undertaken in the context at issue here,can constitute a discharge of a pollutant under the clean water act 
tsakopoulos also contends that no case has ever held a plow to be a point source,and that a prohibited discharge must be from a point source.this argument has no merit.the statutory definition of point source any discernible,confined,and discrete conveyance is extremely broad,and courts have found that bulldozers and backhoes can constitute point sources,avoyelles,at.in this case,bulldozers and tractors were used to pull large metal prongs through the soil.we can think of no reason why this combination would not satisfy the definition of a point source.
b.the normal farming exception 
tsakopoulos next contends,that even if deep ripping constitutes a discharge of pollutants,it is nonetheless exempt from regulation under the farming exceptions,which state that discharges from normal farming and ranching activities,such as plowing are not subject to the clean water act.f a.the section of the statute containing the farming exceptions,however,includes a significant qualifying provision 
any discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters incidental to any activity having as its purpose bringing an area of the navigable waters into a use to which it was not previously subject,where the flow or circulation of navigable waters may be impaired or the reach of such waters be reduced,shall be required to have a permit under this section.
f.thus,even normal plowing can be regulated under the clean water act if it falls under this recapture provision.see avoyelles,at noting that f can preclude the normal farming exceptions.
we conclude that the deep ripping at issue in this case is governed by the recapture provision.converting ranch land to orchards and vineyards is clearly bringing the land into a use to which it was not previously subject,and there is a clear basis in this record to conclude that the destruction of the soil layer at issue here constitutes an impairment of the flow of nearby navigable waters.
although the corps can not regulate a farmer who desires merely to change from one wetland crop to another,activities that require substantial hydrological alterations require a permit.united states akers,cir.as we have explained,the intent of congress in enacting the act was to prevent conversion of wetlands to dry lands,and we have classified as those activities which change a wetland hydrological regime.akers,at.in this case,tsakopoulos activities were not intended simply to substitute one wetland crop for another rather they radically altered the hydrological regime of the protected wetlands.accordingly,it was entirely proper for the corps and the epa to exercise jurisdiction over tsakopoulos activities.
ii.the vernal pool 
the district court found clean water act violations in one isolated vernal pool on tsakopoulos property.earlier this year,the supreme court ruled in solid waste that the corps rule extending the definition of navigable waters under the clean water act to include intrastate waters used as habitat for migratory birds exceeds the authority granted to the corps under the clean water act.the government now concedes that solid waste precludes corps authority over the vernal pool in dispute and has formally withdrawn its enforcement claim with respect to the pool.we accordingly reverse the district court findings of clean water act violations in the vernal pool.
iii.the district court factual findings 
tsakopoulos challenges the district court factual findings of violations of the clean water act.we review for clear error.ambassador hotel,cir.
tsakopoulos argues that there was no substantial evidence at all to support the court factual findings of deep ripping in protected swales.he argues that the evidence can only demonstrate shallow ripping consistent with the ripper in its uppermost position,which was permitted under the government direction.
where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.cree flores,cir.the district court here held a bench trial,examined numerous exhibits,and heard over twenty witnesses.there is ample evidence to support the district court findings.the court cited documentary evidence showing deep ripping,eyewitness testimony of deep ripping on the property,and tsakopoulos own concession that mistakes had been made.the court also relied on the studies of lyndon lee,who conducted extensive investigations at the site.lee was able to dig soil pits as far as thirty inches into the soil.by examining the composition of the soil in these pits,lee could determine whether the underlying clay layer had been ripped up,consistent with deep ripping.the district court chose to credit this evidence that deep ripping had occurred,and we can find no clear error on this record.
iv.the civil penalty 
the district court found that tsakopoulos had committed violations of the clean water act.it counted each pass of the ripper through a protected wetland as a separate violation.the statute provides for a maximum penalty of per day for each violation.the statutory maximum penalty was therefore.the court then considered a variety of factors in setting the penalty.the court found that tsakopoulos risked damaging rare federal wetlands because of his motivation to reap economic gain.the court also found an absence of a good faith attempt to comply with the act.the court accordingly set the penalty at,which is below the statutory maximum.the court also allowed tsakopoulos to suspend of the penalty if he performed various restoration measures.
tsakopoulos now makes three challenges to the district court calculation of the civil penalty.we conclude that none of these arguments has merit.
penalty calculation per violation 
tsakopoulos first contends that the penalty should have been based on the number of days in which illegal ripping occurred,not on the number of individual passes with the ripper.he argues that the statutory language per day for each violation means that he can only be assessed for any day in which ripping violations occurred,regardless of the total number of rippings in that day.
we disagree.the statute imposes a maximum penalty per day for each violation.d.it does not say per each day in which violations occur or per day in which a party pollutes.the focus is clearly on each violation,and courts have consistently rejected attempts to limit civil penalties to the number of days in which violations occur.a contrary rule would encourage individuals to stack all their violations into one pollution day,in which innumerable offenses could occur,subject only to the maximum.
tsakopoulos relies most heavily on chesapeake bay,gwaltney of smithfield,cir,vacated,d.in gwaltney,the court considered a case of continuous violations of monthly permits.the violator argued that a monthly violation should be treated as a single day of violation.i
