dixie national forest plan 
the barney top project is located in the two million acre dixie national forest in southern utah.the dixie national forest land and resource management plan,adopted in,guides management activities in the dixie national forest.the plan established management objectives for preserving forests of different age classes and for maintaining the goshawk population.the plan provides a general direction to p lan timber harvest on a drainage by drainage basis.aplt,vol.at.specifically,the plan states that a portion of trees in each drainage should be in each age class,s even to ten percent should be managed as old growth,and t he remainder should be more or less evenly distributed in the other age classes.id.the plan also sets at pairs the minimum viable population for the goshawk,a species of hawk considered a management indicator species that is dependent on old growth trees for its habitat.pursuant to the plan,the goshawk population is to be monitored annual ly if the goshawk population is near minimum level,or every years in project areas,or whenever a total declining goshawk population size over a year period presents a variation which would cause further evaluation change in management direction.id.at.
in response to declining goshawk populations,the forest service amended the plan in march of to include the utah northern goshawk conservation strategy the conservation strategy.the conservation strategy is a product of the cooperative effort of the utah national forests,the bureau of land management,the united states fish and wildlife service,and the utah division of wildlife resources to manage goshawk habitat in accordance with the recommendations found in the two leading scientific studies on the subject management recommendations for the northern goshawk in the southwestern united states the reynolds report and habitat assessment and management recommendations for the northern goshawk in the state of utah the graham report.see aple.supp.app.at.this amendment to the plan is sometimes referred to as the goshawk amendment.
barney top resource management project 
the forest service designed the project to suppress the spread of destructive spruce beetles among spruce and fir trees and to improve the distribution of age classes among spruce,fir,and aspens over a period.the project encompasses a acre area of forest land situated on the barney top and table cliff plateaus and provides for the treatment of acres of engleman fir and acres of aspen forest.specifically,the project calls for acres of conifer thinning,acres of thinning,acres of conifer harvesting,five acres of meadow restoration,and acres of aspen harvesting and prescribed burning.the forest service contends the treatment will reduce current tree mortality from spruce beetles in the forest by creating stand conditions that do not promote spruce beetles or disease.the project environmental assessment ea asserts the treatments will also maintain the presence of aspens by rectifying an imbalance in aspen age classes that has facilitated conifer succession.aplt,vol.at.
the project includes a number of secondary actions designed to enable completion of its primary objectives.the ea calls for the reconstruction of miles of existing road,the addition of miles of presently unclassified road to the classified road system,the closure of miles of road to motorized vehicle used by the public,the use of forest road as a haul route,id.at,and application of magnesium chloride as needed for dust abatement for approximately five miles of forest road.id.at.additionally,the project requires control lines to prevent the spread of the prescribed burn beyond the targeted acreage.id.at.
the forest service conducted an ea of the project and issued a finding of no significant impact fonsi.uec brought an administrative appeal,which resulted in an affirmance of the forest services decision.uec then filed a complaint in the district court contending that the project violated nepa,nfma,and the forest plan.the district court granted summary judgment for the forest service.on appeal,uec asserts that the forest service violated nepa by failing to properly analyze the environmental impacts of magnesium chloride road salt application to the project main road,and the environmental impacts of fireline construction.uec also contends that the forest service violated nfma and the forest plan by failing to ensure the requisite quantity of viable old growth forest,and by failing to ensure the viability of species dependent on old growth,specifically the northern goshawk.we address each argument in turn.

analysisa.road salt 
uec contends that the forest service violated nepa by failing to analyze the environmental consequences of applying magnesium chloride to forest road.as a preliminary matter,we address the forest service argument that this claim is moot.the present litigation notwithstanding,implementation of the project has begun and,according to david keefe,the supervisory forester for the dixie national forest,contractors have already completed the application of magnesium chloride to fr.aple.supp.app.at.keefe notes the barney top stewardship contract provides for a application of magnesium chloride that will last for multiple years.id.the forest service asserts uec claim that the forest service violated nepa by failing to analyze the effect of magnesium chloride is moot because the contractor has already completed its magnesium chloride application.
pursuant to article iii of the constitution,federal courts may adjudicate only actual,ongoing cases or controversies.lewis cont l bank,d.i f an event occurs while a case is pending on appeal that makes it impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever to a prevailing party,the appeal must be dismissed as moot.church of scientology united states,d quotation marks omitted.however,even where it is too late to provide a fully satisfactory remedy the availability of a partial remedy will prevent the case from being moot.id.at.see also airport neighbors alliance,at c ourts still consider nepa claims when the court can provide some remedy if it determines that an agency failed to comply with nepa.we must,therefore,ask whether we can effectuate even a partial remedy in this case where the contractor has already applied magnesium chloride to the road.
included among the project design criteria outlined in the ea is the statement that m agnesium chloride will be applied as needed for dust abatement for approximately miles of fr adjacent to pine lake campground.aplt.app.at.the ea thus does not limit the use of road salt to a single application,but instead provides for its use as needed.id.the project was intended to unfold over a four to period,including an initial three year timber harvest.joseph black,a forest engineer for the dixie national forest,noted in a supplemental affidavit that g enerally,magnesium chloride for dust abatement is applied to a road surface once a year.aple.supp.app.at.although the forest service present contract calls for only a single application,the ea provides for the use of road salt throughout the life of the project if necessary.because the forest service retains the flexibility to implement the project design and employ magnesium chloride for dust abatement,this issue is not moot.
moving to the merits of the claim,the forest service acknowledges it did not perform a detailed analysis in the ea separate from the analysis of the effects of the proposed action as a whole for the application of magnesium chloride.aple.br.at.it asserts that such an analysis was unwarranted because applying magnesium chloride is a routine component of road maintenance,and road maintenance is exempt from nepa documentation under categorical exclusion of the forest service handbook.id.see forest service handbook environmental policy and procedures handbook,ch,hereinafter the handbook.
the handbook enumerates several categories of routine maintenance that may be categorically excluded from documentation in an ea,including the r epair and maintenance of roads,trails,and landline boundaries.id.within this category,the handbook provides a list of examples of such repair,including resurfacing and cleaning culverts,pruning vegetation,grooming a trail,surveying,and g rading a road and clearing the roadside without the use of herbicides.id.notably,none of these illustrative actions include the application of chemicals to roads or surrounding areas.furthermore,the handbook explicitly excludes road grading from this categorical exclusion if it is paired with the application of herbicides.
as documentation provided by the forest service states,seven and to nine tons of magnesium chloride are generally added to each road mile for dust abatement.aple.supp.app.at.in this case,therefore,as much as tons of magnesium chloride will be spread over the five mile expanse of forest service road at each application.this amount of added chemical is simply not equivalent to the minor physical alterations involved in cleaning,pruning,surveying,or grooming.the handbook omission of any maintenance requiring the application of chemicals and its explicit exclusion of maintenance reliant upon herbicides,suggests that actions involving the addition of chemicals were not among the types of maintenance categorically excluded from consideration in an ea.we conclude,therefore,that the addition of magnesium chloride is not categorically excluded from consideration in the ea 
because the application of magnesium chloride is not categorically excluded from forest service review,we consider whether the agency examined the environmental impact of magnesium chloride applications when evaluating the project.in july,the same interdisciplinary team assigned to the barney top ea,used the public comments concerning travel management collected through this proposal,to develop a roads analysis report rap analyz ing all of the roads within the project area.aplt,vol.at,vol.at.the rap posed the following question how and where does the road system create potential for pollutants such as chemical spills,oils,salts,or herbicides,to enter surface water,vol.at emphasis added.it concluded that on low volume,low maintenance,forest roads such as those found in the barney top area,the potential for this is very low gucinski and others.the only areas where this potential exists are a section of forest road.id.the ea,completed two months later by the same officials,proposed for the project the road developments described and analyzed in the rap.id.at.in writing the ea,the team directly referenced the conclusions of its rap.id.at.the rap conclusion,supported with a citation to a published text,that there was only a very low potential of pollution from salts at fr,the rap reference in the ea,and the more general discussion of road impacts in the ea,satisfies us that the forest service sufficiently examined the effects of road salt application and did not act arbitrarily or capriciously.
uec also asserts the forest service violated nepa by failing to consider the environmental impact of proposed firelines.according to the ea,after a harvest of acres of aspen,a prescribed fire would be ignited to reduce activity fuels and fire disturbance while stimulating aspen suckering.aplt,vol.at.following discussion of the scope and purpose of the burn,the ea states c ontrol line preparation would utilize existing mechanical fuel breaks from logging.id.in its discussion of the same prescribed burn,the ea also states 
approximately chains chain or,feet of fireline would need to be constructed.each unit,which is to be burned,will require a mechanical fireline to be constructed.the fireline would be approximately inches wide,exposing bare mineral soil.after completion of the prescribed fire treatments,the fireline would be rehabilitated as necessary.these firelines would be installed around the perimeter of each small unit.
before wading into the merits of uec claim,we first address the parties dispute over the extent to which fireline construction will overlap with existing forest breaks.the forest service contends the firelines that would need to be constructed,id.at,are in fact the same control lines that would utilize existing logging fuel breaks,id.at.see aple.br.at.according to the forest service,no additional fire lines will be created,because the roads and skid trails used for the timber harvest will subsequently serve as the fire lines.id.uec argues,to the contrary,that fuel breaks will be augmented by the additional feet of perimeter fireline that will need to be constructed.as we have noted,the ea states the f ire control lines will be constructed around the perimeter,using mechanical equipment,aplt,vol.at,to scrape the surface and expos e bare mineral soil.id.at.the reuse of existing cleared trails is arguably inconsistent with this direction to construct firelines and scrape soil using mechanical equipment.
even interpreting the ea to mandate the construction of firelines,however,we are persuaded the forest service adequately considered the environmental impacts of the prescribed burn.the ea discusses the effects of the prescribed burn on soil and water quality in accordance with burn plans,see id.at these erosion effects resulting from prescribed burning would be minimized by conducting burning in accordance with burn plans,and with prior forest service monitoring results see id.at watershed monitoring on the dixie national forest indicates that prescribed burning,when done within burn parameters,has no short term adverse effects to hydrologic function,and short term soil loss is minimal.citing two forest service reports.furthermore,the ea states that fire control lines adjacent to forest road will be rehabilitated upon completion of the prescribed fire.id.at.see also id.at t he fireline would be rehabilitated as necessary.although the ea lacks an individualized analysis of the environmental impact of fireline construction,it is clear that the forest service broadly considered the effects of prescribed burning on soil and water resources.as such,we conclude the forest service did not fail to consider the environmental impacts of the prescribed burn and the effects of the fireline construction in reaching its conclusion that the project would not cause a significant environmental impact.
nfma and the forest plan 
old growth forest 
uec maintains the forest service failed to adhere to its selected methodology for evaluating the presence of old growth forest and thus failed to satisfy old growth requirements set out in the forest plan.as the ea notes,the project proposed tree harvest is expected to reduce old growth.aplt,vol.at.the forest plan provides that s even to ten percent of each drainage should be managed as old growth.aplt,vol.at.the forest service sought to catalog existing old growth areas to establish a baseline for examining the effects of the proposed action.to this end,the forest service selected the hamilton methodology for identifying old growth forest.hamilton establishes empirical standards for classifying forests as,including tree diameter,age and density,number of canopy layers,and presence and characteristics of dead and decadent trees.see aple.supp,tab.
in this case,each drainage was delineated into stands and evaluated as to old growth qualification.aplt,vol.at.the administrative record includes a table listing individual stands in the drainages and identifies each as either old growth or growth forest.see aplt,vol.at.more specifically,the table includes a single column relating to classification marked with either a y for yes,old growth,or left blank to indicate the absence of old growth.id.additionally,a separate table providing greater statistical detail characterizes the trees within the project area.this spreadsheet presents data for each individual hamilton evaluation criterion for all stands in the project area.see aplt,vol.at.
in its complaint in the district court,uec asserted only that the forest service violated the forest plan because it failed to determine whether the requisite amount of old growth exists by drainage.aplt,vol.at.see also mem.in supp.of mot.for uec olenhouse mot.at t he forest service has failed to determine whether sufficient old growth exists by drainage,and b ecause the forest plan demands that old growth be determined by drainage it has violated its forest plan and the nfma.both the administrative record and the ea contradict this claim.as noted above,the record includes a table identifying the old growth character of each stand,see aplt,vol.at,and the ea presented a chart entitled old growth by drainage,detailing the acreage of old growth present in each drainage.aplt,vol.at.thus,the record indisputably demonstrates the forest service determined the amount of old growth by drainage as required by the forest plan.
on appeal,uec alleges two flaws in the forest service old growth conclusions.first,uec argues the record fails to present the underlying data for each individual hamilton element that would have enabled the forest service to reach a reasoned final old growth conclusion as to stands in the broader area.aplt.br.at.second,uec asserts that even where the underlying data was provided for the project area,several of the stands were classified as old growth notwithstanding the fact that they did not meet all of the minimum criteria.id.at.in both regards,uec contends the forest service has therefore failed to reach a reasoned,conclusion as to the presence of old growth forest in the drainage area.
uec argument on appeal differs markedly from the old growth claim it presented to the district court.there,uec asserted the forest service failed to determine old growth by drainage.by contrast,it now acknowledges that old growth was identified by drainage,but asserts these old growth classifications were not supported by adequate data.reply br.at.generally,we do not consider issues not presented to,considered and decided by the trial court,lyons jefferson bank trust,cir brackets omitted quoting cavic pioneer astro,because an appellant new argument gives rise to a host of new issues,and appellee had no opportunity to present evidence it may have thought relevant to these issues.bancamerica commercial mosher steel of,cir,modified on other grounds,cir.in this case,if uec had raised its present assertion in the district court,the forest service would have had the opportunity to respond by producing additional data or explaining its data gathering procedures in greater detail.see lyons,at we have no idea what evidence,if any,the opposing party would,or could offer,but this is only because it has had no opportunity to proffer such evidence.brackets omitted quoting singleton wulff,d.because uec did not raise the claim below,we do not consider its present contentions that the forest service calculations of
