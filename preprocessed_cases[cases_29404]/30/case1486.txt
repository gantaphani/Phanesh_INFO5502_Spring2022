petitioner bluewater network bluewater challenges the environmental protection agency epa or agency final rule adopting a approach to setting emissions standards for category marine diesel engines which are very large marine engines used primarily for propulsion power on vessels such as container ships,tankers,bulk carriers,and cruise ships.control of emissions from new marine engines at or above liters per cylinder,fed.reg,to be codified at pts.bluewater claims that the rule fails to reduce emissions from those engines and entirely omits to regulate the emissions from ships engines,as required by section a of the clean air act caa.a see also id.d a.we conclude that the epa reasonably interpreted and implemented the caa and therefore deny bluewater petition for review.
in,the congress enacted the caa to protect and enhance the quality of the nation air resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population.id.b.in,it added section,which authorizes the epa to establish emissions standards for nonroad engines and nonroad vehicles.id.a see husqvarna ab epa,see also engine mfrs.ass epa.section a and requires the epa to determine whether the emissions from new and existing nonroad engines or nonroad vehicles are significant contributors to air pollution in areas with air quality problems.a.section a in turn requires the epa to promulgate emissions standards for all new nonroad engines which in the administrator judgment cause,or contribute to,such air pollution.id.a emphasis added.the standards must 
achieve the greatest degree of emission reduction achievable through the application of technology which the epa administrator determines will be available for the engines or vehicles to which such standards apply,giving appropriate consideration to the cost of applying such technology within the period of time available to manufacturers and to noise,energy,and safety factors associated with the application of such technology.
id.the standards must also take effect at the earliest possible date considering the lead time necessary to permit the development and application of the requisite technology,giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such period and energy and safety.id.b.finally,the epa must revise the standards from time to time.id.a.
in,the epa determined that nonroad engines and vehicles contribute significantly to air pollution in problem areas throughout the country and set about the process of setting emissions standards for various categories of engines,including marine diesel engines.see control of air pollution determination of significance for nonroad sources and emission standards for new nonroad engines at or above kilowatts,fed.reg,june,to be codified at pts.control of air pollution emission standards for new gasoline and diesel marine engines,fed.reg.notice of proposed rulemaking.as noted above,the category marine diesel engines that are the subject of this rulemaking are some of the largest engines in the world,with greater than liters displacement per cylinder.see fed.reg.at.the engines burn residual fuel oil a byproduct of refining crude oil into products which tends to have higher ash,sulfur and nitrogen content than other fuels.see id.at.residual fuel oil also has a higher variability than other fuels,which makes engine emissions more difficult to control.see id.at.the engines thus contribute to national ozone,carbon monoxide,nitrous oxide nox and particulate matter levels,especially near commercial ports like new orleans,la and along coastal areas like santa barbara,ca.see id.at.existing diesel engine technologies,such as turbo and,injection improvements and engine cooling,are used to increase the efficiency and reduce emissions from these engines.see id.at.there are also new,advanced technologies,including systems that introduce water into the combustion process,selective catalytic reduction systems that add a reducing agent like ammonia into the engine exhaust and the use of fuel cells.see id.at.
the epa effort to set emissions standards for category engines coincided with similar action taken by the international marine organization imo see,control of air pollution emission standards for new gasoline and diesel marine engines exemptions for new nonroad engines at or above kilowatts and new nonroad engines at or below kilowatts,fed.reg,supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking proposed revisions,fed.reg.at.in,the imo formally adopted annex vi to the international convention on the prevention of pollution from ships,as modified by the protocol of relating thereto marpol.annex vi prescribes a nox emissions limit for diesel engines on ships constructed on or after january,and for engines undergoing major conversion on or after that date.regulation to annex vi of marpol.annex vi has recently been ratified by the requisite number of imo member countries and will take effect in may.see http last visited june.
following the imo adoption of annex vi,the epa noticed its intent to set the caa emissions standards for category engines at the same level set by annex vi.see control of emissions of air pollution from new ci marine engines at or above kilowatts,fed.reg,advance notice of proposed rulemaking may.it reasoned that category engines have only a minimal impact on air quality because they operate in waters for only a limited amount of time and that any stricter standards could be applied to ships only,potentially compromising their competitiveness in the world shipping market.id.several months later,the epa decided to postpone adopting emissions standards for these engines.control of emissions of air pollution from new ci marine engines at or above kw,fed.reg,notice of proposed rulemaking.because it believed annex vi standards to be appropriate for category engines under the caa based on its analysis of available control technologies,the epa concluded that adopting those standards would be unnecessary and redundant because it expected vessels to comply with the annex vi standards.id.at.in the same notice,the epa also proposed excluding smaller categories and diesel engines on vessels in waters from any emissions standards,id.at,because,relying in part on united states treasury department rulings and tariff schedules,it deemed ships engaged in international trade not to have been imported into the united states.id.the epa final rule adopted both positions it did not set emissions standards for category engines and it defined the category and category engines to which its rule applied so as to exempt those aboard ships.control of emissions of air pollution from new marine engines at or above kw,fed.reg,codified at pts.
in,earth island institute,an environmental group,originally petitioned for review of that rule bluewater became the petitioner in.as part of a settlement agreement in that matter,the epa agreed to initiate the rulemaking that resulted in the rule now under review.thus,in may,the epa proposed,among other things,to formally adopt the annex vi emissions standards as the caa standards for category engines.control of emissions of air pollution from new marine engines at or above,fed.reg.proposed rule may.it also invited comment on whether it should adopt stricter emissions standards in the future and expand those standards to cover category engines on vessels entering territory.id.
on february,the epa issued the rule under review.control of emissions from new marine compression ignition engines at or above liters per cylinder,fed.reg,to be codified at pts.the rule provides a approach for setting emissions standards for category engines under the caa.id.at.the first step,which the epa referred to as its near term tier standard,tracks annex vi emissions standards and took effect on january.id.at.the standards,the epa explained,apply only to ships and are intended to achieve a reduction in the national category nox inventory by.id.at.the epa also committed to a second step,imposing longer term tier standards in a rulemaking to be completed no later than april.id.at.in the future rulemaking,the epa promised to consider the state of technology that
