this is an appeal from a judgment in a lawsuit brought by the district attorney for humboldt county on behalf of the people of california the state under california unfair competition law,business and professions code sections et ucl,for alleged fraudulent business practices.judgment was entered against the state following the sustaining of a demurrer to the second amended complaint.in reaching the judgment,the trial court ruled that respondents the pacific lumber company,scotia pacific company llc,and salmon creek llc collectively,pacific lumber were immune from ucl liability under both california civil code section,subdivision b and under federal law pursuant to the doctrine,and that the state had failed to state a cause of action based on pacific lumber alleged fraudulent business practices.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on february,the state filed a complaint against pacific lumber asserting causes of action arising under the ucl.the allegations in the complaint stemmed from a agreement between pacific lumber,the state of california and the united states known as the headwaters agreement.pursuant to the headwaters agreement,pacific lumber agreed to sell the headwaters forest,an ancient redwood forest,and other land to the state and federal governments for over million and other consideration.in return,pacific lumber received assurances from those governments that it would be permitted to harvest certain of its remaining timberlands in accordance with,among other things,a sustained yield plan and habitat conservation plan approved by relevant state and federal agencies 
an exhaustive administrative review process ensued pursuant to the california environmental quality act,public resources code sections et ceqa,after which the appointed state agency,the california department of forestry and fire protection cdf,certified the state environmental impact report and,on or about march,approved pacific lumber sustained yield plan and habitat conservation plan referred to herein collectively as the sustained yield plan.following the issuance of all necessary federal and state permits,the headwaters forest purchase was thus completed 
in its original complaint,the state alleged pacific lumber intentionally misrepresented and concealed crucial facts during the ceqa administrative proceedings held in connection with the headwaters agreement.pacific lumber demurred.
before a hearing was held on pacific lumber demurrer to the original complaint,the state filed a first amended complaint on may,raising essentially the same allegations.the trial court thereafter sustained pacific lumber demurrer to the first amended complaint with leave to amend.the second amended complaint,the subject of this appeal,was then filed may.
in the second amended complaint,the state again alleged pacific lumber intentionally misrepresented and concealed crucial facts during the ceqa administrative proceedings held in connection with the headwaters agreement.in particular,the state alleged pacific lumber submitted a report containing false data in order to obtain approval from the cdf for an increased rate of timber harvesting and to ensure decreased environmental mitigation requirements.according to the second amended complaint,the false data was submitted to conceal a finding by a consultant hired by pacific lumber that new timber harvesting could trigger increased landslide frequency in the bear creek and elk river watersheds.worried such finding would result in issuance of permits for lower rates of harvesting,and thus would hinder its ability to meet certain of its financial obligations,pacific lumber allegedly devised a scheme to submit false data for jordan creek,a watershed adjacent to bear creek,which indicated,contrary to the bear creek and elk river finding,that new harvesting would not likely trigger increased landslide frequency.
pacific lumber allegedly submitted this false data shortly after the end of the period allowed under ceqa for public review and comment on pacific lumber harvesting plan and on the state of california environmental impact report pacific lumber then allegedly delayed submitting corrected data for two months,and deliberately delivered the corrected data to the wrong the north coast regional water quality control board and a local office of the than to the government offices designated to review public comments and to make final determinations on pacific lumber permits.
according to the state,pacific lumber submission of false data and delayed submission of corrected data undermined the legitimacy of the ceqa process by precluding the preparation of an accurate environmental impact report open to public review and comment and allowing for the approval of pacific lumber sustained yield plan and the issuance of permits based on incorrect information.the state thus sought civil penalties and other relief under the ucl to prevent pacific lumber from realizing profits on timber harvested pursuant to its allegedly sustained yield plan.
the trial court sustained pacific lumber demurrer to the second amended complaint,this time without leave to amend.the trial court reasoned that pacific lumber was immune from liability for its conduct in connection with the underlying ceqa administrative proceedings under civil code section,subdivision b,the litigation privilege,and under federal law according to the doctrine.judgment was thus entered against the state.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the state contends on appeal that the trial court erred by applying the litigation privilege under civil code section,subdivision b and the doctrine under federal law to pacific lumber alleged wrongful conduct in connection with the ceqa administrative process,and by deciding on demurrer as a matter of law that pacific lumber alleged material concealments and misrepresentations did not undermine the legitimacy of that process.
we address the state arguments in turn.in doing so,we apply rules governing the appellate review of an order sustaining a demurrer.we thus must give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d.because only factual allegations are considered on demurrer,we must disregard any contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the complaint.daar yellow cab cal d.further,because the demurrer at issue is to an amended complaint,we may properly consider allegations asserted in the prior complaints a plaintiff may not discard factual allegations of a prior complaint,or avoid them by contradictory averments,in a superseding,amended pleading.citation.continental ins.lexington ins.th,d.

finally,where,also as here,the demurrer was sustained without leave to amend,we must determine whether the plaintiff has proven a reasonable possibility that the pleading defect can be cured by amendment.blank,supra,cal d at.if the plaintiff meets that burden,we must reverse the trial court order as an abuse of discretion.ibid.
does the litigation privilege bar the state ucl claims 
the trial court rejected the state ucl action as a matter of law after finding it barred by civil code section,subdivision b section b.section b renders absolutely privileged communications made as part of a judicial or proceeding.silberg anderson cal d,silberg,subd.b action apartment,city of santa monica cal th,d,action apartment.the usual formulation is that the privilege applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and that have some connection or logical relation to the action.silberg,supra,at.
the principal purpose of the litigation privilege is to afford litigants and witnesses citation the utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions.citations.action apartment,supra,cal th at,d.or,as otherwise stated,it exists to protect citizens from the threat of litigation for communications to government agencies whose function it is to investigate and remedy wrongdoing.citation.wise thrifty payless,th,d.
to achieve this end,the absolute privilege is interpreted broadly to apply to any communication,not just a publication,having some relation to a judicial or proceeding,irrespective of the communication maliciousness or untruthfulness.kashian harriman th,d action apartment,supra,cal th at,d,silberg,supra,cal d at.and judicial or proceedings are defined broadly to include all kinds of proceedings,including administrative,legislative and other official proceedings.silberg,supra,at.further,the privilege is not limited to statements made during a trial or other proceedings,but may extend to steps taken prior thereto,or afterwards.rusheen cohen cal th,d,rusheen.action apartment,supra,at,d.
here,the state ucl action is premised on pacific lumber allegedly fraudulent conduct in communicating information to government agencies during the ceqa administrative proceedings held in connection with the headwaters agreement.in particular,the state alleges pacific lumber submitted false information in connection with those proceedings with the intent to interfere with the cdf consideration of pacific lumber sustained yield plan,certification of the state of california environmental impact report,and issuance of permits for the remaining timber lands under the headwaters agreement.as such,pacific lumber communications,whether fraudulent or not,fall squarely within the scope of the litigation privilege silberg,supra,cal d at,the litigation privilege protects communication s made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation kashian harriman,supra,th at,d communications made in connection with litigation do not necessarily fall outside the privilege merely because they are,or are alleged to be,fraudulent,perjurious,unethical,or even illegal.see also mission oaks ranch,county of santa barbara th,d s ection applies to the preparation and certification of an eir,an environmental impact report,and thus bars a lawsuit against a consultant for allegedly including false statements in a proposed eir,overruled on other grounds by briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,fn,d,pettitt levy d.any publication made in a city planning commission or city council proceedings is within the protection of section though the proceedings are not strictly judicial id.at.section bars a lawsuit by property owners against certain individuals for allegedly preparing and presenting false documentary evidence in connection with opposing the owners building permit application.
while accepting that communications like those challenged here generally fall within the litigation privilege,the state nonetheless claims the privilege is inapplicable in this case because it arises under the ucl rather than under general tort laws.the ucl forbids acts of unfair competition,which is defined to include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.bus,communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.the ucl is broad in scope,embracing anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.citations.at,d.the ucl scope is not,however,unlimited.at,d.of relevance here,for example,it does not permit an action that another statute expressly precludes.id.at,d.as such,w hen specific legislation provides a safe harbor,plaintiffs may not use the general unfair competition law to assault that harbor.id.at,d.here,the trial court found that section b provided such a safe harbor.for reasons discussed below,we agree.
in rubin green cal th,d,rubin,our supreme court specifically examined the safe harbor provided by section b in an action brought under the ucl.there,the plaintiff,the owner of a mobile home park,sued a park resident and her attorneys for,among other things,improper solicitation by the attorneys in anticipation of litigation against the plaintiff over park conditions.rubin,supra,at,d.acknowledging that the alleged acts of attorney solicitation fell squarely within the litigation privilege,the plaintiff argued the case should nonetheless proceed because,unlike ordinary tort laws,the ucl grants any member of the public standing to seek relief for unfair competition.rubin,supra,at,d.
the court disagreed,reject ing the claim that a plaintiff may,in effect,plead around absolute barriers to relief by relabeling the nature of the action as one brought under the unfair competition statute.rubin,supra,cal th at,d.the court thus concluded that,where the conduct alleged in the complaint comes within the scope of section b,and is thus absolutely immune from civil tort liability,t o permit the same acts to be the subject of an injunctive relief proceeding brought by this same plaintiff under the ucl undermines that immunity.if the policies underlying section b are sufficiently strong to support an absolute privilege,the resulting immunity should not evaporate merely because the plaintiff discovers a conveniently different label for pleading what is in substance an identical grievance arising from identical conduct as that protected by section b.rubin,supra,at,d.
relying on dicta found elsewhere in rubin,the state and amicus curiae argue this holding does not apply here because,unlike in rubin,the state,as plaintiff,was not a party to the underlying ceqa proceedings and is a governmental entity suing on behalf of the public rather than a private litigant.we reject both contentions.
as an initial matter,we disagree the state was not a party to the underlying ceqa proceedings.the state of california was a party to the headwaters agreement and,in the ceqa proceedings,several state agencies,including the cdf and the department of fish and game participated on behalf of the people of the state of california.indeed,the state attorney general continues to defend the outcome of those proceedings on behalf of the people in a case now pending before the california supreme court,environmental protection information center et california department of forestry and fire protection et,case number.reporter note for supreme court opinion,filed july,see cal th.it is thus clear the people interests were adequately represented in the ceqa proceedings the state does not contend otherwise,and that,as such,those proceedings,not this litigation,provided the more appropriate forum in which to expos e the bias of witnesses and the falsity of evidence,thereby enhancing the finality of judgments and avoiding an unending roundelay of litigation,an evil far worse than an occasional unfair result.citation.silberg,supra,cal d at.that the people are being represented in this case by the district attorney of humboldt county rather than by the state attorney general or a state agency does not change that fact.
moreover,putting this conclusion aside,we disagree with the state that,under rubin,the litigation privilege does not preclude lawsuits under the ucl by litigants.rather,the rubin court expressly limited its holding to the precise circumstances before it,including the circumstance that the same plaintiff was involved against the same defendants in the prior litigation,and that both the state bar and prosecutorial authorities are authorized to pursue additional sanctions against attorney solicitation of the sort alleged in the amended complaint.rubin,supra,cal th at,d.and the california supreme court has clarified since rubin that no broad exception exists to the litigation privilege for any party who did not participate in the underlying litigation because such exception would be antithetical to the privilege purposes.action apartment,supra,cal th at,d.derivative litigation brought by parties who did not participate in the underlying litigation,like litigation brought by parties who did participate,would pose an external threat of liability that would deter potential litigants,witnesses,and others from participating in judicial proceedings.id.at,d.
we acknowledge that,in so concluding,our supreme court left open the possibility that the legislature could create exceptions to the litigation privilege for both parties and to the prior proceedings.action apartment,supra,cal th at,d.according to the state and amicus curiae,the legislature created such an exception for ucl actions brought on behalf of the public by governmental entities.in so arguing,the state points to ceqa savings clause,which provides that n o provision of this division is a limitation or restriction on the power or authority of any public agency in the enforcement or administration of any provision of law which it is specifically permitted or required to enforce or administer.the state and amicus curiae also point again to dicta in rubin,which states that the policy underlying the unfair competition statute can be vindicated by multiple parties other than plaintiff,including the attorney general,district attorneys,and certain city attorneys rubin,supra,cal th at,d.we conclude neither source provides authority for an exception to the litigation privilege for enforcement actions brought by governmental entities under the ucl.
with respect to ceqa savings clause,we find within it no legislative intent to override the litigation privilege absolute protection of access to courts and other bodies.indeed,the clause gives governmental entities no additional authority whatsoever,but rather simply acknowledges and preserves their existing authority.thus,absent some other,independent source of authority to pierce the litigation privilege,the savings clause is irrelevant to our inquiry.see action apartment,supra,cal th at,d.
nor do we find within rubin dicta an independent source of authority to pierce the litigation privilege.first,as we touched upon above,the rubin court had no reason,given the facts before it,to consider a broad exception to the privilege for enforcement actions brought by governmental entities under the ucl.second,we believe such exception,at least so broadly stated,would run counter to our supreme court insistence,given the importance of the privilege absolute protection of access to official proceedings,that litigants,whatever their identity,should not be permitted to plead around the privilege absent clear legislative intent to the contrary.action apartment,supra,cal th at,d,see also rubin,supra,cal th at,d.that legislative intent does not exist here.
the ucl,unlike other statutes that courts have determined were intended by the legislature to withstand the litigation privilege,is not necessarily more specific than the litigation privilege and would not be significantly or wholly inoperable if its enforcement were barred when in conflict with the privilege.action apartment,supra,cal th at,d,noting,for example,that t he crimes of perjury and subornation of perjury would be almost without meaning if statements made during the course of litigation were protected from prosecution for perjury by the litigation privilege and that t he misdemeanors established by business and professions code section evince a legislative intent that certain attorney conduct not be protected from prosecution by the litigation privilege every attorney is guilty of a misdemeanor who either a is guilty of any deceit or collusion,or consents to any deceit or collusion,with intent to deceive the court or any party.b willfully delays his client suit with a view to his own gain.c willfully receives any money or allowance for or on account of any money which he has not laid out or become answerable for.nor do we find,or has the state or amicus curiae pointed to,any other irreconcilable conflicts between the litigation privilege and the ucl upon which to base an exception.action apartment,supra,at,d.
further,as pacific lumber points out,several courts have recognized that the litigation privilege applies to claims brought against public entities,braun bureau of state audits th,d people health laboratories of north america,th,d.to then decline to apply the privilege to claims brought by public entities,under the ucl or any other statute,would indeed be inequitable.
for these reasons,we agree with the trial court that section b bars this action.indeed,to conclude otherwise,we believe,would be inconsistent with our mandate to resolve a ny doubt about whether the litigation privilege applies in favor of applying it.citation.kashian,supra,th at,d.as several california courts have explained in recognizing that the litigation privilege has its costs,it is desirable to create an absolute privilege not because we desire to protect the shady practitioner,but because we do not want the honest one to have to be concerned with subsequent derivative actions silberg,supra,cal d at,quoting thornton rhoden d.
in so holding,we acknowledge the state and amicus argument that ucl actions brought by governmental entities on the people behalf serve important law enforcement purposes.however,the california supreme court has already made clear that fact alone does not warrant erosion of the absolute litigation privilege.acknowledging in action apartment that the city of santa monica may have been motivated by a legitimate government purpose in adopting a city ordinance prohibiting landlords from bringing actions to recover rental units without a reasonable factual or legal basis,it nonetheless held that t he city enforcement of the provision that creates a civil and criminal cause of action based on the act of initiating litigation would cut against the litigation privileges core policy of protecting access to the courts.citation.knowing that the city or any other person could bring such an enforcement action would have a chilling effect on landlords pursuing evictions through the courts.action apartment,supra,cal th at,d.the same chilling effect would occur here,we fear,were this lawsuit to proceed.
does the doctrine bar the state ucl claims 
because section b bars this action,we need not address the state remaining arguments for reversing the trial court ruling on demurrer.aubry,supra,cal th at,d,t he judgment must be affirmed if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken.we nonetheless briefly address the state argument,given the parties and amicus curiae extensive briefing of the issue.
under the doctrine,t hose who petition the government are generally immune from antitrust liability.professional real estate investors,columbia pictures industries,d professional real estate investors see also blank,supra,cal d at,the doctrine declares that efforts to influence government action are not within the scope of the sherman act,regardless of anticompetitive purpose or effect.this doctrine relies on the constitutional right to petition for redress of grievances to establish that there is no antitrust liability for petitioning any branch of government,even if the motive is anticompetitive.pacific gas electric bear stearns cal d.the doctrine further relies on principles of comity,noninterference on the part of the courts with governmental bodies that may validly cause otherwise anticompetitive effects and with efforts intended to influence such bodies.blank,supra,cal d at.

following the california supreme court decision in blank,the united states supreme court clarified the sham exception to the doctrine,setting forth a test for determining whether a defendant petitioning activities fall within its reach first,it must be objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits second,the litigant subjective motivation must conceal an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor through the use of the governmental opposed to the outcome of that an anticompetitive weapon.be k construction national labor relations board,d be k,quoting professional real estate investors,supra,at.see also wolfgram wells fargo bank th,d.to meet this test,the defendant petitioning activities thus must be a sham both objectively and subjectively.be k,supra,at.see also wolfgram,supra,at,d.
here,the state contends pacific lumber petitioning activities fall within the sham exception,and thus enjoy no immunity.we disagree.pacific lumber activities in connection with the ceqa administrative proceedings constituted a genuine effort to influence government action.noerr,supra,at.designed to secure approval of its sustained yield plan,the company effort was neither objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits,nor did it conceal an attempt to interfere with a competitor business relationships through the use of the governmental opposed to the outcome of that process.be k,supra,at.see also wolfgram,supra,th at,d absent a patent lack of merit,an action protected under the first amendment by the right of petition can not be the basis for litigation.indeed,according to the state own allegations,pacific lumber achieved the very outcome it petitioned for in the ceqa to harvest timber at a desirable annual rate.steel,supra,th at,d a cause of action under the sham exception was stated where the allegations show defendants undertook petitioning activity solely to delay or prevent plaintiffs entry into the shredded automobile body market through use of the governmental opposed to the outcome of that an anticompetitive weapon.that pacific lumber is alleged to have employed improper tactics in seeking that outcome does not render their efforts less genuine.blank,supra,cal d at,f or purposes of the doctrine,impropriety and genuineness are not related.
apparently conceding pacific lumber conduct fails to meet the test for the sham exception put forth by the united states supreme court,the state and amicus curiae rely primarily on federal cases to suggest the exception nonetheless applies because allegations are raised of fraudulent conduct in the context of an adjudicatory proceeding.specifically,they contend t he utterance of knowing and reckless falsehoods that affect the outcome of a government agency adjudicatory determination are not protected by the doctrine.
in so arguing,the state admits that the united states supreme court has not recognized an exception to the doctrine based on a defendant fraudulent conduct.see professional real estate investors,supra,at,fn.suggesting an open question remains whether there is a exception to the doctrine.the state argues,however,that the following language in california transport suggests such an exception would be appropriate there are many forms of illegal and reprehensible practice which may corrupt the administrative or judicial processes and which may result in antitrust violations.misrepresentations,condoned in the political arena,are not immunized when used in the adjudicatory process.opponents before agencies or courts often think poorly of the other tactics,motions,or defenses and may readily call them baseless.one claim,which a court or agency may think baseless,may go unnoticed but a pattern of baseless,repetitive claims may emerge which leads the factfinder to conclude that the administrative and judicial processes have been abused.that may be a difficult line to discern and draw.but once it is drawn,the case is established that abuse of those processes produced an illegal result,effectively barring respondents from access to the agencies and courts.insofar as the administrative or judicial processes are involved,actions of that kind can not acquire immunity by seeking refuge under the umbrella of political expression.california transport,at.
while a split of authority exists,several federal courts have relied on this language to extend the sham exception to cover certain fraudulent acts,at least when done in the adjudicatory context.in kottle northwest kidney centers cir,for example,the court recognized that in the context of a judicial proceeding,if the alleged anticompetitive behavior consists of making intentional misrepresentations to the court,litigation can be deemed a sham if a party knowing fraud upon,or its intentional misrepresentations to,the court deprive the litigation of its legitimacy.liberty lake,magnuson,cir clipper exxpress rocky mountain motor tariff bureau,cir.see also potters medical center city hosp.ass cir,the knowing and willful submission of false facts to a government agency falls within the sham exception.but see armstrong surgical center,armstrong county memorial hosp.cir,fn.disagreeing with kottle and other authority that an exception exists for knowingly submitting false information to an adjudicative body baltimore scrap david joseph cir,baltimore scrap declining to reach the question of whether a fraud exception to still exists after professional real estate investors where plaintiff can not show that the state court judgment was procured by fraud or deceit,and noting that a broad fraud exception would allow federal collateral litigation over conduct in state courts that never affected the core of a state judgment.the kottle court went on to conclude that administrative bodies are equivalent to judicial ones for purposes of the sham exception when such bodies act in an adjudicatory capacity,meaning their actions are guided by enforceable standards subject to review rather than by political discretion.kottle,supra,at,fn.
here,relying on kottle,the state and amicus curiae contend the ceqa proceedings were akin to judicial ones for purposes of the sham exception because,under the relevant rules and regulations,the cdf made factual findings based upon evidence submitted in connection with public hearings,and because the agency ultimate decisions were subject to judicial review.see,tit,code civ.
regardless of whether the ceqa proceedings are characterized as judicial or adjudicatory for other purposes,we would decline to hold that the state allegations meet the requirements of the sham exception for purposes of the doctrine.first,as stated above,the united states supreme court has not expanded the sham exception to cover such allegations,or recognized an independent exception.professional real estate investors,supra,at,fn.moreover,the united states supreme court has recently confirmed that conduct falls within the sham exception only if it is,unlike here,objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits and sub
