this case involves the cleanup of the wingate superfund site,a sixty acre stretch of land that became contaminated with hazardous waste as a result of the city of lauderdale operation of a landfill and incinerators on the property.the broward gardens housing complex,situated about of a mile from the wingate site,was constructed during the city operation of the landfill.after the city and other parties implemented a cleanup plan for wingate pursuant to a consent decree,the broward gardens tenants association and various residents of broward gardens sued the united states environmental protection agency,the united states department of housing and urban development,various federal officials,and the city,alleging numerous deficiencies in the cleanup plan.
the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to section h of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla,which prohibits federal judicial review of challenges to cercla cleanups except where necessary to decide a claim that falls within one of five statutory exceptions.on appeal,plaintiffs do not assert that their claims fit within any of these statutory exceptions to the section h bar,but instead contend that section h does not apply to begin with,because their complaint is not a challenge to the wingate cleanup within the meaning of section h and section h does not apply to constitutional claims anyway.we disagree with both contentions and affirm the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
background facts and procedural history 
the plaintiffs complaint alleges the following historical facts,which we accept as true for purposes of this review.see shands teaching hosp.and clinics,beech,cir.in,the city of fort lauderdale acquired the piece of land that would later become known as the wingate superfund site.from until,the city used the property to operate a landfill and incinerators,causing it to become contaminated with,among other things,arsenic and dioxin.the city never conducted a health study of the site during all those years of operation.
broward gardens is a housing complex located approximately of a mile from wingate.percent of broward gardens tenants are.a private developer planned the complex in the,and hud insured the mortgage.hud also subsidizes the rents for units leased to low income persons.
in,pursuant to section of cercla,which provides for the establishment of a national contingency plan for the removal of hazardous substances,epa conducted initial studies of wingate and added it to the national priorities list npl,a list of hazardous waste sites for which the cleanup was a high priority.a year after wingate was added to the npl,the florida department of health conducted a preliminary study which demonstrated that cancer levels in broward county were higher in the areas surrounding wingate than in any other part of the county.
after conducting studies of wingate and soliciting public comment,epa developed,pursuant to cercla,a proposed remedial plan for the site cleanup in,epa issued a record of decision in which it presented the remedial action it had selected.that selected remedy included construction of a synthetic or clay cap with erosion controls over the landfill excavation of contaminated soil and incinerator ash,and disposal on the on site landfill drainage,treatment,and disposal of water in lake stupid excavation of lake stupid sediments,and disposal on the on site landfill storm water management construction of a vertical barrier between the landfill and rock pit lake natural attenuation for the surface water at rock pit lake decontamination of the buildings and structures monitoring of ground water,surface water,sediment,and fish tissue institutional controls ground water use restrictions within the current site boundary and institutional controls for the maintenance of the site cap,storm water controls,fencing,and signs.
the record of decision states that t he selected remedy is protective of human health and the environment,complies with federal and state requirements that are legally applicable or relevant and appropriate to the remedial action,and is cost effective.the florida department of environmental protection,after reviewing the plan,advised epa of its concerns including the fact that that the plan ignored the state cancer risk cleanup level for arsenic.epa chose not to incorporate that risk cleanup level for arsenic into the proposed cleanup plan for wingate.
after negotiating with the city and other potentially responsible parties prps over who would fund and implement the selected remedial action,epa formulated a proposed consent decree for the cleanup of wingate.under the proposed decree,the city and other settling parties would finance and perform the remedial action for wingate as set out in the record of decision and the appendix to the decree.that remedial action was essentially the same as the epa proposed remedial plan,which we have already outlined.
pursuant to section of cercla,epa submitted the proposed consent decree to the united states district court for the southern district of florida,united states city of lauderdale,and it was made available for public comment.various groups such as the legal aid services of broward county,and the legal environmental assistance foundation leaf submitted comments expressing their concerns that the proposed remedial action did not require as much soil cleanup as florida law did,and for that reason the site would never be removed from the npl list and the proposed remedial action did not assure protection of human health from the arsenic and dioxin contamination.
at the end of the comment period,epa moved for entry of the decree.some people who were not parties but who lived close to wingate appeared to challenge the proposed remedy and oppose the motion to enter the decree.the district court found that those did not have standing and,on december,entered the decree.united states city of lauderdale,d.the to the decree did not attempt to appeal the court standing determination or anything else.
after the cleanup of wingate commenced,the broward gardens tenants association and various residents of broward gardens filed a complaint against epa,hud,various federal officials,and the city.it alleges that broward gardens was established as part of an overall plan to racially segregate lauderdale,with the knowledge that the tenants would be exposed to hazardous substances.the complaint also alleges that the cleanup plan for wingate is inadequate and that the site continues to expose plaintiffs to hazardous substances such as dioxin and arsenic by implementing the inadequate cleanup plan,the complaint contends,defendants were perpetuating de jure segregation.
the complaint sets forth seven counts based on various constitutional and statutory provisions.count i alleges a violation of the fifth amendment by epa count ii alleges a violation of the thirteenth amendment and by the city count iii alleges a violation of the fourteenth amendment and by the city count iv alleges a violation of title vi of the civil rights act of,et,by the city count v alleges a violation of title viii of the civil rights act of,et,by epa and various epa officials count vi alleges a violation of the fair housing act,et by hud and a named hud official and count vii alleges a violation of the fifth amendment by the epa officials.
the complaint requests various forms of declaratory and injunctive relief,including that the court 
order the defendants promptly to take effective action to disestablish the continuing de jure segregation of broward gardens and the conditions,features,and effects of that segregation,including the continued isolation and exposure of broward gardens to contamination,and industrial and other adverse land use conditions 
order that the defendants promptly take effective action to disestablish the continuing de jure segregation of broward gardens by adopting and implementing the state stricter standards in the remedial plan for wingate,including the elimination of the cap and mound method 
grant such other relief as may be just and appropriate.
the defendants filed motions to dismiss asserting,among other things,that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case because of section h of cercla,which limits a federal court jurisdiction to hear challenges to cleanups undertaken pursuant to cercla until those cleanups have been completed.the court agreed,granting the motions to dismiss the claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
specifically,the district court concluded that the complaint is a challenge to the cleanup plan at wingate and that therefore section h applied.because it was undisputed that the cleanup of wingate had not yet been completed,the court concluded that the complaint is barred by the plain language of section h.it rejected plaintiffs contention that their constitutional claims could nevertheless proceed,concluding that section h makes no exception for constitutional claims 
ii.discussion 
cercla sets forth a comprehensive scheme for the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.as part of that scheme,section of the act gives epa the authority to undertake response actions where there is a release or threatened release of hazardous substances.response actions fall into two categories removal actions which include actions to study and clean up contamination,and remedial actions which are those actions consistent with permanent remedy taken instead of or in addition to removal actions.cercla also gives epa authority to issue administrative orders for certain persons to undertake response actions themselves or to file suit seeking federal court orders to the same effect.a.under section of cercla,epa can negotiate settlement agreements with prps,in some cases for issuance by the district court as consent decrees.
in,congress amended cercla by adding section h,which,with five enumerated exceptions,denies federal courts jurisdiction to hear challenges to both removal and remedial actions taken under cercla until those actions are complete.h.entitled timing of review,section h provides that 
no federal court shall have jurisdiction under federal law other than under section of title relating to diversity of citizenship jurisdiction or under state law which is applicable or relevant and appropriate under section of this title relating to cleanup standards to review any challenges to removal or remedial action selected under section of this title,or to review any order issued under section a of this title,in any action except one of the following 
an action under section of this title to recover response costs or damages for contribution.
an action to enforce an order issued under section a of this title or to recover a penalty for violation of such order.
an action for reimbursement under section b of this title.
an action under section of this title relating to citizens suits alleging that the removal or remedial action taken under section of this title or secured under section of this title was in violation of any requirement of this chapter.such an action may not be brought with regard to a removal where a remedial action is to be undertaken at the site.
an action under section of this title in which the united states has moved to compel a remedial action.
plaintiffs do not dispute that the cleanup of wingate is a remedial action selected under section of cercla,nor do they dispute that section h bars federal judicial review of certain challenges to an ongoing cercla cleanup such as the one at wingate until the cleanup is completed.instead,they contend that their complaint is not a challenge to the wingate cleanup,and therefore falls outside the scope of section h.alternatively,plaintiffs contend that cercla ban against judicial review of ongoing cleanup plans does not apply to their constitutional claims we review de novo the court grant of defendants motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.ochran united states,cir.
is the complaint a challenge to the wingate remedial plan 
plaintiffs first attempt to circumvent the h bar by insisting that their complaint does not really challenge the remedial plan for wingate,as set forth in the consent decree a suit challenges a remedial action within the meaning of h if it interferes with the implementation of a cercla remedy.see costner urs consultants,cir.to determine whether a suit interferes with,and thus challenges,a cleanup,courts look to see if the relief requested will impact the remedial action selected.for example,in mcclellan ecological seepage situation perry,cir,the court,in holding that plaintiffs citizen suit claims under the resource conservation and recovery act and the clean water act were barred by section h,held that vindication of those claims would create new requirements for dealing with the inactive sites that are now subject to the cercla cleanup and clearly interfere with the cleanup.id.at see also razore tulalip tribes of washington,cir holding no jurisdiction to entertain prp citizen suit where suit,if successful,would dictate specific remedial actions and alter the method and order for cleanup,in violation of h alabama epa,cir holding complaint barred because it challenged the remedial action plan to the extent that it sought to enjoin epa from participating in the shipment of wastes from a superfund site in texas to alabama and to prevent epa from participating in any further remedial action at the site.conversely,where a suit does not call into question the selected epa remedial or removal plan,the suit is not a challenge under section h.see beck atlantic richfield,cir holding that plaintiffs action for compensatory damages but not injunctive relief could go forward,because resolution of the damage claim would not involve altering the terms of the cleanup order.
as the district court concluded in this case,the plaintiffs requests for relief seek to change the nature of the wingate cleanup.the complaint seeks injunctive relief,including an order that defendants end exposure of broward gardens to contamination for the wingate superfund site,and that they adopt and implement the state stricter standards in the remedial plan for wingate,including the elimination of the cap and mound method.thus,the complaint asks the court to order the defendants to alter the remedial plan for wingate.because the complaint seeks to have the court modify or replace the remedial plan for wingate,it clearly is a challenge to the selected remedial plan.
plaintiffs and leaf,as amicus curiae,counter that the complaint should be construed to seek the remedy of relocation,and argue that such a remedy is not a challenge to the remedial action that was selected by epa and implemented by the consent decree.it is not clear that the complaint actually requests relocation as a remedy,but it does not matter.assuming it is pleaded,the request for relocation constitutes a challenge to the cleanup.congress specifically provided that relocation can constitute one of the measures of a remedial plan,which means that epa could have incorporated relocation into wingate remedial plan,but chose not to do so.if the district court were to grant plaintiffs relief in the form of relocation,the remedial action as set forth in the consent decree would have to be altered to include relocation.asserting that a remedial plan is inadequate because it fails to include a measure that it could have included is challenging the plan for section h purposes.
leaf contends that because the broward gardens complex is located outside the site boundaries,and because the selected remedial plan does not address lands and structures outside those boundaries,relocation of broward gardens residents would have no impact on the selected remedial plan.but,as we have just pointed out,cercla expressly provides that relocation can constitute one of the measures of a remedial plan.specifically,the statute provides that the term remedial action 
includes the costs of permanent relocation of residents and businesses and community facilities where the president determines that,alone or in combination with other measures,such relocation is more than and environ
