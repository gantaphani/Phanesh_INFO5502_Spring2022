west coast seafood processors association wcspa appeals from the district court denial of its motion to intervene as a defendant in this case,in which the natural resources defense council,and pacific marine conservation council,together,nrdc challenged the national marine fisheries service nmfs program to preserve groundfish species off the coast of california,oregon,and washington.because the litigation between nrdc and nmfs has ended,we dismiss wcspa appeal as moot.
exercising its authority under the magnuson stevens act,et,nmfs uses two primary and interrelated tools to regulate pacific groundfish fisheries the pacific coast groundfish fishery management plan groundfish plan,established in and amended periodically since,which sets forth procedures for assessing the health of groundfish populations and for formulating preservation measures and annual or biennial specifications and management measures specifications,which set quotas on the catch for each overfished species and impose restrictions on the methods used to catch such species.
this case was already eight years old when wcspa sought to intervene,both as of right and permissively,but in one sense the case was brand new.nrdc originally filed the case as a challenge to amendment of the groundfish plan,which governs the development of rebuilding plans for overfished species.wcspa began to participate as an amicus in late,but it did not move to intervene.between and,nrdc amended its complaint four times,each time to add a challenge to a new amendment to the groundfish plan.wcspa moved to intervene in anticipation of the fourth amended complaint,but the presiding magistrate judge denied the motion as untimely,and wcspa did not appeal.
in,nrdc changed the nature of the case by filing a fifth amended complaint that added a challenge to nmfs specifications.whereas previously the case had concerned only the groundfish plan,the fifth amended complaint brought in an attack on nmfs other major regulatory mechanism,the specifications that set fishing quotas in the past,nrdc had challenged the specifications in separate actions.between and,it filed separate actions challenging the annual specifications for,and,and the biennial specifications for.wcspa successfully intervened in all four actions,thereby demonstrating a strong interest in fully participating in litigation concerning the specifications.predictably,wcspa also moved to intervene in this case two days after nrdc filed its challenge to the specifications in its fifth amended complaint.but the magistrate denied the motion as untimely because of the age of the litigation.on appeal,wcspa argues that the magistrate judge erred by basing his decision on the age of the litigation eight years rather than the time that had elapsed between the filing of the fifth amended complaint and the motion to intervene two days.
while this appeal was pending,however,the underlying litigation the dispute between nrdc and nmfs fully ran its course.on the parties for summary judgment,the magistrate judge held that the specifications for three species violated the magnuson stevens act,but that the specifications for four other species did not.in an order on remedy,filed april,six weeks before we heard oral argument on this appeal the magistrate judge directed nmfs to establish new specifications within one year and retained jurisdiction to ensure the agency compliance.although nmfs filed a notice of appeal from the order on remedy,it voluntarily dismissed that appeal before briefing by either party.the magistrate judge entered final judgment on may.
an appeal is moot if there exists no present controversy as to which effective relief can be granted.outdoor media group,city of beaumont,cir quoting vill.of gambell babbitt,cir.wcspa appeals from the denial of its motion to intervene in a case that the district court has since decided,through the order on remedy and the subsequent final judgment,from which neither party has appealed.because the underlying litigation is over,we can not grant wcspa any effective relief by allowing it to intervene now.the appeal is therefore moot.see united states ford,cir dismissing as moot an appeal of a denial of a motion to intervene where the underlying litigation was voluntarily dismissed since there is no longer any action in which appellants can intervene,judicial consideration of the intervention question would be fruitless.canatella california,cir holding that entry of judgment in the underlying litigation does not moot an appeal from a denial of a motion to intervene,if one of the parties keeps the underlying litigation live by pursuing an appeal.
the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness does not apply.that exception applies only in extraordinary cases.doe madison sch.dist,cir en banc.although it might apply to an appeal of the underlying litigation about the biennial specifications,it does not apply to wcspa appeal of the denial of its motion to intervene.
first,the capable of repetition prong of the exception requires a reasonable expectation that the same party will confront the same controversy again.feldman bomar,cir.on this appeal,the controversy is whether wcspa motion to intervene was timely.unique circumstances produced this controversy.for eight years,nrdc maintained an action challenging amendments to the groundfish plan,a subject that did not prompt wcspa to intervene,at least not for the first six years of the case.nrdc then amended its complaint to add an attack on the specifications,a subject that wcspa did consider.the district court denied the motion to intervene as untimely because of the age of the litigation.wcspa disagrees and argues that the motion came in timely response to the fifth amended complaint.it is not reasonable to expect that this dispute about timeliness will arise again.the hybrid groundfish litigation is over.although nrdc will likely challenge future specifications and wcspa will likely file future motions to intervene,the timeliness issue,which is the subject of this appeal,will not likely reappear as it did not appear in any of the other cases in which the nrdc challenged earlier specifications and in which wcspa successfully intervened,unless the same unlikely,hybrid scenario develops again over the next decade.such a speculative possibility does not constitute a reasonable expectation.see sze ins,cir luckie epa,cir.
second,the intervention issue does not evade review.a controversy evades review only if it is inherently limited in duration such that it is likely always to become moot before federal court litigation is completed.ctr.for biological diversity lohn,cir quoting native vill.of noatak blatchford,cir.with respect to this inquiry,one must not conflate the issue in the underlying litigation whether the specifications are valid with the controversy in this appeal over wcspa motion to intervene.the controversy over the specifications does evade review,because the specifications are biennial.see alaska ctr.for the env t forest,cir permit evades review see also evans,at nmfs specifications evade review.but the mootness vel non of the controversy over wcspa right to intervene depends on the duration of the underlying litigation,not on the duration of the specifications.see canatella,at.therefore,the intervention controversy does not evade review because,by virtue of the very fact that the underlying dispute satisfies the mootness exception and could continue well past the specifications period,the intervention dispute is not inherently limited in duration nor likely always to become moot.lohn,at.had nmfs not voluntarily dismissed its appeal,the underlying case would have remained alive,and we could have granted wcspa effective relief by allowing it to intervene.see canatella,at.the intervention controversy avoids review here only because nmfs acquiesced in the remedy by dismissing its appeal,not because the controversy is inherently limited in duration.therefore,the exception does not apply.see lohn,at 
in sum,these appeals are moot and no exception to mootness can revive them.accordingly,these appeals are 
the majority concludes that the case is moot and does not reach its merits.i respectfully dissent since i conclude the case survives mootness because it falls in the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness.i would thus reach the merits of the appeal and reverse.
a seafood processors trade association moved to intervene in a pending action,as of right and also permissively,two days after the magistrate judge had granted the plaintiff,an environmental organization,leave to file an amended complaint that challenged fishing quotas.for the past several years,the environmental organization had challenged such fishing quotas in separate federal court actions and the trade association had intervened in almost all of those actions.here,however,the magistrate judge denied the trade association motion to intervene on the sole ground the motion was untimely.
the proposed intervenor in this case is west coast seafood processors association wcspa,a nonprofit trade association whose member companies,located in california,oregon,and washington,process fish taken from fisheries into consumable fish products.wcspa appeals the magistrate judge denial of its motion to intervene in this case brought by the natural resources defense council,and pacific marine conservation council,together the nrdc,environmental organizations,against the secretary of commerce,the national oceanic and atmospheric administration,and the national marine fisheries service nmfs.
in its fifth amended complaint,nrdc alleges that nmfs violated the magnuson stevens fishery conservation and management act magnuson act,et,which directs nmfs to end overfishing and to increase the populations of overfished species off the coasts of the united states.nmfs adopts fishery management plans to accomplish this statutory mandate.these plans set target dates by which to increase overfished populations to certain levels,as well as procedures to impose fishing limits to achieve those targets.pursuant to those procedures,nmfs separately announces fishing limits that set quotas,in metric tons,on the amount of fish that may be caught each year.
in years past,nrdc has sued nmfs on the pacific coast groundfish fishery management plan groundfish plan amendments,contending that the amendments violated the magnuson act.between and,nrdc amended its original complaint four times,each time to incorporate a challenge to a newly adopted groundfish plan amendment.wcspa did not intervene in the suits as a party because it was satisfied with nmfs representation as to issues raised relating to the groundfish plan.
however,in separate federal actions,nrdc also sued nmfs to challenge the annual fishing quota specifications for,and,as well as the biennial specifications for,which dealt with quotas metric tons of fish.wcspa timely intervened in each case for each year save one.here,however,nrdc decided simply to amend its groundfish plan lawsuit by its fifth amended complaint instead of following its longtime practice of bringing a separate and new lawsuit to challenge the specifications.two days after the magistrate judge granted nrdc leave to so amend its complaint,wcspa moved to intervene,as it had done in each of nrdc separate,prior federal actions challenging fishing quotas since.the magistrate judge here denied wcspa motion as untimely,and wcspa appealed.
given that nrdc fundamentally altered wcspa interest in this case when nrdc amended its complaint to challenge the fishing quotas,as opposed to another amendment to nmfs fishery management plan,and given that wcspa promptly moved to intervene after the magistrate judge granted nrdc leave to file the amended complaint,i find the magistrate judge below abused his discretion by such denial hence,i would reverse.
i disagree with the majority that the panel can not reach the merits of the appeal because it is moot.mootness is determined by whether a present controversy exists as to which a court can grant any effective relief.siskiyou reg l educ.project forest,cir.i agree with the majority that because the subject of the controversy that once existed between the nrdc and nmfs the specifications has expired and is on the verge of being replaced by a new set of specifications,there is no longer any effective relief this court can grant to wcspa.
nonetheless,i conclude that this case falls within the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness.this exception applies if two requirements are met the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subjected to the same action again.weinstein bradford,d per curiam.the present case meets both of these requirements.
first,the challenged action here is too short in its duration to be fully litigated before a court of appeals and the supreme court prior to its expiration.the underlying lawsuit between nrdc and nmfs deals with fishing quota specifications which expire every two years.once the fishing quota specifications expire,the controversy over wcspa right to intervene in the suit challenging the fishing quota specifications becomes moot.wcspa thus has at most two years to challenge the denial of its motion to intervene before its challenge becomes moot.both the supreme court and this court have held that two years is too short in duration for a case to be fully litigated.pac.terminal icc.order that expires by its terms after two years evades review alaska ctr.for env t forest,cir a permit that expired in two years is too short for judicial review see also greenpeace action franklin,cir fishing quota specifications that expire in one year evade review.
second,the challenged action is capable of repetition.the supreme court has explained it is enough that the litigant faces some likelihood of becoming involved in the same controversy in the future.parole comm geraghty,d.the central consideration is whether the controversy is capable of repetition and not whether the claimant ha s demonstrated that a recurrence of the dispute is more probable than not.honig doe,d emphasis in original.further,i n estimating the likelihood of an event occurring in the future,a natural starting point is how often it has occurred in the past.clarke united states,en banc.for almost a decade before its fifth amended complaint,nrdc had,without exception,challenged fishing quotas in separate actions,and wcspa had,with only one early exception,intervened in each of those actions.in the present case,wcspa attempted to intervene in the fishing quota suit only two days after nrdc successfully amended its separate groundfish plan lawsuit to challenge the fishing quota specifications.yet,the magistrate judge inexplicably concluded that wcspa motion to intervene was untimely despite wcspa promptness in filing its motion.given that nrdc successfully prevented wcspa from intervening in its fishing quota suit,it is now likely that nrdc will pursue its fishing quota challenges by amendment to future groundfish plan suits against nmfs rather than by separate action.hence,wcspa faces some likelihood of becoming involved in the same controversy in the future.
because both prongs of the repetition and evasion exception are satisfied,i conclude this case falls within the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness.therefore,i would reach the merits of wcspa appeal.
on the merits,i would hold that the magistrate judge abused his discretion when he denied wcspa motion to intervene as untimely.under united states hinkson,cir en banc,a trial court abuses its discretion if it fails to apply the correct legal standard to decide an issue.if,however,the trial court applies the correct legal standard,there is no abuse of discretion unless the trial court findings of fact,and its application of those findings of fact to the correct legal standard,are illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from facts in the record.id.
here,the magistrate judge correctly identified the three factors that courts weigh to determine whether a motion to intervene is timely the stage of the proceeding at which a
