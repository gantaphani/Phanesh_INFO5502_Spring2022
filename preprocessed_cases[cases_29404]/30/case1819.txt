appellant friends of riverside hills friends appeals from the superior court judgment dismissing its petition for writ of mandate petition.in its petition,friends challenged the city of riverside city decision to approve three tract maps within the rancho la sierra specific plan specific plan area of riverside without requiring the applicant to comply with all conditions of approval and mitigation measures contained in the specific plan.the court dismissed the petition because friends did not comply with the requirement of government code section that any action to attack or review,the decision of a public body concerning a subdivision under the subdivision map act et sma include service of a summons within days after the date of the challenged decision.in this appeal,friends challenges only the dismissal of the ceqa cause of action regarding the mitigation measures.at issue here is whether the section service of summons requirement applies to a petition for writ of mandate alleging a ceqa cause of action,where the petitioner challenges the decision of a public body concerning a subdivision under the sma and if so,whether friends ceqa cause of action concern s a subdivision under the sma.
as discussed below,we conclude that the service of summons requirement of section applies to ceqa causes of action concerning a subdivision,because the requirement does not conflict with ceqa procedures such that ceqa actions would be excepted from the broad and rule that any type of action challenging a decision under the sma must comply with the requirement and friends ceqa cause of action concerns a subdivision,because it overlaps with the other sma causes of action in the petition and could have been brought under the sma.thus,the trial court did not err when it dismissed the entire petition.

does the section summons requirement apply to ceqa causes of action concerning a subdivision 
statutory background and issues presented 
friends contends that,because there is no summons requirement in ceqa,section does not apply here,even if the city decision concern ed a subdivision within the meaning of that statute.this is because,friends argues,under ceqa personal jurisdiction is conferred by personal service of the petition.
the sma sets forth the summons requirement for any action to challenge an agency decision concerning a subdivision 
any action or proceeding to attack,set aside,void,or annul the decision of an advisory agency,appeal board,or legislative body concerning a subdivision,or of any of the proceedings,acts,or determinations taken,done,or made prior to the decision,or to determine the reasonableness,legality,or validity of any condition attached thereto shall not be maintained by any person unless the action or proceeding is commenced and service of summons effected within days after the date of the decision.thereafter all persons are barred from any action or proceeding,italics added.
case law has made it clear that this service of summons requirement is mandatory and acts as a statute of limitations,barring actions under the sma in which the service of summons is not accomplished within days after the challenged decision of the legislative or advisory body.sprague county of san diego th,d,citing maginn city of glendale th,d.
the city and real parties argue that section governs all actions concerning a subdivision,even those grounded in alleged violations of ceqa,and thus the friends suit became barred when friends did not serve the summons within days of the city council june,decision to accept the project as complete.
friends contends that the ceqa requirements for service of process,and no others,apply to the first cause of action.prior to filing a petition for writ of mandate under ceqa,the petitioner must provide notice of the intent to sue to the public agency who approved the challenged project.pub.resources code.this notice tells the public agency that the action has begun and what project is being challenged.board of supervisors superior court th,d board of supervisors.within days after the petition is filed,the petition and a request to prepare the administrative record must be personally served on the lead agency.pub.resources code,subd.a.
the request to prepare the administrative record,together with the complaint or petition,shall be served personally upon the lead agency not later than business days from the date that the action or proceeding was filed.pub.resources code,subd.a.
friends fulfilled the notice and service requirements.friends provided its notice of intent to sue on july.friends personally served the petition and its notice regarding preparation of the administrative record on july,within business days after it filed the petition on july.friends argues here that nothing else is required.
statute of limitations applies broadly to any action concerning a subdivision 
there is no case law directly addressing whether a petition alleging a ceqa cause of action that concern s a subdivision must comply with the statute of limitations resulting from section.however,there is ample case law holding that the requirement applies to all types of actions seeking review of a legislative or advisory body decisions under the sma,regardless of the legal basis.
in presenting jamul board of supervisors d.jamul,the appellate court found that the statute of limitations for challenging a legislative decision concerning subdivisions,resulting from section filing requirement,applies to any action or proceeding,regardless of its form,and thus applies to a complaint for declaratory relief.the appellate court affirmed the trial court judgment denying a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief challenging the board of supervisors denial of the petitioner request to toll the expiration date of a tentative subdivision map.the basis of the denial was failure to file the petition within days of the board decision as required by section.
the court found that the legislature specifically designed the statute broad language to include a wide range of actions jamul,supra,d at.r egardless of the nature of or label attached to the action challenging the legislative body decision,the action is governed by section.ibid.the court stressed that section applies to any challenge to a decision,regardless of the legal stratagems employed,whether the challenge is procedural or substantive,and whether it directly or indirectly attacks the legislative or advisory body action or inaction.jamul,supra,at.the court cites to five appellate cases for this point,which include attacks on school impact fees and other conditions of tentative maps,the granting or failure to grant certificates of compliance,extension of a tentative map,and the legislative body process and legal authority for making decisions under the sma.ibid.
even our state supreme court has emphasized,in hensler city of glendale cal th,d,hensler,that the statute of limitation under section applies to any type of action seeking review of a legislative or advisory body decision under the sma.in hensler,the supreme court upheld the appellate court affirmance of the trial court judgment of dismissal,holding that the plaintiff landowner inverse condemnation action against the city was barred under the statute of limitations imposed by section,because it was filed three years after the city rejected the plaintiff proposed development on his property.this is because the alleged taking resulted from the city adoption pursuant to the sma,and application to plaintiff property,of an ordinance prohibiting construction on major ridge lines.the court concluded that,an action which requires that review judicial review of a decision of the local legislative body concerning a subdivision or of the reasonableness,legality,or validity of any condition attached to a permit decision is governed by section regardless of the plaintiff characterization of the cause of action.hensler,supra,at,d.the court further stated,every appellate decision which has considered the issue in a case involving a controversy related to a subdivision has held that section is applicable no matter what the form of the action.id.at,d.the supreme court then cites nine separate cases,including jamul and the cases it cited,that find section applicable in various contexts.the key factor in each of the cases is that the action attacked or sought review of a decision of a local legislative or advisory body relating to a subdivision under the sma.
under the judicial decisions discussed above,the statute of limitations resulting from the filing and service of summons requirements of section applies to all causes of action brought to challenge a local body decision under the sma.we now consider friends argument that its ceqa cause of action is an exception,because it is grounded in the more specific of the two procedural statutes,and the two statutes can not be reconciled because they conflict and fulfilling the procedural requirements of the ceqa statutes,by itself,confers personal jurisdiction as stated in board of supervisors,supra,th at page,d.
are ceqa actions excepted from sma broad summons requirement 
in royalty,the appellate court held that the service requirement found in government code section,subdivision c e the general provision for challenging a conditional use permit under the planning and zoning law,et,applies to a petition for writ of mandate challenging a city issuance of a conditional use permit based on failure to comply with ceqa.the court held this even though ceqa has its own separate requirements for challenging the issuance of a conditional use permit on ceqa grounds,found at public resources code section,subdivision a the petitioner argued that public resources code section,subdivision a,should apply exclusively,because it governs challenges to a conditional use permit based specifically on noncompliance with ceqa,whereas government code section,subdivision c e,governs challenges to a conditional use permit generally.further,petitioner argued that the two statutes can not be reconciled,and thus the more specific of the two,the ceqa statute,should apply.royalty,supra,th at,d.the petitioner wanted the ceqa statute to apply exclusively because it allowed the city to agree to an extension of the personal service deadline contained in public resources code section,subdivision a,whereas there was no good cause exception to the deadline for personal service set forth in government code section,subdivision c e the petitioner had served the petition on the city days after the city approved the conditional use permit.
the appellate court reasoned that the two statutes can be reconciled because only one of them requires dismissal when its time limits are not met,and thus the petitioner was required to comply with the requirements of both.specifically,the seemingly mandatory service requirement of public resources code section,subdivision a can be extended for good cause.royalty,supra,th at,d.as a result,the statutes can and should be harmonized.to accomplish the legislature purpose of limiting the time in which a decision regarding a conditional use permit can be challenged by filing and serving a petition,in no event can service of the petition be accomplished beyond the time bar contained in the government code.to conclude otherwise would be to ignore the absolute limitations bar contained in government code section.ibid.
we recognize,as friends points out in its reply brief,that both the facts and the statutes in royalty differ in significant respects from the case at hand.however,royalty shows that ceqa causes of action challenging government decisions made under other statutory schemes in royalty the planning and zoning law generally here the sma must comply with the procedural requirements of both ceqa and the other statutory scheme,at least where the two statutory schemes do not conflict with each other.
as a general rule,when two statutes relate to the same subject,the more specific one will control unless they can be reconciled.citations.when the two statutes can be reconciled,they must be construed in reference to each other,so as to harmonize the two in such a way that no part of either becomes surplusage.royalty,supra,th at,d,quoting devita county of napa cal th,d.put another way,if we can reasonably harmonize t wo statutes dealing with the same subject,then we must give concurrent effect to both,even though one is specific and the other general.citations.citation.garcia mccutchen cal th,d.
here,as the city and real parties point out,there is no conflict between the two statutory schemes because the statutes do not have identical mandates addressing the same action.this is because the sma requires the petitioner to serve the summons on the legislative body within days of the challenged decision,whereas nothing in ceqa prohibits service of the summons or mandates dismissal if the summons is not served.both ceqa and section can be harmonized.friends could easily have complied with the sma service of summons requirement without running afoul of the ceqa procedures it simply failed to do so.notwithstanding friends detailed statutory arguments to the contrary,it could have satisfied the requirements of both statutory schemes without conflict.
further,as the city and real parties state,royalty and board of supervisors affirm that the service requirements of ceqa can be extended for good cause.the service requirements of section,like section in royalty,are mandatory and dismissal is mandated for failure to meet the specified deadlines.thus,for the same reasons that the ceqa statutes do not conflict with the section service statute in royalty,they do not conflict with the sma service requirements in section.
we also address friends contention that,under board of supervisors,they satisfied all requirements for service of a ceqa petition and nothing further is required.f
