background 
from to,a municipal class ii rubbish disposal facility was operated at a landfill in carson,california the landfill.approximately million cubic yards of waste,some of which contained hazardous substances,were deposited at the landfill.
in,the california department of health services,toxic substance control program dtsc identified the waste disposed at the landfill and estimated that percent of the material could be considered hazardous.the dtsc divided the landfill into two operable units ous the upper ou which includes the soil,waste zone,and the ground water immediately beneath the landfill and the lower ou,which includes the ground water beneath the upper ou.
in october,the dtsc issued a final remedial action plan the plan which assigned of the aggregate liability for the hazardous waste in the upper ou to generators of waste sent to the landfill.atlantic richfield company arco,chevron,chevron,exxon mobil exxon,phillips petroleum phillips,shell chemical shell chemical,shell oil shell oil,southern california gas gas,texaco texaco,union oil company of california union,and unocal unocal sometimes collectively referred to as oil companies,among others,were identified as potentially responsible parties for the waste.cities were not identified as potentially responsible parties in the plan.the plan,however,indicated that the allocation of responsibility was and did not limit strict joint,and several liability under cercla and other laws.
on december,the dtsc filed an action in federal district court against commercial realty projects,and metromall,llc,owners of the landfill sometimes jointly referred to as landowners,seeking recovery of environmental response costs under cercla and state law.on the same day,the parties lodged a consent decree landowner consent decree with the district court.under the landowner consent decree,landowners agreed to establish a million escrow account,which would cap liability to fund the plan.
on july,oil companies moved to intervene in the action against landowners to oppose the landowner consent decree which,due to the million cap,potentially shifted a significant portion of the recovery response costs from landowners to oil companies.on july,the district court denied oil companies motion to intervene,which oil companies appealed.
on august,landowners filed a separate action against oil companies asserting contribution claims under cercla,and other related claims.beginning september,we stayed oil companies appeal to permit the parties to pursue settlement discussions with the aid of the ninth circuit mediator.the ninth circuit mediator suspended the ninth circuit mediation to allow a larger group to participate in settlement negotiations under the supervision of a magistrate judge.the dtsc,oil companies and long beach oil development long beach oil subsequently participated in a series of settlement conferences before the magistrate judge.
in august,oil companies invited potentially responsible parties,including cities,to participate in settlement negotiations with the dtsc and the landowners.most refused to attend.in a letter dated september,oil companies cited evidence linking cities and the other potentially responsible parties to the landfill,and invited those parties to a second meeting to be held on september,but required execution of a confidentiality agreement in order to participate.while cities representatives arrived for the meeting,most,if not all of the cities refused to execute the confidentiality agreement and were not permitted to attend the meeting.
during the same time settlement negotiations were proceeding,phillips,union oil,unocal and the shell companies submitted administrative claims under the california tort claims act to cities in relation to response cost for the landfill.oil companies also served notice upon municipal waste generators of their intent to file suit under the resource conservation recovery act.
in november,as part of a global settlement with the dtsc,oil companies submitted settlement offers to cities for contribution toward remedial costs at the landfill in exchange for a full release from liability and contribution protection.cities rejected the offer.in january,oil companies and the dtsc again invited cities to join in global settlement discussions.most,if not all,the cities again refused to participate.
in february,shell,union oil,and unocal filed an action in federal court against cities and others,seeking contribution toward remedial costs at the landfill under cercla,and for other legal and equitable relief.phillips filed a similar complaint.
in may,oil companies extended the magistrate judge invitation to cities to attend settlement negotiations to be conducted among oil companies,landowners and the dtsc.most,if not all,either refused to attend or declined to join in global settlement discussions.in september,the dtsc and oil companies made a final unsuccessful attempt to include cities in a global settlement.
in october,the parties settled.on october,the dtsc issued a notice to interested parties that it was seeking judicial approval of a consent decree to resolve dtsc claims against landowners,oil companies and others oil consent decree.cities submitted comments on november,challenging several aspects of the oil consent decree.on december,the district court,pursuant to a stipulation by the parties and oil companies,permitted the dtsc to amend its complaint to add oil companies as defendants.
after requiring certain modifications incorporating comments to the oil consent decree,the dtsc moved for judicial approval of the oil consent decree on january.on that same day,cities moved,for the first time,to intervene.on march,the district court denied cities motion.on march,the district court entered an order granting the dtsc motion for judicial approval of the oil consent decree.on march,the district court entered the oil consent decree.cities filed timely notices of appeal 
discussion 
the oil consent decree contains the following provisions which cities find particularly objectionable 
oil companies are to pay million in recovery costs,with million deposited into an account for landfill recovery costs the account,million deposited into the account of attorneys for the landowners,and million deposited into the account contingent upon oil companies obtaining assignment of all claims against third parties 
oil companies are required to in good faith pursue third parties to maximize,to the extent practical recovery from 
oil companies recovery from third parties is subject to the following distribution formula the first million reimburses oil companies,the next million defrays oil companies attorney fees,and any additional funds are divided equally between the account and oil companies 
funds deposited by oil companies into the account shall be considered costs incurred consistently with the national recovery plan ncp and 
the oil consent decree resolves all claims brought by the dtsc against oil companies.
unfortunately,cities untimely intervention prevents them from pursuing their objections on appeal.
