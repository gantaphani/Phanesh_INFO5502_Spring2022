frontier oil corporation frontier and its subsidiary,wainoco oil gas company wainoco,appeal a summary judgment in favor of rli insurance company rli.frontier and wainoco contend rli has a duty to defend them in several personal injury actions arising from the operation of an oil and gas production facility adjacent to beverly hills high school in beverly hills,california.frontier predecessor and rli predecessor had entered into a liability insurance policy in texas.the parties dispute whether rli agreed under the terms of the policy to defend pollution claims and whether a duty to defend the underlying actions has arisen.each of these questions presents a issue concerning the law governing our determination.each issue in turn presents the threshold question of the applicable rule.
we conclude that notwithstanding the application of the governmental interest analysis to other issues,civil code section is the rule that determines the law governing the interpretation of a contract.section states that a contract is to be interpreted according to the law and usage of the place it is to be performed if the contract indicate s a place of performance and according to the law and usage of the place it was made if the contract does not indicate a place of performance.a contract indicate s a place of performance within the meaning of section if the contract expressly specifies a place of performance or if the intended place of performance can be gleaned from the nature of the contract and its surrounding circumstances.california,as the location of the risk insured under the policy,was the state where rli would be obligated to perform its defense obligations under the policy,and the contracting parties knew this at the time the policy was issued.indeed,the policy included several endorsements reflecting the existence of a covered risk located in california.the law of california therefore governs the interpretation of the policy.interpreting the policy under california law,we will hold that it includes a contractual duty to defend and that the facts alleged in the underlying complaints were sufficient to create a potential for coverage giving rise to a duty to defend.we will therefore reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the insurance policy 
underwriters indemnity company,rli predecessor in interest,issued a commercial general liability insurance policy to wainoco oil corporation,frontier predecessor in interest,in january.wainoco oil corporation,acting through an insurance brokerage,and underwriters indemnity company entered into the insurance contract in texas.the policy was effective from october,to october.
the policy liability insuring clause states we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies the bodily injury or property damage must be caused by an occurrence we will have the right and duty to defend any suit seeking those damages.italics added.exclusion of,in the same coverage form,provided for an absolute pollution exclusion this insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the actual,alleged or threatened discharge,dispersal,release or escape of pollutants 
the policy includes several contemporaneously issued endorsements,including one entitled oil and gas lease operators pollution liability coverage the pollution liability endorsement,which states at the top of its first page,this endorsement forms a part of the policy to which attached,effective on the inception date of the policy unless otherwise stated herein.the pollution liability endorsement deletes exclusion of from the policy and states we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by a pollution incident.the endorsement defines pollution incident as the sudden and accidental emission,discharge,release or escape of pollutants into or upon land or the atmosphere,provided that such emission,discharge,release or escape emanates from operations conducted on land and results in environmental damage.environmental damage is defined as the injurious presence in or upon land or the atmosphere of solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal contaminants,irritants or pollutants.the endorsement,however,does not mention a duty to defend.
the policy also includes three additional endorsements relating specifically to the oil and gas operations in beverly hills,california.one adds the city of beverly hills as an additional insured with respect to claims arising out of the following project oil and gas operations at olympic,city of beverly hill s,ca,apparently as a public entity that had issued a permit to conduct oil and gas operations at the site the second adds the department of transportation of the city of los angeles as an additional insured,also apparently as a public entity that had issued a permit and the third is a waiver of transfer rights of recovery against others made out in favor of the city of beverly hills with respect to claims arising from the same project.
finally,an endorsement for certain texas changes apparently conforms this policy issued in texas with texas law with respect to three specific areas,none of which is relevant to the issues raised in this appeal the notice prejudice rule,policy cancellation,and policy renewal.that endorsement also states that the insured may complain to the texas state board of insurance if any dispute concerning the premium or a claim is not resolved.
underlying actions and tender of defense 
lori lynn moss and numerous other plaintiffs filed a complaint against frontier,wainoco,and other oil and gas industry defendants in june moss venoco,no.the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants oil and gas operations at and other locations at the beverly hills site caused releases of toxic chemicals into the environment resulting in personal injuries and deaths.other plaintiffs filed similar complaints against frontier,wainoco,and others alleging the same operative facts in six additional actions filed from july to may.frontier and wainoco tendered defense of all of these actions to several primary liability insurers,including rli.rli responded that it would investigate the matter.
in january,frontier and wainoco made a written demand on numerous insurers,including rli,to provide a defense in the underlying actions.on february,rli filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of texas seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no duty to defend or indemnify frontier or wainoco in the underlying actions rli insurance wainoco oil gas,no.rli sent a letter to frontier and wainoco the next day denying coverage and a defense.
trial court proceedings 
frontier and wainoco filed their complaint in this action against rli and other insurers in february,alleging counts for declaratory relief,breach of contract,and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,all relating to the insurers refusal to defend the underlying actions.the texas federal district court stayed rli declaratory relief action in april under its broad discretionary authority to abstain from ruling on a declaratory relief action where there is a pending state court action in which the matters in controversy might be fully resolved.frontier and wainoco later resolved this action with respect to all of the insurer defendants except rli.
rli moved for summary judgment against frontier in november,arguing that it had no duty to defend frontier in the underlying actions.rli argued that texas law governed the dispute pursuant to civil code section and code of civil procedure section and that under texas law,rli had no duty to indemnify or defend frontier.specifically,rli argued that under texas law the pollution liability endorsement does not promise a defense of pollution claims,so the policy provides for indemnity of pollution claims but not a defense and,in any event the allegations in the underlying complaints do not create a potential for coverage.rli moved for summary judgment against wainoco on the same grounds,and also argued that wainoco was entitled to no relief because it was not a named insured under the policy.
the trial court concluded that civil code section determined whether the law of california or texas governed the dispute noting the texas changes endorsement,the court stated,the insurance policy as a whole shows the intent of the parties at the time the insurance contract was made was that texas law would apply to any disputes arising out of the contract.the court concluded,the insurance contract was made and accepted between a texas insurer and a insured in texas and was to be performed under texas law.the court therefore held that texas law governed this dispute.the court acknowledged that t he major risk identified by the parties in their contract was the insured petroleum drilling operation in california,but stated that such circumstance alone did not compel the conclusion that california law governed.
the trial court concluded that,under texas law,the policy did not include a duty to defend pollution claims because the pollution liability endorsement did not expressly promise a defense.the court therefore held that rli had no duty to defend frontier or wainoco regardless of the allegations in the underlying actions.the court granted the summary judgment motions against both frontier and wainoco and entered a judgment in favor of rli.frontier and wainoco filed a timely appeal.
contentions 
frontier and wainoco contend the governmental interest analysis is the rule that determines whether california law or texas law governs the parties rights under the policy,and under that analysis california law applies even under civil code section and code of civil procedure section,the contemplated place of performance was california,so california law applies interpreted in accordance with california law,the policy includes a contractual duty to defend that extends to claims arising from pollution incidents the allegations of the third party complaints establish a potential for coverage under the policy and therefore create a duty to defend and rli has a duty to defend under texas law,even if it applies.
rli disputes these contentions and argues that civil code section and code of civil procedure section establish the rule that determines whether california law or texas law governs the interpretation of the policy and,under that analysis,texas law applies because the policy does not expressly specify a place of performance and the contract was made in texas even under the governmental interest analysis,texas law applies interpreted in accordance with texas law,the policy does not include a duty to defend pollution claims the allegations of the third party complaints do not establish a potential for coverage under the policy and therefore can not support a duty to defend under texas law if california law applies,the matter should be remanded to the superior court to consider extrinsic evidence that was not considered in ruling on the prior summary judgment motion and wainoco is not an insured under the policy,so the judgment should be affirmed as to wainoco.
discussion 
standard of review 
a party is entitled to summary judgment only if there is no triable issue of material fact and the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a defendant moving for summary judgment must show that one or more elements of the plaintiff cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense,subd.p.a defendant can satisfy its burden by presenting evidence that negates an element of the cause of action or evidence that the plaintiff can not reasonably obtain needed evidence.kahn east side union high school dist.cal th,d.if the defendant meets this burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to set forth specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.code civ,subd.p.we review the trial court ruling de novo,liberally construe the evidence in favor of the opposing party,and resolve all doubts concerning the evidence in favor of the opposing party.miller department of corrections cal th,d.
choice of law refers to the determination of which state or other jurisdiction law applies to a particular issue.choice of law is one branch of the larger doctrine of conflicts of laws,which also includes the questions in which jurisdiction a suit can be brought and the effect of a foreign judgment.see weintraub,commentary on the conflict of laws ed,rest d conflict of laws,com.a.rules can be statutory or based on common law.see rest d conflict of laws,coms.b,c,leflar,statutes.courts and commentators have long struggled with differing approaches to challenging problems.
the determination whether rli has a duty to defend under the policy presents two principal issues.the first is whether the policy includes a duty to defend pollution claims.this is a question of contract interpretation.the second is whether the underlying personal injury actions trigger the duty to defend.each of these questions presents a issue as to whether the law of california or another state governs.each issue in turn presents the threshold question of which rule properly applies.
we first will decide that civil code section is the rule that determines the law governing the interpretation of the policy.we then will apply section,conclude that california law governs,and interpret the policy under california law.such interpretation will require us to conclude that the policy includes a duty to defend pollution claims.next,we will consider the choice of law with respect to whether the underlying actions trigger the duty to defend.we will hold that california law governs under either section or the governmental interest analysis.applying california law,we will conclude that rli has a duty to defend frontier and wainoco in the underlying actions.
civil code section is california rule that determines the law governing the interpretation of a contract 
civil code section see fn,ante was first enacted in based on an identical provision in the field code field draft and remains unchanged today.published opinions by california courts have applied the statute as a rule determining the law governing the interpretation of a contract very infrequently,and those opinions discussed post provide little guidance as to the meaning of the critical phrase indicate a place of performance.
our fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the legislative intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d.because the statutory language ordinarily is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent,we begin by examining the words of the statute.ibid.we give the words of the statute their ordinary and usual meaning and construe them in the context of the statute as a whole and the entire scheme of law of which it is a part.state farm mutual automobile ins.garamendi cal th,d.if the language is clear and a literal construction would not result in absurd consequences that the legislature did not intend,we presume that the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning governs.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th,d.if the language is ambiguous,we may consider a variety of extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,legislative history,and public policy.ibid.
civil code section,by its express terms,prescribes a rule concerning the interpretation of contracts.it states that a contract is to be interpreted according to the law and usage of the place where it is to be performed,but only if the contract indicate s a place of performance,and is to be interpreted according to the law and usage of the place where it was made if the contract does not indicate a place of performance.frontier and wainoco construe the quoted language to mean that a contract must be interpreted according to the law of the place where it is to be performed if the contract contemplates performance in a particular place,while rli construes the same language to mean that the law of the place where the contract is to be performed governs only if the contract expressly specifies a place of performance.
the apparent purpose of civil code section is to determine the choice of law with respect to the interpretation of a contract in accordance with the parties presumed intention at the time they entered into the contract.this was the explanation given by courts and commentators for the former common law rule on which section apparently was based.judge joseph story,in his highly regarded treatise on conflict of laws,described an exception to the general rule that the law of the place of making governed the validity and interpretation of a contract w here the contract is,either expressly or tacitly,to be performed in any other place,there the general rule is in conformity to the presumed intention of the parties that the contract as to its validity,nature,obligation,and interpretation is to be governed by the law of the place of performance.story,conflict of laws ed.similarly,kent commentaries explained that the law of the place a contract is to be performed should govern because,the rights of the parties are to be judged of by that law by which they intended,or rather by which they may justly be presumed to have bound themselves.citations.kent,commentaries on american law ed.fn.numerous contemporary judicial opinions followed this rule based on the parties presumed intention.see,vanzant,jones arnold,hamilton johnson mcdaniel chicago northwestern iowa,dyke erie,first nat.bank of waverly hall.
in our view,civil code section was intended to give effect to the parties presumed intention that the law of the place a contract is to be performed should govern its interpretation the parties intention as to the place of performance sometimes can be gleaned from the nature of the contract and the surrounding circumstances,even if the contract does not expressly specify a place of performance.this was story view.story,conflict of laws,supra,where the contract is,either expressly or tacitly,to be performed in any other place,italics added see also pomeroy ainsworth barb,if no place of performance is expressly stated,or implied from the terms of the contract,the law of the place where it was made will govern italics added.moreover,the use of the word indicate in section in lieu of a more restrictive word such as specify or state suggests that the legislature intended a less restrictive meaning.accordingly,we conclude that a contract indicate s a place of performance within the meaning of section if the intended place of performance can be gleaned from the nature of the contract and its surrounding circumstances.the intended place of performance is a question of contract interpretation for the court to decide,except to the extent the answer may depend on the credibility of extrinsic evidence.parsons bristol development cal d,american alternative ins.superior court th,d.
prior california opinions offer little guidance on the application of civil code section as a rule 
the california courts of appeal have cited civil code section in several opinions involving issues,but those opinions offer little or no meaningful guidance as to the meaning of indicate a place of performance.
blochman.bank ketcham,blochman was the first opinion by a california court to expressly invoke civil code section as a rule.blochman involved a promissory note executed and delivered in mexico,with the place of payment left blank.the plaintiff later inserted in the blank a location in california.blochman,supra,at.blochman concluded that the parties intended to allow the holder to designate a place for payment.the court stated that this was the law of california when a blank was left in a note for the holder to fill in,stated that there was nothing in the record to indicate that mexican law was to the contrary,and therefore presumed that mexican law was the same.id.at.although this discussion concerned the choice of law with respect to the interpretation of the contract,blochman did not cite section in this context.instead,blochman cited section in support of its conclusion that california law,rather than the law of mexico,governed the validity and enforceability of the note because the note was payable in california,supra,at.blochman did not discuss whether there was any indication that the contracting parties anticipated that the note would be made payable in california.
blair new york life ins.d,blair was an action by an insured for payment of disability insurance benefits.the defendant executed and issued the policy in new york,and delivered it to the insured in the state of washington.the insured moved to california several years later.the insured received disability benefits in washington and california before the defendant discontinued the payment of benefits based on the insured failure to disclose material facts concerning her physical condition.id.at.the issue concerned the interpretation of an incontestability clause.id.at.blair quoted civil code section and stated that the statute means that the place where the contract is made is of importance when the contract does not indicate a specific place of performance.blair,supra,at.after an intervening discussion,blair stated,the law of the place of performance of an insurance contract controls as to its legal construction and effect,but that of the place where made governs on all questions of execution and validity flittner equitable life assur.soc.pac,unless the terms of the contract provide otherwise or the circumstances indicate a different intention.id.at.blair did not cite section with regard to this last quoted statement.
the terms of the insurance policy in blair provided for payment of premiums at the defendant home office in new york or to an authorized agent elsewhere.blair,supra,d at.blair concluded,u nder this provision,the contract was to be performed partly in new york and partly in any other place where the premiums were paid or other necessary business could be transacted.id.at,but see flittner equitable life assur,supra.at,reaching a different conclusion on similar facts.blair stated that the contract was performed partly in new york and partly in washington,that the defendant waived the right to apply washington law by paying benefits to the plaintiff in california,and that the law of california governed because the breach occurred in california id.at,see also braun new york life ins.d,followed blair and declined to discuss the argument that blair failed to give effect to.the holding in blair apparently was based on the stated rule that in the circumstances of that case,liability for breach of contract was governed by the laws of the state where the breach occurred the holding apparently was not based on section.
shippers dev.general ins.d.shippers involved the interpretation of an insurance policy exclusion.id.at.shippers stated that the insurer relied on civil code section,quoted the statute,and then stated the insurer argument fails to consider the following rule the law of the place of performance of an insurance contract controls as to its legal construction and effect,but that of the place where made governs on all questions of execution and validity citation,unless the terms of the contract provide otherwise or the circumstances indicate a different intention.in this case,the circumstances do not indicate that in the matter of the interpretation of the contract,the parties intended to be restricted to the laws of the state of washington,where the contract was consummated by the delivery of the policy.blair new york life ins.d.it was contemplated that the policy would be effective and might have to be performed outside the state of washington.the law of this state in interpreting the policy will govern the extent of the coverage with respect to losses occurring within this state.citation.shippers,supra,at,fn.omitted.thus,it appears that rather than construe and apply section,shippers followed dicta from blair.although it appears that the dicta may be somewhat consistent with section with respect to the law governing contract interpretation,we must construe and apply the statute rather than a purported rule of law of some other origin.
some california opinions citing civil code section have concluded that there was no conflict between the laws of the states involved,and therefore have not determined whether the contract indicated a place of performance.see,gitano group,kemper group th,fn,d international service ins.gonzales d.other opinions have cited section to support conclusions on issues other than the law governing the interpretation of a contract,hambrecht quist venture partners american medical,th,d statute of limitations klein superior court d.formation of an oral contract henderson superior court d.validity and enforceability of a contract,statute of limitations,statute of frauds,and parol evidence rule wheeling financial indem.d.validity of an insurance policy exclusion bracker american nat.food d,measure of contract damages hardy musicraft records d,validity of a stock sale under securities laws blochman,supra.at,validity of a promissory note,without explaining why a statute that by its express terms establishes a rule only as to the interpretation of a contract should determine other issues.these and other california opinions offer little or no analysis of the meaning of indicate a place of performance in section 
the governmental interest analysis does not supplant civil code section as to the law governing the interpretation of contracts 
the most prevalent modern rule in california is the governmental interest analysis.it replaced former common law rules,and is sometimes labeled california modern rule.some courts and commentators discussed post have inferred or suggested that the judicially developed governmental interest analysis supplants the rule stated in civil code section.our careful review of the governmental interest analysis as developed by the california supreme court,however,causes us to conclude that it does not supplant the legislative command of section.
under the governmental interest analysis,the court first determines whether the applicable rules of law of the potentially concerned jurisdictions are the same or different.if the applicable rules of law are identical,the court may apply california law.if the applicable rules of law differ materially,the court proceeds to the second step,which involves an examination of the interests of each jurisdiction in having its own law applied to the particular dispute.if each jurisdiction has an interest in applying its own law to the issue,there is a true conflict and the court must proceed to the third step.in the third step,known as the comparative impairment analysis,the court determines which jurisdiction has a greater interest in the application of its own law to the issue or,conversely,which jurisdiction interest would be more significantly impaired if its law were not applied.the court must apply the law of the jurisdiction whose interest would be more significantly impaired if its law were not applied.kearney salomon smith barney,cal th,d,kearney washington mutual bank superior court cal th,d,washington mutual.
the california supreme court first definitively adopted the governmental interest analysis for use in tort actions in reich purcell cal d,reich,a wrongful death action arising from the collision of two automobiles in missouri driven by residents of california and ohio id.at.the issue involved the amount of tort damages.a missouri statute limited the amount of damages in a wrongful death action,while there was no such limitation under the laws of california and ohio.id.at.reich rejected the former common law rule that the law of the place of the wrong governed in tort actions.id.at.reich stated,the forum must search to find the proper law to apply based upon the interests of the litigants and the involved states id.at,and stated that the former rigid rule must be subordinated to the objective of proper choice of law in conflict cases,to determine the law that most appropriately applies to the issue involved citation id.at.reich concluded that california had no interest in applying its law to the benefit of the defendant because california did not limit the amount of damages awardable,and that missouri had no interest in applying its law limiting damages to the benefit of a defendant who was not a resident of that state as of the date of injury.the court therefore concluded that the law of ohio governed the amount of damages and that the missouri limitation on damages did not apply.id.at.
the california supreme court subsequently applied the governmental interest analysis in several other cases involving questions of tort and contract law.travelers ins.workmen.bd.cal d,was an action for workmen compensation benefits.the plaintiff originally entered into an oral employment contract in california,and later was injured in utah.id.at.the plaintiff was entitled to benefits under california workmen compensation statute only if he was injured while working under an employment contract that was entered into in california.id.at.the issues concerned the place of formation of the employment contract,whether an employment agency in colorado acted as the employer agent for purposes of transmitting an employment offer to the plaintiff,and whether the parties had rescinded the oral contract and formed a new employment contract in wyoming.ibid.travelers decided each of these questions by considering the governmental interests of the states involved,stating,california has rejected the traditional mechanical solutions to problems and adopted foreign law only when it is appropriate in light of the significant interests in the particular case.citations.id.at.travelers concluded that california had a strong interest in applying its own laws to determine whether an injured californian was entitled to benefits under the workmen compensation act and that the other states involved had no significant interest in applying their laws to the dispute.id.at.the court therefore concluded that california law governed the,agency,and rescission issues.id.at.
hurtado superior court cal d,was a wrongful death action arising from a collision in california involving three automobiles driven by residents of california and mexico.id.at.the issue involved the amount of tort damages.hurtado concluded that mexico had no interest in the application of its law limiting the amount of damages in a wrongful death action to the benefit of defendants who were not residents of mexico,so there was no true conflict and the measure of damages of california,as the forum state,should apply.id.at.
bernhard harrah club cal d,bernhard involved a collision in california between an automobile driven by a california resident and a motorcycle driven by the plaintiff,who was also a california resident.the automobile driver allegedly was intoxicated after drinking liquor served by the defendant at a gambling casino in nevada.id.at.the issue concerned the existence of tort liability.the allegations of the complaint supported negligence liability under california law,but did not support liability under nevada law.id.at.bernhard concluded that each state was interested in the application of its own law,so there was a true conflict,and that the true conflict should be resolved by a comparative impairment analysis.id.at.bernhard concluded that california interest in preventing the sale of alcoholic beverages to intoxicated persons whose intoxicated state is likely to contribute to injuries in california would be more significantly impaired than would nevada interest in protecting its tavern keepers from unlimited liability.id.at.the court therefore concluded that california law applied and that the complaint alleged facts sufficient to state a cause of action under california law.id.at.
offshore rental continental oil cal d,offshore rental was a negligence action arising from a personal injury suffered by an officer of the plaintiff corporation while on the defendant premises in louisiana.the plaintiff sought to recover damages for injuries to its business interests resulting from the loss of the officer services.id.at.the issue concerned the existence of tort liability.offshore rental assumed that california law,allowed a cause of action for negligent injury to a business employee,and concluded that louisiana law did not allow such a cause of action.offshore rental,supra,at.offshore rental noted that no california court had squarely held that the california statute supported such a cause of action,while a louisiana appellate court nine years earlier had held that louisiana law did not allow a cause of action by a corporate plaintiff for the loss of services of its officer.id.at.offshore rental characterized the california statute as unusual and outmoded and concluded that california interest in establishing liability under the statute was less strong than louisiana interest in the application of its prevalent and progressive law.id.at.the court therefore concluded that louisiana law applied and that the trial court dismissal of the cause of action was proper.id.at.

some federal courts have concluded or suggested that the governmental interest analysis has judicially supplanted the rule stated in civil code section or that the state of california law on this point is uncertain.the ninth circuit in strassberg new england mut.life ins.cir applied the governmental interest analysis to determine the law governing whether an insurance policy had lapsed due to nonpayment of insurance premiums.strassberg stated,california conflicts law has developed significantly since the original enactment of california civil code,and california law moved away from a mechanical choice of law process to employ the governmental interest analysis.id.at.later,in arno club med cir,the ninth circuit applied the governmental interest analysis to determine the law governing the existence of an implied in fact contract.arno stated that section would yield the same result and,t here appears to be some difference of opinion as to whether california choice of law rule for contracts is the governmental interest test or the test of.id.at fn.although section states a rule only as to contract interpretation,strassberg and arno,in making these statements,did not distinguish contract interpretation from other issues.
the sixth circuit in northland insurance guardsman products,cir applied the governmental interest analysis to determine the law governing the interpretation of an insurance policy,stating,the california supreme court has moved away from the mechanical application of and now employs what is commonly termed the governmental interest analysis approach to choice of law questions citation.id.at.similarly,vestrock partners california energy,civ.wl stated with regard to the governmental interest analysis,california courts normally employ the choice of law test in contracts cases notwithstanding.id.at see also reppy,choice of law problems arising when unmarried cohabitants change domicile,fn.stating,the california supreme court adoption of interest analysis had worked a judicial repeal of the choice of law rule in section.again,in making these statements,these authorities did not distinguish contract interpretation from other issues.
after reviewing all of these authorities,and in light of the fact that our supreme court has not addressed this issue,we are unable to conclude that california has judicially abrogated the express legislative mandate of civil code section relating to the interpretation of contracts.instead,we hold that the rule in civil code section determines the law governing the interpretation of a contract,notwithstanding the application of the governmental interest analysis to other issues the california supreme court has never applied the governmental interest analysis to determine the law governing the interpretation of a contract and has never stated or suggested that section does not determine the law governing the interpretation of a contract.broad statements declaring the governmental interest analysis california rule and rejecting traditional rules should be viewed in light of the particular issues that were before the court in those cases.
the opinions by the california courts of appeal cited by frontier and wainoco are not inconsistent with our conclusion that civil code section determines the law governing contract interpretation notwithstanding the application of the governmental interest analysis to other issues.robert mcmullan son,united states fid.guar.d.was a declaratory relief action against a liability insurer.the trial court determined that the insurer had a duty to defend an action against the insured,and the question on appeal was whether the insured was entitled to recover its attorney fees incurred in the declaratory relief action.applying the governmental interest analysis,the mcmullan court concluded that the laws of california and the other states involved did not differ on that question and that even if the laws differed,only california had an interest in applying its own laws to the dispute.id.at.the issue concerned the right to recover attorney fees in an action to enforce the insured rights under the policy and did not involve an issue of contract interpretation.
stonewall surplus lines ins.johnson controls,th,d stonewall was a declaratory relief action by excess liability insurers against their insured.the trial court concluded that the insurers were not required to indemnify the insured for a punitive damages award because california law,for reasons of public policy,prohibits indemnity for punitive damages.id.at,d.the question on appeal was whether the insurers could be required to indemnify the insured for punitive damages.applying the governmental interest analysis,the court of appeal concluded that the laws of california and wisconsin differed on that question and that california had a greater interest in applying its own laws to the dispute.id.at,d.in deciding that california law governed,stonewall placed particular importance on the location of the insured risk id.at,d,citing rest d conflict of laws,com.the issue concerned the existence of a right of indemnity for punitive damages and did not involve an issue of contract interpretation.

the liability insurance policy at issue in this case includes both indemnity and defense obligations.an indemnity obligation entails the payment of money in order to resolve liability.citations.buss superior court cal th,d,buss.a defense obligation,in contrast,entails the rendering of a service,the mounting and funding of a defense citations.ibid.an insurer performs its defense obligation by providing defense services through an attorney.if the insured risk involves operations at one or more fixed locations,as here,a third party complaint against the insured arising from those operations typically is prosecuted in the jurisdiction where the operations are located.the insurer provides defense services in the jurisdiction where the suit is prosecuted.there is little doubt that this was the understanding of the parties at the time they entered into the insurance contract in this case.
the policy provides general liability coverage and specifically refers to claims arising from oil and gas operations at in beverly hills,california.two policy endorsements name the city of beverly hills and the department of transportation of the city of los angeles as additional insureds with respect to claims arising out of oil or gas operations in the city of beverly hills,california.in another endorsement,rli waives its right of recovery against the city of beverly hills for certain payments made under the policy with respect to the same specified claims.these three endorsements clearly demonstrate that the parties intended the policy to provide coverage for the insureds oil and gas operations in beverly hills.accordingly,we conclude that the parties anticipated that a suit arising from those operations in beverly hills could be prosecuted in california and that rli would be obligated to provide a defense in california if the claims were potentially covered under the policy.
we therefore conclude that california was the intended place of performance of the contract with respect to those claims,that the policy thus indicate s a place of performance within the meaning of civil code section with respect to such claims,and that california law governs the interpretation of the policy.accordingly,we have no need to apply a governmental interest analysis or give consideration to texas law with respect to the interpretation of the policy.

an endorsement modifies the basic insuring forms of the policy and is an integral part of the policy adams explorer ins.th,d.standing alone,an endorsement means nothing.endorsements on an insurance policy form a part of the insurance contract citation,and the policy of insurance with the endorsements and riders thereon must be construed together as a whole citation.id.at,d.an endorsement can expand or restrict the coverage otherwise provided by the policy.if there is any conflict between an endorsement and the body of a policy,the endorsement controls,provided that any reduction in coverage reasonably expected under the body of a policy must be conspicuous,plain and clear.haynes farmers ins.exchange cal th,d.
the policy here expressly promises both indemnity and a defense.the insuring clause in the commercial general liability coverage form provides coverage for sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence,and states that rli has the right and duty to defend any suit seeking those damages.exclusion of in the same coverage form states that the insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage caused by the actual or threatened release of pollutants at premises owned,occupied,or used by the insured.the pollution liability endorsement deletes exclusion f and provides coverage for sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by a pollution incident.the endorsement does not mention the duty to defend,does not clearly and unmistakably exclude pollution claims from the duty to defend stated in the body of the policy,and therefore does not exclude pollution claims from the contractual duty to defend.
the insuring clause in the pollution endorsement provides coverage for damages arising from a pollution incident,which is defined in relevant part as a sudden and accidental release resulting in environmental damage.california courts interpret the phrase sudden and accidental when used in this context to mean abrupt in time,unexpected,and unintended.shell oil winterthur swiss ins.th,d.
interpreting the policy under california law,we conclude that rli promised to defend claims for damages arising from pollution incidents with respect to the oil and gas operations in beverly hills notwithstanding that the pollution liability endorsement does not mention a duty to defend.
the allegations of the third party complaints create a duty to defend 
a.the applicable rule 
the fundamental principles under california law regarding whether a duty to defend arises were established in gray zurich insurance cal d,gray.gray rejected the argument that an insurer had a duty to defend under the policy only if the insured was entitled to indemnity,and held that the duty to defend was independent of and broader than the duty to indemnify.id.at.gray stated that uncertainties concerning policy interpretation must be resolved in favor of the reasonable expectations of the insured,and that in light of the policy language,the insured reasonably would expect the insurer to defend a suit involving a loss of the nature and kind covered by the policy.ibid.gray therefore concluded that an insurer must defend a suit that potentially seeks damages covered by the policy.id.at.
gray seemed to state that these conclusions reflected the court interpretation of policy provisions,as distinguished from a rule of law imposed on the parties for public policy reasons regardless of their intentions upon entering into the insurance contract.gray,supra,cal d at.this suggests that the fundamental principals discussed above regarding whether a duty to defend arises are rules of law regarding policy interpretation and that civil code section determines the appropriate choice of law governing these issues.on the other hand,it was not necessary for the court in gray to decide whether these rules of law were rules of policy interpretation for purposes of section these rules could be characterized as public policy choices that do not necessarily reflect the actual or presumed intention of the parties.moreover,gray stated further that the duty to defend arises whenever the insurer ascertains facts that create a potential for liability under the policy,whether the insurer learns those facts from the complaint,the insured,or other sources,and did not explain that conclusion as a question of policy interpretation or refer to the reasonable expectations of the insured.gray,supra,at.we need not decide whether these or other rules regarding the duty to defend are rules of policy interpretation for purposes of section because our conclusion under either section or the governmental interest analysis is that california law governs,as we will explain 
b.the applicable rules of law of california and texas do not materially differ 
the first step in the governmental interest analysis is to determine whether the applicable rules of law of the potentially concerned jurisdictions materially differ.washington mutual,supra,cal th at,d.if there is no material difference,there is no problem and the court may proceed to apply california law.see id.at,d.the party arguing that foreign law governs has the burden to identify the applicable foreign law,show that it materially differs from california law,and show that the foreign law furthers an interest of the foreign state.id.at,d,bernhard,supra,cal d at.

texas law differs from california law in that under texas law,facts extrinsic to the complaint can not give rise to a duty to defend.guideone,supra,at heyden,supra,at.under california law,in contrast,extrinsic facts known to the insurer give rise to a duty to defend if the facts create a potential for coverage under the policy.scottsdale,supra,cal th at,d,gray,supra,cal d.because the complaints in the underlying actions allege facts that create a potential for coverage without regard to extrinsic evidence,as explained post,this difference between california law and the law of texas is not relevant here.apart from this distinction,the foregoing texas rules of law do not materially differ from california law,and no party has shown that any other texas rule of law applicable to these facts materially differs from california law.we therefore conclude that the applicable rules of law of california and texas are substantially identical with respect to a liability insurer duty to defend thus,even if the governmental interest analysis was the choice of law rule that we were to use to determine if a duty to defend ever arose,california law would be applied.washington mutual,supra,cal th at,d.
