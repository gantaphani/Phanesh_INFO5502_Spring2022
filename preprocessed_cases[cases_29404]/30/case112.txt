like the contaminated property that gave rise to it,the case before us demands careful handling.the pivotal question,heretofore untouched by any appellate court,is whether the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy code,a,prevents a state from simultaneously creating and perfecting an environmental superlien on a debtor property after the institution of a bankruptcy proceeding.both the bankruptcy court and the district court answered this surpassingly close question in the negative,holding that the environmental superlien evades the grasp of the automatic stay.we affirm.
background 
the debtor,main street limited partnership,owns a shopping plaza on main street in natick,massachusetts the property.for many years,a dry cleaning business leased space in the plaza.as a result,the property became profoundly contaminated with chemicals and other pollutants.in time,the massachusetts department of environmental protection the commonwealth concluded that contamination from the property posed a dire threat to drinking water in the town of natick.to avert this threat,the commonwealth spent large sums of money on emergency cleanup activities.it then sought reimbursement for these expenses,along with assurances in respect to anticipated future expenditures,from the debtor.moreover,the commonwealth informed the debtor,by letter dated november,that it intended to record a lien against the property to secure present and future cleanup costs.see.laws ch,the environmental superlien statute.
initially,the debtor denied responsibility for the contamination and contested the dollar amount that the commonwealth placed on cleanup costs.accordingly,it demanded an adjudicatory hearing.see.the hearing moved slowly.before it concluded,the debtor filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.by the debtor own admission,a principal reason behind this filing was a desire to avoid perfection of the commonwealth lien.to that extent,the maneuver failed the hearing officer ruled that the environmental superlien statute fell within an exception to the automatic stay and refused to adjourn the administrative proceeding.
the debtor countered by asking the bankruptcy court to hold the commonwealth in contempt for continuing to press forward in the postpetition period.the bankruptcy court refused the debtor request.when the debtor appealed,the district court followed suit,ruling that the automatic stay did not preclude continuation of the proceedings necessary to perfect the commonwealth environmental superlien.see in re main.dep t of envt l.this appeal ensued.because its resolution turns on questions of statutory interpretation,we exercise plenary review.see soares brockton credit union in re soares,cir.
ii.the statutes 
as this case perches at a crossroads formed by the intersection of federal and state law,we set out the pieces of the statutory puzzle before attempting to fit them together.we begin with familiar fare the automatic stay provision.
the automatic stay,a,is one of the fundamental protections afforded to debtors by the bankruptcy laws.midlantic bank dep t of envt l,d.it gives debtors breathing room by stopping collection efforts in their tracks and permitting their resumption only when the stay is lifted by the bankruptcy court or dissolved by operation of law.soares,at.to accomplish these objectives,the statute provides that the filing of a bankruptcy petition halts a wide variety of specified creditor activities.see a.this appeal does not require us to call the roll.it suffices for present purposes to note that the stay applies,inter alia,to any act to create,perfect,or enforce any lien against property of the estate.id.a.
while the automatic stay is an important part of the bankruptcy protection framework,it is not an absolute.congress has crafted certain exceptions to the automatic stay.see id.b.one of them,pertinent here,makes the automatic stay inapplicable to any act to perfect,or to maintain or continue the perfection of,an interest in property to the extent that the bankruptcy trustee rights and powers are subject to such perfection under section b of the bankruptcy code.id.b.the companion statute,b,limits the debtor powers to avoid statutory liens by providing that they are subject to any generally applicable law that permits perfection of an interest in property to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in such property before the date of perfection.id.b a.thus,sections b and b a,read together,plot the boundaries of the exception to the automatic stay which is at issue here.
to this point,we have been discussing relevant federal statutes.but this appeal also involves a state environmental superlien statute.laws ch,formally known as the massachusetts oil and hazardous material prevention act.the state legislature designed this statute to assure the prompt and efficient cleanup of hazardous materials acme laundry sec y of envt l affairs.it provides in pertinent part that once the commonwealth spends money assessing or cleaning up a polluted tract of land,it may place a priority lien on that property 
any liability to the commonwealth for cleanup costs shall constitute a debt to the commonwealth.any such debt shall constitute a lien on all property owned by persons liable under this chapter when a statement of claim naming such persons is recorded,registered or filed any lien recorded,registered or filed pursuant to this section shall have priority over any encumbrance theretofore recorded,registered or filed with respect to any site described in such statement of claim.
the question here is whether the environmental superlien fits within the exception described in sections b and b of the bankruptcy code.the debtor argues that the superlien falls outside the narrow boundaries of the exception and thus succumbs to the automatic stay.the commonwealth demurs,maintaining that its superlien comes within the safe harbor dredged by the exception and thus evades the automatic stay.in the pages that follow,we examine these dueling interpretations.
iii.the statutes in action 
eligibility for the pertinent exception to the automatic stay depends upon the existence vel non of three elements there must be an act to perfect an interest in property under circumstances in which the statute fits within the contours of section b a.we deal with the first two elements in part iii a,reserving the third for discussion in part iii b.
in parsing section b,we alter the natural progression because the question of what constitutes an interest in property is crucial to the resolution of the questions that section b and section b a contain an interest in property begin there.
interest in property.the threshold question is whether the commonwealth had a prepetition interest in the property although the parties are at loggerheads on a variety of issues,they are in perfect harmony on two important preliminary matters.first,the debtor acknowledges at this point in the proceedings that it was indebted to the commonwealth under chapter.this is as it should be,for massachusetts law makes it pellucid that once the commonwealth expends any funds in connection with the assessment or cleanup of a contaminated property,a debt is created.see acme laundry,at.second,it is beyond cavil that at the time the debtor sought the protection of the bankruptcy court,the commonwealth had not recorded a lien against the property.
these agreed facts bring us to the crucial question did the commonwealth have an interest in the property at the time the debtor filed its bankruptcy petition on that issue,the harmony dissipates.the debtor contends that section b interest in property requirement only can be satisfied by the existence,prepetition,of a lien and that,since no such lien was of record when the bankruptcy court jurisdiction attached,the commonwealth had no interest in the property and,therefore,can not qualify for the balm of section b.the commonwealth sings a different tune.it asserts that the term interest in property,as used in section b,is broader than the term lien and that it had a prepetition interest in the property arising out of a medley of factors,including its expenditures for cleanup,its right to record a superlien,its notice to the debtor that it intended to record such a lien,and its taking of all possible administrative steps toward recordation.
we conclude that the term interest in property is not synonymous with the term lien.in arriving at this conclusion,we look first to the plain language of section b.see boivin black,cir explaining that all statutory analysis must begin with the language of the particular statute sub judice.the language of an unambiguous statute normally determines its meaning.freytag commissioner,d state of narragansett indian tribe,cir.it follows inexorably that when a statute plain language points in a single direction,an inquiring court ordinarily should look no further.united states hilario,cir,cert.denied,d.these principles apply here.
congress is familiar with the word lien,and used that word frequently in drafting the bankruptcy code,a,a.it is an orthodox tenet of statutory construction that where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute,but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.duncan walker,d quoting bates united states,d.honoring this tenet,we ascribe considerable significance to the fact that section b uses the term interest in property rather than the term lien.giving congress word choices their full effect is an especially attractive option here.after all,the text of section b is straightforward and leads to a perfectly plausible result.that makes the case for plain meaning extremely compelling.see pritzker yari,cir as a fundamental principle of statutory construction,we will not depart from,or otherwise embellish,the language of a statute absent either undeniable textual ambiguity or some other extraordinary consideration,such as the prospect of yielding a patently absurd result.we therefore conclude that the term interest in property as used in section b is broader than the term lien.accord lincoln sav.bank suffolk county treasurer in re parr meadows racing ass n,cir finding that state interest in property dated from the assessment of real property taxes rather than from the recordation of a tax lien maryland bank mayor city council of baltimore in re maryland glass,cir concluding that state had an interest in real property,in the form of a right to require that sale proceeds be applied first to taxes due at the time of sale,notwithstanding absence of lien fitch jones lamson mach.in re jones lamson mach,finding that interest in property arose when employees performed services for the debtor rather than when lien was created.
in an effort to its narrow construction of the phrase interest in property,the debtor points out that the bankruptcy code defines a lien as an interest in property specifically,as an interest in property to secure payment of a debt or performance of an obligation.but the mere fact that a lien is one kind of interest in property does not mean that a lien is the only kind of interest in property recognized by section b.maryland glass,at finding that the term interest in property,as used in b,is not limited to liens.
finally,the debtor adverts to decisions that have equated an interest in property under section b with a lien,equibank,steel,cir equating interest in property with lien in context of real property taxes.withal,p roperty interests are created and defined by state law,butner united states,d,and these cases often turn on differences in state law,cs first boston mortgage capital rv centennial in re rv centennial,distinguishing case from similar bankruptcy cases based upon differences in state property law.the fact that interest in property and lien may be synonymous under the law of a particular state or under a particular state statute does not render the terms coextensive for purposes of the bankruptcy code.
that ends this phase of our inquiry.we hold that interest in property,as that term is used in b,is unequivalent to,and broader than,the term lien.with that definitional building block in place,we move to the question of whether,under massachusetts law,the commonwealth had an interest in the property.
the parties reasonably assume that,under the environmental superlien statute,a debt comes into being once the commonwealth has incurred expenses relating to the cleanup of a particular piece of property the debt ripens into a lien when recorded and recording the lien simultaneously perfects it.see.laws ch.but these reference points have limited utility for purposes of our inquiry after all,a section debt is not an interest in property,see in re microfab,and,as discussed above,the term lien can not be employed as a proxy for an interest in property.thus,we search for guidance beyond the four corners of the environmental superlien statute.
in acme laundry,the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc dealt extensively with the superlien statute.while the court did not directly answer the question before us,its discussion is quite helpful.for example,the sjc limned the statute central purpose to assure that the costs of environmental cleanup are borne by those who are responsible for the release because they own or owned the land or because they caused the spill.at.the importance that the legislature attaches to this goal is illustrated by the severe sanctions imposed on those who violate cleanup orders.see.laws ch,providing for civil penalties,fines,and imprisonment.the sjc also made clear that the liability created by the commonwealth expenditure of funds is,encompassing future costs and immediately triggering the right to record a lien.acme laundry,at.
in this case,the debtor was liable to the commonwealth for past and future cleanup costs the commonwealth had a present right to record a lien on the property and it had set that process in motion by notifying the debtor of its intentions and participating vigorously in the administrative hearing process.viewing these facts through the prism of acme laundry,we conclude,as did the district court,main,at,that this commonwealth expenditures,together with its notice of intent to record a lien and its tenacious pursuit of that lien through administrative to satisfy section b interest in property requirement.
we find support for this conclusion in the only reported case directly in point.in that case,in re perona,the district court considered the question of a state prepetition interest in property in the context of an environmental superlien and concluded that far less than what exists here was sufficient to establish such an interest.the court determined that new jersey obtained an interest in the debtor property on the date the state notified the debtor that it would place a superpriority lien on the property if it had to commence the cleanup of toxic waste.id.at.although the state only prepetition act was this totality of the state cleanup efforts occurred postpetition,id.at court found that solitary act sufficient to establish an interest in the property.id.if the facts of perona yielded an interest in property,then a fortiori,the facts of the instant case can yield no less.
act to perfect.we next turn to the act to perfect requirement of section b.when the commonwealth takes the step of recording under the environmental superlien statute,that act both creates and perfects its lien.see.laws ch.the debtor points out that while the automatic stay applies to any act to create,perfect,or enforce,a,section b only exempts acts to perfect based on this discrepancy,it concludes that an act which simultaneously creates and perfects can not qualify for an exception to the automatic stay under section b.
at first glance,there seems to be a deep division of authority on this bankruptcy courts permitting simultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of an interest in property pursuant to section b and others prohibiting such a step.but this is not the issue that actually divides those courts.instead,the courts split over the issue of what constitutes an interest in property,and that divergence drives the seeming disagreement over the status of creation plus perfection.in other words,courts that hew to the proposition that interest in property means lien do not allow simultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of liens,while courts tend to hold the opposite.
this dichotomy makes perfect sense.the availability of section b generally is thought to depend upon the existence of a prepetition interest in property.see collier on bankruptcy lawrence king,ed.section b does not authorize the creation of new rights or interests for the creditor.but supra note.if the particular interest is a lien,that lien must be in place prepetition before section b can come into play.an act that both creates and perfects a lien postpetition can not so qualify.see,louisville jefferson county metro.sewer dist.excel eng g,in re excel eng g,refusing to recognize validity of postpetition creation and perfection of mechanic lien because creditor had no lien at the time debtor filed for bankruptcy watervliet paper city of watervliet in re shoreham paper,finding postpetition creation and perfection of property tax lien barred by automatic stay because no prepetition interest existed equitable life assur.soc y ballentine in re ballentine,holding that creation of a postpetition tax levy based on a prepetition assessment was barred by the automatic stay north side lumber indus.indem.in re north side lumber.or,barring filing of statutory lien that simultaneously created and perfected an interest in property because lien did not exist at the time of the bankruptcy filing.
courts which recognize that there is no necessary congruence between an interest in property and a lien end up in a different place.such courts routinely read the section b exception to leave room for the simultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of liens based on prepetition interests in property.see,in re summit ventures,allowing postpetition creation and perfection of tax lien based on prepetition interest in form of tax assessment jones lamson,at permitting postpetition creation and perfection of mechanic lien where plaintiffs work for debtor constituted their prepetition interest in property see also parr meadows,at upholding,without discussion,the simultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of a tax lien for section b purposes where the county preexisting tax assessment constituted a prepetition interest in the property.
in our view,the plain language of section b suggests the answer to the question of whether the environmental superlien statute simultaneous model fits under the statutory umbrella.the statute provides in pertinent part that the automatic stay does not apply to any act to perfect an interest in property bearing in mind that interest in property is broader than lien,see supra part iii a,this language appears to cover the simultaneous creation and perfection of a lien based on a prepetition interest in property.an act that both creates and perfects in one fell swoop is an act to perfect.since section b says that the filing of a bankruptcy petition does not automatically stay an act to perfect,the simultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of a lien may come within the pertinent exception to the automatic stay so long as the creditor holds a valid prepetition interest in the property.
we buttress this conclusion with two practical observations.first,applying the debtor section b use of the unembellished word perfect means that an act of combined creation and perfection remains subject to the automatic lead to an absurd result.under the debtor theory,an act that effected the concurrent creation and perfection of a lien would,at one and the same time,be both stayed by section a and exempted from the stay by section a.we decline to indulge in so schizophrenic a reading of the bankruptcy code.
second,statutory liens often are created and perfected by the same act.congress clearly intended section b limitation on the debtor avoidance power to extend to statutory liens after all,section b specifically refers to section,which deals with the avoidance of statutory liens.since congress incorporated section b into the section b exception,it is logical to infer that congress intended that statutory liens would,at times,be exempt from the automatic stay.under the debtor interpretation,a significant class of statutory that are created and perfected by the same never be exempt from the automatic stay.it seems difficult to reconcile this outcome with congress discernible intent.
for these reasons,we conclude that the act of simultaneous creation and perfection effectuated by the massachusetts environmental superlien statute qualifies as an act to perfect under section b.
the bankruptcy code delineates the scope of a debtor power to avoid certain creditor initiatives.but this power is circumscribed in certain respects.insofar as it applies to statutory liens,this power can not be exercised to curtail any generally applicable law that permits perfection of an interest in property to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in such property before the date of perfection.b a.the purpose of section b is to protect,in spite of the surprise intervention of a bankruptcy petition,those whom state law protects by allowing them to perfect their liens or interests as of an effective date that is earlier than the date of perfection,at,reprinted in.for a particular creditor to reach the haven contemplated by section b a,three elements must coalesce the creditor must act pursuant to a law of general applicability that law must allow the creditor to perfect an interest in property and such perfection must be effective against previously acquired rights in the property.
the first of these elements requires little discussion.for a law to be generally applicable,it must apply to cases within and without the bankruptcy sphere.see makoroff city of lockport,cir.the debtor concedes that the environmental superlien statute here at issue.laws ch,satisfies this definition.the remaining two elements require more detailed elaboration.we consolidate our discussion of them.
the debtor asserts that the superlien statute does not permit perfection of an interest in property to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in such property before the date of perfection.b a.to support this assertion,it makes three claims that the commonwealth held no prepetition interest in the property that perfection here,the act of recording is a prerequisite to establishing priority,but no act of recordation ever occurred and that only state statutes that contain specific relation back language can come within the parameters of section b.we address these claims sequentially.
accepting for argument sake the debtor view that section b requires an interest in property which arises prepetition,we nonetheless find the debtor ipse dixit that the commonwealth had no prepetition interest in the property foreclosed by our earlier determination that the commonwealth in fact enjoyed such a prepetition interest.see supra part iii a.the debtor nimbly skips to another lack of a section lien on the property.to be sure,there is no such that fact does not support the conclusion that the debtor draws from it.the only reason that the commonwealth has not recorded a lien is that its efforts to convert its interest in the property into a lien have been stalled by the debtor demand for an adjudicative hearing.this circumstance does not preclude us from resolving the issue of whether the environmental superlien statute measures up to the specific requirements imposed by section b a.
last,the debtor suggests,citing a snippet plucked from section b legislative history,that a state statute must explicitly provide that perfection relate back to a prepetition date in order to fit within the safe harbor contemplated by section b a.there are three reasons why we find this suggestion unconvincing.the short response to it is that section b a enunciates no such requirement,and courts can not limit legislation by cavalierly conjuring up qualifications that the legislature has either eschewed or neglected to consider.see brogan united states,d united states sebaggala,cir.no
