at issue in this appeal is whether marine forests society marine forests qualifies for an award of attorney fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section hereafter section,which entitles a successful litigant to such an award when its lawsuit resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public and,among other things,a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons.even without a favorable judicial resolution,the plaintiff is considered a successful litigant for purposes of section if the lawsuit was the catalyst that caused the defendant to change its behavior substantially because of,and in the manner sought by,the litigation.graham daimlerchrysler cal th,d,hereafter graham.
but for this lawsuit filed by marine forests,the california coastal commission commission would be operating as it had since its creation.the authority of the senate committee on rules and the speaker of the assembly to not only appoint a majority of the commission voting members but also to replace them at will if they act in a manner disfavored by the appointing authority allowed the legislature to both declare the law and control the commission execution of the law and exercise of its functions.that contravened the separation of powers clause of california constitution.
because of this lawsuit,the legislature amended the governing statutes to cure the constitutional defect by providing that each of the commission members appointed by the senate committee on rules or the speaker of the assembly shall serve a term and can not be removed at the pleasure of the appointing authority.this action conferred a benefit on the general public by eliminating the potential that a decision of the commission affecting an important public right might be influenced by an appointment and removal process that was subject to making members of the commission subservient to members of the legislature.
however,while it was the impetus for change in the authority to appoint and remove members of the commission,the lawsuit did not achieve its objective to enjoin the commission from requiring marine forests to remove an experimental reef that it had planted on the ocean floor.indeed,the commission resisted marine forests attack on its action,and the judgment enjoining the commission from ordering marine forests to cease and desist from maintaining the reef was reversed by the california supreme court,which held that under the de facto officer doctrine,prior actions of the commission such as the cease and desist order in this case can not be set aside on the ground that the appointment of the commissioners who participated in the decision may be vulnerable to constitutional challenge.marine forests society california coastal com.cal th,d.
consequently,even though it was the catalyst that caused the legislature to change the appointment authority,the lawsuit did not cause the defendant the commission to substantially change its behavior because of,and in the manner sought by,the litigation.graham,supra,cal th at,d.thus,despite the fact that this lawsuit was the catalyst for a change in the law,the catalyst theory for a section attorney award does not apply because it was the legislature,not the commission,that changed its behavior as a result of this lawsuit.
to the extent it can be said that the rationale of the catalyst theory should apply to a lawsuit like this,which was the moving force resulting in a change in statutory law that conferred a significant benefit on the general public regarding important rights affecting the public,the argument must be made to the california supreme court because we are bound by the ruling in graham,supra,cal th at,d.auto equity sales,superior court cal d.
background 
this is the third appeal stemming from litigation between marine forests and the commission.
because of the separation of powers problem summarized above,we initially affirmed the trial court judgment that enjoined the commission from granting,denying,or conditioning permits,or from issuing cease and desist orders.marine forests society california coastal com.th,d hereafter marine forests i,review granted.
we then reversed the trial court award of trial attorney fees to marine forests based on a private attorney general theory.we did so because marine forests failed to demonstrate that the financial burden of bringing the litigation was out of proportion to its individual stake in the is one of the three criteria necessary for the entitlement to attorney fees pursuant to section.marine forests society california coastal commission,wl nonpub.opn.hereafter marine forests ii.
in this third appeal,the commission challenges the trial court order awarding marine forests its appellate attorney fees.marine forests cross appeals,contending the trial court erred in ruling that law of the case precluded an award of trial fees and abused its discretion when it failed to apply a larger multiplier in awarding appellate attorney fees.as we will explain,marine forests is not entitled to attorney fees because it is not the prevailing party in that the california supreme court reversed the judgment in favor of marine forests marine forests society california coastal,supra,cal th,d,and it is not a successful party under the catalyst theory for attorney fees pursuant to section.thus,we shall reverse the order awarding appellate attorney fees.because marine forests was not entitled to attorney fees,its cross appeal fails.
the commission is the state coastal zone planning and management agency with primary responsibility for implementing the provisions of the california coastal act of.pub.resources code.it has voting members,with the governor,the speaker of the assembly and the senate committee on rules each selecting members.pub.resources code,subds.d,e.
marine forests is a nonprofit corporation whose purpose is the development of experimental research programs for the creation of marine forests to replace lost marine habitat.to promote this objective,it planted an experimental marine forest on a sandy plain ocean near newport harbor in orange county,california.the marine forest was made of various materials,including used tires,plastic jugs,and concrete blocks.
when the commission commenced cease and desist proceedings regarding the experimental reef,marine forests filed a lawsuit.among other things,marine forests claimed that because members of the commission served terms at the pleasure of their appointing authority former pub.resources code,the commission should be enjoined from issuing cease and desist orders or from granting or denying permits for coastal development because the scheme for appointment of its voting members gave the legislative branch control over the commission,thereby impermissibly interfering with the commission executive branch responsibility to execute the laws.the trial court ruled in favor of marine forests but stayed its decision pending the commission appeal.
in marine forests i,we concluded that the commission interpretation and implementation of the california coastal act is an executive function and that the appointment structure giving the senate committee on rules and the speaker of the assembly the power to appoint the majority of the commission voting members and to remove them at will contravened the separation of powers clause of california constitution.this was so because that power allowed the legislative branch to not only declare the law,but also to control the commission execution of the law and exercise of its powers.accordingly,we affirmed the trial court judgment in favor of marine forests.marine forests i,supra,th,d,review granted.
the commission then appealed from the trial court order awarding section attorney fees to marine forests.the commission argued that marine forests failed to establish a necessary criterion for such an award,namely that the financial burden of litigation was outweighed by its personal stake in the matter.according to the commission,marine forests had a strong personal and pecuniary motive to pursue the requested relief because its primary objective was to prevent the commission from ordering it to remove its artificial reef,which would have been very costly,or to pay penalties of up to a day if it failed to remove the artificial reef.pub.resources code,subd.a.this purpose was shown by the fact that,aside from its separation of powers contention,marine forests alleged other causes of action,including a claim that the coastal act precluded the commission staff from acting on substantive coastal issues,the cease and desist order would constitute an unconstitutional taking of private property,the commission failure to prepare an environmental impact report violated the california environmental quality act ceqa,and the issuance of a cease and desist order would violate marine forests civil rights.
in marine forests ii,we reversed the attorney fee award for the following reason the construction and maintenance of artificial reefs is marine forests main reason for being.its inability to obtain necessary permits from the commission for the construction of such reefs,and the impending removal of its existing artificial reef at the direction of the commission,threatened its very existence.thus,it raised every conceivable theory,including the separation of powers argument,to prevent this from occurring.its action in effect invalidated the commission issuance of the cease and desist order against marine forests on the ground that the commission,due to the statutory method for the appointment of its voting members,lacked the authority to issue such an order.although the trial court decision resolved a constitutional issue involving the separation of powers doctrine,the public interest in this outcome was incidental to marine forests primary objective of preventing the commission from ordering it to remove its artificial reef or to pay monetary penalties for its failure to do so.section is intended as a bounty for pursuing public interest litigation,not a reward for litigants motivated by their own interests who coincidentally serve the public.citations.the record showed that although marine forests also litigated the separation of powers issue,an award of public interest attorney fees was not necessary to encourage marine forests to do so.rather,it litigated the issue for its own pecuniary benefit,with incidental benefit to the public.in other words,marine forests individual stake in the litigation would have been sufficient in its own right to have motivated its participation in the litigation.citation.as the party moving for attorney fees under section,marine forests had the burden to prove that it met the relevant criteria for an award of such fees.citations.however,even after the commission raised the issue in the trial court,marine forests failed to address the manner in which the financial burden of pursuing the litigation outweighed its personal stake in maintaining its artificial reef and avoiding penalties.therefore,attorney fees were unwarranted because marine forests did not meet its burden of establishing the necessary criteria.marine forests ii,supra.
the california supreme court then granted the commission petition for review in marine forests i concerning the separation of powers issue.marine forests society california coastal,supra,cal th,d,hereafter marine forests iii.and in response to marine forests i,the legislature amended public resources code section hereafter section to eliminate the provision concerning the ability of the speaker of the assembly and the senate committee on rules to remove their appointees to the commission at will.now such appointments are for a set term 
in marine forests iii,the supreme court held injunctive relief was not warranted because the current statutory provisions governing the composition of the commission do not violate the separation of powers clause of the california constitution.marine forests iii,supra,cal th at,d.the court then concluded that even if the statutory scheme had violated the separation of powers clause,the commission actions prior to the statutory amendment were valid because of the de facto officer doctrine.id.at,d.where officers act under color of appointment as provided by an unconstitutional public law,but act before the law is adjudged unconstitutional,their actions are deemed valid even if a challenge to their actions is timely raised in an administrative or judicial proceeding contesting the validity of an official action.id.at,d.a principal purpose of the de facto officer doctrine is to prevent the crippling of an officer or commission operations that would occur if this type of claim could be raised in any proceeding challenging an individual action taken by the officer or commission.marine forests iii,supra,cal th at,d.hence,the circumstance that the statutory provisions governing the appointment and tenure of the members of the commission who acted upon a particular matter might be vulnerable to constitutional challenge provides no independent basis for overturning the action taken by the commission.marine forests iii,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,the supreme court reversed our decision affirming the trial court judgment granting injunctive relief.id.at,d.
after the remittitur was filed in the trial court,marine forests renewed in the trial court its motion for attorney fees,asserting that even though it did not obtain a favorable judgment,it is entitled to attorney fees under a catalyst theory of recovery because its action triggered a legislative change in the manner of appointment of commission members,thereby bestowing a significant benefit upon the public.to fill the evidentiary void left in the earlier proceedings as to whether the financial burden of bringing the litigation was out of proportion to its individual stake in the matter,marine forests provided estimates indicating that it would cost to have volunteers remove the artificial reef over a period of approximately six months,or cost to have a contractor remove the reef over four days,whereas marine forests had incurred in attorney fees in pursuing the litigation.this,marine forests argued,demonstrated that the financial burden of private enforcement outweighed its personal gain.
the commission opposed the attorney fee motion,contending that the doctrine of law of the case precluded an award and asserting that marine forests was not entitled to fees because it was not the successful party and had not achieved its litigation objectives.
ruling the doctrine of law of the case barred only an award of trial attorney fees,not appellate attorney fees,the trial court found the lawsuit triggered,and was a catalyst for,the amendment of a statute that violated the california constitution,which showed marine forests had achieved a significant goal of its litigation even if it did not obtain a favorable judgment.the court further found that the resulting legislative amendment also satisfied the first and second requirement of section,the vindication of an important right affecting the public interest,which conferred a significant benefit on the general public.in addition,the court found that the financial burden of litigation was out of proportion to marine forests individual stake in the matter because the cost of removing the reef was outweighed by the cost of litigation.applying a multiplier of,the court awarded marine forests attorney fees of.
discussion 
the commission argues the doctrine of law of the case precludes an award of appellate attorney fees.marine forests counters that not only are appellate attorney fees appropriate,the trial court erred in ruling that trial attorney fees are barred by law of the case.
we need not address these contentions because regardless of whether the doctrine of law of the case applies,the commission alternate appellate contention has merit and bars an award of fees.the commission correctly asserts that an attorney fee award is not warranted because marine forests is no longer the prevailing party and it failed to establish it is entitled to fees under the catalyst theory.
section provides a court may award attorneys fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted
