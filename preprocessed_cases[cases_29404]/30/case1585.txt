a.the endangered species act 
the supreme court explained in tennessee valley authority hill,d tva,that in passing the esa congress intended to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction.in keeping with this mandate,section a a of the esa makes it unlawful for any person including a federal agency to import an endangered or threatened species into the united states.a a.the esa provides that its provisions shall be enforced by the secretary of the interior who has designated enforcement responsibility to the fish wildlife service the secretary of commerce who has designated enforcement responsibility to national marine fisheries service the secretary of the treasury who has designated enforcement responsibility to customs and border protection and the coast guard.see e any person authorized by the secretary,the secretary of the treasury,or the secretary of the department in which the coast guard is operating,to enforce this chapter may detain for inspection and inspect any package,crate,or other container upon importation or exportation such person so authorized may search and seize,with or without a warrant,as authorized by law.
in addition,the esa provides additional constraints on all federal agencies.section a mandates 
each federal agency shall,in consultation with and with the assistance of the secretary of commerce or the interior,insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency hereinafter in this section referred to as an agency action is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species.
a.section a imposes a substantive and not just procedural statutory requirement.ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d.as the supreme court explained in tva,section compels agencies not only to consider the effect of their projects on endangered species,but to take such actions as are necessary to insure that species are not extirpated as the result of federal activities.tva,at.emphasis in original 
salmon and steelhead importation 
included in the species that have been designated endangered or threatened are populations of west coast salmon and steelhead the salmon.c.customs and fish wildlife officials are stationed at the ports of entry into the united states and are tasked with enforcing the importation ban on the salmon.see g all import shipments of fish and wildlife subject to the regulations or permit requirements of the fish and wildlife service,published pursuant to the endangered species act of,shall be subject to examination or inspection by that agency officer serving the port of entry,for determination as to permissible release or such other disposition as he may direct.
despite these regulations,the complaint,which at this stage in the proceedings we must accept as true,alleges that n either the customs and border protection,the fish wildlife service,nor marine fisheries enforce the esa prohibition against the import into the united states of salmon caught in canada.compl.see also appellants br.whether by conscious policy or neglect,neither customs nor fish wildlife make any effort to implement the prohibition on imports of threatened salmon.in addition,neither customs nor fish wildlife has consulted with marine fisheries,pursuant to section of the esa regarding their lack of enforcement of the prohibition against importing salmon from canada into the united states.compl.
procedural history 
plaintiffs are organizations dedicated to the protection of wild fishes,included the salmon.they initially brought suit in the district court of the western district of washington,under the citizen suit provisions of the esa and the administrative procedure act apa.salmon spawning recovery alliance spero,no,dist.lexis,wl.may,salmon spawning i.their complaint alleged by allowing continued import of salmon and steelhead in violation of of esa,the defendants are jeopardizing the continued existence of the listed salmon and steelhead in violation of a,compl.the section claim and that it is arbitrary and capricious and not in accordance with law,in violation of the administrative procedure act and a violation of section of the esa,for the customs and border protection and fish wildlife service to continue to allow the import into the united states of salmon caught in canada without having completed the consultations required by section of the esa,compl.the section claim.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.salmon spawning i,at.they argued that the court of international trade had exclusive jurisdiction over the section claim under i because the claim arises out of a law providing for embargoes or other quantitative restrictions on the importation of merchandise,and that accordingly,the court of international trade could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the section claim the district court agreed and transferred the case to the court of international trade so that the court of international trade may determine its own jurisdiction,including whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the section claim.id.at.
the court of international trade did not reach the issue of whether it was the proper forum to adjudicate salmon spawning claims.rather,it dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the grounds that no federal court had jurisdiction over the claims.the court found that it was without jurisdiction over the plaintiffs section claim because the exercise of the agency enforcement powers lie solely within the agency discretion.salmon spawning ii,d at citing heckler chaney,d.furthermore,the trial court concluded that plaintiffs had no standing to bring their section claim.
plaintiffs appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.see bender williamsport area sch,d explaining that a federal appellate court always has jurisdiction to determine whether the lower federal court had jurisdiction.
jurisdiction over the section claim 
the district court and the court of international trade both interpreted the plaintiffs first claim as stating a violation of section of the esa.plaintiffs now argue that the courts below were in error because the claim alleged a violation of the substantive provisions of section a,not of section.the language of the complaint is ambiguous.see compl.by allowing the continuing import of salmon and steelhead in violation of section of the esa,the defendants are jeopardizing the continued existence of the listed salmon and steelhead in violation of a.however,the plaintiffs themselves left no doubt that they initially intended to raise a claim under section.in their opposition to defendants motion to dismiss in the district court,plaintiffs argued that plaintiffs allegation that defendants are allowing the import of listed salmon,thereby introducing the listed salmon into the united states,is sufficient to state a claim for violation of esa,citing as support of their complaint.plaintiffs opposition to defendants motion to dismiss complaint,salmon spawning spero,no,at,wl.march,see also id.at plaintiffs have alleged that defendants allow the continued import of salmon.complaint.this participation directly violates esa section a a.given that the trial court interpretation of plaintiffs complaint is consistent with plaintiffs own initial representations as to the meaning of the claim,we find no basis for reversing the court of international trade interpretation.
to the extent that salmon spawning has brought a cause of action alleging that defendants have violated section by allowing the importation of salmon,the district court properly dismissed the claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in substance the claim alleges that the defendants have violated section prohibition on the importation of endangered species by failing to enforce the ban.the supreme court recognized in heckler chaney,d,that an agency decision not to prosecute or enforce,whether through civil or criminal process,is a decision generally committed to an agency absolute discretion.id.at.accordingly,an agency decision not to undertake enforcement actions is presumptively unreviewable under the apa.id.at.see a precluding judicial review under the apa when agency action is committed to agency discretion by law interstate commerce comm of locomotive eng rs,d explaining that the unavailability of judicial review to the extent that agency action is committed to agency discretion by law is a limitation to the general grant of jurisdiction contained in.this presumption of unreviewability has not been rebutted here.see heckler,at.t he presumption may be rebutted where the substantive statute has provided guidelines for the agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers.rather,the statute makes clear the discretionary nature of the defendants enforcement powers stating only that officers may detain for inspection and inspect any package,crate,or other container,including its contents,and all accompanying documents,upon importation may make arrests and may search and seize.e emphasis added accordingly,plaintiffs section claim is not justiciable under the apa.
nor do the citizen suit provisions of the esa provide jurisdiction.section g a of the esa gives any person the right to bring suit to enjoin any person,including the united states and any other governmental instrumentality or agency who is alleged to be in violation of any provision of this act or regulation issued under the authority thereof.g a.as we have previously explained,this provision offers no independent jurisdiction to challenge a federal agency implementation of the act.earth island inst.albright,citing bennett spear,d.the supreme court has explained that the esa authorization in section g a of suits to enjoin an agency who is alleged to be in violation of any provision of the act can not be read to apply to challenges to the implementation or enforcement of the esa.bennett,at.affirming that section g a is a means by which private parties may enforce the substantive provisions of the esa against regulated private entities and government is not an alternative avenue for judicial review of the secretary implementation of the statute 
we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of the first claim of the plaintiffs complaint.
jurisdiction over the section a claim 
plaintiffs second claim alleges that defendants violated the apa and section of the esa by allowing the importation of salmon without completing the consultation required by section.in other words,this count of the complaint alleges a procedural violation of section a.the district court dismissed the claim for lack of standing.
to establish standing under article iii of the constitution,a plaintiff must show that it suffered an that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant and likely redressable by a favorable judicial decision.figueroa united states,citing daimlerchrysler cuno,d see also lujan defenders of wildlife,d 
the court of international trade held that plaintiffs section claim did not satisfy the redressability prong of the standing analysis.the trial court concluded that there was no obligation under section for the federal defendants to consult regarding their decision not to enforce the endangered salmon ban because the consultation requirement is only triggered by affirmative action,not a failure to act.accordingly,the court reasoned that any injury suffered by the plaintiffs was not capable of being redressed.in reaching this result,the trial court misinterpreted the redressibility prong of the standing analysis.standing requires that the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d emphasis added.a favorable decision in the current case would be a holding that defendants do have an obligation to consult under section regarding their failure to enforce the endangered salmon import ban.rather than focus on whether such a favorable decision would likely provide plaintiffs redress,the trial court mistakenly reasoned that there would not be a favorable result and thus salmon spawning would not be entitled to any relief.this is not an issue of standing but rather a question on the merits.see litecubes,llc light,subject matter jurisdiction does not fail simply because the plaintiff might be unable to ultimately succeed on the merits.citing steel citizens for better env t,d 
under a proper analysis,the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the elements of standing to preclude dismissing the case for lack of standing based on the pleadings plaintiffs have alleged,inter alia,that their members frequent the habitat areas of salmon for recreation and attempt to observe the endangered salmon spawning.compl.the supreme court has recognized that injury to such interests can form the basis for an.see lujan,at.t he desire to use or observe an animal species,even for purely esthetic purposes,is undeniably a cognizable interest for purpose of standing.animal legal def.fund quigg,the interests alleged to have been injured may reflect aesthetic,conservational,and recreational as well as economic values.quoting sierra club morton,d.plaintiffs allege that the aesthetic,recreational,and environmental interests of their members are being adversely affected and irreparably injured by defendants failure to prevent the importation of endangered salmon because this failure has jeopardized the continued existence of the listed salmon compl.at this early stage in the proceedings,this allegation is sufficient to establish an fairly traceable to defendants.
moreover,plaintiffs section claim is attempting to enforce a procedural right.such rights can be asserted without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy,as long as the procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of the plaintiff that is the ultimate basis of his standing.lujan,at.thus,we agree with the ninth circuit that to establish standing by alleging procedural harm,the members must show only that they have a procedural right that,if exercised,could protect their concrete interests and that those interests fall within the zone of interests protected by the statute at issue.defenders of wildlife envtl.prot.agency,cir emphasis in original,overruled on other grounds sub nom.ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d.the consultation requirements of section are designed to make certain that every federal agency takes whatever actions are necessary to ensure the survival of each endangered and threatened species.sierra club glickman,cir citing tva,at.see also tva,at.t he legislative history undergirding reveals an explicit congressional decision to require agencies to afford first priority to the declared national policy of saving endangered species.thus,because consultation could require the defendants to more actively enforce the import ban,consultation could protect the plaintiffs interests in the survival of the salmon,and it is precisely this interest which the procedure was designed to protect.in such a situation,a claim alleging a violation of the procedural requirements of section a satisfies the redressability prong of standing.see defenders of wildlife,at concluding that the standing requirements for procedural harm were met in a section claim because the use of improper section consultation lessens the likelihood that the impact of the proposed action on listed species and their habitats will be recognized and accounted for in making the transfer decision glickman,at finding plaintiffs had standing to bring a procedural claim under section a because the procedures in question were designed to protect sierra club threatened concrete interest in this case.we,therefore,conclude that the trial court improperly dismissed the case for lack of standing.bennett,at.holding that plaintiffs who have economic and other interests in water from the klamath irrigation project had standing to bring a claim under the apa alleging that a biological opinion issued by the fish wildlife service regarding the klamath project violated section of the esa 
because the court of international trade dismissed the case for lack of standing,it never considered whether plaintiffs section claim fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of international trade.nor did the district court for the western district of washington ever evaluate whether the court of international trade had independent jurisdiction over section claims.rather,the district court found that the court of international trade would have discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the section claim on the basis of the section claim.
because supplemental jurisdiction can not be exercised when a court does not have original jurisdiction over at least one claim in the suit,a i n any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.see arbaugh y h,d w hen a federal court concludes that it lacks jurisdiction,the court must dismiss the complaint in its entirety in contrast,when a court grants a motion to dismiss for failure to state a federal claim,the court generally retains discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction,pursuant to,and because we affirm the court of international trade dismissal of the section claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,we need not consider and,therefore,do not decide whether the court of international trade could have properly exercised supplemental jurisdiction over salmon spawning section claim under a 
instead,for the court of international trade to have jurisdiction over the current action,plaintiffs section claim must fall within the court exclusive jurisdiction under.there are two possible sources of court of international trade jurisdiction for the claim i,which provides the court of international trade with exclusive jurisdiction over civil actions that arise out of any law of the united states providing for embargoes or other quantitative restrictions on the importation of merchandise for reasons other than the protection of the public health or safety and i,which provides the court of international trade with exclusive jurisdiction over civil actions arising from administration and enforcement with respect to the matters referred to in i.see sakar int l united states,s ection i as it relates to section i provides the court of international trade with jurisdiction over cases that arise out of any law providing for the administration and enforcement of an embargo.
while an appellate court has inherent jurisdiction to determine whether a lower tribunal had jurisdiction,int l custom prods.united states,it also has discretion to remand issues,even jurisdictional ones,to the trial court when that court has not had the opportunity to consider the issue in the first instance.see united food commercial workers union,local centermark props.meriden square,cir remanding the issue of federal question jurisdiction to the district court for consideration in the first instance and noting that this course of action was particularly appropriate when the district court never considered the issue and the issue has been given a somewhat cursory and confused treatment on appeal mitchell food,united states,because the court of international trade did not definitively resolve the standing and real party in interest objections,we vacate and remand for a determination of these issues in the first instance.cohen world omni fin,cir w e remand the case to the district court to consider its subject matter jurisdiction.tagayun lever stolzenberg,cir we will vacate the order of dismissal and remand with instructions to the district court to consider in the first instance whether it had subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction to consider appellants claims.chen ashcroft,cir when confronted with a novel legal issue,we could decide the case based on application of law to the facts.however,we believe the better course in this case is to remand to the agency for its consideration of the issue in the first instance.
the issue of whether plaintiffs section claim falls within the court of international trade exclusive jurisdiction,or instead should be brought in a district court,is one of first impression for this court and it raises difficult,novel issues concerning the scope of the court of international trade jurisdiction.the parties have not briefed the issue neither the district court nor the court of international trade addressed the issue in the instant case,and it does not appear that the court of international trade has ever had the opportunity to consider such an issue in prior cases.under these circumstances,we believe that the better course of action is to remand the case to the court of international trade to determine in the first instance whether the section claim falls within its exclusive jurisdiction.in making this determination,the court will need to consider whether the suit arises out of any law of the united states providing for embargoes or other quantitative restrictions on the importation of merchandise or for the administration and enforcement with respect to such embargoes under i,and also whether there is a conflict between i and section of the esa which vests jurisdiction over citizen suits brought pursuant to the esa with the district courts.g the district courts shall have jurisdiction,without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties,to enforce any such provision or regulation,or to order the secretary to perform such act or duty,as the case may be.
if the court of international trade determines that the section claim does not fall within its jurisdiction,it should transfer the case back to the district court for the western district of washington.if it concludes that it does have jurisdiction over the claim,it should proceed with further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
for the foregoing reasons,the court of international trade dismissal of plaintiffs section claim is affirmed.the court dismissal of the section claim for lack of standing is reversed,and the case is remanded to the court of international trade to determine whether the surviving claim falls within its exclusive jurisdiction.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded.
