section of the emergency planning and community act epcra or the act,stat,is captioned toxic chemical release forms.the act calls for the creation of a toxic release inventory list tri.epa acknowledged in the district court that congress intended that the tri would contain only toxic chemicals.epa memorandum in support of for summary judgment at june,epa summary judgment memorandum internal quotation marks omitted.congress used the phrase toxic chemical times in.a naïve observer might think that the section sole subject is toxic chemicals.he would be right.a naïve observer might also think it obvious that that was so.he would be wrong.
in,the american chemical council petitioned epa to delete methyl ethyl ketone mek from the tri,see methyl ethyl ketone toxic chemical release reporting community,march,mek petition denial,arguing principally that mek is not a toxic chemical as that term is used in the act.joint appendix.epa denied the petition,mek petition denial.at,and the court below granted epa motion for summary judgment,holding that the decision not to delist mek was reasonable,based on a permissible construction of the statute,and neither arbitrary nor capricious.see american chemistry council whitman,d.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.huls america browner.because we find epa decision is based on an impermissible construction of the statute,we vacate the decision of the district court and remand so that the district court can direct epa to delist mek.
mek is a clear,colorless,highly volatile,and highly flammable liquid.mek petition denial.at.a highly effective solvent,it is released in the united states in substantial nearly million pounds released into the air in,and another and pounds into water and onto land,respectively.see id.at.although mek can cause chronic developmental toxicity at moderately high to high doses,id.at,it has low acute and chronic systemic toxicity in that effects occur only at high doses,id.at.mek was on the initial tri list of chemicals and chemical categories specified by congress,see c,which had consolidated two state lists of hazardous chemicals,see.
the emergency protection and community act was intended to provide communities with information on potential chemical hazards within their boundaries and to facilitate awareness and planning for accidental releases.see huls america,at citing,pt.at.the act establishes state emergency response commissions and local emergency planning committees,and requires certain facilities that manufacture,process,or use chemicals on the tri to provide an estimate of the amount of the chemical present at the facility and the annual quantity of the chemical entering the environment.see g see also reports required for listed chemical if a facility uses at least pounds or manufactures or possesses at least pounds annually.such facilities report this information to epa,which then makes the information available to the public.h,j.
the act provides for listing if 
a the chemical is known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects at concentration levels that are reasonably likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries as a result of continuous,or frequently recurring,releases.
b the chemical is known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause in humans 
i cancer or teratogenic effects,or 
ii serious or irreversible 
i reproductive dysfunctions,
ii neurological disorders,
iii heritable genetic mutations,or 
iv other chronic health effects.
c the chemical is known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause,because of 
i its toxicity,
ii its toxicity and persistence in the environment,or 
iii its toxicity and tendency to bioaccumulate in the environment,
a significant adverse effect on the environment of sufficient seriousness,in the judgment of the administrator,to warrant reporting under this section.
any person may petition the administrator to delete a chemical from the list,see e,and the administrator may delete a chemical if there is sufficient evidence to establish any of the statutory criteria,d.although e mentions only subsections a and b of d,the parties apparently agree that it allows petitions to delist a chemical that fails to satisfy subsection c,and we assume that to be the case for present purposes.
in its petition to epa,the council argued that mek does satisfy any of the three listing criteria,and epa agreed as to the acute human health effects criterion of d a.but epa found that mek did meet the chronic health effects requirement of d b,and the significant adverse effect on the environment requirement of d c.in doing so epa rested entirely on the proposition that mek,as a volatile organic chemical voc,contribute s to the formation of tropospheric ozone,which is known to cause significant adverse effects to human health and the environment.see mek petition denial.at see also appellees br.at epa decision was expressly based on mek role as a precursor to ozone.
there is no dispute here either that ozone itself is a toxic chemical under the criteria of d,or that mek to some degree contributes to the creation of ozone.see.june.that leaves the issue before this contribution to the creation of a concededly toxic chemical is adequate to support listing on the tri.
the council principal contention is that the tri is only intended to include toxic chemicals,meaning chemicals that cause harm through exposure to the chemical.see appellant br.at.epa responds that,properly interpreted,d provides for listing chemicals that result in harm not by exposure to the listed chemical,but by exposure to some downstream chemical that the listed chemical in some way fosters.in the context of d b,epa speaks of indirect causation and indirect effects.for d c,epa speaks of indirect toxicity.but these are all linguistic variants on the same theme,rejecting the idea that the act is confined to toxic chemicals in the ordinary sense of the term.
with respect to d b,the chronic health effects criterion,epa first suggests that the statute does not require that the listed chemical be toxic at all.rather,epa insists the section permits the listing of any chemical that is known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause serious chronic health effects,as epa interprets that phrase.epa views the phrase cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause as ambiguous,and interprets it to incorporate indirect effects.it claims deference for this interpretation under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.before reaching the question of what notion of causation is permissible,however,we must address whether there is a prerequisite that a chemical be toxic,and if so,what that term means.
the agency attempts to make something of the fact that the term toxicity appears explicitly in d c,but not in d b.see appellees br.at.it is true of course,that when congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the separate inclusion or exclusion.barnhart sigmon coal,d quoting russello united states,d troy browner.but that principle has little purchase when,as here,the overall scope of a statute is clearly limited by a requirement that is not explicitly mentioned in every subsection.the basic question is whether the overall text,structure,and purpose of the statute allow epa to list chemicals.see rifle ass of america reno.the answer is that they do not.
the term toxicity or toxic chemical is used times in the statute,and while the frequency of usage says nothing about the term content,it does strongly suggest that the toxics release inventory is intended to include chemicals and chemical compounds that are,in fact,toxic.moreover,while epa sometimes suggests that the only requirement for listing under d b is that the chemical cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause the stated harm,see mek petition denial.at,there is at least some question whether epa actually subscribes to this view.even in this case epa observed that congress intended that the tri would contain only toxic chemicals
