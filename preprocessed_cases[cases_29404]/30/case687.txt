wildearth guardians,montanans for quiet recreation,and friends of the bitterroot,collectively,wildearth,challenge the united states forest service decision to designate over two million acres of public land in the beaverhead deerlodge national forest forest for use by winter motorized vehicles,principally snowmobiles.wildearth alleges that the forest service review of the environmental impacts of snowmobiles under the national environmental policy act nepa was inadequate in several material respects.wildearth also alleges that the forest service failed to comply with the minimization requirements of executive order.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
at,the forest is the largest national forest in the state of montana.the island mountain ranges within the forest provide a variety of habitats spanning from cold desert to alpine peaks.over terrestrial land species live in the forest,including grizzly bears,wolves,wolverines,lynx,and a broad variety of big game species,such as mule deer,deer,black bear,moose,elk,bighorn sheep,mountain goat,and antelope.the forest is also nationally renowned as a recreation destination.recreational opportunities include activities such as fishing,hunting,hiking,skiing,and mountain biking,as well as motorized activities,including motorcycle riding and snowmobiling.
in,the forest service issued a notice of intent to revise the land and resource management plan forest plan for the forest pursuant to the national forest management act.may.the purpose of a forest plan is to guide decisions regarding natural resource management and other activity over a period of ten to fifteen years.because a forest plan may have a significant impact on the environment,nepa requires the forest service to prepare an environmental impact statement.
in january,after considering various alternative plans,the regional forester signed and released a record of decision rod approving the environmental impact eis and adopting the beaverhead deerlodge revised forest plan revised forest plan or revised plan.the revised plan,which adopts modified alternative six,covers eight revision topics,including recreation and travel management,which governs snowmobile access within the forest.the revised forest plan divides the forest into twelve different landscape areas,which are,in turn,divided into multiple management areas.in,the forest service issued a second rod rod implementing the travel management decisions in the revised plan.
at issue in this case is the designation in the revised forest plan of over two million acres,or,of the forest for snowmobile use.as compared to prior forest plans the revised plan decreased the area open to snowmobiles.the revision,however,will not necessarily result in a reduction of snowmobile impacts.there has been a sharp increase in snowmobile use since the,and advances in technology allow snowmobiles to reach altitudes and terrain not previously accessible.
the regional forester acknowledged in the rod that the unmanaged expansion of motorized uses,including snowmobiles,has resulted in resource damage,wildlife impacts,and competition and conflict between user groups.snowmobiles affect wildlife in part because they stress animals and provoke a flight response during the winter season,when the animals are particularly vulnerable to depletion of their energy reserves.because some species avoid all motorized vehicles,snowmobiles can effectively reduce the amount of available habitat.there is also evidence that snowmobiles can disturb reproduction cycles of wildlife species such as the wolverine.in addition to disturbing wildlife,snowmobiles can interfere with winter recreation activities because of the noise and pollution they generate.
wildearth and other groups filed a number of administrative appeals challenging the eis and rod.in october,the reviewing officer for the forest service consolidated and rejected the appeals.wildearth subsequently filed suit in the united states district court for the district of montana.relevant to this appeal,wildearth alleged that the forest service violated nepa because it failed to analyze adequately the impacts of snowmobile use on big game winter habitat and conflicting recreational uses the forest service violated executive order,and executive order.may,because it failed to apply specified criteria when designating areas open to snowmobile use and,subpart c of the travel management rule tmr,which exempts vehicles osvs from compliance with the minimization criteria in executive order and,is invalid.the montana snowmobile association and the idaho state snowmobile association intervened as defendants.
the parties filed for summary judgment,which the district court granted in part,and denied in part.wildlands cpr,forest,d.the court concluded that,although the forest service environmental analysis of snowmobile impacts on wildlife lack ed clarity,the analysis was nevertheless adequate given the deference afforded to agencies by the administrative procedure act apa,and nepa.id.at.turning to executive order,the court concluded that the forest service met the order requirements in designating the general areas to close to snowmobile use,but not in making designations at the level.id.at.finally,the court ruled that wildearth challenge to the exemption for vehicles in subpart c of the tmr was not ripe because the forest service did not rely on subpart c to justify its actions under the revised forest plan.id.at.

wildearth raises two nepa arguments first,that the forest service did not adequately analyze the impact of snowmobile use on big game wildlife,and second,that the forest service analysis of conflicts between snowmobiles and other recreational uses was insufficient.we examine these arguments in order.
impact of snowmobile use on big game wildlife 
as required by nepa,the eis is structured around alternatives that provide varying degrees of protection for big game wildlife by managing vehicle access see c iii.in the wildlife habitat section of the eis,table compares the alternatives in terms of the percentage of big game winter range closed to snowmobiles throughout the forest and in each landscape area.in the same section,table compares the open road density for wildlife in each alternative.in addition to this quantitative data,the eis includes for each alternative a short qualitative discussion of the effects that snowmobiles would have on wildlife habitat,particularly the big game winter range.
wildearth argues that the eis fails to comply with nepa procedural requirements because it does not identify the location of the winter range for big game animals establish where snowmobiles impact that range and discuss what options are available to avoid the concomitant impacts.we agree.the information provided in the eis meets neither the public disclosure purpose of nepa nor the specific requirements in the ceq regulations.
the ceq regulations state that,to comply with nepa,an agency must insure that environmental information is available to public officials and citizens before decisions are made and before actions are taken.the information must be of high quality.accurate scientific analysis,expert agency comments,and public scrutiny are essential to implementing nepa.b.to fulfill nepa public disclosure requirements,the agency must provide to the public the underlying environmental data from which the forest service develops its opinions and arrives at its decisions.see idaho sporting cong.thomas,cir,overruled on other grounds by lands council mcnair,cir en banc.alternately,the agency may incorporate publicly available data underlying the eis by reference.see jones marine fisheries,cir.to incorporate underlying data by reference,the agency must cite the source in the eis and briefly describe the content.a source may be incorporated by reference only if it is reasonably available for inspection by potentially interested persons within the time allowed for comment.see also requiring the agency to make explicit reference by footnote to the scientific and other sources relied upon for conclusions in the eis.
here,the wildlife habitat section of the eis lists the percentage of big game winter range protected in each landscape area,but provides virtually no information about where the big game winter range is actually located,nor the concentration of game in each area.in other words,the eis does not make public the underlying environmental data,nor specifically reference any documentary source that the forest service relied upon in making its determinations on snowmobile access.see idaho sporting,at.
the forest service points to several parts of the eis to argue that it provided or referenced data adequately for the public to assess snowmobile impacts on the big game winter range.however,none are sufficient to satisfy nepa requirements.
first,the forest service refers to a wolverine habitat prediction map in the eis.this map uses the big game winter range as an indicator of wolverine habitat because wolverines depend on big game carrion for food.notably,the map is contained in an appendix that discusses impact on wolverine denning habitat,not big game.the eis does not mention that the wolverine habitat map identifies the big game winter range.nor does the eis explain anywhere that the wolverine habitat prediction map serves as a proxy for a map of the big game winter range.an interested person,without more,would not be able to discern that a map entitled wolverine habitat prediction provides the baseline data for the tables depicting the big game winter range in the eis.see.and even if someone did manage to make this connection,that would be enough to access the forest service baseline data,as the forest service concedes that this map does not accurately depict the big game winter range.the forest service states that it remedied this error by using updated maps provided by montana fish,wildlife parks mfwp in its final analysis.but those maps are neither included,nor referenced,in the eis.to take the required hard look at a proposed project effects,an agency may not rely on incorrect assumptions or data in an eis.native ecosystems council forest,cir citing b.it surely follows that the data the forest service provides to the public to substantiate its analysis and conclusions must also be accurate.if the wolverine habitat prediction map does not accurately depict the big game winter range,and the forest service ultimately worked from a different,accurate map,then it is the accurate map that must be disclosed to the public 
second,the forest service states that the information wildearth demands in the form of a map was otherwise provided in the tables and accompanying qualitative discussion in the eis.as wildearth acknowledges,the forest service was not required to present the data in any particular format.see ecology ctr.castaneda,cir we defer to an agency choice of format for scientific data.the issue,however,is one of substance,not format.without data on the location of the big game winter range,the public was severely limited in its ability to participate in the process.
for instance,mfwp comments show why geography matters.it submitted extensive comments to the forest service on the impact snowmobile use would have on moose,one of the big game species,in several specific management areas within the boulder river landscape.one comment states that m oose occur commonly throughout the boulder river sheepshead management area and their needs should be specifically addressed,including the importance of not approaching or stressing them during the winter i t is apparent that snowmobiles are driving through willow communities,likely reducing moose forage.there is virtually nothing in the eis responsive to the mfwp comments.
the forest service maintains that it nonetheless did adequately discuss impacts on moose.in support,the forest service refers only to table in the eis,showing the percentage of big game winter range closed to snowmobiles,and a statement that winter allocations are designed to protect low elevation winter range for deer,elk,and moose.this paltry information does not allow the public to determine where the range for moose is located,whether the areas open to snowmobile use will affect that range,or whether the forest service considered alternatives that would avoid adverse impacts on moose and other big game wildlife.in other words,the eis does not provide the information necessary to determine how specific land should be allocated to protect particular habitat important to the moose and other big game wildlife.because the forest service did not make the relevant information available,methow valley citizens council,at,the public was limited to advocacy interested persons could argue only for the allocation of more or less land for snowmobile use,but not for the protection of particular areas.as a result,the forest service effectively stymied the public ability to challenge agency action.ecology,at.
third,the forest service argues that it adequately considered impacts on big game wildlife because it acknowledged that motorized winter recreation can adversely affect wildlife by causing them to move away when demands on their energy reserves are highest,and provided illustrative data.this data is contained in table of the eis showing the comparative probability that elk and mule deer would take flight from vehicles,bicycle riders,horse riders,and hikers passing by at different distances.there is no basis for concluding that this table provides probative evidence of how big game wildlife would respond to snowmobiles in winter.
the study from which table is drawn is specific to mule,deer,and elk,not to big game species generally.michael wisdom,et,effects of off road recreation on mule deer and elk,transactions of the north american wildlife and natural resource conference.further,the study measures flight response to vehicles,not snowmobiles.id.at.and,notably,the study measures flight response in spring,summer,and fall,but not winter.there is no discussion in the eis,nor the study itself,whether this information is probative of how big game,generally,would respond to snowmobiles in winter.id.nor is there any acknowledgment or explanation in the eis of the absence of data on snowmobile disturbance of specific species.see establishing that if data is incomplete or unavailable,then the agency shall always make clear that such information is lacking.
we have stated that nepa emphasizes the importance of coherent and comprehensive environmental analysis to ensure informed decisionmaking to the end that the agency will not act on incomplete information,only to regret its decision after it is too late to correct.blue mountains biodiversity project blackwood,cir quoting marsh or.natural res.council,d.here,the forest service asks us to assume the adequacy and accuracy of partial data without providing any basis for doing so.nepa requires more.
in sum,we conclude that the eis does not provide the public adequate access to information about the impact of snowmobiles on big game wildlife and habitat.the information included in and referenced by the eis therefore does not allow the public to play a role in both the decisionmaking process and the implementation of that decision.see methow valley citizens council,at.we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to the forest service on this issue.
conflicts between snowmobiles and other recreational uses 
wildearth next argues that the forest service violated nepa because it did not adequately address how the snowmobile allocations in the revised plan affect other winter recreational activities,such as skiing and snowshoeing.we disagree and affirm the district court ruling on this issue.
under the multiple use sustained yield act musya,the forest service must administer national forests in a manner that balances different uses and interests.in allocating land for different uses,the forest service was bound by this mandate.see e.as the rod explains,d ecisions about the type and location of public recreation access are among the most difficult for land managers because of the delicate balance between competing public values and natural resource protection.
the revised forest plan accomplishes this delicate task by creating five categories of recreational opportunities areas emphasizing motorized recreation areas where motorized use is permitted in winter,but not in summer areas where only use is allowed,providing for quiet recreation backcountry areas with a wide mix of motorized and designations and designated wilderness areas where motorized use and as well as mountain biking are prohibited.although snowmobile use is permitted in roughly of the forest,of the forest is open to at least some winter recreation activities.the forest service explained in the eis that it allocated recreational opportunities to meet different user expectation s and to create logical areas where recreational settings could effectively be managed.
wildearth argument that the forest service did not adequately review the consequences of its recreation allotments is not supported in the record.the eis includes a section devoted to recreation and travel management,which covers both summer and winter recreation activities.this section addresses the results of a survey estimating visitation levels and the type of recreation in which visitors engaged discusses application of the recreation opportunity spectrum,a method used to categorize,evaluate,and monitor settings and opportunities based on the natural,managerial,and social environment presents a discussion of recreation trends and presents an extensive comparison of recreational opportunities at the landscape level under each alternative.the rod and eis illustrate that the forest service collected information and,based on that information,adopted guidelines that it applied in its process.the forest service made that information available to the public so that interested persons could effectively participate in the process.see methow valley citizens council,at.
wildearth specifically complains about the forest service allocation decisions in the jefferson management area.the rod notes that management of snowmobile use will be difficult in this area because there is not an effective topographical barrier to illegal motorized entry into areas.as we understand wildearth argument,the mere possibility of illegal motorized entry triggered a responsibility under nepa to address in the eis the possibility of.nepa,however,does not require that the forest service affirmatively address in an eis every uncertainty.lands council,at.here,the forest service aimed to balance recreational uses,acknowledged that the effectiveness of its decision relies upon voluntary compliance,created monitoring protocols for the area,and stated that it plans to its decision if noncompliance occurs.
in sum,the forest service provided sufficient information to establish that it took a hard look at the impacts of snowmobile use on recreation in these particular management areas and throughout the revised plan area.see earth island,at.
we next turn to wildearth argument that the forest service failed to comply with the minimization requirements in executive order in,president richard nixon issued executive order,directing agencies to promulgate regulations that require that all areas and trails allowing vehicles orvs on public lands be located in areas that 
minimize damage to soil,watershed,vegetation,or other resources of the public lands minimize harassment of wildlife or significant disruption of wildlife habitats and,minimize conflicts between vehicle use and other existing or proposed recreational uses of the same or neighboring public lands,and to ensure the compatibility of such uses with existing conditions in populated areas,taking into account noise and other factors.
exec.order.
before,the forest service permitted each national forest,or other administrative unit,to designate areas and trails open to orv use on an ad hoc basis.see repealed george cameron coggins robert glicksman,pub.nat.resources ed.recognizing that a sharp increase in orv use,coupled with advances in orv power,range,and capabilities,had made it impossible to fulfill the intent of executive orders and without taking a more active approach to regulation,final rule travel management designated routes and areas for motor vehicle use,the secretary of promulgated the travel management rule tmr to improve implementation of the executive orders and establish a national system of roads,trails,and areas with restricted orv use.the relevant section of the tmr requires that,
in designating national forest system trails and areas on national forest system lands,the responsible official shall consider effects on the following,with the objective of minimizing damage to soil,watershed,vegetation,and other forest resources harassment of wildlife and significant disruption of wildlife habitats conflicts between motor vehicle use and existing or proposed recreational uses of national forest system lands or neighboring federal lands.
b,b minimization criteria.
notably,wildearth does not frame its argument under the tmr,but rather challenges the forest service implementation of executive order.wildlands,d at.where the forest service has placed restrictions or prohibitions on snowmobile use within a forest plan area,as it has here,the forest service must comply with the tmr,including the section implementing the criteria in executive order.c thus,by challenging the forest service implementation of executive order minimization criteria,wildearth is necessarily challenging the implementation of the tmr.
the district court concluded that executive order could be enforced through a private right of action.we need not address that issue,however,because we construe wildearth claim as seeking to enforce the tmr.under the administrative procedure act,an aggrieved person may challenge an agency implementation of its own regulation,see,gifford pinchot task force fish wildlife,cir.
the forest service argues that its analysis of snowmobile allocations in the eis satisfied the tmr specifically,the forest service cites to generalized statements in the eis that it designed snowmobile allocations to protect low elevation winter range for deer,elk,and moose to protect high elevation secure habitat for mountain goat and wolverine and to provide quiet winter recreation opportunities in locations people can drive to as evidence that it considered the minimi
