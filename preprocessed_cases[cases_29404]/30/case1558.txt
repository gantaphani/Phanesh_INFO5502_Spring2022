on march,the exxon valdez supertanker struck bligh reef in prince william sound,dumping nearly eleven million gallons of oil into alaska coastal ecosystem.congress responded with the oil pollution act of opa or act,stat.the act not only broadened federal liability for oil spills,it also established substantive tanker design and evaluation requirements to prevent such spills from occurring in the first place.the oil pollution act of is now more than old,but the coast guard,the enforcing agency,still has failed to promulgate regulations required by the act.citing the agency failures on this score,petitioners bluewater network and ocean advocates now seek a writ of mandamus to compel the coast guard to finally make good on congress commitments.
one of the contested statutory provisions the coast guard,by august,to promulgate regulations establishing minimum compliance standards and use requirements for tank level and pressure monitoring tlpm devices.no such regulations currently exist.furthermore,the coast guard admits that it will not undertake any rulemaking in the future,citing a temporary rulemaking that expired in.the coast guard earlier temporary compliance standards are of no moment.petitioners claim here,with which we agree,is that the agency failure to pursue rulemaking once the temporary regulations expired was a blatant violation of the statute.the coast guard never stated in its regulation that,after sunset,it would simply abandon altogether.indeed,this does not even appear to be a viable option under the statute.moreover,the coast guard has never even attempted to promulgate equipment use requirements.it can not now point to an admittedly incomplete,and,rule to avoid a congressional mandate to establish some sort of regulations.
the second contested provision c requires the coast guard,by february,to initiate issuance of regulations to define waters,including prince william sound and two other named areas,over which tankers must be escorted by at least two towing vessels.citing an earlier rulemaking in which it promulgated regulations concerning the three named areas,the coast guard asserts that petitioners should have brought their mandamus claims regarding regulation of other waters in a petition for review of the earlier rulemaking.however,as with,petitioners are not challenging the earlier rulemaking and the coast guard gave interested parties no reason to believe that the earlier regulations covering c would be the final word on the matter.nonetheless,we do agree with the coast guard that c does not create a sufficiently clear duty regarding other waters to merit mandamus relief.in particular,it is not at all obvious whether c actually forces the coast guard itself to come up with the names of,and instigate rulemaking regarding,possible other waters.petitioners are certainly free to petition the agency for rulemaking when and if they alight on candidates for inclusion.
on the record at hand,we grant in part and deny in part petitioners mandamus request and order the coast guard to conduct prompt rulemaking pursuant to of the act.
background 
a.the oil pollution act of 
the opa consists of nine distinct titles,two of i and the bulk of the act provisions.title i,oil pollution compensation and liability,contains extensive new provisions regarding the liability of parties responsible for an oil spill.see,stat.at codified as amended at.included among these provisions is,which grants this court exclusive jurisdiction to review challenges to any regulation promulgated under the act.section also imposes a jurisdictional time limit within which challenges to regulations must be brought.see a,stat.at codified at a.title iv,prevention and removal,for the most part amends existing statutory provisions,in many cases instructing the secretary of transportation,including the coast guard,to promulgate regulations for ensuring the prevention of oil spills.see,stat.at codified in scattered sections of.two such preventative provisions are at issue in this case.
the first,consists of two parts.see,stat.at codified at note.section a requires that the coast guard,no later than one year after enactment of the opa,establish regulations setting minimum standards for tlpm devices.see a,stat.at.such devices would continually monitor the volume of oil contained in a tanker hull and alert the crew to recognizable drops in the oil level,thereby signalling a potential leak.section b mandates that the coast guard,also no later than one year after enactment of the opa,issue regulations establishing the use by oil cargo ships of tank level and pressure monitoring devices,which are referred to in subsection a and which meet the standards established by the secretary under subsection a.b,stat.at.the coast guard has interpreted b to apply only to single,and not double,hulled tankers.see b.petitioners do not challenge that interpretation here.
section c,the second provision at issue here,requires that,not later than months after enactment of the opa,the secretary shall initiate issuance of regulations to define those areas,including prince william sound,alaska,and rosario strait and puget sound,washington including those portions of the strait of juan de fuca east of port angeles,haro strait,and the strait of georgia subject to united states jurisdiction,on which single hulled tankers over gross tons transporting oil in bulk shall be escorted by at least two towing vessels.c,stat.at codified at note emphasis added.thus,the act names three areas specifically for which the coast guard must issue regulations.
rulemaking and regulatory history of the two provisions 
petitioners filed the present mandamus petition in december,seeking to compel the coast guard to comply with its obligations under both and c of the opa.if the coast guard had simply disregarded both of the provisions,deciding instead to delay indefinitely any rulemaking under either section,this would be a straightforward case of unreasonable delay.what makes this case somewhat unusual,albeit not difficult,is the fact that the coast guard has episodically engaged in some rulemaking,and promulgated some regulations,pursuant to each of the provisions at issue.in order to put this case in proper perspective,we must first outline the curious history of agency actions purportedly taken pursuant to and.
and tank level or pressure monitoring devices 
approximately three months before the deadline,the coast guard issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comments and suggestions regarding possible proposed rules for complying with a and b.see.may.the coast guard also commissioned a technical feasibility study of existing tlpm devices,released in early,which confirmed that,as of,existing level detectors were not sufficiently sensitive to detect leakage before a large discharge occurr ed.notice of availability of technical feasibility study.the study found that attainable accuracy is expected to be within of the actual level.id.concerned that a to percent error margin,which translates to between and gallons of oil for a ton tanker,would provide insufficient warning to allow prompt action by the crew,the coast guard called for a public hearing to augment comments to the original advanced notice.see notice of public meeting.
in its august notice of proposed rulemaking,the coast guard limited its proposed rule to the establishment of standards for tlpm devices pursuant to a,leaving questions of installation and use of compliant devices,pursuant to b,for another day.see.the coast guard proposed that a leak detection device must sound an alarm before the contents of the tank decline to a level of percent below the level at which the tank was loaded,or at the loss of gallons of cargo,whichever is less.id.at.it chose this exacting standard,despite the technical feasibility study,because a loss of or more gallons in virtually all environments poses appreciable risk to the marine environment.id.the coast guard acknowledged that currently available devices may not meet the proposed standards for meaningful leak detection however,establishing the standards may lead to development of devices which will provide appropriate leak detection.id.
in march,nearly six years after the statutory deadline,the coast guard adopted the proposed standards in the form of a temporary rule,effective for two years beginning april.see,march,to be codified at.the rule did not require installation or use of tlpm devices unless and until a compliant technology had been invented and the appropriate b rulemaking undertaken.see c.in establishing the short sunset,the coast guard cited its belief that unless a tank level or pressure monitoring device is developed within years from the effective date of the temporary rule,it may not be economically feasible to require installation of such a device considering phaseout schedules.at.all vessels will be phased out of operation by the year.see.
the temporary regulations did,in fact,sunset on april.in november of that year,the coast guard gave notice of completed action in the tlpm rulemaking because current technology can not create a device that can meet reasonable expectations,the temporary rule was allowed to expire,and no further action is required.if the coast guard ever receives information about a device that is accurate enough to meet the standard,the rulemaking will be reinitiated.thus,there are currently no regulations in place under either of two provisions.moreover,the coast guard never even attempted rulemaking pursuant b.
c escorts for certain tankers 
nearly two years after passage of the opa,the coast guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking.see.july.the proposed rule contemplated applying the requirement only to those three areas specifically mentioned in c,prince william sound,rosario strait,and puget sound.see id.at proposed july,to be codified at pt.the coast guard did,however,invite comments regarding other waters to which the requirement might be extended the coast guard may require two escorts in other territorial waters of the united states.this notice does not propose additional areas.any additional areas proposed will be included in a notice of proposed rulemaking and the public will be afforded an opportunity to comment.id.at.in the alternative,the coast guard suggested that it would consider other waters towing and escort requirements pursuant to the ports and waterways safety act of,as amended by the port and tanker safety act of,under which t he coast guard has significantly broader authority.id.at.
the coast guard issued a final rule in august of.see pt.the final rule did not expand coverage beyond the areas.in response to comments nominating additional waters besides those named,the coast guard stated simply that such comments will be considered in the separate other waters rulemaking project.see final rule,emphasis added.the separate other waters rulemaking project presumably referred to an ongoing effort,initiated in,to establish other waters escort requirements pursuant to the.see advanced notice of proposed rulemaking.april.the coast guard had chosen the route,rather than c rigid two escort minimum,because section c provides no authority to require the use of escort vessels for ships other than laden,oil tankers over gt.in contrast,the pwsa has no such limitations.request for comments.to date,the coast guard has not promulgated final other waters escort requirements.it has since reiterated,however,that e xtending escort requirements beyond the opa mandated areas is discretionary.advanced notice of proposed pwsa rulemaking.
ii.jurisdiction 
the instant litigation presents two distinct jurisdictional issues,one general and one specific to this case.citing the supreme court recent decision in united states locke,d,petitioners now suggest that a grant of exclusive jurisdiction to this court might apply only to actions challenging regulations promulgated pursuant to title i,and not title iv,of the opa.as such,this court would not have original jurisdiction to hear petitioners mandamus claims.see telecommunications research and action,hereinafter trac.for its part,the coast guard argues that a does apply,but that petitioners could have,and therefore should have,brought their mandamus claims as separate petitions for review of the earlier and c rulemakings.that being the case,the coast guard claims,petitioners can not now circumvent a jurisdictional time limit for filing challenges to final agency action.
petitioners are wrong in their suggestion that this court does not have exclusive jurisdiction over this case pursuant to.and the coast guard is wrong in its contention that petitioners claims are untimely.
scope of this court exclusive jurisdiction under the opa 
where a statute commits final agency action to review by this court,we also retain exclusive jurisdiction to hear suits seeking relief that might affect our future statutory power of review.trac,at.this includes mandamus actions challenging an agency unreasonable delay.id.we must therefore determine whether the opa vests this court with jurisdiction in the first instance to hear challenges to regulations,like those at issue here,promulgated pursuant to title iv of the act.
section a of the opa states review of any regulation promulgated under this act may be had upon application by any interested person only in the circuit court of appeals of the united states for the district of columbia.a,stat.at emphasis added.on its face,the term this act would seem to suggest broad application of the review provision to all titles of the opa.petitioners,however,point to a possible complication.the supreme court earlier this year held that savings provision immediately following in title i of the only to the effect of provisions like those contained in title i,and not those contained in the remainder of the act.see locke,at.at.petitioners argue that,in so holding,the supreme court interpreted this act,as used in,to refer only to title i of the opa.why,they ask,should it be interpreted more broadly in the context of a petitioners fundamentally misunderstand both the holding and reasoning of locke.
locke involved a claim that various federal oil cargo statutes,including the opa,the state of washington rules governing tanker vessel manning,operation,and design.the court of appeals had held that of the opa effectively saved all state tanker provisions from its,and the other statutes,reach.section reads in pertinent part 
a preservation of state authorities nothing in this act or the act of march,shall 
affect,or be construed or interpreted as preempting,the authority of any state or political subdivision thereof from imposing any additional liability or requirements with respect to 
a the discharge of oil or other pollution by oil within such state or 
b any removal activities in connection with such a discharge 
c additional requirements and liabilities penalties.nothing in this act shall in any way affect,or be construed to affect,the authority of the united states or any state or political subdivision thereof 
to impose additional liability or additional requirements or 
to impose,or to determine the amount of,any fine or penalty whether criminal or civil in nature for any violation of law 
relating to the discharge,or substantial threat of a discharge,of oil.
stat.at codified at emphasis added.relying in large part on congress placement of the provision in title i,the supreme court held that congress intended these savings clauses only to preserve state laws of a scope similar to the matters contained in title i of opa.locke,at.at.the court conclusion was fortified by c use of the phrase relating to the discharge,or substantial threat of discharge,of oil,for congress had used these same key words in declaring the scope of title id.citing a,which codified a,stat.at.in other words,congress intended to save from only those state laws having to do with liability and compensation regarding an oil spill.because the state provisions at issue dealt with tanker manning,operation,and design,rather than liability and compensation,the court concluded that they were subject to.id.at.at.
at no point in its analysis did the court profess to interpret the phrase this act or suggest that it was limited to title i of the opa.at no point did the court hold
