we again consider the fate of the threatened northern spotted owl,this time in the context of a lumber thinning and fuel reduction project in northern california,known as the beaverslide project.conservation congress contends that the federal government violated various national environmental laws in failing to consult adequately as to the project potential effects on the owl the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the government,and we affirm.
the beaverslide project is located on approximately acres of national forest land in trinity county,california.according to the united states forest service,the project two main purposes are to protect against the current risk of wildfires due to the dense forest,and to provide a sustainable,timber supply to local communities.the project calls for commercial thinning of trees,reduction of fuels,and the creation of fuel corridors,among other treatments.
the northern spotted owl is a nocturnal predator that occupies forest land stretching from southwest british columbia through washington,oregon,and california.the owl has been listed as a threatened species under the endangered species act,et,since,and many populations of the owl continue to decline.recognizing the threat to the owl,the united states fish and wildlife service issued a recovery plan,as well as a revised recovery plan,providing recommendations and suggesting actions to aid in protecting the northern spotted owl.recovery plans are prepared in accordance with section f of the endangered species act for all endangered and threatened species,and while they provide guidance for the conservation of those species,they are not binding authorities.friends of blackwater salazar.
the forest service and the fish and wildlife service consulted on the project potential effects on the northern spotted owl.both the endangered species act and the national environmental policy act nepa,et,establish frameworks for consultations.
the endangered species act is a comprehensive scheme with the broad purpose of protecting endangered and threatened species.ctr.for biological diversity bureau of land,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.particularly relevant here is section a of the endangered species act,which governs the consultations that must take place between agencies.a.the endangered species act imposes both substantive and procedural duties on agency consultation.forest guardians johanns,cir.substantively,agencies contemplating certain kinds of federal action are required to insure that the action they take is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat of an endangered or threatened species.conservation cong.forest,cir alteration in original quoting a.agencies must consult with either the fish and wildlife service for species or the national marine fisheries service for marine species to determine the likely effects of their proposed actions on endangered or threatened species.id.
according to the implementing regulations,the first step in the consultation process is for the acting agency to independently determine whether its actions may affect an endangered or threatened species or that species habitat.a.if so,the agency must initiate either informal or formal consultation with the consulting agency.san luis delta mendota water auth.jewell,cir see also.informal consultation is an optional process that includes all discussions,correspondence,between the two agencies and is designed to assist the federal agency in determining whether formal consultation or a conference is required.a.if upon completion of informal consultation,the two agencies agree in writing that the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect any endangered or threatened species,no further action is necessary.conservation,at see also a,b.however,if either agency determines that the proposed action is likely to adversely affect a listed species or habitat,formal consultation is required.see.formal consultation entails the consulting agency preparing a biological opinion stating whether the proposed action,taken together with cumulative effects,is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.g.

foremost among these procedural requirements is that agencies considering major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment are required to prepare an environmental impact statement eis.c see also watersheds project kraayenbrink,cir.the eis shall provide full and fair discussion of significant environmental impacts and shall inform decisionmakers and the public of the reasonable alternatives which would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment.
to comply with the endangered species act,the forest service issued a biological assessment in september,which independently analyzed the beaverslide project and concluded that the project may but was not likely to adversely affect the northern spotted owl.in october,the fish and wildlife service agreed with the forest service conclusion in a letter of concurrence.
in may,the forest service issued an amendment to its biological assessment,responding to anticipated changes in the forest service supplemental environmental impact statement,discussed further below.the forest service determination that the project may affect but was not likely to adversely affect the owl remained unchanged.in september,the fish and wildlife service again agreed with this determination in a technical assistance letter.by this time,the fish and wildlife service recovery plan was available,and the technical assistance letter also concluded that the beaverslide project was consistent with the plan recommendations.all other consultation prior to the letter the revised plan.
in may,conservation congress sent a notice of intent to sue under the endangered species act provision to the agencies,as required by g.it submitted a second notice in october,after the recovery plan was published.the second notice alleged that the forest service biological assessment,its amendment,and the fish and wildlife service concurrence letters no longer used the best scientific and commercial data available,and cited to information contained in the recovery plan.in response to these notices of intent,the forest service and the fish and wildlife service consulted and exchanged letters,both of which concluded that reinitiating further consultation in light of the recovery plan was not necessary.
after litigation in this case had commenced,the agencies informed us that they conducted one final round of consultation on the beaverslide project.in december,the fish and wildlife service issued a rule revising the designation of critical habitat for the northern spotted owl.in response,the forest service issued a new assessment in march,analyzing how the change in the owl critical habitat designation affected the project.it again concluded that the project was not likely to adversely affect the owl.the fish and wildlife service also separately prepared a biological opinion in response to its new rule,and concluded that the project would not result in destruction or adverse modification of the owl habitat.
concurrent with its consultation under the endangered species act,the
