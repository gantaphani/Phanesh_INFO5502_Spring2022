on page,of the slip opinion,the phrase lacking force of law,is deleted,and the word interpretations is capitalized.after sip.and before interpretations the following text and footnote is inserted this statement makes it clear that the sip reach extends only to those it directly regulates and does not have force of law constituting binding precedent for future sip revisions.

on page at of the slip opinion,the following footnote number is added at the end of part ii a after advocating this interpretation the present case is distinguishable from exxon mobil epa,cir,in two significant respects.first,our decision in exxon predated the supreme court decision in mead to the extent that the analyses differ,mead controls.second,the present case is distinguishable from exxon.in exxon,the epa had issued a final rule carefully explaining its interpretation of section m of the clean air act.at.here,by contrast,the epa has never undertaken to explain its interpretation of section l of the clean air act,affording us no basis to understand the epa reasoning or to assess its exegesis of the statutory text.
in this pro se petition for review,robert hall raises procedural and substantive challenges to the environmental protection agency epa approval of a revision to the air quality plan adopted by clark county,nevada which modifies existing rules for new stationary sources seeking permits to emit pollutants in clark county.the most significant issue that hall raises is whether the epa adequately assessed clark county prospects,under its revised air quality plan,of meeting the clean air act caa or act requirements concerning attainment of air quality standards.the statutory basis for this claim is the act requirement that the epa determine whether air quality plan revisions will interfere with attainment requirements.see caa l,l.
although we reject hall procedural challenges,we conclude that the epa interpretation of its review responsibility under l is not consistent with the act.the epa argues that,so long as a revision to an air quality plan does not relax existing pollution control measures,there necessarily will be no interference with attainment requirements.the epa concluded that the revisions at issue here did not relax the preexisting rules and so,without further inquiry,the epa made a determination of.this truncated,as the epa admits,at most assures that the rules as revised will not exacerbate the existing situation does not fulfill the epa responsibility under l.that provision requires the epa to evaluate whether the plan as revised will achieve the pollution reductions required under the act,and the absence of exacerbation of the existing situation does not assure this result.we therefore remand this matter to the epa for further consideration.
backgrounda.clean air act 
the act creates a framework for the development of cooperative federal,state,regional,and local programs to prevent and control air pollution.caa a,a.pursuant to b of the act,the epa sets national ambient air quality standards naaqs,the attainment and maintenance of which are requisite to protect the public health.b.in,the epa promulgated naaqs for six criteria pollutants,relevant for our matter,carbon monoxide,and ozone.pt.
each state must submit a state implementation plan sip that specif ies the manner in which naaqs will be achieved and maintained within each air quality control region in the state.caa a,a.as summarized by the epa,the purposes of a sip are to make demonstrations of how attainment,maintenance,and progress will be achieved and to provide a control strategy that will achieve the necessary reductions and otherwise meet the requirements of the act.state implementation plans general preamble for the implementation of title i of the clean air act amendments of,hereinafter sip preamble for amendments.by virtue of the states roles in devising a strategy and adopting an implementation plan,the supreme court has emphasized that i t is to the states that the act assigns initial and primary responsibility for deciding what emissions reductions will be required from which sources.whitman am.trucking ass ns,d.
there are exceptions to that primary responsibility of the states.at least since the clean air act amendments amendments,the act has required the states to regulate certain sources of emissions,including,for example,new stationary sources and automobiles,and has established a floor of minimum emissions control standards for such sources,below which the sips can not go.see train nrdc,d.
state sips are subject to epa review and,if inadequate,disapproval.caa l,l.the requirement that the states submit sips to epa for review allows for federal oversight of the states efforts to achieve and maintain the required level of air quality,at.
statutory deadlines for nonattainment areas 
in the amendments,congress required the states to achieve attainment of naaqs by.see,at.in the clean air act amendments amendments,those deadlines gave way to a new deadline,with the possibility of extensions until for certain pollutants.see general preamble for proposed rulemaking on approval of state implementation plan revisions for nonattainment areas,hereinafter sip preamble for amendments.in,based on perceived widespread failure to meet air quality standards,congress again considered amendments to the act,at,at.
amendments.
the resulting clean air act amendments of amendments established a new set of attainment deadlines.in general,the amendments contemplated that less serious nonattainment areas would attain naaqs within five years of enactment and that more serious nonattainment areas would have years to attain naaqs.see,caa a a,a a setting default five and attainment deadlines caa a,a setting and deadlines for attainment of carbon monoxide naaqs caa c,c setting various attainment dates for areas in moderate and serious nonattainment for,with an outside deadline of december,for serious nonattainment areas.in addition,the amendments modified the statutory minimum emission controls,including the minimum emission controls for new stationary sources.see,at,at.
the amendments also established an elaborate timetable for states to submit various new planning documents to the epa,revisions to the pollution control requirements of existing sips,and demonstrations of interim progress and,ultimately,attainment as summarized by the senate report the emphasis in the bill is not on the deadlines but on what happens in the period before deadlines,at,at.t he nonattainment provisions of the bill are designed to require regular and monitored progress toward attainment id.
clark county new source review program revisions 
at the time of enactment of the amendments,clark county new source review program consisted of rules that were last approved by the epa in.the revised new source review program at issue here was approved by the epa on may.may.
parts of clark county,including the las vegas valley,have been in nonattainment for particulate matter and carbon monoxide from the time of the epa approval of the rules to,as far as the record shows,the present the amendments required clark county to submit revisions to its new source review program by november.clark county missed this deadline.but,from until submission to the epa in,clark county engaged in an involved process of revising its new source review program.during this period,clark county received substantial input from the epa,the regulated community,and the public.
hall petition for review 
hall timely filed this pro se petition for review.after initial briefing,we asked the epa and hall to submit supplemental briefs addressing the nature and scope of the epa sip review responsibility under caa l.we also directed the epa to identify any parts of the record that demonstrate that the epa considered whether the revised new source review program interfere s with current requirements.
in its supplemental brief,the epa explained that it approved the clark county new source review revisions based on the following interpretation of l if the sip revision does not relax the existing sip then the sip revision does not interfere with attainment or reasonable further progress requirements and no further inquiry is needed.the epa reasoned that,if there was no relaxation of air quality regulations,the revision would not exacerbate the existing situation by allowing increased emissions and,consequently the sip revision would not interfere with reasonable further progress or attainment.because the epa determined that clark county revised new source review rules did not relax the rules that had been approved in,it concluded,without further inquiry,that the revisions would not interfere with attainment or reasonable further progress requirements.
because we were uncertain of the source of this interpretation,we requested a brief explaining the agency procedures and sources used in arriving at this interpretation.the epa represented that the no relaxation standard discussed above served as the basis of other final rules approving and disapproving sip revisions and that those rules were promulgated in accordance with rulemaking procedures.
discussion 
we will set aside the epa approval of a sip only if the approval is arbitrary,capricious,or otherwise not in accordance with law.ober epa,cir.
epa review responsibility under l 
section l of the act provides that t he administrator shall not approve a revision of a plan if the revision would interfere with any applicable requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further progress or any other applicable requirement of this chapter.l.we must determine whether the epa properly determined that clark county revised new source review program would not interfere with the act attainment requirements.
chevron and skidmore deference 
as an initial matter,the epa argues that,in resolving that question,we owe deference to the epa interpretation of l.epa argues that the interpretation of l applied here is evident in and the basis of other epa final rules approving or disapproving sip revisions and that,because these final rules are promulgated after full notice and opportunity for comment by the public,the interpretation is entitled to deference under chevron,nrdc,d.
even if the interpretation at issue were evident in the other final rules that the epa identifies,each such final rule explicitly states that nothing in the rule has precedential effect.see,nothing in this action should be construed as permitting,allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any sip.this statement makes it clear that the sip reach extends only to those it directly regulates and does not have force of law constituting binding precedent for future sip revisions.interpretations of the act set forth in such documents are not entitled to chevron deference.united states mead,d holding that the binding character of a customs letter stops short of third parties,lacks the force of law,and so is beyond the chevron pale.
of course,as mead reiterates,an agency interpretation that is not accorded chevron deference still may be entitled to a respect proportional to its power to persuade,based on such factors as its writer thoroughness,logic and expertness,its fit with prior interpretations,and any other sources of weight.id.at citing skidmore swift.but our skidmore assessment,id.at,does not weigh in favor of the interpretation advanced in this case.
the interpretation advanced here does not fit with prior interpretations that the epa has cited to us.here,the epa argues that,when there is no relaxation of preexisting rules,this finding conclusively establishes.none of the final rules approving other sip revisions that the epa has cited to us is based on such an interpretation of l.this is not surprising because,in the past,the epa has stated that epa views each type of sip revision as presenting unique issues that should be addressed on a basis,an assessment that has led the epa to decline to issue any general guidance on section l.in short,the interpretation advanced here is not one applied uniformly by the epa.
moreover,in explaining its interpretation in the extensive briefing in this case,the epa has not offered any explanation of how the interpretation fits within the statutory scheme that the epa administers or reflects the epa considered policy judgment about how best to administer the act.the epa has given us no basis to conclude that the epa has drawn on any special expertise in advocating this interpretation 
thus,the epa interpretation must stand or fall on its fidelity to statutory text,statutory structure,and legislative history.considering those standard signposts of legislative intent,we conclude that the epa no relaxation rule,as applied in this case,is not a persuasive interpretation of l.
we start with the text of the current act.without further context,the text of l,and the provisions that it incorporates by reference,do not clearly define the nature of the epa review responsibility.the applicable requirement s concerning attainment and reasonable further progress,caa l,l,include the current attainment deadlines and,as relevant to this case,a requirement that implementation plans include new source review regulations as necessary to assure attainment,caa a c,a c.these substantive criteria are fairly clear,but,given the complexity of the task of achieving the pollution reductions required by the act,it is less clear what it means for a particular revision to interfere with such requirements or what analysis the epa must conduct to make a determination of.
our task is complicated by the fact that l was first added to the act in the amendments,and that those amendments made other relevant changes in the text of the act.therefore,in order to discern congress intent on the specific issue before nature of the epa responsibility to consider attainment objectives in reviewing sip trace the history of the principal provisions bearing on that responsibility.from our review,we conclude that there is substantial continuity between the standards governing the epa sip review before and after the amendments,and we hold that the epa action in this case is inconsistent with established principles governing epa review.
sip review provisions prior to the amendments 
prior to the amendments,the act stated that the epa shall approve a plan or portion of the plan if the epa determines that it meets various substantive criteria,including,inter alia,that it provide s for the attainment of naaqs by statutory deadlines,includes emissions limitations and other measures as may be necessary to insure attainment,and includes a new source review program as necessary to assure attainment.caa a,a.the act provided that the epa should approve a revision if the epa determined that it met the same criteria.see caa a,a 
the seminal case on the epa sip review responsibility is train nrdc,d.that case concerned a narrower issue relating to the approval of variances but,in addressing that issue,the epa took the position,inter alia,that it could approve any plan revision as long as the revision did not interfere with the attainment and maintenance of naaqs.id.at.the court reached a general conclusion that the epa interpretation of the act was reasonable.id.and,in discussing the epa review function,the court explained that the epa most basic responsibility in reviewing air quality plans under the act is to determine whether the ultimate effect of a state choice of emission limitations is compliance with naaqs.id.at.the court observed that the epa review of revisions to such plans was subject to the same principles and basic standards as epa review of initial plans epa approval is subject to the condition that the revised plan satisfy the general requirements applicable to original implementation plans.id.at.explaining the nature of the basic judgment that the epa must make,both in approving an initial plan and in reviewing revisions,the court stated i n each instance the agency must measure the existing level of pollution,compare it with the national standards,and determine the effect on this comparison of specified emission modifications.id.at.elaborating on the nature of the judgment that the epa must make in reviewing a revised plan,the court stated that the epa should disapprove a plan revision if the plan as so revised would no longer insure timely attainment of the national standards.id.at.see also id.at.stating that a revision would be disapproved if it cause d a plan to fail to insure maintenance of those standards.
two developments after train shed considerable light on the amendments.first,after train,the epa formally reiterated its position that one of t he basic criteria for approving any individual element of a submitted plan revision is that it must n ot interfere with assuring attainment of the naaqs by the required deadline,or with satisfying the act other requirements.sip preamble for amendments.at emphasis added.it applied that standard to its review of revisions and,in a number of cases following train,courts accepted the standard.see ohio envtl.council epa,cir united states steel epa,cir navistar int l transp.epa,cir.
second,in abramowitz epa,cir,the petitioner challenged the epa practice of approving particular pollution control measures submitted by a state without requiring an attainment demonstration that would show that an implementation plan,taken as a whole,would attain naaqs by the statutory deadlines then in effect we agreed.id.at.we reasoned that the act required that a plan provide for attainment,that control measures adopted by a state would assure attainment by the deadlines,and that there was no reference in the act to a separate determination of control measures and attainment demonstration.id.at.
amendments to sip review provisions 
against this background,the intent of the amendments with regard to certain fundamentals is quite clear.in drafting current l,congress incorporated into the act the standard adopted by the epa and approved by the courts.caa l,l.congress incorporation of the standard into the amended act provides a strong inference that congress approved of judicial and administrative construction of that standard,at least in its outer contours.when congress incorporates the text of past interpretations,congress repetition of a term carries the implication that congress intended the term to be construed in accordance with interpretations.bragdon abbott,d.see also lorillard pons,d congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute,and,when congress reenacts a statute without showing disapproval of its existing interpretation,congress is presumed to adopt that interpretation.
although congress adopted the standard and can be presumed generally to have approved administrative and judicial interpretations of the act consistent with that standard,congress expressly overrule d that portion of abramowitz which held that epa could not approve individual measures in a plan submission without either approving or disapproving the plan as a whole,at,thus,k of the amended act permits the epa to issue partial approval s,that is,to approve the states sip revisions in piecemeal fashion.caa k,k.although the legislative history does not explicitly say so,this disapproval of abramowitz strongly implies that,under the amended act,there is no rigid requirement that the epa always must require a formal attainment demonstration before approving plan revisions.this conclusion is borne out by the statutory scheme.the act provides for piecemeal submission of sip revisions,including attainment demonstrations.the act establishes an elaborate timeline for states to submit revisions to their plans.and the act requires formal attainment demonstrations as part of the sip revisions the states must submit to the epa.but the act explicitly contemplates that those attainment demonstrations may be submitted for epa review at different times than other elements of the states sip revisions for example,revisions to control measures are submitted for review.see,caa,provisions governing carbon monoxide nonattainment areas.
synthesizing these changes,as relevant to our decision in this case,we can discern certain fundamentals about the epa review responsibility.to the extent consistent with the new statutory scheme,the guidance provided in train still holds.the objective of the epa analysis is to determine whether the ultimate effect of a state choice of emission limitations is compliance with naaqs.train,at,t he act charges the epa with the determination as to whether the state choices will result in attainment of the naaqs.the nature of the judgment that the epa must make is to measure the existing level of pollution,compare it with the national standards,and determine the effect on this comparison of specified emission modifications.train,at.in other words,the epa must determine the extent of pollution reductions that are required and determine whether the emissions reductions effected by the proposed revisions will be adequate to the task.
of course,it is impossible to determine the adequacy of the emissions reductions effected by a particular component of an implementation plan unless the emissions reductions that can be expected from the rest of the plan also,at some level,enter into the analysis.the epa must be able to determine that,with the revisions in place,the whole plan as revised can meet the act attainment requirements.id.at.
admittedly,this determination is complicated by the fact that,under the amendments,the plan as revised is not static.the amendments require,if not wholesale,at least substantial revisions to sips before the attainment deadlines.and the amendments contemplate that a state prospects for meeting the new attainment deadlines will depend not on any one revision to the existing sips,but instead on the contributions of all the contemplated revisions.yet,when the epa reviews a particular revision,the epa will not have before it the plan as a whole,that is,the final plan that in the state judgment will achieve the act attainment requirements.compare abramowitz,at holding,prior to the amendments,that,before approving any particular component of a revised plan,the epa was required to insist on a formal demonstration that the plan as a whole would achieve attainment.within this statutory context,the epa can not be required to ignore other anticipated revisions in determining whether the state will achieve attainment.rather,for the epa to determine that the plan as revised can meet attainment requirements,the epa must be able to conclude that the particular plan revision before it is consistent with the development of an overall plan capable of meeting the act attainment requirements.in other words,in the context of an evolving attainment effort,the epa must consider the relation of the step to the movement as a whole.
epa application of the no relaxation rule 
the epa does not claim that its decision was based on any empirical analysis that measure d the existing level of pollution,compare d it with the national standards,and determine d the effect on this comparison of specified emission modifications.train,at.rather,the epa claims a necessary statutory equivalence between of rules approved in and with current attainment requirements.the epa application of the no relaxation rule in this case can not be squared with the act 
when,in,the epa approved clark county new source review program,it necessarily determined that the new source review rules,in conjunction with other components of clark county implementation plan,would attain naaqs for all criteria pollutants by the and deadlines that were then in effect.see sip preamble for amendments.at.yet,during the time those rules were in place,the las vegas valley and other parts of clark county have remained in nonattainment for carbon monoxide and particulate matter.
the epa approach effectively makes the emissions reductions achieved under those same rules the baseline for determining with the act current attainment requirements.as the ep
