this case involves an environmental law challenge to united states air force air force plans to permit the german air force to station,for training purposes,thirty fighter aircraft at holloman air force base holloman,in addition to the twelve already there.the suit was brought by ranchers and livestock raising associations referred to collectively as appellants located near holloman,claiming,among other things,multiple violations of the national environmental policy act nepa,by the air force,the department of defense,and various air force and department officials the district court affirmed the air force final agency decision on the grounds that it was neither arbitrary,capricious,nor without reasonable foundation.lee air force,d.
on appeal,appellants argue that the air force,in carrying out the procedures required under nepa to assess the environmental impact of its proposed action,failed to consider reasonable alternatives,failed to assess adequately the potential impact on property values in surrounding areas,used a flawed methodology to analyze noise impacts,used outdated studies to assess livestock impacts,and failed to consider the impact of aerial refueling or the potential secondary effects of aircraft accidents.they further argue that the air force agreement with the german federal ministry of defense german defense ministry to expand german air force training at holloman is invalid because the air force did not follow the procedural requirements imposed by the act,for international agreements.
background 
holloman is located in southern new mexico,approximately seven miles west of alamagordo and miles northeast of el paso,texas.the base is adjacent to the white sands missile range as well as white sands national monument.the united states and germany began negotiations to establish the german air force training program at issue here in.initially,the united states offered to allow the beddown of up to german air force tornado aircraft at holloman.however,d ue to political considerations and funding limitations,the gaf german air force decided to pursue the program in two i and holloman ii.appellants app.at.in the holloman i stage,the german air force would move twelve tornados to holloman,to be followed by thirty additional tornados in the holloman ii stage.
before giving final approval to an agreement finalizing these negotiations,the air force analyzed the environmental impact of its proposed action in an environmental assessment ea,issued in february.the ea considered only the impact of holloman i and concluded that there would be no significant environmental impact.the air force thus issued a finding of no significant environmental impact fonsi,which allowed it to avoid preparing a more detailed environmental impact statement eis.
subsequently,on may,the air force and the german defense ministry signed a memorandum of agreement agreement implementing holloman i.the agreement authorized a german air force tactical training establishment tte at holloman and provided for the beddown of twelve tornados,accompanied by german air force personnel.the twelve tornados were relocated to holloman in may.
according to air force documents in the administrative record,the german air force identified a need for additional flight training after the beddown occurred,in the course of preparing specific tornado mission training plans.appellees.at.this,in combination with the need to compensate for increasingly limited access to white sands missile range restricted airspace,led the air force to consider modifying holloman existing military training routes mtrs and military operations areas moas and establishing an oval aerial refueling track.under its proposal,the air force would convert cruise missile routes into routes for down to feet above ground level military aircraft training,and establish a new moa,with operating altitudes as low as feet above ground level,south of the existing moa area.the air force prepared an ea and issued a fonsi in connection with this proposal in june.
faa approval of these airspace modifications was pending when,in may,the air force and the german defense ministry amended their agreement in order to implement the holloman ii stage.the amendments indicated that the german air force tte at holloman would be expanded through the beddown of thirty additional german air force tornados and a substantial increase in the number of permanent german air force training and logistics personnel.appellants app.at.under the expansion,tornado aircrews could participate in five different training courses that would include training in takeoffs and landings,the use of radar for navigation on mtrs,training,training,and aerial refueling.the amended agreement indicated that its implementation was subject to a final decision by the air force following completion of the nepa process.id.
the air force decided to analyze the environmental impact of the german air force tte expansion by preparing a full eis.an april air force document suggests that an eis was necessary in order to identify a potential new bombing site because the tornado training contemplated by the proposed expansion would increase the number of practice bombings to several thousand per year.id.at.the eis considered three options for a new target complex ntc to accommodate the proposed increase in practice bombings.the new ntc,if established,would be used for bombings using inert or subscale munitions while live munitions deliveries would continue to be restricted to the red rio live drop target on the white sands missile range.the preferred option was to construct the ntc on the west otero mesa portion of mcgregor range.the other options were to construct the ntc on the tularosa basin portion of mcgregor range or to use only existing ranges.because the faa had not yet approved the airspace modifications assessed in the ea,the eis took into account the different impacts that would result depending on whether or not the modifications were implemented.in addition,the eis considered a alternative,under which the german air force tte expansion would not occur.appellees.at.
the air force solicited public comments on the proposed expansion at public hearings held during the initial eis scoping process and through written announcements after the draft eis was released in june.a final eis was completed in april.on may,the air force gave final approval to the german air force tte expansion and the preferred west otero mesa training option in a record of decision rod,explaining that although the alternative would result in the minimum environmental impact,it would not provide the training,proficiency,and combined action capabilities needed to achieve the strategy and goals.id.at.the existing range option would provide only minimally adequate training for gaf aircrews and has the potential to significantly degrade current air force operations and training.id.in contrast,
t he west otero mesa training option provides the maximum training opportunity for both the gaf and the air force.in addition to the greater opportunity for training,this option also provides for the greatest training versatility and efficiency.finally,ntc construction on the west otero mesa will disturb a significantly smaller geographical area compared to the tularosa basin training option and will involve a fraction of the cost.
id.at.the rod described the potential environmental impacts of the decision,including increased noise in some portions of the affected airspace,overflight disturbance to land use,and slight to moderate impacts to biological resources but concluded that mitigation measures would likely avoid or adequately minimize these potential impacts.id.at.
as indicated above,appellants challenged the air force rod as a final agency action,pursuant to the administrative procedures act apa,and alleged violations of nepa and the act.in support of their nepa claims,appellants offered three expert affidavits that were not part of the administrative record.one of these,by armand smith,was offered to support appellants assertion that the eis should have included a concrete appraisal of the potential decrease in property values resulting from the proposed action.two others,by william weida and karl kryter,were offered to support appellants argument that the air force used a flawed methodology in performing its analysis of noise impacts resulting from the proposed action.
the district court first held that these expert affidavits were not eligible for admission into evidence the district court then rejected appellants claims,holding that the air force final eis complied with nepa and that appellants had no standing to claim a violation of the act appellants brought this appeal challenging all three of these holdings.

we consider appellants nepa and claims in turn below.because appellants claim in regard to their submissions is closely tied to their nepa challenge,we consider that claim in the course of our nepa discussion.
nepa claim 
the national environmental policy act nepa,prescribes the necessary process by which federal agencies must take a hard look at the environmental consequences of their proposed actions.utahns for better,at.for proposed major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,agencies must prepare an environmental impact statement eis in which they consider the environmental impact of the proposed action and compare this impact with that of alternatives to the proposed action.see c.agencies need not prepare a full eis,however,if they initially prepare the less detailed environmental assessment ea and,based on the ea,issue a finding of no significant impact fonsi,concluding that the proposed action will not significantly affect the environment.utah wilderness alliance norton,cir,cert.granted,internal quotation marks omitted.
the infusion of nepa procedures into the ongoing programs and actions of the federal government serves two related goals by requiring agencies to gather and consider detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts,it ensures that important effects will not be overlooked or underestimated only to be discovered after resources have been committed or the die otherwise cast.robertson methow valley citizens council,d.in addition,by making the relevant information available to the public,it both assures the public that the agency has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process and,perhaps more significantly,provides a springboard for public comment.id.quoting balt.gas natural res.def.council,d.
however,it is well established that nepa does not mandate particular results,utahns for better,at citing robertson,at,nor does it require agencies to elevate environmental concerns over other valid concerns,id.at citing balt.gas,at.because nepa imposes procedural rather than substantive requirements,t he role of the courts in reviewing compliance with nepa is simply to ensure that the agency has adequately considered and disclosed the environmental impact of its actions and that its decision is not arbitrary and capricious.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we apply a rule of reason standard essentially an abuse of discretion standard in deciding whether claimed deficiencies in a final eis are merely flyspecks,or are significant enough to defeat the goals of informed decisionmaking and informed public comment.see also custer county action ass garvey,cir,cert.denied,d.
as indicated above,appellants object to the air force eis on a number of grounds.we address each of these grounds in turn.
consideration of alternatives 
nepa requires an eis to include discussion of alternatives to the proposed action.c iii.appellants argue that the final eis did not comply with this requirement because it failed to discuss air force bases other than holloman as alternative sites for the german air force tte expansion.according to appellants,t here is no legitimate reason why other bases could not be considered for the beddown of the combined tornado aircraft.appellants br.at.appellants also argue that the air force initial decision,in,to beddown a small number of aircraft was made in order to avoid having to prepare an initial eis so that the air force could establish as a foregone conclusion the premise that any additional german air force aircraft would also be bedded down at holloman.id.in response,the air force argues that no other base was considered because n o other base was reasonable,and that this was just as true in as it was in.appellees br.at.
the consideration of alternatives to a proposed action is the heart of the environmental impact statement.see.envtl.coalition dombeck,cir ass ns working for aurora residential env t.dep t of,cir all indian pueblo council united states,cir.however,nepa does not require an agency to analyze the environmental consequences of alternatives it has in good faith rejected as too remote,speculative,or impractical or ineffective.id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also citizens against burlington,busey,t he term alternatives is not.d iscussion of alternatives must be moored to some notion of feasibility.quoting.yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,d.
thus,council on environmental quality ceq regulations implementing nepa require agencies to r igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives.a emphasis added.air force regulations further specify that r easonable alternatives are those that meet the underlying purpose and need for the proposed action and that would cause a reasonable person to inquire further before choosing a particular course of action.b.
here,we conclude that the air force decision to eliminate other bases from consideration in the eis was not unreasonable in light of the stated purpose and need for the german air force tte expansion.the eis explains that the proposed action is intended to further support the agreement between the air force and the german defense ministry,to demonstrate continued commitment to nato allies despite the reduction of a military presence in europe,to capitalize on the substantial infrastructure investments the gaf has already made at holloman,to provide a terrain training location not otherwise available to gaf aircrews in germany,and to allow tornado expertise to be shared among students in different courses in order to enhance the training environment and produce students.appellees.at.in effect,the proposal at issue in was the expansion of the german air force tte at holloman,pursuant to the amended agreement.as such,it was not unreasonable for the air force to confine its consideration of alternatives to those available at holloman.
while appellants argue that the air force should have separated its analysis of alternative sites for a ntc from those available for the german air force tte expansion,it is clear that the air force considered the new ntc to be part of the proposed expansion and in fact the aspect of the expansion that made an eis necessary.the air force limitation of its ntc alternatives to those available at holloman therefore did not violate nepa.
the record does not support appellants further assertion that the air force decision to bed down only twelve tornados at first allowed it to circumvent nepa requirement to consider alternatives by preparing an ea instead of an eis.indeed,air force regulations note that the obligation to discuss reasonable alternatives applies equally to eas and eiss.c.in connection with this obligation,the regulations further state that the air force may expressly eliminate alternatives from detailed analysis,based on reasonable selection standards for example,operational,technical,or environmental standards suitable to a particular project,as long as these standards are not so narrowly define d that they unnecessarily limit consideration to the proposal initially favored by proponents.id.c.
in accord with these regulations,the ea eliminated bases other than holloman from detailed analysis.it explained,in a history of the formulation of the alternatives,that the air force identified holloman as the only feasible site for the potential beddown through a narrowing process,based on the following criteria 
the airbase must be an existing active duty base with facilities such that construction would be held to a minimum,both to keep costs to a minimum and to allow for rapid.facilities needed would include sufficient available ramp space for parking,buildings for work space and maintenance,and available housing for personnel.as pilots would require tactical training,suitable and ranges should be near the base.also,as training would involve bringing personnel to the for a short time,the flying environment should allow for the maximum number of flying days uninterrupted by weather in addition to the above criteria,the gaf requested that holloman afb,new mexico specifically be evaluated due to it being the beddown location for an existing gaf training unit and its proximity to german army training conducted at fort bliss in el paso,texas.
appellees.at.as described in the ea,the air force eliminated other air force bases as alternatives because those bases were already operating near full capacity,their use would require extensive construction to accommodate the german air force,they were located in areas where weather would significantly curtail the number of days available for training,or they were scheduled for closure.id.at.although holloman,the preferred site,turned out to be the only feasible site,the criteria used by the air force to make this determination appear reasonable,and there is no indication that the air force unnecessarily eliminated other bases as alternatives.
the eis refers back to this initial decisionmaking process.id.at.significantly,we find no indication in the record that the air force conclusion in that holloman was the only feasible site for the initial beddown would have been different if the air force had considered the beddown of tornados rather than twelve.further,there is no indication that new potential sites meeting the air force criteria had become available by the time of the eis.under these circumstances,the fact that the air force approved the establishment of a german air force tte in a series of stages rather than in a single stage does not indicate that the air force circumvented nepa requirements.
appellants urge us to find this situation analogous to that in davis mineta,cir.in davis,we held that an agency decision to issue a fonsi rather than prepare an eis was arbitrary because the agency had obligated itself contractually to issue a fonsi before it conducted an ea,making it clear that the agency had prejudged the nepa issues.id.at.here,in contrast,the air force did not sign the original agreement with the german defense ministry until after it had completed the ea and issued a fonsi.the agreement only obligated the air force to accept a beddown of twelve tornados.the amended agreement explicitly stated that it would not go into effect unless the air force approved the action following completion of all nepa requirements.there is thus no indication here that the air force prejudged the nepa issues.
we therefore hold that the eis limitation of its alternatives analysis to those available at holloman does not violate nepa.
consideration of impacts 
appellants remaining arguments concern the eis impacts analysis.nepa requires an eis to include an analysis of the environmental impact of the proposed action,c i,including ecological,aesthetic,historical,cultural,economic,social,and health impacts,whether direct,indirect,or cumulative.we address each of the alleged deficiencies in the eis impacts analysis below.
economic impacts 
first,appellants challenge the eis assessment of economic impacts.they specifically contest its conclusory determination that any changes in value of rural properties surrounding holloman due to the increased overflights accompanying the proposed german air force tte expansion were impossible to quantify.they argue that the air force should at least have attempted to assign a dollar value to these changes,or discussed other failed attempts,before concluding that quantification was impossible.
the final eis discussion of the proposed action potential impact on land values was included in response to public comments raising the issue.the eis noted that,in the rural holloman surroundings,changes in daily aircraft overflight may or may not be readily discernible to the observer,and even w here such changes can be discerned,existing variability in land value due to locations and improvements make it impossible to quantify any potential difference that might be associated with aircraft overflight.appellants app.at.the eis concluded that given the rural nature of the area and the relatively sporadic nature of overflights,changes in overflight would not be expected to produce measurable impacts on the economic value of the underlying land.id.the eis did not cite specific scientific support for the assertion that changes in land value were impossible to quantify.rather,it referred to documentation from some locations in the united states,particularly around airports,where changes in land value resulting from increased overflights had been difficult to quantify.
under the circumstances here,we do not believe the eis treatment of the land valuation issue constituted a violation of nepa,despite the eis failure to cite by name or discuss in detail the documentation it relied on for its conclusion that valuation was impossible.an agency obligation in regard to incomplete or unavailable information is governed by the ceq regulations.an agency must obtain and include in the eis information on reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts that are essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives if the costs of obtaining such information are not exorbitant.holy cross wilderness fund madigan,cir.if the costs of obtaining the information are exorbitant or the means to obtain it are not known the agency must follow four specific steps.id.referring to the four steps outlined in b.these steps include the obligation to summarize existing credible scientific evidence which is relevant to evaluating the reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts.b.again,however,these steps are only required in regard to reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts.id.b.
here,it is clear from the record that the air force did not consider decreased land values a reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impact rather,it concluded that no measurable decrease in land values was likely to occur.the evidence in the record supports this conclusion.the eis indicates that implementation of the proposed action would increase the average number of daily sorties flying out of holloman from to,and the number of operations and low approaches from to per day.this would result in an increase in the daily use of each mtr and moa of between one and three sorties per day.appellants app.at.an mtr width,which may be sixty or more miles,would further disperse the impact of the increased use.id.at.while appellants note that noise levels over some private land would reach db,they do not specify the nature of this land current use,and the record shows that the noise in those areas was already at the db level without the proposed action.id.at.we hold that the air force conclusion that the proposed action impact on property values was minimal does not violate the rule of reason.the air force was therefore not obligated to take the further steps required under.see.envt l coalition,at holding that the forest service had no obligation under to obtain unavailable information that was not essential to reasoned decision making.
appellants argue that the affidavit
