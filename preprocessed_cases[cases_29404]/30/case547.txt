the government appeals from the dismissal of a suit by which the epa sought access to the property of john tarkowski,pursuant to section e of the superfund statute comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla,e,for the purpose of remediation,specifically,of investigating possible environmental hazards and removing quantities of tarkowski personal property and other materials.the judge concluded that the action for which the epa sought authorization would be arbitrary and capricious in the circumstances presented by this case.
tarkowski is an elderly,impecunious man who lives on a tract in what was once a rural backwater in wauconda,illinois but is now an affluent suburb.he may be land rich as a result of the development of the area that surrounds his tract,but this is unclear he may not actually own the tract,although his right to its possession is not in doubt.
he built the house in which he lives out of surplus materials,and his yard is full of what his upscale neighbors regard as junk,such as wooden pallets that he burns for heat because he ca afford gas,tires that he uses to build retaining walls,drums for building a culvert for water runoff,barrels,batteries,paint cans,and other construction materials and supplies,some of them the detritus of a failed project to construct a subdivision on the tract before being disabled by injuries many years ago,tarkowski was a building contractor.
tarkowski neighbors have been harassing him for many years.in a letter was left in his mailbox which says hey polock sic we do want any white trash or white niggers here.we want you.the next year the neighbors complained about the condition of tarkowski property to the epa,which the same year made a preliminary assessment and concluded that the property posed no environmental hazard despite its unsightliness.in the epa rated the property a zero on its hazard rating scale.in state authorities at the epa request took and examined various soil and water samples on the property.tests on the samples received traces of lead,but only in an area in which tarkowski does some welding for personal,noncommercial use.other metals,and pesticides,revealed by the tests were likewise consistent with household use and other chemicals that the tests revealed could have come from petroleum products,which are exempt under section of cercla.in short,there was no evidence of legally significant contamination.
the following year,however,the epa,pursuant to an access order similar to the one sought in this case,took additional samples on tarkowski property,some from the soil,some from drums,and one from a piece of pipe insulation.only trace amounts of contaminants were found,and there was no indication that they exceeded the levels of these contaminants found in the surrounding properties none of which was deemed to pose any kind of environmental hazard or to require or justify remedial efforts.nevertheless the epa brought this suit,claiming without furnishing any factual basis for the claim that the environmental contamination at the site tarkowski property presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health,welfare and the environment arising from the actual release or threat of release of hazardous substances from the site.the relief sought was an order forbidding tarkowski to prevent the epa from going onto his land in order to fence it apparently to keep children from straying onto it,conduct additional tests,install wells,dig up the property looking for any buried drums and,if they were found,remove them,remove contaminated soil,and cart away a variety of objects lying on the property,including drums and other containers,batteries,and materials containing asbestos,all these objects being tarkowski personal property.the epa is thus seeking the access order for a mixture of investigative and remedial purposes we need not consider whether,if only the former were sought,the epa has made a sufficient showing to justify such an order,as in united states fisher,cir which was,however,a much stronger case for such an order than this one is.but we will have to consider whether a request for an order limited to remediation would have a different status in the district court.
the epa takes the extreme position that,provided it has probable cause to believe that there is even a thimbleful of a hazardous substance spilled in a person yard,or we suppose even a drop,it has an absolute right to an access order regardless of the action it proposes to take once it gains that access,such as excavating the entire yard and removing the soil to a depth of ten feet,thus rendering the property wholly useless to its owner.the court not only must,the epa argues,issue the order no questions asked the court can not limit the extent of the remedial measures that the epa can take once it gains access.all the epa will concede is that if it wanted to do the excavation at,or wanted to use a stick of dynamite to dislodge the topsoil,the court might refuse to order access.similarly,while the agency claims the absolute right to an access order if it learns that a single flake of asbestos is lying on the floor of tarkowski house,it acknowledges that the court could forbid it to use a battering ram to gain access to the house for purposes of removing the flake.
the epa makes no pretense that the position it advocates serves a public purpose,strikes a reasonable balance between property rights and community rights,rationally advances the agency mission,or even comports with the limitations that the constitution has been interpreted to place on federal regulation of purely local activities,not to mention the limitations that the fourth amendment places on searches and seizures.access orders are orders to seize as well as search,because of the control that the agency exerts over the property even when it is just doing test borings and other investigative work.that such orders must comply with the fourth amendment is apparent from marshall barlow,d.rather,the epa defends its position as ineluctably compelled by statutory language that we have now to examine in order to determine whether the case can be decided without our having to reach any constitutional issues.
sections e,and of cercla,e,authorize the epa to go upon a property to inspect or to obtain samples for testing e or to effectuate a response action e d,if there is a reasonable basis to believe there may be a release or threat of release of a hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant.e.section e b i provides that if consent to the entry is denied,the government may obtain a judicial order preventing interference with the entry what we are calling an access order unless under the circumstances of the case the demand for entry or inspection is arbitrary and capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.
the requirement of reasonable basis is easily satisfied,and is satisfied here,as it would be in our thimbleful and flake examples,as there is nothing in section e about magnitude.but this makes it all the more important to consider whether the agency proposed action is unreasonable arbitrary and capricious.the epa may be reasonable,though we doubt it,in wanting to conduct additional tests on tarkowski would depend in part on how disruptive the tests would be to tarkowski use of the property.united states fisher,supra,at.but given what the agency now knows or has reason to know,which is that the property although unsightly is not a site or source of even a slight environmental hazard,for it to want to go ahead and rip up the property without completing its inspection bespeaks a precipitance that would be warranted only by emergency conditions.the epa assures us that it wo undertake any drastic remedial action until it completes new tests.but,if so,why is it not seeking merely an order to allow it to go onto the property to conduct tests that would not unreasonably interfere with tarkowski use and enjoyment of his property the agency is adamant in the assertion of a right to carry out remedial action whatever the test results are,or indeed before completing or for that matte
