plaintiff william sheffield challenges several municipal ordinances enacted by the city of fort thomas,kentucky,alleging that the ordinances violate the united states and kentucky constitutions and that the ordinances are preempted by kentucky state statutes and administrative regulations.the district court rejected all of sheffield challenges.with one exception,we agree with that conclusion.we hold,however,that the district court erred in concluding that kentucky administrative regulations have no preemptive force as against kentucky municipal ordinances.we therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
between and the present day,the deer population within the state of kentucky increased approximately.according to the kentucky department of fish and wildlife resources dfwr,deer are reaching a saturation point in many parts of the commonwealth.among these regions is the heavily wooded area surrounding the city of fort thomas a suburb of cincinnati,ohio,whose residents have suffered increasingly from motor vehicle collisions with deer,landscaping damage due to deer,and other problems.eventually,the members of the fort thomas city council decided to take action.
beginning in october,a city administrative officer worked with dfwr representatives to develop a plan.various options were considered,ranging from implementing a program to administering a drug derived from pig ovaries.in the end,the city council opted for a approach educating the public about tactics prohibiting deer feeding and permitting the hunting of deer by bow and arrow within the city limits,which dfwr representatives had advised was the most effective means of controlling the deer population in an urban area.
the second and third parts of this plan required several additions and amendments to the fort thomas city code the ordinances,which the city council enacted in december.to implement the ban,the city council adopted an ordinance the ordinance which read in relevant part 
determination of city.
it is hereby determined that an increasing population of deer within the city poses a threat to public safety by increasing the likelihood of collisions,deer attacks on residents,pedestrians and visitors,and the transmission of diseases to humans from deer poses a threat to native plant and animal life by excessive foraging which disturbs natural ecological balances and poses a threat to the quality of life by damage to landscaping and vegetable gardens.
feeding prohibited.
a no person shall knowingly,purposely or intentionally feed deer,cause deer to be fed or provide food to deer in the city on any public or private property.this prohibition includes,but is not limited to,disbursement of food on the ground,at a feeding station,in a feeding device,or in a container of any form providing a salt or mineral or any other means which serves to provide feed to any deer in the city.
b a person shall be deemed to have knowingly,purposely or intentionally fed deer,caused deer to be fed,or provided food to deer if the person places,or allows to be placed,wheat,pelleted livestock food,corn in any form,fruit,vegetables,hay or alfalfa,human food scraps,any form of commercially sold wildlife feed,birdseed or livestock feed,or any other edible matter that deer will consume on the ground or within the reach of deer.this prohibition shall not include live vegetation such as ornamental landscaping,flowers,trees,vines,vegetable gardens,edible matter located either in an enclosed building or stored in a securely sealed package,or unmodified commercially purchased bird feeders or their equivalent when placed out of the reach of deer.

to implement the remainder of its plan,the city council had to modify of the city code,entitled discharge of firearms and other weapons,which provided at the time that n o person other than a police officer shall discharge any firearm of any nature,nor use or discharge any sling,bow,or other weapon in the city of fort thomas to that end,the city council enacted an ordinance the ordinance inserting the following language at the end of 
the provisions of this subchapter shall not apply to any individual discharging an arrow from a bow or crossbow when such discharge meets all of the following requirements 
when such discharge occurs during the kentucky archery hunting season for deer as established by the commonwealth of kentucky or when such discharge occurs pursuant to a depredation permit issued by the kentucky department of fish and wildlife resources and 
when the individual is discharging an arrow from a point not less than feet from a residence,apartment,or business structure not on the property on which the discharge is occurring,or a street,highway,interstate,railroad or park,in the intended direction of the arrow and 
when the individual is discharging an arrow in a manner where no residence,apartment or business structure not on the property on which the discharge is occurring,or a street,highway,interstate,railroad or park is less than feet perpendicular to the arrow intended path of trajectory sic and 
when the individual is discharging an arrow in a manner in which it does not leave the property from which it is being discharged and 
when the individual is discharging an arrow not more than yards from the intended target and 
when the individual discharging an arrow is either the owner of the property upon which the arrow is being discharged or has the permission of the property owner upon which the arrow is being discharged.

finally,to address the disposal of the carcasses of the deer and other animals that could now be shot by bow and arrow within the city limits,the city council enacted another provision the ordinance 
this subchapter shall apply to the field dressing of any animal killed in conjunction with the discharge of any arrow from a bow in strict compliance with of this chapter,the ordinance.

in december,fort thomas residents lisa kelly and william sheffield filed suit in kentucky state court against the city,as well as various city officials in their individual and official capacities,alleging that the ordinances violated various provisions of the united states and kentucky constitutions and were preempted by kentucky state statutes and administrative regulations.the defendants removed the complaint to federal court.in two separate orders dated january,and april,the district court granted the defendants summary judgment as to all claims.see kelly city of fort thomas,d.
plaintiffs timely appealed kelly,however,withdrew from the lawsuit after she was elected to the very city council whose membership she was suing.sheffield,now the sole appellant,has abandoned many of the claims asserted before the district court.his remaining claims are that all three ordinances are preempted by chapter of the kentucky revised statutes,which broadly regulates the commonwealth wildlife resources,by chapter of the kentucky administrative regulations,which more concretely regulates hunting that the ordinance violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution and of the kentucky constitution because it infringes on his asserted fundamental right to be free from a risk of serious bodily harm lacks a rational basis and that the ordinance violates those same constitutional provisions because it is void for vagueness

iii.discussion 
relevant provisions governing wildlife 
sheffield argues that the ordinances are preempted by chapter of the kentucky revised statutes.acts,ch,which contains numerous provisions regulating fish and wildlife resources,by administrative regulations promulgated thereunder by the dfwr.see.stat.admin.regs.a brief summary of the relevant provisions is in order.
the declared purpose of chapter is 
to protect and conserve the wildlife of this commonwealth so as to insure a permanent and continued supply of the wildlife resources of this state for the purpose of furnishing sport and recreation for the present and for the future residents of this state to promote the general welfare of the commonwealth to provide for the prudent taking and disposition of wildlife within reasonable limits,based upon the adequacy of the supply thereof to protect the food supply of this state,and to insure the continuation of an important part of the commerce of this state which depends upon the existence of its wildlife resources.
among many other things,that chapter establishes the dfwr in order to enforce the laws and regulations adopted under this chapter relating to wildlife,id.empowers the dfwr to issue regulations regarding hunting season dates,bag limits,weapons usable for hunting,and locations where hunting is permitted,id.implements a regime governing hunting licenses,id.and prohibits the discharge of any firearm,bow and arrow,crossbow or other similar device,upon,over,or across any public roadway anywhere in the state,id.chapter does not address whether hunting is permitted or prohibited in urban areas or whether cities have any say in the matter.nor does it address the proper method of disposal of animal carcasses,other than to state that landowners without hunting licenses who kill wild animals causing damage to their property must obtain the dfwr authorization if they wish to use the carcass,id.and licensed hunters may place animal carcasses in cold storage or mount them,id.
the dfwr,in turn,has promulgated a variety of regulations associated with wildlife.one relevant provision,among other things,specifies various windows of time between september and january when deer may be hunted with various weapons and divides kentucky counties into four zones and specifies how many deer a person may take per year in each zone.admin.regs.this regulation does not address where deer hunting is permitted or prohibited within each zone,in urban areas.another relevant regulation prohibits the feeding of wildlife from march through may,but provides that w ildlife may be fed year round within the curtilage of the home.admin.regs.lastly,a regulation provides that killed deer must be logged before moving the carcass from the site where taken,id,and that a carcass must be tagged if it leaves the possession of the hunter,id,but does not otherwise address the disposal of carcasses.
kentucky home rule statute 
the obvious point for our preemption analysis is,known as the home rule statute.under that statute,a city may exercise any power and perform any function within its boundaries that is in furtherance of a public purpose of the city and not in conflict with a constitutional provision or statute.emphasis added.the home rule statute further provides that a power or function is in conflict with a statute if it is expressly prohibited by a statute or there is a comprehensive scheme of legislation on the same general subject embodied in the kentucky revised statutes id.

preemption analysis of the ordinances 
sheffield first argues that the ordinance is preempted because it allows the crossbow hunting of deer during windows of time when.admin.regs.entitled statewide season dates forbids it.we set aside for the moment the issue of whether administrative regulations have preemptive force municipal ordinances,as we conclude that sheffield is simply mistaken with respect to what the ordinance purports to authorize.
to wit,the ordinance does not affirmatively provide that deer may be hunted within city limits during the time periods specified therein rather,it merely provides that arrows may be discharged from bows and crossbows within city limits during those times.the ordinance text is entirely agnostic as to the purpose behind the discharge it might be for the purpose of hunting deer,state laws and regulations permitting,but it might also be for target practice or any number of other reasons.the dfwr regulation to which sheffield points does not prohibit the discharge of arrows from crossbows per se at any time.because the ordinance does not purport to permit conduct which is prohibited by the regulation,there is no explicit conflict between them.louisville nashville commonwealth ex rel.city of covington.
sheffield also argues that the ordinance is preempted because it purports to regulate hunting,notwithstanding the fact that t he state has already exercised its supreme power regarding hunting by enacting a comprehensive scheme of legislation at chapter of the kentucky revised statutes.appellant reply br.at.the kentucky courts have never addressed whether chapter is a comprehensive scheme of legislation or how broad its preemptive effect might be.however,our analysis of the kentucky case law satisfies us that the kentucky courts would not hold the ordinance preempted by chapter as a whole 
the leading kentucky case on comprehensive scheme preemption is commonwealth do,in which the question presented to the kentucky supreme court was whether the entry of the state into the field of prevention preempts local regulations and enforcement.the court stated that the test for preemption of an entire field of regulation is whether 
the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action or the subject matter has been partially covered by general law and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the municipality.
id.at quoting in re hubbard,cal.the court noted that that there are many individual situations where local police power may operate on the same subject matter to supplement the general law by providing for additional reasonable requirements.id.at.the fundamental question,the court observed,is whether the general assembly intend ed to exclusively occupy th e area of regulations.id.at emphasis added see also wright,legislative intent is the touchstone of all preemption analysis.quoting keck commonwealth ex rel.golden.
defendants argue that even if chapter comprehensively regulates the treatment of the commonwealth wildlife resources,including the hunting thereof,the ordinance is not preempted because it is not a hunting ordinance in the first place.after all,under the home rule statute,comprehensive scheme preemption only exists where there is a comprehensive scheme of legislation on the same general subject as the challenged ordinance.emphasis added.indeed,as we have already noted,the ordinance on its face regulates only when bows and arrows may be fired within city limits.this certainly weighs against a finding of preemption.
further,given the historical background against which chapter was enacted,we can not conclude that the general assembly intended to preclude municipalities from regulating when weapons may be fired within their borders.see do,at observing that preemption turns on the general assembly inten t.kentucky high court noted over seventy years before chapter was p ractically all cities and towns have ordinances making it unlawful to discharge firearms therein lexington ry.true.and almost twenty years before that,the same court noted that for at least the half of a century,since,the legislature has shown a consistent purpose and intention that the governing authorities of municipalities have the right to make the discharge of firearms within their limits lawful or unlawful within certain limits,or at certain places or on certain occasions,thus bestowing upon such authorities a discretion as to the times and the places where firearms may be discharged.commonwealth vanmeter,emphasis added affirming conviction under ordinance stating that n o person shall shoot off a gun,pistol,sling,air gun or flobert rifle,within the city limits of sterling 
it is unlikely that when the general assembly enacted chapter,it intended to upend this tradition sub silentio and arrogate the topic of weapon discharge to its exclusive control.see valley vista,city of monterey park,d,stating that where local governments through their traditional police power have historically played the dominant role in a matter,it is less likely that the legislature intended to impliedly preempt the field.
in fact,at oral argument,sheffield counsel conceded fort thomas authority to impose an absolute ban on discharging any weapons within city limits at any time,as it had formerly done.given this concession,sheffield can not seriously dispute that the city council had the power to ban discharging less than all weapons at less than all times,as the greater power typically includes the lesser.sheffield actual complaint thus does not appear to be that the enacted text is an inherently improper exercise of municipal authority,but rather,that the city council motive in enacting hope that hunters would take advantage of it to kill deer in accordance with state improper an action the city council would otherwise have been empowered to take.
however,neither the home rule statute text nor any kentucky case appears to support such a proposition.indeed,in the context,c ourt s will not strike down an otherwise constitutional enactment on the basis of an alleged illicit motive.city of erie pap,for a plurality upholding municipal ordinance against first amendment challenge and rejecting argument that that the city council had an illicit motive in enacting the ordinance.we therefore hold that the ordinance is not preempted.
sheffield raises a similar comprehensive scheme preemption argument against the ordinance,which requires anyone who field dresses,remov es blood and internal organs from the carcass of any animal killed in conjunction with the ordinance to containerize and remove all blood and internal organs from within the city,and which prohibits the bur ial,burn ing,or other dispos al of such blood and organs within the city.sheffield argues that this provision subject matter places it squarely within the ostensibly field of hunting.we are not convinced.
first,we note that while field dressing is certainly a concept associated with the hunt,it is not technically a part of hunting,t he action or practice of chasing game or other wild animals,either for profit or sport the chase oxford english dictionary online ed accord webster third new int l dictionary unabridged at defining hunting as the act,practice,or an instance of chasing,taking,or killing wild and esp.game animals chase.and while field dressing follows close on the heels of the kill chronologically,it is arguably conceptually related just as closely,if not more so,to the process of butchering and meat preparation,which falls well outside the scope of chapter.
furthermore,that the act of field dressing occurs subsequent to the kill has special significance in light of the common law of wild animals.such animals in a state of freedom,animals ferae naturae are owned by the state in its sovereign capacity as the representative and for the benefit of all its people in common,and u pon this fact of public ownership rests,to a large extent,the governmental power of regulation of fishing and hunting d fish and game quoted in.op.att y,wl,at.however,once a wild animal is taken and reduced to possession,the property right in the carcass generally leaves the state and vests in the possessor.see also pierson post,cai.at this point,the once paramount state concern with that animal welfare has clearly waned.do,at 
finally,just as the kentucky courts have traditionally viewed municipalities as possessing the power to regulate the discharge of weapons within their boundaries,the courts have also viewed municipalities as empowered to take local public health and sanitation measures.see do,at noting that t here is no broader field of local police power than that of public health and that kentucky cases recognize the theory of concurrent local authority in the area of public health.perhaps the paradigmatic local measures are those regulating waste disposal.see valley vista,d at noting that local agencies through their traditional police power have historically played the dominant role in local sanitation matters such as waste disposal.it is beyond dispute that the sanitary disposal of blood and internal organs falls within this core area of local concern.if the general assembly in enacting its wildlife code intended to implicitly preempt municipalities traditional authority to dictate local sanitation measures tangentially related to wildlife,we believe that it would have said so.
accordingly,we hold that the ordinance is not preempted by chapter.
we reach a different outcome with respect to the ordinance.sheffield correctly points out that the ordinance ban on knowingly,purposely or intentionally feed ing deer on any public or private property within the city of fort thomas directly conflicts with.admin.regs,entitled recreational feeding of wildlife,which provides 
wildlife may be fed year round in public areas not open to legal hunting or trapping,unless otherwise prohibited by an administrative regulation or municipal ordinance.
wildlife may be fed year round within the curtilage of the home 
wildlife shall not be fed from march through may except as provided in subsections and of this section.
id.emphasis added.the ordinance clearly prohibits conduct which is explicitly permitted by the knowing,purposeful,or intentional feeding of deer within the curtilage of the home.louisville nashville,at.
defendants raise two arguments against preemption.first,they assert that,despite the administrative regulation facial applicability to all w ildlife.admin.regs.was actually intended to apply solely or primarily to wild turkeys,not deer.in support of this contention,they cite the regulatory impact analysis and tiering statement prepared by the dfwr prior to the regulation enactment this document does in fact contain a statement that.admin.regs.is necess ary because it enables law enforcement officers to more effectively enforce another regulation that prohibits the use of bait for hunting turkeys.admin.register.however,this is not the only reason the document gives as to why the regulation is necessary 
and in any event,regardless of which animals the feeding ban was intended to protect,the specific provision permitting feeding within the curtilage of the home was clearly not intended for the benefit of the animals which would presumably be best served by an absolute ban on human interference.rather,the telltale word curtilage demonstrates that this particular provision in the regulation was intended to guarantee the domestic interests of property owners.see oliver united states,describing the privileged constitutional status of the curtilage,the area to which extends the intimate activity associated with the sanctity of a man home and the privacies of life quoting boyd united states.
defendants also argue that even if the ordinance is in direct conflict with.admin.regs,administrative regulations,as opposed to statutes,have no preemptive force.the district court accepted this argument,noting that while the home rule statute specifically prohibits a municipality from enacting ordinances that conflict with constitutional or statutory provisions,it is silent regarding a municipality authority to act in the face of a conflicting administrative regulation.kelly,d at citing.relying on the canon that a court may not insert language to arrive at a meaning different from that created by the stated language of a statute,the district court concluded that the home rule statute silence as to the preemptive force of administrative regulations means that they have no such force.ibid.quoting peter garrett gunsmith,city of dayton,emphasis omitted.
while the district court was quite possibly correct in its reading of the home rule statute,we believe the district court erred by treating the home rule statute as the beginning and end of the preemption question,rather than further considering the question in light of the common law of relations.viewing the question from this broader perspective,we are satisfied that the kentucky supreme court would hold that state regulations have the same preemptive force as statutes.
the relative powers of municipal and state governments under american common law were authoritatively described over years ago by the preeminent theorist and chief justice of the iowa supreme court john forrest dillon 
municipal corporations owe their origin to,and derive their powers and rights wholly from,the legislature.it breathes into them the breath of life,without which they can not exist.as it creates,so it may destroy municipalities are,so to phrase it,the mere tenants at will of the legislature.
city of clinton cedar rapids.river,iowa.dillon observed that t his plenary power on the part of the legislature over public corporations is a doctrine so well settled that it is unnecessary to refer to more than a few cases asserting it.ibid.as a result of municipalities lack of any inherent right of local,a city generally had no power to pass a given ordinance without express permission from the legislature to do so a principle that came to be known as dillon rule.see dillon,municipal corporations,at,ed quoted in note,municipal home rule for kentucky.accord city of bowling green gasoline marketers.
it also followed directly from the status of municipalities as mere tenants at will of the legislature,exercising their authority by legislative grace alone,that any municipal act in conflict with the legislature superior enactments was null and void.see boyle campbell,an ordinance in conflict with a state law is universally held to be invalid.march commonwealth,ky a power vested by the legislature in a city corporation can not be considered as imparting by implication a power to repeal the laws of the state,or supersede them by any of its ordinances.it was even stated that municipal authorities can not adopt ordinances which infringe the spirit of a state law or are repugnant to the general policy of the state.arnold commonwealth ex rel.city of somerset,quoting.municipal corporations emphases added accord municipal corporations municipal regulations should not be repugnant to the established or public policy of the state.
because these principles of relations were fleshed out well before the rise of the modern state in the new deal era,see william eskridge,john ferejohn,the article i,section game,geo,dillon canonical treatment of the law of relations does not specifically address conflicts between ordinances and regulations.however,given the common law principle of absolute municipal subordination to the just to the state statutes,but also its general policy we have little doubt that the common law would ascribe the same preemptive force to validly promulgated statewide regulations as it does to statutes.while sparse,the kentucky case law from the rule era supports this conclusion.see dep t of alcoholic beverage control,the legislature having chosen the alcoholic beverage control board as its agency,and having delegated to it the power to control and regulate liquor licenses,we conclude that it was the legislative intent that the board has a superior right to the city to control licensing.
indeed,the kentucky supreme court has observed in a different context that a dministrative regulations properly adopted and filed have the force and effect of law,and have the same effect as statutes enacted directly by the legislative body from which the administrative agency derives its authority.rietze williams,holding that rule that one injured by a violation of a statute may recover from a defendant such damages as he has sustained by reason of that violation also applies to violation of administrative regulation see also city of owensboro bd.of trustees,city of owensboro employees pension fund,any law directly passed by the legislature of a state,and any enactment to which a state gives the force of law,is treated as a statute of the state.quoting fed.trust hartford fire,cir 
treatises and other secondary authorities appear to be in agreement that state regulations have preemptive force.see mcquillin,the law of municipal corporations ed.in no event may a city enforce restrictions or regulations which are in conflict with the plain mandate of a legislative enactment or state administrative regulations promulgated pursuant to legislative authority.emphasis added municipal corporations conflicts between regulations promulgated pursuant to properly delegated authority and ordinances are governed by the same principles governing conflicts between statutes and ordinances.d municipal corporations a local ordinance may be invalid because it conflicts with a state regulation if the state regulation has the force and effect of law.
it also bears noting that under preemption doctrine,f ederal regulations have no less effect with respect to state laws than federal statutes so long as the regulations are within the scope of the agency delegated authority.fidelity fed.sav.and loan ass de la cuesta.it would be surprising if the common law of preemption were otherwise.
of course,none of this would matter if kentucky home rule statute,which does not mention preemption by administrative regulation,was intended to abrogate the rules of preemption and impose a new,strictly statutory preemption regime.we are convinced,however,that this was not the legislature intent.
the home rule statute was enacted in in order to obviate the need for the great number of statutes delegating specific powers which had previously been the only way the general assembly could delegate powers to cities,and thereby give cities in kentucky far greater flexibility and authority to handle their local affairs than they ever had in the past.david morris,municipal law.the statute does this by granting municipalities a blanket authorization to adopt all ordinances.see id.at.
while the home rule statute purports to specify when a municipal ordinance will be preempted,the kentucky legislative research commission,an adjunct body to the state legislature,has opined that t he preemption language in the home rule statute merely restates the common law in kentucky on the relationship of local ordinances to state law.kentucky legislative research commission,informational bulletin kentucky municipal statutory law,available at http last visited august,emphasis added.similarly,a leading scholarly article on the home rule statute explains 
th e home rule statute approach to preemption does not represent a new concept the drafters of the statute attempted to codify the common law rule of state supremacy over local governments 
it is unclear if the courts will feel bound by the home rule statute legislative restatement of the judicially formulated rule of preemption.since the definition so closely parallels the common law rule,it may well be ignored and the courts may continue reconciling clashes between local governments and the state in accordance with the common law
