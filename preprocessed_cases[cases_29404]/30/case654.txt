plaintiffs,california sea urchin commission and other commercial fishing groups,appeal the district court dismissal of their complaint alleging that the fish and wildlife service fws violated its statutory authority under public law by terminating a translocation program for the southern sea otter.the district court dismissed the complaint,concluding that it constituted a facial challenge to a regulation and was thus untimely.reviewing the dismissal de novo,fireman fund ins.city of lodi,cir,we reverse and remand for the reasons that follow.
the southern sea otter,also known as the california sea otter,historically ranged throughout the california coast,but was hunted to near extinction for its fur in the and.the southern sea otter was listed as a threatened species under the endangered species act esa in.although the sea otter population and range had increased since federal and state bans on hunting in the early,it was still only about of its historical level at the time of listing.fed.reg,final rule.in,fws finalized a recovery plan for the sea otter,which determined that the most effective means of recovery was to establish a new colony far enough away from the present range that a oil spill could not wipe out the entire population.id.
in,congress authorized fws to develop and implement a plan for the relocation and management of a population of california sea otters from the existing range of the parent population to another location.pub.b.fws then promulgated the final rule,which implemented the program and chose san nicolas island as the home of the experimental population.fed.reg.at.the fishing industry,including the groups that are plaintiffs here,was opposed to an expansion of the sea otter population.the fishing industry participated in the rulemaking process and opposed the experimental population because it perceived a new population of sea otters,and their accompanying federal protections under the esa and the marine mammal protection act mmpa,as onerous.another source of conflict is that sea otters prey on many species that are harvested commercially,including sea urchin,lobster,and abalone.congress authorized the experimental population on the condition that fws include an otter management zone,which would be free of otters,to protect fishing,oil,and military interests.pub.b fed.reg.at.congress required fws to use all feasible means to capture and remove otters from the management zone to prevent,to the maximum extent feasible,conflict with other fishery resources.pub.b b.fishermen who incidentally harmed otters while conducting lawful activities in the management zone were exempted from the take prohibitions of the esa and the mmpa.pub.c.the management zone covered the entire southern california coast from point conception to the mexico border,except for the experimental population on san nicolas island.
the final rule acknowledged that there was some chance the translocation program would not succeed.to determine whether the project should be continued or terminated,fws included in the final rule five termination criteria fed.reg.at.fws planned to terminate the experimental population if it found that any one of the criteria was met.id.
from the start of the translocation program,the experimental sea otter population was plagued by high mortality and emigration.fed.reg.in,fws stopped removing sea otters that were found in the management zone,though the esa and mmpa exemptions remained in effect.fws prepared several environmental impact statements on the effects of terminating the program and reinitiated esa consultation,culminating in a biological opinion concluding that resumption of otter removal in the management zone would likely jeopardize the otter continued existence.fed.reg.
despite the recognized failures of the translocation program,the management zone esa and mmpa take exemptions continued as before.in,friends of the sea otter and other environmental organizations sued fws for unreasonable delay in terminating the translocation program.the parties reached a settlement that required fws to issue a final decision on program termination by the end of.on december,fws promulgated a rule terminating the program based on application of the final rule termination criteria.fed.reg.at.fws analysis concluded that the translocation program met the final rule second failure criterion fewer than otters remain and the reasons for emigration or mortality can not be identified remedied.id.at fed.reg.at.
plaintiffs filed suit in early,alleging that the program termination exceeded fws statutory authority under public law plaintiffs contend that congress gave fws the authority only to implement the otter translocation program,not to terminate it,and that congress did not authorize the termination criteria in the final rule.thus,plaintiffs contend,the program termination exceeded the agency statutory authority.

plaintiffs complaint claims that fws lacks the statutory authority to terminate the translocation program that public law provides no authority to fws to cease such program once it has been initiated.fws contends that the complaint is really a facial challenge to the final rule,which laid out the termination criteria fws relied on in.such a challenge would be far outside the statute of limitations.plaintiffs,on the other hand,contend that the program termination was the operative final agency action,and that the final rule is relevant only because it provides fws authorization for the termination.this would place the complaint well within the statute of limitations.
we conclude that the operative agency action challenged is the program termination,and thus that plaintiffs challenge is timely.we express no opinion on the merits of plaintiffs underlying claims.we hold only that plaintiffs may challenge fws termination of the program within six years of the decision to terminate the program,and were not required to bring suit within six years of the rulemaking espousing the authority to terminate the program.to hold otherwise would require plaintiffs to have filed suit nearly a decade before fws took the action that caused their injury.
the final rule was clearly a final agency action,but so too was the program termination.although the final rule laid out the criteria through which the translocation program could be terminated at some future date,fws did not terminate the program until,when it determined that the southern sea otter translocation program has failed to fulfill its purpose fed.reg.at.although plaintiffs can not now challenge the final rule,they can challenge its application in the program termination as exceeding the agency statutory authority.see ctr.for biological diversity salazar,cir.holding that while the plaintiffs were from challenging a regulatory definition,they can challenge fws alleged application of that definition in the chukchi sea regulations as exceeding the agency statutory authority.
fws contends that because plaintiffs challenge is brought against fws underlying authority as asserted in the final rule,the challenge existed at the time the final rule was promulgated and plaintiffs unjustifiably waited more than years to sue.we disagree.plaintiffs did not wait to sue,because the issue did not become salient until fws actually terminated the program,in.a plaintiff can not be expected to anticipate all possible future challenges to a rule and bring
