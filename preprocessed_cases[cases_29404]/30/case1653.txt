james wilson and michael hackett proponents appeal the denial of their petition for a writ of mandate seeking to compel respondents,the county of napa and john tuteur in his official capacity as registrar of voters for the county of napa collectively,the registrar,to place on the county ballot their proposed initiative measure entitled water,forest and oak woodland protection initiative of.the registrar refused to do so as he was advised by county counsel that the measure does not comply with the full text requirement of elections code section because the measure includes a permit requirement for removing certain oak trees requiring compliance with the best management practices set forth in appendix d,sections and of the napa county voluntary oak woodland management plan without including the text of those best management practices.we conclude that the trial court correctly held the proposed initiative does not comply with the full text requirement.the measure does not simply another provision of law but would enact as binding conditions for permission to remove certain oak trees what are now only recommended measures for voluntary compliance.
background 
in february proponents submitted to the registrar their initiative petition containing the requisite number of signatures for submission of the measure to the voters of the county of napa at the earliest special or general election for which it qualifies.after initially certifying that the initiative qualified for placement on the ballot,the registrar rejected the petition based on advice from county counsel that the measure did not comply with the full text requirement of section.
the initiative measure consists of sections filling pages.its purpose is stated to be to protect the water quality,biological productivity and economic and environmental value of napa county streams,watersheds,wetlands and forests,and to safeguard the public health,safety and welfare of the county residents.by various amendments to the county general plan and the county code,the measure would,among other things,amend the goals and policies of the general plan,require additional water quality buffer zones to be established along streams and wetlands,and increase the minimum ratio for replacing lost oak woodlands in an agricultural watershed zoning district from a ratio to a ratio.the measure would also add to title of the napa county code a new section,establishing an oak removal permit program,which contains the provisions found to be in noncompliance with section.
section would require one to obtain an oak removal permit to remove from a single parcel of five or more acres within an agricultural watershed district during a calendar year any valley oak tree of a specified minimum size or or more oak trees of any species of a specified minimum size.the section specifies the information that must be included in an application for an oak removal permit,which must include a proposed oak removal plan prepared and signed by a registered professional forester or certified arborist.the plan must include,among other information,remediation measures,and a permit may not be approved if p roposed remediation measures are not adequate under subsection e.subsection e in turn provides,among other things,at a minimum,adequate remediation shall include.compliance with the best management practices for tree protection during construction activities set forth in appendix d,section of the napa county voluntary oak woodland management plan and.replacement of removed oak trees or oak woodlands at a ratio or permanent preservation of comparable oak trees or oak woodlands at a ratio by permanently preserving comparable oak trees or oak woodlands through dedications,conservation easements,or similar measures or replanting and monitoring of replacement oak trees pursuant to a plan that ensures replacement of failed plantings and complies with the best management practices for maintenance,restoration,and rehabilitation of oak woodlands set forth in appendix d,section of the napa county voluntary woodland management plan.italics added.
when the registrar rejected the petition because the initiative does not include or attach the provisions of the napa county voluntary woodland management plan the management plan specifying the best management practices referred to in section e,the proponents sought a writ of mandate directing the registrar to place the initiative on the ballot.following a hearing,the superior court denied the petition for a writ of mandate,reasoning as follows the initiative,in referencing sections and and deeming them mandatory,will enact them into binding legal requirements under proposed county code section.proponents argument that the best management practices are not being enacted or adopted is belied by the plain and specific language of the initiative.b ecause the text of sections and in appendix d of the napa county voluntary oak woodland management plan was omitted from the initiative petition that was circulated for signatures,the initiative does not contain the full and complete text of everything that will be enacted if the voters approve it as is required by elections code section,citing we care santa paula herrera th,we care.
proponents promptly filed an emergency petition in this court for issuance of an extraordinary writ,which this court denied summarily without reaching the merits,as did the supreme court with respect to an emergency petition filed in that court.proponents then filed a notice of appeal,and this court granted an application for expedited review so that the matter may be resolved before the next local election.
discussion 
because there is no dispute as to the facts and the issue presented is solely one of statutory interpretation,we review the matter de novo.alliance for a better downtown millbrae wade th.
section of the elections code requires an initiative petition to contain the full text of the measure that the initiative proposes to enact in reviewing compliance with this requirement,immaterial deviations may be excused so long as there is substantial compliance.t he governing california decisions consistently have applied a substantial compliance rule in this context,realistically evaluating whether the particular defect in question frustrates the purposes of the applicable election requirement.costa superior court cal th.i n determining whether a departure from statutory requirements imposed on initiative or referendum petitions by provisions should be viewed as invalidating a circulated petition,past california decisions have been most concerned with departures that affect the integrity of the process by misleading or withholding vital information from those persons whose signatures are solicited.id.at.t he type of defect that most often has been found fatal is the failure of an initiative or referendum petition to comply with the statutory requirement of setting forth in sufficient detail the text of the proposed initiative measure or the legislative act against which the referendum is brought so that registered voters can intelligently evaluate whether to sign the initiative petition and to avoid confusion.id.at,fn.
the initiative petition in this case sets forth in full all of the provisions that the initiative proposes to enact.however,because the measure incorporates provisions of the management plan without stating or attaching those provisions,the registrar contends the petition does not comply with the full text requirement for the same reasons that the petition was held not to comply in mervyn reyes th mervyn.in mervyn,the initiative petition referred to,but did not actually contain,the various provisions that the initiative would have enacted.id.at.in that case,the proposed initiative read the people hereby the open space land use designations parks and recreation,baylands,limited open space of the general policies plan map and the supporting policies in chapter vii open space,parks and recreation,chapter viii environmental concerns and chapter ix urban design of the general policies plan of the city of hayward in effect on january.mervyn.the actual text of the referenced policies was not included in or attached to the petition.the court held that the purpose of the full text requirement is to provide sufficient information so that registered voters can intelligently evaluate whether to sign the initiative petition and to avoid confusion.id.at.i t is imperative that persons evaluating whether to sign the petition be advised which laws are being challenged and which will remain the same.only inclusion of the existing general plan will accomplish such purpose.id.at.although the text of the initiative petition contained reference to the policies that the measure would enact,because the petition omitted the text of those policies which the court considered the key element of the initiative,the petition did not comply with the full text requirement and the city council had the ministerial duty to reject the petition.id.at.
proponents,on the other hand,place heavy reliance on we care,supra,th,in which the court held that the failure to include in an initiative petition the text of the land use element of the city general plan,to which reference was made in the petition,did not cause the petition to violate the full text requirement.in we care,the proposed initiative read in part this initiative hereby amends the general plan land use element adopted on or about april,and as amended thereafter,to require any future amendment to the general plan land use element involving a development,proposed development,or land use designation,which would have the effect of increasing the density as currently reflected in the land use element on a gross of or more acres,to be approved by a majority of the voters at a general or special election.id.at.the court of appeal held that although the petition sought to amend the general plan,the amendment does not change any land use or density designated in the general plan.nor does it even purport to prohibit any change in land use or density.it simply adds a provision to the general plan requiring that any increase in density for projects involving or more acres be approved by popular vote.the petition contains the full text of the measure.there is no need to include any portion of the general plan.certainly,the passage of we care initiative will affect the general plan.but the statute does not require that a petition include the text of every plan,law or ordinance the measure might affect.id.at.
the court in we care distinguished the petition in mervyn and in other cases finding petitions not to comply with the full text rule.we care petition does not seek to amend the general plan by nothing more than reference to headings,titles or numbers.unlike several other cases,we care petition does not omit the text of an incorporated exhibit or any other portion of the proposed enactment.instead,the petition contains the full and complete text of everything that will be enacted if the voters approve it.we care,supra,th at.
the distinction drawn in we care is dispositive and confirms that the proposed initiative in this case does not comply with the full text rule.the initiative in we care,which complied with the statutory requirement,set forth the full and complete text of everything that will be enacted if the voters approve it.we care,supra,th at.the proposed initiative in mervyn,which did not comply,merely referred to,but did not actually contain,the various provisions that the initiative would have enacted.mervyn,supra,th at.the latter is the case here.without stating or attaching the content of the best management practices included in the management plan,to which the measure refers,the proposed initiative would convert what are now recommended voluntary practices into mandatory practices with which an applicant would be required to comply in order to obtain a removal permit.a person presented with the petition could not ascertain from the petition itself the content of the best management practices to which the proposed initiative refers but would be required to do extraneous research to learn what practices the measure would require of a permit applicant.the purpose of the full text requirement is to provide sufficient information so that registered voters can intelligently evaluate whether to sign the initiative petition and to avoid confusion.ibid.as is true of the full text requirement applicable to referendum petitions,the statute underlying purpose is minimizing the possibility prospective signers may misunderstand the purpose of a petition.nelson carlson th.although technical deficiencies in a petition will not invalidate the petition if there is substantial compliance with the statutory requirements,there is no substantial compliance if the defect frustrates the purpose of the requirement.id.at,accord billig voges d.the omission of the best management practices with which the proposed initiative would compel compliance frustrates the purpose of the full text rule and therefore invalidates the petition.
proponents principal argument is that the initiative on its face clearly does not enact best management practices,either expressly or otherwise.but as the trial court correctly observed,this contention is belied by the terms of the measure,set out above.in order for a holder of five or more acres to obtain a permit to remove oak trees in the area to which the measure would apply,it would be necessary to comply with management practices that are not at present mandatory.the initiative would impose legal obligations on permit applicants that do not presently exist and in that sense the best management practices would clearly be enacted.
proponents overstate the consequences of this conclusion.we do not imply that may never be included in an initiative petition.are commonly and permissibly used in both initiatives and referendums.their inclusion presents no problem so long as the reference does not create or impose new legal obligations that are not otherwise specified in the measure.that not all impose new legal obligations invalidating a petition is exemplified by the several propositions in the statewide ballot to which proponents refer in their argument these initiatives did not purport to enact provisions by making previously voluntary practices mandatory,as does the initiative before us.the first initiative cited by the proponents merely relates to the manner of amending the statute,much like the initiative in we care,supra,th in most of the others the provisions had previously been enacted and the initiative merely required compliance with obligations thus,there is no merit to proponents argument that the trial court expansive new full text requirement would render all of these propositions invalid for failing to include the language of the referenced policies as part of their text.the interpretation of the full text requirement adopted by the trial court which we affirm is neither new nor would it invalidate all other initiatives containing a cross reference.
nor is there any inconsistency between this conclusion and the decision in lin city of pleasanton th,on which proponents also rely.lin
