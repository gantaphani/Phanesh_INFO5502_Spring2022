the state of new york appeals from orders of the united states district court for the western district of new york elfvin,district judge dismissing its claims against of panex industries,a dissolved delaware corporation.the state asserted these claims several years after panex had been dissolved,outside the corporate windup period established by delaware general corporation law and before obtaining a judgment against panex as required by delaware general corporation law b,but the state argues that its claims are valid under the common law equitable trust fund doctrine.the from the district court denial of a motion to dismiss the state cercla claims against panex and the summary judgment granted to the state on those claims.they argue that delaware general corporation law governs and that panex lacked capacity to be sued under the statute because it had been dissolved for over three years by the time the state notified panex of its claims and filed suit.the district court found that cercla preempted section in this instance.
the issues raised in this appeal are one chapter in a complex tale involving numerous parties.at the heart of the suit is the state effort to recover million in unreimbursed environmental response costs that it has paid to investigate and clean up the landfill site in allegany county,new york 
panex industries,was formed in under delaware law as part of the reorganization plan of its predecessor company,duplan corporation.one of duplan operating divisions had been the rochester button company,a manufacturing plant.in the early,rochester button used the landfill site to dispose of its industrial waste,placing much of it in a special disposal pit designated for rochester button exclusive use.there was abundant evidence that rochester button made substantial deposits of hazardous waste at the landfill during the course of its operations.the new york state department of environmental conservation ultimately determined that the site presented a significant threat to the public health and environment,and the state began incurring response costs in connection with its investigation of contamination at the site in april.
meanwhile,unaware of the contamination at the landfill site or of the state recently commenced investigation,panex shareholders voted to dissolve the corporation on september.panex filed its certification of dissolution effecting its formal dissolution under delaware law on april.to facilitate the corporate,panex liquidation plan created a stockholder liquidating trust,which was intended in part to reduce tax liability arising after dissolution,see city investing.liquidating trust continental casualty.panex former shareholders had received liquidating distributions totaling million before the trust was created.the trust received million in funding at its inception,and it distributed about million to former shareholders in july when the statute of limitations had run on its and tax years and there were no other known panex liabilities.in all,the received over million in distributions.the in this action were among those distributees.
delaware general corporation law generally establishes a continuation period,beginning at dissolution,for dissolved corporations to wind up their affairs and for unknown claimants to assert claims against the corporation.after this period,the corporation ceases to exist and lacks capacity to be sued.the state sent panex formal notice of its claim for response costs at the landfill site in march,but panex did not receive the notice until april,over three years after its dissolution which occurred on april,thus just after the period expired.upon receipt of this notice,the trustees of the panex trust extended the life of the trust and postponed further distributions.for the next several years,the state conducted investigations at the site and,in,formulated a remediation plan.
after adopting the remediation plan,the state filed this action in the western district of new york against panex,the panex trust,and the purchasers of the rochester button assets,among others,asserting federal claims under cercla and nuisance claims under new york law.on behalf of panex,its trustees moved to dismiss,arguing that delaware general corporation law barred all claims against panex because the suit was filed more than three years after its dissolution.the district court dismissed the nuisance claims but denied the motion to dismiss the cercla claims,holding that cercla preempted delaware statutory limit on the dissolved corporation capacity to be sued.
in march,the costs of defending this and another cercla lawsuit had depleted the panex trust further,and the district court granted the state leave to join panex as defendants in this action.the state asserts claims under the common law equitable trust fund doctrine,which allows claimants against a dissolved or insolvent corporation to follow the distributed assets of the corporation into the hands of its shareholders in order to satisfy the corporation liability.see,koch united states,cir.
panex moved to dismiss the claims against them under federal rules of civil procedure b and b.the district court granted the motion on october,ruling that the trust fund doctrine did not survive delaware enactment of section,which barred the state claims because they were not brought within three years of panex dissolution.the district court also concluded that the state claim against the was premature on the ground that delaware general corporation law b required the state to obtain a judgment against panex and the panex trust,and have that judgment returned unsatisfied,before pursuing recovery from the,which the state had not done.the court rejected the state argument that it should adopt the trust fund doctrine as a matter of federal common law under cercla,which would in turn preempt the delaware statutes.as a result of this ruling,the were dismissed as defendants.
seven years later,the district court granted summary judgment to the state on its cercla claims against panex and the successor trust that had succeeded the panex trust,concluding that cercla preempts the delaware statutory limits that otherwise would bar suit against the dissolved corporation.the district court judgment held panex and the successor trust jointly and severally liable to the state for under cercla,and declared that those entities were jointly and severally liable for all future response costs incurred by the state in cleaning up the site under cercla g.neither panex nor the successor trust has any assets to pay the judgment,so,if the state is going to recover from anyone,it must be the.thus,the state appeals the district court order dismissing its claims against the.the the grant of summary judgment against panex and the denial of an earlier motion to dismiss the claims against panex in light of the state failure to file suit within the period established by delaware general corporation law.
the state advances four arguments in its appeal 
the district court erred in determining that section bars the state claim against the,because the common law trust fund doctrine survives enactment of the statute 
the district court erred in holding that the state claims against the were premature under section b because it had not first obtained an unsatisfied judgment against panex 
the district court correctly held that cercla preempts any time limits that delaware general corporation law would place on the state claims against panex,and the court should have allowed its claims against the to proceed on the same grounds and 
the district court erred in refusing to recognize that the trust fund doctrine applies in any cercla suit as a matter of federal common law.
on,the argue that the district court erred in finding that cercla preempts delaware law limitation on the dissolved corporation panex capacity to be sued after the expiration of the period.
the state argues that the district court erred in holding that delaware general corporation law and b bar its claims against the panex.according to the state,the trust fund doctrine permits claims against dissolved corporations to go forward with no special time limit,and sections and b have no effect upon its continued relevance.we review the district court decision to grant the motion to dismiss de novo.see cooper parsky,cir.
we first address the state argument that the trust fund doctrine survives enactment of delaware general corporation law,ann.tit,allowing its claims against panex and the to proceed even though suit was filed more than three years after panex dissolution.under the common law,dissolution of a corporation terminated its existence as a legal entity,thus abating all pending actions by and against it and terminating its capacity to sue or be sued.in re citadel.the trust fund doctrine first arose,in part,to compensate for this rather harsh rule,giving creditors some protection in the event of a corporate dissolution.in re rego.essentially,the trust fund doctrine gave creditors an equitable right to follow corporate assets after dissolution,such that the assets are held like a trust in which the creditors have a claim superior to that of the shareholders.see also koch united states,cir snyder nathan,cir.
several states have enacted statutes that continue the existence of corporations for a definite period of time following dissolution,thereby providing a statutory remedy for the difficulties associated with the common law abatement rule.considering that the equitable remedy arose in order to supply relief where none existed,it may be argued that adequate statutory remedies deprive courts of equitable jurisdiction.see george wallach,products liability a remedy in search of a effect of a sale of assets and subsequent dissolution on product dissatisfaction claims.indeed,several courts construing such statutes have concluded that the statutory remedies available to creditors obviate reliance upon equitable remedies,thereby precluding their use by the courts.see,reconstruction fin.teter,cir holding that illinois statutes completely regulate and control both the substantive and procedural rights of a corporation creditors hunter fort worth capital,the effect of these statutes was to supplant the equitable trust fund theory by declaring a statutory equivalent.but see green oilwell,div.of steel,holding that state law did not provide a direct remedy for creditors and therefore did not displace the trust fund doctrine.the delaware court of chancery has addressed this issue briefly,explaining that the problem that the trust fund doctrine addresses has been ameliorated by provisions in the corporate codes of most or all jurisdictions that continue the existence of the corporation as a jural entity for limited purposes following dissolution.in re rego,at.
delaware statute,section of the delaware general corporation law,was enacted in order to formalize the continued existence of corporate assets and to provide a mechanism for the assertion of claims as part of the winding up process continuing the corporation existence by operation of law.city investing.liquidating trust continental casualty.like other statutes,section provides that any suit against the corporation,which was filed before dissolution or during the three year statutory period,does not abate,even on the expiration of the period.in re rego,at.when the period expires,however,so does the corporation capacity to be sued.
the initial question before this court is whether section supersedes the trust fund doctrine,preventing the state claims against panex from going forward because the state filed suit after the expiration of the period.the state argues that because section does not explicitly address the remedies available to creditors against,section does not supersede the trust fund doctrine as to these defendants.the district court noted,however,that the trust fund doctrine has never been used by a delaware law court to circumvent section in any situation.other courts also have recognized that the trust fund doctrine has been superseded by statutes,and the district court cited three cases to support this proposition pacific scene,penasquitos,cal d,cal hunter,and blankenship demmler manufacturing,d.
the state argues that the district court reliance upon these cases is misplaced because they involve statutes that provide specific statutory remedies against,unlike section,thereby limiting their applicability.thus,california corporations code restored to creditors a direct remedy against the former shareholders of dissolved corporations,pacific scene,at in texas,article of the texas business corporation act applies to officers,directors,and shareholders of a dissolved corporation,hunter,at and in illinois,the survival statute provided that corporate dissolution shall not take away or impair any remedy available to or against such corporation,its directors,or shareholders for claims accruing before dissolution as long as suit was filed within the two year period,blankenship,at.
these cases support the conclusion that section applies to this case.first,in concluding that statutory remedies supersede the common law trust fund doctrine,all three cases address as a policy matter the necessity of protecting shareholders,together with officers and corporations,from uncertain liability this reduces the significance of differences in statutory language.see,pacific scene,at stating that shareholders nonetheless possess an important statutory interest in the final and certain termination of their involvement with the affairs of a dissolving corporation hunter,at stating that article expresses a legislative policy to restrict the use of the trust fund theory to claims,and to protect shareholders,officers and directors of a dissolved corporation from prolonged and uncertain liability.we recognize that shareholders,officers,and corporations all have an interest in certainty and finality.see william fletcher,cyclopedia of the law of corporations the trust fund doctrine is fuzzy statutes by contrast are sharp.accordingly,the adoption of corporate dissolution statutes has supplanted the equitable trust theory in most jurisdictions.
second,all three cases deal with claims,so the courts were addressing the availability of the trust fund doctrine despite statutory schemes that limit remedies to claims.the cases question whether to apply the trust fund doctrine in order to provide remedies,which explains the emphasis on statutory construction and whether the statutes regulate corporate liability to the point of superceding the trust fund doctrine.see,hunter,at stating that no real purpose would be served by permitting suits against officers,directors,and shareholders of a dissolved corporation,unless the legislature intended for the statute to bar resort to the trust fund theory apart from the statute in order to enforce claims.to hold otherwise would violate the rule of statutory construction that the legislature is never presumed to do a useless act pacific scene,at courts and commenters have been troubled by the implication that legislators uselessly created a redundant statutory remedy for a subclass of claims concurrently remediable in equity.
in contrast,the instant case involves a claim accruing before panex dissolution.therefore the key question is not whether section completely supersedes the trust fund doctrine,but is instead the narrower question of whether section provides a remedy for the state claim against panex former shareholders contrary to the state assertions,several delaware cases suggest that the court of chancery interprets section as applying to claims against both corporations and shareholders that arise before dissolution.the court in in re rego briefly discussed the relationship between the trust fund doctrine and statutory remedies.it acknowledged that section addresses the same problems as the trust fund doctrine,but it also recognized that the modern scheme still leaves open the question,what,if any,rights are afforded to persons who have no claim against a corporation at the time of its dissolution,or during the statutory period,but who do thereafter acquire such a claim.in re rego,at.the court concluded that a corporation could not be liable for a claim,but characterized the possibility that shareholders and directors may be liable as an unclear and troubling question.id.
the crucial question for the court in analyzing statutory remedies was whether a claim arose before or after the statutory period,not whether the defendant was the corporation,the directors,or the shareholders by addressing the fact that shareholders and directors may be liable in the modern scheme,but only in the context of claims,the court was implicitly recognizing that section covers all potential claims,regardless of which corporate constituent is named as the defendant.
similarly,in in re citadel industries,the court made no distinction between potential defendants when it analyzed the expiration of the statutory period.the court concluded that the corporation no longer existed as a body corporate.it no longer had legal existence as a corporation t here was no longer a legal entity which could be continued through its officers,directors and shareholders.in re citadel industries,at.the court also expressed concern that o nce a corporation is dissolved,the following period run,all known debts paid,and all remaining assets distributed to shareholders,h ow can a vast number of former shareholders be compelled to return any final distribution of assets,id.at.although section does not set forth specific remedies against shareholders,there is evidence that the court of chancery considers section to be a comprehensive statutory remedy available to creditors for claims against all potential defendants,including the corporation,its officers,and its shareholders 
we are persuaded by the general consensus that modern statutory remedies have effectively replaced the trust fund doctrine and that there are sound reasons for abiding by the period established by section.we therefore conclude that the district court correctly held that the state claims against the are barred by section.
having concluded that section applies to the state claims against panex and its former shareholders,we must likewise conclude that delaware general corporation law b bars the state claims against the.as the state points out,delaware law requires that for section b to apply,the defendants must be liable by the provisions of this chapter.ann.tit.a.the state argues that this precludes application of section b in this case because it is a suit arising in equity.
in light of our conclusion that section provides the only basis for liability,the state argument must fail.section applies to claims against shareholders that arise before dissolution,so therefore section b also applies and the state must obtain judgment against panex before pursuing its claim against the.
as we have concluded that the delaware statutes bar the state claims against panex and its,we turn to the state argument that those statutes should not apply in the face of cercla.the district court accepted this argument as to panex,holding that cercla preempted delaware general corporation law limitation on panex capacity to be sued.it rejected the argument as to the,however,reasoning that delaware law controls because any liability of the would arise from their amenability to suit under delaware law,not from cercla or federal common law.we hold that cercla does not require displacement of delaware law in this case,and the suits against both the and panex are barred.
the state first contends that delaware law conflicts with the federal policy expressed in cercla,such that the cercla limitations period set forth at g b preempts the corporate period established by delaware general corporation law.alternatively,the state urges this court to displace the delaware statutes and apply the trust fund doctrine as a matter of federal common law in cercla cases,allowing it to pursue panex assets that have been distributed to panex former shareholders.
we begin with the observation that corporate law is overwhelmingly the province of the states.see kamen kemper fin,d.the federal rules of civil procedure provide that state law governs a corporation capacity to be sued.b,and the supreme court has held that h ow long and upon what terms a corporation may continue to exist is a matter exclusively of state power,with the federal government powerless to resurrect a corporation which the state has put out of existence for all purposes.chicago title trust wilcox.see also melrose distillers,united states,d state law determines the question of corporate existence.whether framed in terms of conflict preemption or in terms of the creation of federal common law,the supreme court expressly has cautioned against displacement of state law in areas traditionally occupied by the states.see,english,d warning that preemption of areas that have been traditionally occupied by the states is inappropriate absent clear and manifest congressional intent to supersede state law atherton fdic,d stating that congress legislates against the background of state law,so a significant conflict between federal policy and state law must be specifically shown before the creation of federal common law is justified.keeping these principles in mind,we address in turn each of the state arguments for displacement of delaware corporate law.
conflict preemption 
to determine whether cercla preempts the delaware statutes,we must ascertain the intent of congress.cal.fed.sav.loan ass guerra,d.the supreme court has identified three situations that show congressional intent to preempt state law where congress expressly states its intent to preempt where congress scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to give rise to a reasonable inference that it leaves no room for the state to act and where state law actually conflicts with federal law.id.at.cercla does not expressly state an intent to preempt state law across the board.see bedford affiliates sills,cir.while cercla does state that it applies n otwithstanding any other provision or rule of law,a,this clause refers only to substantive liability and does not express congressional intent to preempt state rules on how litigation proceeds,including a party amenability to suit.see citizens bituminous fire marine ins,cir.nor is the cercla regulatory scheme so comprehensive that we reasonably can infer an intent to preempt in fact,state corporate law can supplement cercla in several situations.bedford affiliates,at.
our inquiry therefore focuses on the third preemption scenario,whether delaware law actually conflicts with cercla.an actual conflict between state and federal law exists when compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,guerra,at.quoting.lime avocado growers,paul,d,or when state law is an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,guerra,at.quoting hines davidowitz.absent clear congressional intent to the contrary,federal preemption of state law is not favored,see english,at,especially in areas of law traditionally occupied by the states.as we observed above,corporate law is one of these areas.kamen,at.for preemption to occur in this instance,then,the conflict between state law and federal policy must be a sharp one.see boyle united tech,d.
the physical impossibility form of conflict does not exist here,because it is certainly possible to comply with the cercla limitations period and delaware limits on the amenability to suit of dissolved corporations and their.as long as a cercla plaintiff files its claim within three years of the corporation dissolution as required by delaware general corporation law,or seeks extension of the period from the court of chancery within that time as section allows,it also meets cercla limitations period,g.see witco beekhuis,cir finding no actual conflict where it was physically possible for cercla claimant to file within cercla limitations period and period established by delaware nonclaim statute,which also contained a mechanism to preserve contingent cercla contribution claims.that a cercla plaintiff,like the state here,might find it impossible to comply with both statutes in some circumstances is not enough to establish an actual conflict between the two in this case.see id.at.the question of preemption thus turns on whether delaware law presents an obstacle to the accomplishment of cercla objectives.
cercla manifests congress intent that hazardous waste sites should be cleaned up and that those responsible for the contamination should bear the costs.pennsylvania union gas,d.to effectuate these goals,cercla looks backward in time and imposes liability.it allows the government to recover remediation costs directly from parties responsible for contamination,a a it allows private parties to seek indemnification and contribution for costs from potentially responsible parties,a b and it imposes strict liability on owners and operators of contamination sites,a.see goodrich murtha,cir.even so,cercla statutory scheme anticipates that,in some situations,it will be impossible to recover from responsible parties.see commander oil barlo equip,cir neither does cercla automatically assign liability to every party with any connection to a contaminated facility.in other words,cercla objective,while strong,is not absolute and may yield to countervailing considerations.as the supreme court has stated,there is no federal policy that the fund should always win,and more money arguments alone are insufficient to justify displacement of state law.myers fdic,d discussing federal common law in the context of the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act.
we can not conclude that delaware law is an obstacle to the accomplishment of cercla objectives in this instance.the state strongest argument on this point is that cercla aims to hold corporations financially responsible for the environmental damage their activities cause,and dismissal of its claims under delaware law will require taxpayers to pay for the rochester button cleanup,even though millions of dollars in panex assets are traceable to the.cercla recognizes,however,that recovery will not always be possible and manifests no intent that funds that once belonged to a party responsible for contamination should be frozen indefinitely or traced infinitely.see onan indus.steel,recognizing need to construe cercla broadly to achieve environmental and goals but stating that cercla reach is not unlimited,aff,cir.that delaware law,in affording dissolved corporations and their shareholders a measure of finality,operates to leave the state with no source of recovery in this case amounts to the type of more money argument the supreme court rejected in,at,d.it is not the sort of sharp conflict between state law and federal policy that justifies preemption.
the district court documented the disagreement among federal courts on this issue many of the cases that hold that cercla preempts state limits predate supreme court precedent strongly admonishing courts against displacing state law lightly,see,at.in light of that precedent and cercla limits we join those courts of appeals that have held that cercla does not preempt state statutes that limit a party capacity to be sued.see levin metals terminal,cir onan indus.steel,aff,cir witco beekhuis,cir.
a conflict could exist if the delaware statutes would thwart cercla goals by encouraging corporations responsible for contamination to dissolve and distribute assets to avoid cercla liability,but this simply is not the case.states have incentives not to enact laws that would inspire such a race to the bottom.anspec johnson controls,cir kennedy,concurring states have a substantial interest in protecting their citizens and state resources.delaware law protects against this result,requiring dissolving corporations to provide security that will be reasonably likely to be sufficient to cover claims that have not been made known to the corporation or that,based on facts known to the corporation,are likely to arise within a period after dissolution.ann.tit,c,b.see also bradford mank,should state corporate law define successor liability the demise of cercla federal common law,cin,corporate successor liability laws of most states generally prevent corporations from using sham transactions to escape cercla liability.in addition,section provides for extension of the period beyond three years as the court of chancery shall in its discretion direct,which could give a potential cercla plaintiff time to investigate the contamination site while preserving its ability to make a claim against the dissolving corporation.finally,we are not persuaded by the district court rationale that it is unlikely that congress intended that cercla treat differently and inconsistently corporations in identical positions based upon the state of their incorporation preemption is not favored absent clear congressional intent to the contrary,see english,at,and congress probable desire for uniformity is not enough to justify displacement of state law where that state law does not actually conflict with the clear and manifest purpose of congress,witco,at.see also new york serv,cir.
on a fundamental level,the cercla statute of limitations and delaware corporate period serve different purposes,reinforcing our conclusion that they do not actually conflict.cercla statute of limitations extinguishes the right to prosecute an accrued cause of action after a period of time.burlington santa fe ry.poole chem,cir.in contrast,delaware section defines a dissolved corporation capacity to be sued,creating a right for dissolved corporations and their former shareholders to be free from suit after a period of time.see id.as the state points out,an important goal of cercla statute of limitations is to allow time for parties to gauge response costs before the suit is filed,pt,at,reprinted in,thus,the applicable cercla statute of limitations in this case did not begin to run until years after initiation of physical construction of the remedial action.g b.the delaware statute limiting capacity to be sued does not necessarily interfere with this goal,however,because it provides for potentially indefinite extension of the period in the discretion of the court of chancery.ann.tit.delaware statute limits capacity to be sued,not liability,and thus does not conflict with cercla statute of if in operation the state law precludes the cercla plaintiff from recovering in some circumstances.see witco,at.asarco,cir onan.at levin metals terminal,cir.
the state analogizes this case to bedford affiliates,where we held that cercla preempted claims for restitution and indemnification.at.in that case,however,the plaintiffs claims for restitution and indemnification stood in the way of cercla objective of encouraging settlement,which it achieves by restricting the availability of contribution actions.the restitution and indemnification claims would have given the plaintiffs an alternative to the contribution action withheld by cercla,which flies in the face of the federal goal of encouraging settlements.cercla statute of limitations and delaware corporate period present no such direct conflict.
in sum,the state has not shown such a conflict between delaware law and the congressional policy manifested in cercla as to lead us to conclude that congress intended to preempt delaware corporate period,which protects dissolved corporations and their former shareholders interests in finality.cercla does not suggest that the entire corpus of state corporation law is to be replaced simply because a plaintiff cause of action is based upon a federal statute,burks lasker,d,or because it would net the government more money,at,which is essentially all the state has shown here.that is not sufficient to justify preemption.
federal common law 
having held that the cercla statute of limitations does not preempt delaware law in this instance,we address the state argument that we should create a rule of federal common law based on the equitable trust fund doctrine for cercla cases.the state proposed rule would displace delaware law and allow the state to pursue the assets panex distributed to its former shareholders.
the supreme court has sharply curtailed the federal courts ability to create rules of federal common law.to justify creation of a rule of federal common law,the state must show specifically a significant conflict between some federal policy or interest and th
