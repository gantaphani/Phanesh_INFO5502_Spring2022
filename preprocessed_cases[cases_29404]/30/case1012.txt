outside of the agricultural community,plant fungi are rarely the subject of casual dinner conversation,much less contentious litigation.yet to farmers worldwide,the problems posed by white mold,virulent black leg,foot rot,and scab are extremely serious matters.in the late and early,dupont developed a systemic fungicide to combat these problems,which it marketed under the name of benlate.at the zenith of its use,benlate was one of dupont most successful commercial products.
however,into every product life,a little rain must fall.in the case of benlate,the rain became a torrent of litigation alleging that benlate had become contaminated with the herbicide sulfonylureas sus during the manufacturing process,resulting in widespread crop damage.
in previous litigation filed in and,plaintiffs,who are commercial nurserymen,separately sued dupont alleging that contaminated benlate had killed their plants.matsuura altson bird matsuura i,amended by cir.
many similar suits were filed by commercial growers across the nation.in early trials,dupont falsely represented that soil tests had produced no evidence f contamination.during consolidated discovery proceedings in,which included the plaintiffs suits,dupont falsely denied withholding evidence of benlate contamination,and improperly invoked work product protection to resist disclosure of testing data.

alta test results.the results of tests conducted by alta analytical laboratories alta showed that farms where benlate had been used were contaminated with sus.alta laboratories was one of the few laboratories,if not the only one,capable of performing the sophisticated soil and water analysis to determine if benlate was contaminated with sus.matsuura du pont de nemours matsuura ii,haw.
costa rica field tests.dupont conducted field tests of benlate in monte vista,costa rica in.during the costa rica field tests,the plants treated with benlate died,demonstrating that benlate was harmful to plants.dupont destroyed the plants subjected to these field tests and withheld evidence of the field test results.productora de semillas,du pont de nemours,ca.june,order on plaintiff motion to strike defendant dupont pleadings and on plaintiff motion for sanctions against dupont for the destruction of the monte vista benlate test.

contrary to dupont prior representations,the tests confirmed that benlate was contaminated.additional evidence of benlate contamination was produced in other benlate litigation.two district courts held that dupont had intentionally engaged in fraudulent conduct by withholding this evidence.see kawamata farms united agri,imposing million punitive sanction for discovery abuse,aff,haw bush ranch dupont de nemours in re dupont bush ranch,imposing sanctions potentially totaling million,rev on other grounds,cir.although the eleventh circuit reversed the georgia court on the ground that the sanctions were punitive and the court had not followed applicable criminal procedure,the court noted the serious nature of the allegations and stated that it assumed the attorney would conduct an investigation,in re dupont,at.on remand,the district court asked the united states attorney to investigate and prosecute dupont for criminal contempt,in re du pont,hl,order referring matter to attorney,but the court ultimately approved a civil settlement resolving the matter,which required dupont and alston bird to make payments totaling million,see in re du pont,hl,consent order and final judgment.
matsuura i,at.
dupont was first sanctioned by judge elliot,who presided over the bush ranch litigation in the united states district court for the middle district of georgia,on august,for intentionally withholding evidence of the su contamination of benlate that was in its possession and which it was ordered to produce and for falsely representing to the court and to plaintiffs that the alta documents it withheld contained no evidence of su contamination.bush ranch.at.
after learning that dupont fraudulently withheld evidence of benlate contamination,plaintiffs filed the instant actions in the united states district court for the district of,asserting claims under rico and state common law claims of fraud,conspiracy,misrepresentation,abuse of process,infliction of emotional distress,interference with prospective economic advantage,negligence,and spoliation of evidence.in sum,plaintiffs alleged that dupont fraudulently withheld evidence of benlate contamination to induce plaintiffs to settle their underlying benlate litigation.plaintiffs allege they were harmed by dupont fraudulent conduct because they would have requested more money or refused to settle had they known about the concealed data.matsuura ii,at.
the district court granted dupont judgment on the pleadings,ruling the suit was barred by releases signed by plaintiffs as part of their settlement agreements with dupont.matsuura i,at.furthermore,the court held plaintiffs could have rescinded the settlement agreements because of dupont fraud,but forfeited that remedy by failing promptly to tender the settlement proceeds.id.
plaintiffs appealed.we reversed,holding that delaware law controlled and that the delaware supreme court would likely interpret the releases as not barring a claim for fraudulent inducement.id.at.we also held that,under delaware law,plaintiffs alleging that they were fraudulently induced to settle their claims have a choice of remedies they may either rescind the settlement agreement or affirm their settlement agreements and sue for fraud.id.at 
proceedings continued on remand in federal court.as summarized by the supreme court 
on march,the plaintiffs filed a motion for collateral estoppel to preclude defendant from previously adjudicated findings of fraud,discovery abuse,and intentional withholding of evidence in the kawamata farms case motion for collateral estoppel.therein,the plaintiffs seek to preclude dupont from the following issues that dupont fraudulently and intentionally withheld the alta test results from benlate litigants that dupont intentionally withheld the keeler documents from benlate litigants and that the alta test results included analytical findings,which some experts would construe as evidence that benlate was contaminated with sus.the plaintiffs claim that issues and have already been decided in kawamata farms and that issue was decided by the eleventh circuit in bush ranch ii.
matsuura ii,at.in response,dupont filed two related or counter motions.id.first,dupont filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings as to all plaintiffs claims based on litigation conduct,asserting that plaintiffs claims were barred by the doctrine of litigation immunity and that has not recognized a separate tort of spoliation of evidence.id.second,dupont filed a motion for summary judgment based on plaintiffs inability as a matter of law to establish reasonable reliance,asserting that reasonable reliance is an element of a fraudulent inducement claim and that plaintiffs were unable,as a matter of law,to establish that they reasonably relied on dupont representations made during litigation.id.
on may,less than one week before the hearing on the substantive motions,dupont filed a motion to certify questions of state law to the supreme court.judge ezra agreed and certified three questions to the court.matsuura ii,at.the supreme court responded on july.the questions and the supreme court answers are as follows.
the first question certified asked under law,is a party immune from liability for civil damages based on that party misconduct,including fraud,engaged in during prior litigation proceedings id.at.the supreme court submitted the following answer under law,a party is not immune from liability for civil damages based upon that party fraud engaged in during prior litigation proceedings.id.at.
the second certified question asked where plaintiffs attorneys and others have accused the defendant of fraud and dishonesty during the course of prior,related litigation,are plaintiffs thereafter precluded as a matter of law from bringing a cause of action for fraudulent inducement to settle because they should not have relied on the defendant representations id.at.the supreme court submitted the following answer in an action for fraudulent inducement where plaintiffs attorneys and others have accused the defendant of fraud and dishonesty during the course of prior dealings,plaintiffs are not precluded as a matter of law from establishing that their reliance on the defendant representations was reasonable.id.at.
the third and final certified question asked does law recognize a civil cause of action for damages for intentional negligent spoliation of evidence id.at.the supreme court responded 
because the facts alleged can not support their spoliation claim,this court need not resolve whether law would recognize a tort of spoliation of evidence.therefore,insofar as the third certified question does not appear to be determinative of the cause,it was inappropriate for certification under hrap rule.accordingly,we decline to answer it.
id.at citations omitted.
prior to the supreme court response to the certified questions,visiting judge manuel real of los angeles,who replaced chief judge ezra as the judge assigned to this case,denied dupont motion for continuance of the trial date and for limited stay of discovery pending the supreme court ruling and invited dupont to refile its motions for judgment on the pleadings and for summary judgment.dupont refiled its motions.on september,prior to the supreme court ruling on the certified questions,the district court granted dupont motions for summary judgment as to plaintiffs fraud claim on the grounds that plaintiffs could not establish reasonable reliance as a matter of law.

the district court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings as to the rico claims asserted by and matsuura.the elements of a civil rico claim are as follows conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity known as predicate acts causing injury to plaintiff business or property.grimmett brown,cir citing c,c.
the district court held that and matsuura had failed to allege a distinct enterprise.matsuura iii,d at.c provides 
it shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in,or the activities of which affect,interstate or foreign commerce,to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.

perhaps taking a page out of a john grisham novel and matsuura have alleged that the person was dupont and the enterprise consisted of dupont,the law firms employed by dupont,and expert witnesses retained by the law firms.to be sure,if the enterprise consisted only of dupont and its employees,the pleading would fail for lack of distinctiveness.see cedric kushner,at.however,there is no question that law firms retained by dupont are distinctive entities.see united states blinder,cir.and there is no question that dupont and the law firms together can constitute an associated in fact rico enterprise.id.at holding that a group or union consisting solely of corporations or other legal entities can constitute an association in fact enterprise.
the more difficult question is whether the enterprise formed by the group of dupont,the law firms it employed,and the expert witnesses that the law firms retained is separate and distinct from dupont,the rico person alleged in plaintiffs complaint.we conclude that they are.the associated in fact enterprise formed by this union is a being different from,not the same as or part of,the person whose behavior rico was designed to prohibit.rae,at.this is not a situation where the enterprise can not be either formally or practically separable from the person.see united states benny,cir.company that offers products and services for markets including agriculture,nutrition,electronics,communications,safety and protection,home and construction,transportation,and law firms for the purpose of defending dupont in plaintiffs lawsuits.these law firms are required to conform to ethical rules and thus are not merely at the beck and call of their clients.as we recently observed

just as a corporate officer can be a person distinct from the corporate enterprise,dupont is separate from its legal defense team.see sever alaska pulp,cir benny,at.indeed,the rules of professional conduct require law firms to be distinct entities and to maintain their professional independence.model rules of prof l conduct.in addition,even in the context of the relationship,attorneys retain control over important functions for example,in litigation,the attorney retains control over tactical and strategic decisions.new york hill,d model rules of prof l conduct cmt.thus,the litigation enterprise necessarily must be distinct from the client retaining legal assistance.in sum,given the allegations of the complaint,the district court erred in concluding that plaintiffs failed to allege a distinct rico enterprise.
the district court also concluded that the predicate acts alleged by plaintiffs did not support a rico claim because a the mail and wire fraud predicate acts failed due to plaintiffs inability to establish reasonable reliance and b the obstruction of justice predicate acts failed to meet the rico requirements of direct injury and continuity matsuura iii,d at.
the district court concluded,without analysis,that plaintiffs were required to prove that they reasonably relied on dupont fraudulent misrepresentations to state a meritorious civil rico case predicated on mail and wire fraud.id.at.under c,civil rico plaintiffs must demonstrate causation,specifically that they were injured by reason of the alleged racketeering activity of the defendant.c.it is well settled that,to maintain a civil rico claim predicated on mail or wire fraud,a plaintiff must show that the defendants alleged misconduct proximately caused the injury.poulos caesars world,cir citing holmes sec.investor prot,d.although,in some cases,reliance may be a milepost on the road to causation,id.quoting blackie barrack,cir,we have in the past declined to announce a rule that reliance is the only way plaintiffs can establish causation in a civil rico claim predicated on mail or wire fraud.id.at.we need not address whether this is a case where plaintiffs can establish causation only by demonstrating that they reasonably relied on dupont fraud because plaintiffs adequately pleaded reasonable reliance in their amended complaint.plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that they reasonably relied on dupont to obey statutes,court orders,court rules,rules of evidence,written agreements,representations to the court by officers of the court,and representations made under oath to the court by dupont officers and agents.first am.compl.regardless of whether plaintiffs were required to plead reasonable reliance to satisfy the causation element of their rico claims,they did,and thus the district court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings on this question.
although the district court styled its order as one granting judgment on the pleadings,it appeared to be considering this issue on the record.matsuura iii,d at as discussed above,plaintiffs can not prove that they reasonably relied on dupont alleged fraud.therefore,we assume that the district court converted the rule c motion into a motion for summary judgment if so,then the district court erred,because there were genuine issues of material fact that precluded the grant of summary judgment on this question.the district court held that the plaintiffs attorney,malone,knew or had knowledge of many of the alleged facts indicating fraudulent conduct.however,this is a disputed issue.plaintiffs tendered evidence that malone did not know the substance of the evidence that dupont was withholding at the time of settlement.therefore,there exists a triable factual issue as to reasonable reliance.
in sum,the district court improperly granted judgment on the pleadings on the question of reasonable reliance and,to the extent that the district court converted the rule c motion into a rule motion for summary judgment,it also erred because there were genuine issues of material fact on the question.
the district court determined that plaintiffs did not assert that they had suffered an injury to their business or property,as required under c.matsuura iii,d at.rather,the district court determined that because plaintiffs injury consisted of a tainted litigation process that diminished their settlements,plaintiffs suffered the type of personal injury or injury to an intangible interest not remediable by rico civil provisions.see also id.at holding that plaintiffs allegations fail to allege a cognizable rico injury and therefore fail as a matter of law.plaintiffs argue that they 
settled product liability claims,accepted deflated settlements,and dismissed those causes of action,only to find out later that they had been defrauded.plaintiffs underlying claims were specifically focused on injury to their nursery businesses and their property including damaged plant inventory caused by defective benlate,and dupont fraud and racketeering activities further damages those business and property interests when they were duped into accepting low settlements.

plaintiffs have tendered sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to when they knew of or should have discovered the fraud.the district court relied solely on the entry of judge elliot sanction order.however,the district court erred in determining that,as a matter of law,the attention received by judge elliott ruling could be imputed to the plaintiffs.boeing north american,cir the district court erred in concluding as a matter of law that newspaper reports concerning the defendants facilities were sufficiently numerous and notorious to impute knowledge of them to plaintiffs.the district court held that a reasonable,prudent subscriber of newspapers in the area,and a reasonably diligent person living in the area for a substantial period of time between and would have become aware of the release of contaminants from ssfl.this evaluation of the awareness in plaintiffs various communities of a specific fact or event was uniquely an issue for the jury to resolve.further,plaintiffs tendered evidence that their attorney did not realize the import of the order until much later.this,along with other evidence in the record,is sufficient to create a triable factual issue as to whether these parties should have known about the alleged fraud when judge elliot sanction order was issued.
for these reasons,the district court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings as to the rico claims.we express no opinion on the merits of the claims,but simply conclude that dupont is not entitled to judgment on the pleadings for the reasons given by the district court.
the district court erred in holding that dupont was entitled to summary judgment under law because of plaintiffs inability to prove either the fact or amount of damages with reasonable certainty.matsuura iii,d at.
under law,in order to maintain a claim for relief grounded in fraud,the plaintiff must have suffered substantial actual damage,not nominal or speculative.cutter dodge,quoting prosser,law of torts at ed emphasis omitted.p laintiffs suing in fraud are required to show both that they suffered actual pecuniary loss and that such damages are definite and ascertainable,rather than speculative.id.the aim of compensation is to place the plaintiffs in the same position they would have occupied had they not been defrauded.id.in the context of a breach of contract case,the supreme court stated regarding the amount of proof needed to establish the fact and amount of damages 
a distinction is made in the law between the amount of proof required to establish the fact that the injured party has sustained some damage and the measure of proof necessary to enable the jury to determine the amount of damage.it is now generally held that the uncertainty which prevents a recovery is uncertainty as to the fact of damage and not as to its amount.however,the rule that uncertainty as to the amount does not necessarily prevent recovery is not to be interpreted as requiring no proof of the amount of damage.the extent of plaintiff loss must be shown with reasonable certainty and that excludes any showing or conclusion founded upon mere speculation or guess.
chung kaonohi ctr,haw,emphasis added,abrogated on other grounds by francis lee,quoting ferreira honolulu,haw.
regarding the requirement that the amount of damages be shown with reasonable certainty,the supreme court has recognized that t he problem of how to measure damages,and how to establish them in fraud cases,is always a difficult one since the person defrauded has,because of the fraud,not pursued alternative courses of action,and the results of those untaken courses therefore remain speculative.leibert finance factors,haw.thus,the supreme court has stated that the evidence necessary to show damages with reasonable certainty depends on the circumstances of each individual case.

although the state courts have not articulated what must be proven in order to bring a meritorious settlement fraud claim,the district court,relying on a new york case,determined that a settlement fraud plaintiff must prove that the settled claim had merit.matsuura iii,d at that plaintiffs must demonstrate that their settled claim had merit is inconsistent with the aim of compensation in fraud cases,which is to restore plaintiffs to the position they would be in absent the fraud and to provide plaintiffs with the benefit of the bargain,see leibert,at,particularly as a party decision to settle is often made as a result of a analysis rather than an assessment of the claim merits.
in disabatino united states fidelity guaranty,the united states district court for the district of delaware explained why the court does not require plaintiffs alleging that the settlement of their tort claim was procured by fraud to prove that they had a good cause of action against the tortfeasor at the time of the fraud 
whether a good cause of action existed at the time of the settlement was a material fact that the parties already considered in reaching a settlement.requiring a plaintiff to prove in a court of law the existence of a good cause of action for a tort would be inconsistent with affirmance of a settlement agreement.evidence of the legal and factual strength of the claim merely goes to the value of the claim that was compromised in determining damages from the fraud.
the sound approach is one in which the trier of fact determines the probable amount of settlement in absence of fraud after considering all known or foreseeable facts and circumstances affecting the value of the claim on the date of settlement id.at see also matsuura i,at citing disabatino.at for the assertion that damages for fraud are conceptually different from damages for the underlying tort claims and are not too speculative to calculate.to put it another way,the relative strength of the claim in the absence of fraud should be used by the trier of fact to determine the amount of the defrauded party damages.whether the defrauded party could have won its case if it proceeded to trial is irrelevant to this calculation.the critical consideration is the settlement value of the case on the date settlement was reached.such a determination is not beyond the power of a jury to determine.the use of probability analysis,for example,in calculating settlement values is not uncommon.
here,the district court erroneously required plaintiffs to present admissible evidence regarding the merits of their underlying product liability claims.matsuura iii,d at plaintiffs had made no effort,however,to prove either the merits of their underlying product liability claims or what those claims would have been worth had their sic been no fraud by dupont.dupont is also wrong in suggesting that plaintiffs were required to provide such evidence.
therefore,the question becomes whether there is a genuine issue of fact regarding whether plaintiffs suffered damages as a result of dupont fraud.plaintiffs have tendered evidence that knowledge of the withheld evidence on the date of settlement would have increased the settlement value of the case substantially.they cite comparable settlements of much larger amounts and expert testimony this evidence is sufficient to create a triable issue of fact and is not so speculative that damages are incapable of calculation.
dupont argues that attorney malone settled the cases with the belief that he would have won at trial.that malone believed he could win against dupont before dupont fraud was exposed is not particularly relevant to the issue of how much more malone could have settled plaintiffs cases for if he,at the time of settlement,had the test data that dupont had fraudulently withheld.malone also testified that he believed the plaintiffs received full value for their cases.this is certainly relevant evidence,but it does not establish full settlement value as a matter of law.malone also testified that if the alta data that dupont had fraudulently withheld had been revealed to plaintiffs at the time of settlement,plaintiffs cases would have been stronger and their settlement value would have been higher indeed,the import of malone testimony is the subject of vigorous debate between the parties,and the record can support inferences for each position.it is not our task to weigh the evidence.rather,at this stage of the proceedings,we are required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.doing so,we conclude there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether plaintiffs suffered damages as a result of dupont fraud.the district court erroneously granted summary judgment for dupont based on its determination that plaintiffs failed to prove the fact of damages with reasonable certainty.
the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the common law fraud claim on the basis that the plaintiffs could not establish that the alleged fraud was material or that the plaintiffs reasonably relied upon dupont representations to their detriment.
the materiality of undisclosed information can not be determined in a vacuum.tsa int l shimizu,internal quotation marks omitted.an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that,under all the circumstances,the omitted fact would have assumed actual significance in the deliberations of the reasonable claimant.id.internal quotations omitted.here,the plaintiffs have tendered sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact on materiality.as we have discussed,plaintiffs tendered evidence that the settlement value of their cases would have increased substantially had the withheld information been produced on the date of settlement.dupont argues that the information was available elsewhere,that plaintiffs attorney had access to the information,and that the plaintiffs deliberately chose to settle without obtaining the information,but these defenses are fact questions to be resolved by a jury.
under law,plaintiffs reliance on dupont misrepresentation must be reasonable.matsuura ii,at.as a general principle the question of whether one has acted reasonably under the circumstances is for the trier of fact to determine.id.quoting richardson sport shinko.w here reasonable minds might differ as to the reasonableness of plaintiff conduct,the question is for the jury.id.quoting young price,haw,internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court,answering the certified question posed to it by the district court of whether plaintiffs were unable as a matter of law to establish that their reliance on dupont representations was reasonable,stated that we are persuaded that reasonable minds could differ as to the reasonableness of the plaintiffs reliance on dupont representations.id.at.although the record has been developed more fully since the supreme court considered this matter,our analysis is the same.although dupont has raised serious questions about the reasonableness of the reliance and about whether plaintiffs actually relied upon dupont representations,these are factual questions to be resolved by a jury.
the district court also erred in granting summary judgment on plaintiffs common law claims other than the claims of negligence and spoliation.
the settlement agreement does not preclude plaintiffs causes of action.delaware laws governs the construction and effect of plaintiffs settlement contracts with dupont.matsuura i,at.the district court determined that dupont de nemours florida evergreen foliage,in which the delaware supreme court determined that the general release in the settlement agreement between dupont and a similarly situated plaintiff did not bar plaintiff subsequent action against dupont for fraud in the inducement of the release,did not control the question of whether plaintiffs claims were barred by the terms of the settlement agreements between dupont and plaintiffs.matsuura iii,d at.the district court reasoned that plaintiffs do not satisfy the fraud exception articulated by the delaware supreme court,and the covenants not to sue that are contained in the settlement agreements and which are broader than the general release clauses bar any claims related to the settled claims and therefore plaintiffs claims.id.at.
dupont argument that the decisions of this court in matsuura i and the delaware supreme court in florida evergreen unambiguously were limited to the scope of the release clause,and nowhere mentioned the separate covenant not to sue in the parties settlement agreements is erroneous.although the covenant not to sue is not quoted in our decision in matsuura i,dupont argued that the covenant not to sue barred matsuura fraud claims in its brief to the matsuura i court.wl arguing in its brief that t he matsuuras further agreed not to commence any action against dupont based upon or in any way related to any causes of action,claims,demands,actions,obligations,damages,or liabilities which are the subject of this release,and that plaintiffs agreed not to commence or participate in any action based upon or in any way related to a released claim against dupont in the future.we rejected dupont argument.thus,the covenant not to sue does not bar plaintiffs claims.
in addition,although the delaware supreme court does in some instances refer to a fraud exception,florida evergreen,at,the court reasoning for creating the fraud exception applies to claims arising out of fraudulent conduct.as stated by the delaware supreme court 
there is some merit to the contention that parties entering into a general release are chargeable with notice that any uncertainty with respect to the contours of the dispute which led to the litigation,including that which is provable and that which is not,is resolved through the release.see hob tea room miller,construing the effect of a general release that the court characterized as unmistakably lucid.it is quite another thing,however,to conclude that a person is deemed to have released a claim of which he has no knowledge,when the ignorance of such a claim is attributable to fraudulent conduct by the released party.d release.at a minimum,if one party is to be held to release a claim for fraud in the execution of the release itself,the release should include a specific statement of exculpatory language referencing the fraud.
florida evergreen,at.in addition,just as dupont fraudulent inducement of settlement subsists separate from,and necessarily occurred after,any conduct dupont may have engaged in with respect to its manufacture or distribution of benlate,id.at,so do other claims stemming from the same fraudulent condu
