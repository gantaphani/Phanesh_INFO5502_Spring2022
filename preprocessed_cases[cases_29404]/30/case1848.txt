california has been at the forefront of enacting legislation to protect endangered and rare doing so in.natural resources defense council fish game com.th,d.fourteen years later,that legislation was repealed and replaced with the california endangered species act cesa fish et.natural resources defense council,at,d.
in enacting the cesa,the legislature made clear this state policy to protect any endangered or threatened species or subspecies if at risk of extinction throughout all,or a significant portion,of its range,but left undefined certain terms essential to implementing that policy.this appeal addresses the meaning of some of these terms in the context of protecting two evolutionarily significant units of coho salmon in california that defendants in this fish and game commission commission and the department of fish and game department found to be endangered and threatened.
among the issues we will address is whether the term species or subspecies includes evolutionarily significant units,making those units entitled to protection under the cesa.we will also address whether the term range in the cesa refers to a species california range only,thereby entitling a species to protection if it is threatened with extinction throughout all,or a significant portion,of its california range as opposed to its worldwide range.
consistent with the policy of the cesa,we will hold that the term species or subspecies includes evolutionarily significant units and that the term range refers to a species california range only.in so holding,we will deny a challenge by coalition of california corporations to the trial court ruling upholding the listing of two coho salmon evolutionarily significant units as endangered and threatened under the cesa.
factual and procedural background 
acalifornia endangered species act 
under the cesa,the commission must establish a list of endangered species and a list of threatened species and add or remove species from either list if it finds,upon the receipt of sufficient scientific information that the action is warranted.the cesa defines endangered species as a native species or subspecies of a bird,mammal,fish,amphibian,reptile,or plant which is in serious danger of becoming extinct throughout all,or a significant portion,of its range due to one or more causes,including loss of habitat,change in habitat,overexploitation,predation,competition,or disease.it defines threatened species similarly,except that,although not presently threatened with extinction,it is likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future in the absence of the special protection and management efforts required by this chapter.
a n interested person may petition the c ommission to add a species to,or to remove a species from either the list of endangered or the list of threatened species.the commission refers the petition to the department,which then evaluates the petition and submits a written evaluation report to the commission,subd.a.in its report,the department recommends either rejection of the petition or acceptance and consideration of the petition,subd.a.
at its next noticed meeting,the commission consider s the petition,the d epartment written report,and comments received and publishes notice of a finding that it has either rejected the petition or accepted the petition for consideration,subd.a.if the accepted petition recommends the addition of a species to either the list of endangered species or the list of threatened species,the c ommission shall include in the notice that the petitioned species is a candidate species,subd.a.
within months of publishing the notice,the department must provide a status report to the commission,based upon the best scientific information available to the d epartment.the department status report is supplemented by public solicit ation of data and comments from as many persons as is practicable.the commission then schedule s the petition for final consideration at its next available meeting.

coho salmon 
coho salmon are known scientifically as oncorhynchus kisutch,which derives from a combination of the greek roots onkos meaning hooked and rynchos meaning nose and the colloquial name for the species in russia and alaska,kisutch.these medium to large salmon naturally occur in the north pacific ocean,tributary drainages,and freshwater drainages from hokkaido,japan,and eastern russia,around the bering sea and aleutian islands to mainland alaska,and south along the north american coast to monterey bay,california.
in california,there are two areas of genetic for coho salmon.these areas occur from punta gorda south to the san lorenzo central california coast coho evolutionarily significant unit the central coast unit and from punta gorda north across the state border to cape blanco,southern california coast evolutionarily significant unit the southern california coast unit.according to scientists quoted in the department status report,these discontinuities represent areas of restricted gene flow that likely results in some level of reproductive isolation.isolated populations are subject to different levels of genetic drift and unique natural selection pressures that tend over time to result in differences between them.
according to other scientists,also quoted in the department status report,coho salmon have the lowest genetic diversity of the five pacific salmon species,due possibly to one or more severe reductions in population size.studies have shown that the population of coho salmon in california,including hatchery stocks,has declined at least percent since the.according to presence surveys in the department status report,the population of the central coast unit has severely declined in central california to the point of widespread extirpation or within some larger stream systems.in comparison,the southern california coast unit appears in all major stream systems in northern california,although most indicators show declines in that unit as well and a high likelihood that the declines will continue.
reasons for the declining coho salmon population include forestry activities,industrial discharges,agricultural discharges,urban development,and harvesting.
proceedings in this case 
in july,the salmon and steelhead recovery coalition petitioned the commission to list coho salmon north of san francisco bay as an endangered species under the cesa.the commission referred the petition to the department for its evaluation,and the department recommended the petition be accepted and considered.the commission accepted the petition and published notice declaring coho salmon north of san francisco a candidate species.
in april,the department published its status report.as it had done with previous listings under the cesa,the department separately evaluated the status of the two coho units.based on scientific research detailed in the status report,the department recommended adding the california portion of the southern california coast unit to the list of threatened species and the central coast unit to the list of endangered species.
in august,in reliance on the department report,the commission found that the california portion of the southern california coast unit warranted listing as a threatened species and the central coast unit warranted listing as an endangered species.the commission delayed regulatory action while the department prepared a recovery plan for the species.
in august,the commission finally amended the existing regulations to list the california portion of the southern california coast unit as a threatened species and the central coast unit as an endangered species.
in june,plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of mandate and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the commission listing decisions and the commission decision formally adopting the listing regulations pursuant to the rulemaking provisions of the administrative procedure act.
in august,the trial court issued a thorough and ruling denying the petition and the complaint.in its ruling,the trial court made the following four findings the commission acted properly by listing the c oho salmon in two distinct evolutionarily significant units the commission and the department properly considered the coho salmon california range in assessing the species likelihood of extinction the commission thoroughly considered the role of hatchery salmon in determining whether to list the two coho units as endangered and threatened and the commission satisfied the necessity and nonduplication standards in the administrative procedure act.
on appeal,plaintiffs challenge these four findings,asking this court to direct the trial court to issue a writ of mandate declaring the listing regulations void and precluding their enforcement.disagreeing with plaintiffs that the trial court findings were erroneous,we affirm the judgment.
discussion 
ievolutionarily significant units 
the cesa defines endangered species and threatened species as a native species or subspecies of a bird,mammal,fish,amphibian,reptile,or plant,italics added.plaintiffs contend this definition necessarily excludes evolutionarily significant units,and the commission therefore erred in listing the two coho units as endangered and threatened species under the cesa.
the proper interpretation of a statute,and its application to undisputed facts,is a question of law that we review de novo.state water resources control bd.cases th,d.in this de novo review,o ur fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.if there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citations.if,however,the statutory terms are ambiguous,then we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.wilson handley th,d.while we exercise our independent judgment in interpreting a statute,we give deference to an agency interpretation if warranted by the circumstances.state water resources control bd.cases,at,d,citing yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.
according to plaintiffs,the plain meaning of the term species or subspecies necessarily excludes evolutionarily significant units.in their view,the cesa expressly includes the one the definitions of endangered and threatened species.thus,the irresistible conclusion is that all other population segments below the level of species,including evolutionarily significant units,have been excluded from the cesa s definitions of endangered and threatened species.plaintiffs argument is based on a narrow,scientific definition of species or subspecies.
defined broadly,a species is a class of individuals having common attributes and designated by a common name collegiate dict.ed.and a subspecies is a subgroup,at.in nonscientific terms,therefore,it can be said that an evolutionarily significant unit of coho salmon is a subgroup of coho salmon.since the term species or subspecies is also susceptible to this reasonable interpretation,the term is ambiguous in the context of the cesa,and we may look to extrinsic sources in construing the statute,keeping in mind that we must choose the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the lawmakers,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute s.state water resources control bd.cases,supra,th at,d.
we begin with the basic premise that l aws providing for the conservation of natural resources such as the cesa are of great remedial and public importance and thus should be construed liberally.san bernardino valley audubon society city of moreno valley th,d.within the cesa itself,the legislature has expressed the objects to be achieved and the evils to be remedied.san bernardino valley audubon society,at,d,citing.the evils to be remedied include the extinction of c ertain species of fish,wildlife,and plants,and the danger or threat of extinction of o ther species of fish,wildlife,and plants,subds.a,b.the objects to be achieved include the conserv ation,protect ion,restor ation,and enhance ment of any endangered species or any threatened species.
consistent with these objectives,the commission,based on the department recommendation,listed the two coho units as endangered and threatened,because the commission and the department believed such listings were integral to maintaining the diversity of the species and therefore to protecting the species as a whole and because such listings were allowed under the cesa.as we will explain,deference to the commission and the department interpretation of the term species or subspecies as including evolutionarily significant units is appropriate here given their central roles in the listing process,their scientific expertise,and their adherence to the policy that the cesa allows listings of evolutionarily significant units.see yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d.
as we have stated,the legislature entrusted the commission with the responsibility for establishing the list of endangered and threatened species,and the department with the responsibility for evaluating petitions,making recommendations to the commission,subd.a and provid ing a written report to the c ommission,based upon the best scientific information available to the d epartment.in carrying out its responsibilities,the department stated in its initial evaluation that if coho salmon north of san francisco became a candidate species,it would consider separately the two coho units found in california.
the concept of evolutionarily significant units was important because,as the department explained,the ability of coho salmon to survive and reproduce was affected by extinction of nearby populations that may minimize or prevent the exchange of individuals between populations that is necessary to avoid inbreeding and speciation.at the time of the department initial evaluation,there already was information on overall population decline,low population abundance,loss or local populations,fragmentation and collapse of the coho salmon range.
consistent with its initial position,the department in its april status review restated its view that the two coho units should be evaluated separately for listing purposes.the department recognized that evolutionarily significant units reflect the best current understanding of the likely boundaries of reproductively isolated salmon populations over a broad geographic area,that s imilar populations can be grouped for efficient protection of genetic diversity,and that genetic structure and biodiversity among california stocks were important in evaluating and protecting coho salmon.
the department explained in the status review why biodiversity and its genetic underpinnings were important to species preservation.according to conservation biologists,quoted in the department status report,diversity leads to greater abundance because different populations can exploit different habitats and resources d iversity fosters enhanced stability by spreading risk and providing redundancy in the face of unpredictable catastrophes due to such things as climatic or ocean condition fluctuation and diversity provides a range of raw materials that allows adaptation and increased probability of persistence in the face of environmental change.
in addition to believing that evolutionarily significant units were integral to protecting the species,the commission and the department believed that the legislature meant to allow for the listing of such units under the cesa.as the commission explained in response to public comments,its decision to list the two coho units was consistent with its policy allowing such listings that was ushered in by the legislature when enacting the cesa.at that time,the legislature provided that a ny species determined by the c ommission as endangered on or before january,is an endangered species.pursuant to that provision,the commission listed more than a dozen varieties of plants as endangered species even though they did not comprise a specific or subspecific taxon,but rather we re subsets of a specific or subspecific taxon.for approximately years since then,the commission has listed additional varieties of plants and fish all of which are subsets of a specific or subspecific taxon 
we believe deference to the commission and the department interpretation of species or subspecies as including evolutionarily significant units is appropriate here.their broad and interpretation,based on their scientific expertise,is consistent with the liberal construction we accord l aws providing for the conservation of natural resources san bernardino valley audubon society city of moreno valley,supra,th at,d,and furthers the conserv ation,protect ion,restor ation,and enhance ment of any endangered species or any threatened species by maintaining the diversity of the species.in contrast,limiting the term to plaintiffs interpretation frustrates the intent of the cesa because it fails to protect subgroups of a species that are integral to the species survival.
nevertheless,plaintiffs contend the listing of evolutionarily significant units is unsupportable in light of the parallel experience under the federal endangered species act fesa et,noting that the fesa definition of species includes distinct population segment s,which encompasses evolutionarily significant units see.plaintiffs argue that because the cesa contains no language parallel to the fesa distinct populations segment provision this court should be reluctant to read such language into the cesa.in support of their position,plaintiffs cite san bernardino valley audubon society city of moreno valley,supra,th at page,d.as we will explain,that case does not support plaintiffs narrow reading of the term species or subspecies.
there,the trial court determined that the department could issue an incidental take permit of an endangered species for private development,even though at the time the cesa contained no provisions for issuing such permits.san bernardino valley audubon society city of moreno valley,supra,th at,d.plaintiffs appealed,contending the cesa prohibited the take of endangered species incidental to private development,and the agreement by which the permit was issued violated that prohibition.san bernardino valley audubon society,at,d.while the court of appeal resolved the issue on the grounds of laches,it observed that were it to decide the issue on the merits,it would conclude the agreement by which the department issued the permit was invalid.id.at,d.the court reasoned that because the fesa,which the california legislature followed in many respects when it enacted cesa,contained a permit process allowing take incidental to development and other lawful activities and that permit process existed before the drafting and passage of the cesa,the california legislature deliberately chose not to adopt that provision into the state statute.san bernardino valley audubon society,at,d.it is this language on which plaintiffs rely in making their argument.plaintiffs reliance on this language is misplaced.
simply because the cesa does not include the definition of species or subspecies provided in the fesa,the necessary conclusion is not that evolutionarily significant units must be excluded for listing purposes under the cesa.more plausibly,given the legislature policy in enacting the cesa,it is reasonable to conclude that the legislature did not want to limit the term species or subspecies to the federal definition.instead,the legislature likely may have wanted to leave the interpretation of that term to the department which is responsible for providing the best scientific information,and to the commission,which is responsible for making the listing decisions.as we have already explained,deference to their interpretation is consistent with the liberal construction we accord laws such as the cesa and furthers the policy of that statute to conserve,protect,restore,and enhance any endangered species or any threatened species.for these reasons,we agree with the commission and the department that the term species or subspecies as used in sections and of the cesa includes evolutionarily significant units,and the commission did not err in adding the two coho units to the list of endangered species and threatened species under the cesa.
to be entitled to protection under the cesa,a species must be in serious danger of or likely to become in serious danger of extinction throughout all,or a significant portion,of its range,see.plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in accepting the commission and the department interpretation of this range provision as meaning the coho california range,which allows protection of a species if it is threatened with extinction throughout all,or a significant portion,of its california range.plaintiffs argue that the cesa requires the commission and the department to consider the coho entire geographic range,even those portions outside of california boundaries.as we will explain,we agree with the commission and the department interpretation of the range provision as it is congruent with the cesa purpose.
the cesa does not state whether the range to be considered is a species california range or worldwide range.in this regard,the statute is ambiguous.as we explained in part i of the discussion,ante,in interpreting an ambiguous statute,our fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the legislature to effectuate the purpose of the statute.wilson handley,supra,th at,d.we exercise our independent judgment in interpreting a statute,but give deference to an agency interpretation when warranted.state water resources control bd.cases,supra,th at,d,citing yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d.
central to plaintiffs position is their assertion that under the cesa w hat matters ultimately is whether the species goes extinct they reason that the commission and the department interpretation of the range provision may actually contribute to the species demise,given that the protections of the cesa would be inapplicable within california notwithstanding the species endangerment outside of california,because that portion of the species range would be legally irrelevant.the assertion on which plaintiffs base their position is not supported by the language of the cesa.
contrary to plaintiffs assertion,it is reasonable to infer that the cesa focus is protecting species within the state,which is the extent of the state regulatory authority.in enacting the cesa,the legislature declared that endangered and threatened species were of value to the people of this state,and the conservation,protection,and enhancement of these species and their habitat is of statewide concern,subd.c,italics added.interpreting the range provision to limit the inquiry into a species likelihood of extinction in california furthers the legislature policy of protecting these species and their habitat for the value of californians.in addition,the cesa limits protection of species or subspecies to those that are native.by narrowing the definition of endangered and threatened species to include only native species or subspecies,the legislature demonstrated its intent that the cesa apply to protect species or subspecies within the state.
notwithstanding this evidence of legislative intent,plaintiffs point to federal case law construing the fesa range provision that they believe supports their interpretation of the cesa range provision.see defenders of wildlife norton cir.in that case,environmentalists challenged the secretary of the interior decision not to designate as threatened under the fesa a species of lizard based on the secretary reasoning that adequate habitat existed on public lands to ensure the
