in,plaintiff rancho lobo acquired property in rio arriba county for the purpose of establishing a hunting preserve.in february of,rancho lobo applied for and was granted a permit by the forestry division to harvest trees in order to r elease understory trees,i mprove residual tree health and growth,e nhance wildlife habitat and utilization in the areas,p romote the englemann spruce as a stand component aspen regeneration,and p repare future prescribed burn areas by removing white fir and mistletoed douglas fir from ponderosa fir stand types and enhance their establishment.at.
in march,the county informed rancho lobo that it needed to apply for a county timber harvest permit under the timber harvest ordinance.rancho lobo refused to seek a permit,and instead filed an action arguing that the ordinance was invalid because it conflicted with and was preempted by the forest conservation act,that enforcement of the ordinance constituted a taking in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments,and that the ordinance illegally deprived rancho lobo of its property.
both parties filed motions for summary judgment on the issue of the validity of the ordinance.in its motion,rancho lobo alleged that the timber harvest ordinance was invalid because it was preempted by the forest conservation act and was not a proper use of the county zoning authority.in ruling on the,the district court first determined there was sufficient controlling new mexico law for it to decide the validity of the ordinance without certifying the question to the new mexico supreme court.the district court held that the timber harvest ordinance conflicted with the forest conservation act because the act allows while the ordinance prohibits without a variance being obtained.the district court also held that the ordinance conflicted with the forest conservation act because the ordinance required a more extensive and stricter permitting process.
on the issue of preemption,the district court found that the statutory language of the forest conservation act providing that the forestry division is authorized to make and enforce rules and regulations,and enforce all laws,rules and regulations relating to forestry,logging and timber operations indicated an express preemption of the timber harvest ordinance.the district court further found that although the ordinance was a valid exercise of zoning authority,its provision for requiring an environmental assessment was not a valid exercise of authority because it gave the county planning and zoning department unlimited power to determine who would be required to prepare an environmental assessment.ultimately,the district court held that the entire timber harvest ordinance was expressly preempted by the forest conservation act,and was therefore invalid.as a result,the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of rancho lobo.the district court certified the partial summary judgment as a final judgment pursuant to.b.
the county contends that the district court erred in determining that the new mexico forest conservation act preempted the county timber harvest ordinance.the county argues there is no preemption,either express or implied,and that the ordinance does not conflict with the forest conservation act,thus leaving room for concurrent regulation.
we have jurisdiction over rancho lobo preemption claim because of the diversity of the parties.a federal court sitting in diversity applies the substantive law of the forum state.commerce bank,chrysler realty,cir.we review the district court determination of state law de novo.id.
new mexico law on preemption 
counties in new mexico are granted almost the same powers as municipalities.see,same powers except for those powers that are inconsistent with statutory or constitutional limitations placed on counties.the powers granted to counties include the power to enact zoning ordinances and those ordinances that are necessary and proper to provide for the safety,preserve the health,promote the prosperity and improve the morals,order,comfort and convenience of any county or its inhabitants.id.see board of comm rs of rio arriba county greacen.where a county ordinance conflicts with a state statute,the state statute controls.see greacen,at.however,there is no invasion of state statutory authority where the local ordinance merely complements the statute and is nowhere antagonistic therewith.id.at quoting state ex rel.coffin mccall.
with regard to the preemption of local ordinances by state law,the new mexico supreme court has held that,generally,in order to limit the power of local government,some express statement of the power denied must be contained in the state law.see apodaca wilson.however,any new mexico law that clearly intends to preempt a governmental area should be sufficient without necessarily stating that affected municipalities must comply and can not operate to the contrary.casuse city of gallup.in san pedro mining board of county comm rs,app,the court summarized new mexico preemption law as follows 
a local governmental body ability to regulate in an area may be preempted either expressly,by the language of a statute,or impliedly,due to a conflict between the local body ordinances and the contents,purposes,or pervasive scheme of the statute a local government is presumed to retain the power to exercise its normal authority over an activity,so the intention of the legislature to preempt local control must be clearly stated if express preemption is to result 
even in the absence of express preemption by the legislature,a county ordinance may be preempted if it conflicts with a state statute or regulation,or if the statute demonstrates an intent to occupy the entire field.
therefore,under new mexico law,there are three ways a state statute can preempt a local ordinance expressly,because the statute contains language stating that it preempts local ordinances,see apodaca,at impliedly,because the ordinance and the state statute conflict,see greacen,at or impliedly,because the statute demonstrates an intent to occupy the entire field,see casuse,at.
express preemption 
the district court concluded that the forest conservation act expressly preempted local governments from regulating the timber harvest.however,under new mexico law,this characterization is incorrect.in order to expressly preempt a local ordinance,the legislature must clearly state its intention to do so.see san pedro mining,at.there is no such clear statement of intent in the forest conservation act.
the district court conclusion that the forest conservation act expressly preempted the ordinance was based on language in the act giving the forestry division the power to make and enforce rules and regulations not in conflict with any law now in force as it deems necessary for the application of commercial forest practices within the state,to enforce all laws,rules and regulations relating to all forested,cutover or brush lands lying within the state under the following circumstances logging and timber operations and practices conservation of commercial forest lands and products,and to enforce and administer all laws and regulations relating to forestry on lands within the state,id.c.the district court concluded that t he statutory language clearly indicates the legislature intent to expressly preempt local governmental entities from regulating timber harvests.order at.
however,while the language authorizes the forestry division to enforce and administer all laws and regulations relating to timber harvesting,it does not give the division exclusive power to do so,nor does it expressly prohibit local governments from enacting and enforcing laws relating to timber harvesting.therefore,the forest conservation act does not set forth in a clear and unambiguous manner the legislature intent to expressly preempt local regulation.
in san pedro mining,the court addressed a preemption situation similar to the one at issue here the question was whether a county mining ordinance was preempted by the new mexico mining act.the plaintiff in that case claimed express preemption,pointing to language in the new mexico mining act stating that a fter the effective date of the new mexico mining act and until the commission adopts regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of the new mexico mining act,county mining laws or ordinances shall apply to mining within their jurisdictions in new mexico.at.the plaintiff argued this provision of the new mexico mining act meant that after the commission had adopted regulations necessary to carry out the act,the local ordinances were preempted.however,the court disagreed,stating 
it is certainly possible to read this section as plaintiff does,to mean that once the referenced regulations are adopted,no county regulation or ordinance shall apply to mining activity,whether or not the ordinance conflicts with the state regulations or the statute.it is also possible,however,that the legislature included this provision only to ensure that local ordinances governing the same matters as the statute would not be immediately rendered ineffective by the mere passage of the statute,which would have left those matters uncontrolled pending the commission adoption of the regulations required by the statute.given the absence of an explicit prohibition of any type of local regulation of mining after the adoption of the regulations,and given the fact that the act and its regulations are not comprehensive in scope but govern only certain aspects of mining,we believe the act is ambiguous concerning its effect on local mining ordinances.
in san pedro mining,the court cited the new mexico pesticide control act,specifically,as a statute which contained language creating an express preemption.that statute unambiguously precludes local control over pesticides by stating except as otherwise authorized in the pesticide control act,no city,county or other political subdivision of the state and no home rule municipality shall adopt or continue in effect any ordinance,rule,regulation or statute regarding the registration,labeling,distribution,sale,handling,use,application,transportation or disposal of pesticides.the court concluded the new mexico mining act did not expressly preempt the county mining ordinance in question.
as with the mining act at issue in san pedro mining,the forest conservation act does not contain language which unambiguously reflects an intent to expressly preempt local legislation regarding timber harvests.we therefore hold that the district court erred in concluding that the forest conservation act expressly preempted the ordinance in question.
our determination with regard to express preemption does not end our inquiry,however,because rancho lobo also argued the theory of implied preemption,even though the district court did not address that theory.new mexico law recognizes that a statute may be impliedly preempted even though the requirements for express preemption are not met.see san pedro mining,at.we therefore address the question of implied preemption.see chandler city of arvada,cir holding that this court is free to affirm a district court decision on any grounds for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law,even grounds not relied upon by the district court.
implied preemption by occupying area of law 
we can not rely on our conclusion that the f
