this suit involves a decision by the forest service to close numerous roads on boulder top,a popular recreation area in the dixie national forest near teasdale,utah.the decision was taken as part of an effort to reduce sedimentation in lakes on boulder top.biologists had observed that sedimentation was contributing to increased winter kill of trout populations in area lakes,and the forest service concluded that poorly constructed roads on boulder top were a major source of the problem.appellant utah shared access alliance challenged the forest service decision in district court,arguing that the service failed to comply with its obligations under the national environmental policy act nepa,et.among other things,all argued the forest service failed to take a hard look at the potential environmental consequences of the proposed action as required by nepa,and erroneously determined that the action would not significantly affect the quality of the human environment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants,finding the forest service had complied with nepa and that its decision was not arbitrary or capricious we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and affirm for the reasons that follow.
general requirements of nepa.nepa calls for all federal agencies to use a systematic,interdisciplinary approach in agency,taking into account the natural and social sciences and the environmental design arts.a.among other things,nepa requires federal agencies to prepare a detailed statement of the environmental impact for major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.
nepa has been implemented in part by regulations of the council on environmental quality.see et.under the regulations,an agency contemplating action may be required to prepare an environmental assessment or ea containing a concise discussion of environmental considerations and providing a basis for the agency to determine whether the action is a major one.if the agency finds that the action will not significantly affect the human environment and is thus not a major action,it makes a finding of no significant impact or fonsi.if it finds the action will significantly affect the environment,it is then required to prepare a more extensive analysis in the form of an environmental impact statement or eis.see airport neighbors alliance,united states,cir.

boulder top is a acre plateau at about feet elevation on top of boulder mountain in the dixie national forest.it is interspersed with numerous lakes and forest areas and is a popular recreation destination for camping,fishing,hiking and hunting.
sixteen lakes on boulder top are managed for fish production.the main fish species on boulder top include brook trout and yellowstone cutthroat trout.lakes on boulder top that support sport fishing are generally more productive than lakes in other areas of utah.the lakes that consistently overwinter trout have sufficient depth and volume to supply fish through the long winter,when snow and ice cover prevent photosynthesis and the atmospheric input of oxygen.many of the lakes on boulder top are relatively shallow,and there is a delicate balance concerning a lake ability to overwinter trout from one year to the next.for this reason,any decrease in lake depth from sediment accumulation can decrease or eliminate trout survival.see.at.
the boulder top area contains approximately miles of vehicular routes.the road system was summarized by the forest service as follows 
the majority of the roads are the result of past and ongoing dry log timber harvest activities.other roads have resulted from recreationists seeking access to lakes and scenic overlooks,and permittees driving between grazing allotments.in almost all cases,very little thought was given to proper road location,design standards,or maintenance objectives.roads were located so as to incur the least amount of work and therefore costs.many have resulted from simply driving across the gently rolling open meadows,weaving among the rocks wherever possible.where trees have been encountered,primitive road prisms have been constructed if it was physically impossible to weave among the rocks and trees.the net result is a system of low speed primitive roads passable to high clearance vehicles during dry weather,but requiring drive during inclement weather.
road maintenance on the boulder top has been minimal.those involved in the harvest of dry logs have made a good faith effort to maintain the roads they are using,but due to the road prisms and materials available to work with,their efforts are somewhat futile and short lived.maintenance has consisted for the most part of surface blading which usually lasts until the next storm when of the travel way occurs once again.most of the road prisms consist of wheel tracks if blading has occurred and a trench section if blading has been performed.of the trench section tends to just deepen the roadway,allowing for the collection of more water and thus numerous mud holes.when the mud holes become impassible,the practice has been to drive around them,resulting in a torn up,dual or triple tracked section of roadway.
the constructed sections of roadway generally are in timbered areas or areas of excessive rock.typical sections consist of a narrow road prism,often trenched,with slash and boulders lining both sides of the roadway,thus preventing proper maintenance or drainage work.
in the early,utah department of wildlife resource udwr fisheries biologists realized that many of the lakes on boulder top were being impacted by sediment.many lakes that had historically supported overwintering populations of trout were becoming shallower due to increased sediment,and as a result,winter kill of trout was becoming more prevalent.over the course of several years the udwr attempted to reduce winter kill through the use of mechanical aerators,but eventually decided these attempts were not beneficial and were not addressing the root of the problem.according to biologists,much of the sediment increase in the lakes was attributable to poorly located,constructed or improperly drained roads.udwr eventually recommended that the forest service take steps to reduce the sedimentation.at.
by,the forest service had commenced a study of the boulder top area.on june,the forest service published an environmental assessment ea for boulder top with a proposed action and various alternative proposals.the ea determined that action was needed to correct the sediment entering the lakes from improper road location and drainage,and said the purpose of the proposed action was to improve watershed conditions,fisheries and the road system on boulder top to reduce damage.at.the ea noted that although sedimentation of lakes is a natural process,t he sediment impacts from roads and other uses in the riparian areas around the lakes has accelerated sedimentation rates,and the increased sedimentation is a serious threat to fisheries on boulder top.id.at.the ea pointed out that lake sedimentation had been identified where poorly located,poorly drained roads provided access to lakes,and noted that raft lake and meeks lake,for example,contain sediment deltas formed directly from access roads and gullies originating from those roads.id.although the ea identified other activities that also contributed to sedimentation,including timber harvesting and livestock grazing,the forest service viewed these as less urgent problems and asserted that a major source of this sediment is unplanned,poorly located,or substandard roads.id.at.in assessing the various alternative courses of action and the potential impact of road closures to remedy the problem,the ea stated r esearch has shown that up to a reduction in soil erosion is possible when road closure is applied as a mitigation.when roads are permanently obliterated,a reduction in erosion from the roadbed is possible guide for predicting sediment yields from forested watersheds.using these figures,the forest service estimated potential decreased sediment yields from roads under each of six alternatives described in the ea,including a no action alternative.the forest service initial proposed action called for closing about miles of roads,leaving miles open.one of the alternative courses of action,identified as alternative d,involved closure of about miles of roads.the ea projected that this more extensive action would reduce the sediment yield from roads to about of the yield from taking no action.it involved road closures at of the lakes identified as being impacted by sediment from roadbed erosion.see,exh.the ea concluded that alternative d would restore about watershed acres,compared to acres that would be restored under the forest service more limited proposed action.see.at.
aside from discussing and comparing the various alternatives,the ea listed and discussed mitigation measures to be taken to avoid adverse environmental impacts.the ea also discussed at length approximately pages the affected areas of the environment and the projected consequences of the proposed action and the alternatives,including the effects on the watershed,fisheries,plant and wildlife,recreation and wilderness areas,visual quality,and the impact.
on august,after a review period involving consideration of public comments,the forest service issued its first decision notice and fonsi.that decision announced that the forest service would adopt a combination of the initial proposed action and alternative d.after various administrative appeals and proceedings,the forest service withdrew its first decision.on january,the forest service issued a second decision notice and finding of no significant impact.at.the final decision adopted a modified version of alternative d under which about miles of boulder top roads would be closed,leaving miles open to motorized use.
on appeal,first contends the forest service violated nepa by failing to take a hard look at all of the relevant environmental factors.it objects to the forest service reliance upon the guide to predicting sediment yields from forested watersheds hereinafter the guide,arguing the service failed to apply the actual analysis contained in the guide and slavishly adopted that study quantitative findings without making necessary adjustments for local conditions at boulder top.appellant also contends the forest service erred by failing to analyze sediment yields under the method described in determining the risk of cumulative watershed effects resulting from multiple activities,usda forest service or under some other appropriate scientific method.us all further contends the environmental assessment was deficient because it did not consider or propose to address other potential causes of sedimentation,such as livestock grazing.
aside from challenging the methods used in the environmental assessment,all argues that the forest service erred by finding the proposed action would not significantly affect the human environment.according to appellant,application of the factors listed in shows that this proposed action is in fact a major or significant one.believes the forest service failed to adequately consider several important factors in its determination,including the indirect effects of closing a majority of the roads on boulder top and the impact upon boulder top as a unique geographic area.
we have considered appellant challenges to the environmental assessment in this case,but we see nothing to indicate the forest service failed to comply with nepa.
the forest service identified a specific need for action to correct the sediment entering the lakes from improper road location and drainage.at that need,and the fact that substandard roads were a major source of the lake sediment problem,was amply documented by the observations of udwr and forest service personnel over an extended period of time.for example,a survey by forest service and udwr biologists identified numerous examples of roadbed erosion into boulder top lakes and recommended various road closures.see aple.at.common sense alone suggests that a haphazard system of roads in close proximity to lakes would likely be a significant cause of erosion,and there is no dispute that agency personnel documented significant visible effects of lake sedimentation from the roads on boulder top.those observations were duly noted and discussed in the ea.see.at all lakes being impacted by roads show evidence of sediment delta fans forming where the roads approach the lakes.in some instances,the roads have active gullies up to feet deep going down to the lakes.it was not arbitrary or capricious for the forest service to rely upon such observations and informed opinions,nor was it arbitrary or capricious for the service to conclude that the roads on boulder top were a major source of lake sedimentation that needed to be remedied.
appellant contends the forest service use of the guide to predicting sediment yields in the course of its assessment was contrary to nepa hard look requirement because the service did not follow the detailed formulas in the guide and used that study quantitative findings without making adjustments for local conditions.these arguments are unavailing.as noted above,the fact that roads were causing significant sedimentation was documented in the environmental assessment.the forest service concedes it did not undertake a comprehensive watershed study on the magnitude of the one described in the guide,but correctly points out that nepa did not mandate such a massive study as a prerequisite to action.sierra club lynn,cir nepa does not demand that every federal decision be verified by reduction to mathematical absolutes for insertion into a precise formula.the record shows that the forest service undertook to calculate the erosion that was being caused by the roads on boulder top.aple.at.in doing so,the service relied upon germane portions of the guide analyzing sedimentation from roads and the likely reduction to be obtained through road closure or obliteration.we are not persuaded by appellant argument that this was a misuse of the study.the guide itself admonishes users to use their technical expertise and considerable professional judgment to assure that reasonable use is made of the model.models are simply tools to assist in decision making,and users ought to test model results against their best technical judgment of what can logically be expected to actually occur on the ground.at.there is nothing improper about the fact that the guide was used primarily to estimate the impact of road closures.moreover,as the district court noted,the record shows the forest service in fact took into account variables reflecting local conditions at boulder top including the slope and geological erosion rate for that locale as part of its discussion and analysis of environmental impact.see aple.at.
the record shows that the forest service used the guide as a basis for comparison of the various alternatives.it was cited to support the forest service view that the action would significantly reduce sedimentation from roads,noting r esearch has shown that up to a reduction in soil erosion is possible when road closure is applied as a mitigation and w hen roads are permanently obliterated,a reduction from the roadbed is also possible.at.appellant has not shown that reliance upon these figures was irrational or unsound.under the circumstances,the forest service determination was not arbitrary or capricious,but r
