oregon natural resources council fund et.onrc appeals a summary judgment in favor of the bureau of land management blm.we reverse and remand.
onrc challenged the wilson logging project in the glendale resource area of the medford blm district in oregon,on the ground that the project violated the national environmental policy act of nepa.the specific violation was alleged to consist of conducting an insufficient environmental analysis.onrc argues that the blm did not sufficiently consider the cumulative impact of the wilson logging project in conjunction with other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable projects on timber harvest levels and on the northern spotted owl critical habitat.the district court concluded that because logging operations had been completed the cause was moot,and granted summary judgment.
background 
the blm issued an environmental assessment ea for the wilson logging project in the glendale resource area of the medford blm district in july.in october,the blm issued a finding of no significant impact on the human environment and therefore did not prepare a more thorough environmental impact statement.
onrc commenced this action to halt the project in a timely manner but did not succeed in obtaining a preliminary injunction.onrc contends that the blm failed to comply with nepa environmental review requirements and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.the parties for summary judgment,and the district court issued an order granting summary judgment to the blm on june.meanwhile,logging proceeded.
on august,onrc moved the district court for relief from the summary judgment,citing two subsequent decisions lands council powell,cir,as amended,and wildlands ctr.bureau of land,cir kswc.
the district court denied the requested relief,holding that a change in law does not trigger federal rule of civil procedure b,and that there were no extraordinary circumstances present to warrant invocation of rule b.the district court did state that n otwithstanding its holding,the court would reconsider the june,order in light of subsequent ninth circuit precedent if the court of appeals were to find that procedure to be appropriate.final judgment was entered on february.
onrc filed without success a motion for injunction pending appeal.the district court stated that kswc raises serious questions regarding this court holding that the bureau of land management blm analysis of cumulative effects on northern spotted owls and habitat dependent species and the habitat is sufficiently rigorous to satisfy the requirements of the national environmental policy act.the court then denied onrc motion,stating that a lthough plaintiffs have raised a serious question for litigation on the merits,this relatively small project is nearing completion,with only commercial thinning operations remaining on lands allocated for timber production.
on appeal onrc contends that the wilson ea lacked a sufficiently detailed analysis of the cumulative effects of past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future timber harvests on habitat.

iii.mootness 
the blm argues that this action is moot because all of the timber harvesting has been completed and there remain no project activities that could cause a significant environmental impact.i n deciding a mootness issue,the question is not whether the precise relief sought at the time the application for an injunction was filed is still available.the question is whether there can be any effective relief.nw.envtl.def.ctr.gordon,cir quoting garcia lawn,cir.
when evaluating the issue of mootness in nepa cases,we have repeatedly emphasized that if the completion of the action challenged under nepa is sufficient to render the case nonjusticiable,entities could merely ignore the requirements of nepa,build its structures before a case gets to court,and then hide behind the mootness doctrine.such a result is not acceptable.

in its complaint onrc sought declaratory and injunctive relief in addition to costs,fees,and s uch other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.the wilson project is not finished,and the absence of a proper environmental assessment affected,or at least could have affected,not only the logging decision but also the mitigation decision.the absence of the appropriate hard look analysis thus has present consequences.although the harvested trees can not be restored,b ecause harm to old growth species may yet be remedied by any number of mitigation strategies,this case is not moot.neighbors of cuddy mountain alexander,cir identifying possible relief beyond preventing logging including ordering the forest service to study the timber sale impacts on species viability and to mitigate those impacts in the sale area and elsewhere,ordering the forest service to adjust future timber plans to compensate for this allegedly unlawful one,and more direct species population intervention such as monitoring population trends and developing artificial habitats for their recovery.neighbors involved claims under both nepa and the national forest management act of nfma,and while the court determined the case was not moot because of relief available under nfma,it did not conclude that the appellants nepa claim was moot for lack of available relief.rather,the court held there was no nepa violation in the first instance,because the agency had taken the required hard look at potential environmental impacts.id.at.conversely,the blm has not taken the requisite hard look in this case,a failure that,as discussed below,has present consequences.our holding is also consistent with earth island inst.forest,cir.in that case the logging company had a continuing right to cut trees that met certain tree mortality guidelines,while the project term in this case has expired.however,the live controversy in earth island did not exist solely because of the prospective right to continue logging,but also because there were a variety of measures that could provide some effective relief,including revising the tree mortality guidelines,monitoring of the california spotted owl,and obtaining more accurate population surveys of certain bird species.id.at.
in the instant case,thinning and other husbandry functions were yet to be completed at the time the case was submitted,and an appropriate ea can yet yield effective relief.in addition to hazardous fuel and slash pile management together with related mitigation of past damage and prevention of future damage that could be accomplished by road closures,erosion prevention,and monitoring of the logging effects on northern spotted owl activity,the record in this case reveals blm preparation for future sales in contiguous or neighboring habitat areas.all such concerns have to be considered with reference to habitat deterioration in the hard look required in a legally sufficient ea.
iv.how the ea falls short 
the wilson environmental assessment is inadequate for the reasons previously explained in kswc.first,the blm failed to disclose and consider quantified and detailed information regarding the cumulative impact of the wilson logging project combined with past,present,and reasonably foreseeable logging projects.second,the ea was tiered to other documents that did not contain the requisite information about cumulative effects.
quantified and detailed information 
the blm failed to disclose and consider quantified and detailed information regarding the cumulative impact of the wilson logging project combined with past,present,and reasonably foreseeable logging projects.the blm distinguishes the requirements of an environmental assessment from an environmental impact statement eis,and argues that the wilson ea contains enough information to allow it to determine that the project would have no significant environmental impacts.this argument in effect says that the ea is sufficient because we say it is.as discussed below,case law in this circuit holds that such an answer must be supported by proper procedure.
in determining whether a proposed action will significantly impact the human environment,the agency must consider w hether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts.significance exists if it is reasonable to anticipate a cumulatively significant impact on the environment.b.nepa implementing regulations define cumulative impact as the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.
the wilson ea discussion of cumulative impacts identifies seven past and future actions which could affect the watershed.the ea notes that 
the key elk,wilson,and future bear pen and willy slide timber sales,would remove or modify up to approximately acres of habitat.several large blocks greater than acres,functioning as corner to corner contiguous habitat with other blocks,are likely to be substantially reduced,and fragmented.the remaining small isolated habitat blocks in some sections are likely to be harvested,removing the last blocks in some sections.
the ea then addressed the effects of this removal on high mobility and low mobility species.species with high mobility,such as northern spotted owls,would likely still be able to disperse across the landscape,while t he dispersal capability of species with low mobility,such as del norte salamanders,red tree voles,and mollusks,would be substantially reduced 
kswc addressed a similar cumulative impact objection to eas.like the wilson ea,the eas at issue in kswc did not contain objective quantified assessments of the combined environmental impacts of the proposed actions.kswc,at.the discussion of future foreseeable actions consisted of an estimate of the number of acres to be harvested.a calculation of the total number of acres to be harvested in the watershed is a necessary component of a cumulative effects analysis,but it is not a sufficient description of the actual environmental effects that can be expected from logging those acres.id.at.the eas also stated that environmental concerns such as air quality,water quality,and endangered species would not be affected.id.however,t he ea is silent as to the degree that each factor will be impacted and how the project design will reduce or eliminate the identified impacts.this conclusory presentation does not offer any more than the kind of general statements about possible effects and some risk which we have held to be insufficient to constitute a hard look.id.internal quotation marks omitted.both the wilson and the kswc eas do not sufficiently identify or discuss the incremental impact that can be expected from each successive timber sale,or how those individual impacts might combine or synergistically interact with each other to affect the watershed environment.id.at.
the wilson ea is tiered to documents which did not contain the requisite information about the impacts of past,present,and reasonably foreseeable logging.
tiering refers to the coverage of general matters in broader environmental impact statements such as national program or policy statements with subsequent narrower statements or environmental analyses such as regional or basinwide program statements or ultimately statements incorporating by reference the general discussions and concentrating solely on the issues specific to the statement subsequently prepared.
the wilson ea is tiered to the west fork cow creek wastershed analysis,and to the medford district proposed regional management.in kswc,we held that the medford district could not save the eas because it was missing any specific information about the cumulative effects.neither in the nor in the eas does the agency reveal the incremental impact that can be expected as a result of each of these four successive timber sales.kswc,at.the blm contends that,unlike the wilson project land,the land involved in kswc was not matrix land identified to produce a sustainable supply of timber and other forest commodities.however,both cases involve tier key watersheds which contain designated critical habitat for the northern spotted owl.id.at.contrary to the blm contention,kswc is not distinguishable on this ground.tiering to the medford district does not save the ea cumulative effects analysis.prepared in,the west fork cow creek watershed analysis similarly does not address the incremental impact of the wilson logging project,and therefore does not save the cumulative effects analysis.moreover,the watershed analysis is not a nepa document and therefore the ea can not tier to it.id.at.
conclusion 
the summary judgment is reversed.on remand,the district court is instructed to enjoin the remainder of the wilson project until the blm provides a revised environmental assessment,including the required hard look at cumulative impacts of the logging already completed on contiguous habitat areas or neighboring habitat areas to be impacted by contemplated future sales.
reversed and remanded with instructions.
the district court dismissed this case because logging operations had been completed and the cause was moot.op.at.without disagreeing with the underlying all logging and hauling operations have been completed and all that remains to be done to complete the project is some minor cleanup work in the form of hand piling and slash majority holds that this case is not moot.because,in this case which presents only a challenge under the national environmental policy act nepa,i disagree with that conclusion,i respectfully dissent.
a moot action is one where the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.nw.envtl.def.ctr.gordon,cir quoting murphy hunt,d per curiam.it is the constitutional duty of this court,as of every other judicial tribunal to decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect,and not to give opinions on moot questions.neighbors of cuddy mountain alexander,cir thompson,dissenting in part quoting mills green.cuddy mountain ii.accordingly,if effective relief can not be granted,we lack jurisdiction.id.citing church of scientology united states,d.
all of the logging and hauling of trees at the blm wilson logging project was completed in september,more than one year ago our cases are clear that,in these circumstances,no effective relief is available under nepa.in headwaters,bureau of land management,cir,plaintiffs alleged that the blm managed the logging of three units of a timber sale in violation of the federal land policy and management act of.at the time of the appeal,the three units included in the sale had already been logged.id.at.even though defendants still had to haul percent of the logs from the site,and plaintiffs made a broad request for such other relief as the court deemed appropriate,we deemed the case moot because n o relief would bring back the trees.id.at,see also friends of the earth,bergland,cir where the activities sought to be enjoined have already occurred,and the appellate courts can not undo what has already been done,the action is moot.in the instant case,the slash burning that remains to be completed is an extremely trivial component of the overall project,one that,if independently assessed,undoubtedly would have no significant environmental impact.thus,in this case,even less remains to be done to complete the project than in headwaters,which we deemed moot.
