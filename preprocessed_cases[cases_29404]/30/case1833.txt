this appeal raises two challenges to the jurisdiction of the california coastal commission commission to regulate,namely does the commission have the power to unilaterally designate environmentally sensitive habitat areas and thereby prevent development does the commission have the power to prevent development on land four and a half miles from the ocean on the grounds that the development will impair scenic and visual resources of a coastal zone that extends five miles inland into the santa monica mountains below,the commission denied the application filed by appellants milos douda and trisha douda collectively the doudas for a coastal development permit to build a home,finding that their property contains an environmentally sensitive habitat area that had not been designated in the los angeles county land use plan,and that the proposed development would impair scenic and visual resources.the doudas filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate to challenge the denial of their application.the trial court upheld the commission action,and the doudas now appeal.after reviewing the record,we conclude that the trial court properly denied relief.
the california coastal act of 
in,the legislature enacted the california coastal act of coastal act,which became division of the public resources code.stats,ch,et,pub.resources code.the legislature declared that the california coastal zone is a distinct and valuable natural resource of vital and enduring interest to all people,that the permanent protection of the state natural and scenic resources is a paramount concern to present and future residents of the state and nation,and that to promote the public safety,health,and welfare,and to protect public and private property,wildlife,marine fisheries,and other ocean resources,and the natural environment,it is necessary to protect the ecological balance of the coastal zone and prevent its deterioration and destruction.
under the coastal act,each local government must either prepare a local coastal program for the portion of the coastal zone within its jurisdiction,or request that the commission prepare it,subd.a.the content of a local coastal program shall be determined by the local government in full consultation with the commission and with full public participation,subd.b.a local coastal program is defined as a local government land use plans,zoning ordinances,zoning district maps and other actions which,when taken together,implement the provisions and policies of the coastal act.land use plan means the relevant portions of a local government general plan,or local coastal element which are sufficiently detailed to indicate the kinds,location,and intensity of land uses,the applicable resource protection and development policies and,where necessary,a listing of implementing actions.pursuant to the coastal act,the land use plan of a local coastal program must be submitted to a regional coastal commission for review or,if a regional coastal commission does not exist,for approval and certification by the commission,subd.a.if approved by the regional coastal commission,the land use plan of a local coastal program must be forwarded to the commission for certification.the commission must certify the land use plan of a local coastal program if it does not raise a substantial issue as to conformity with the policies of chapter of the coastal act,subds.a c.additionally,the local government must submit the zoning ordinances,zoning district maps,and other implementing actions to the commission for approval.
in pertinent part,chapter of the coastal act provides that e nvironmentally sensitive habitat areas shall be protected against any significant disruption of habitat values,and only uses dependent on those resources shall be allowed within those areas,subd.a.it goes on to provide that t he scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas shall be considered and protected as a resource of public importance.pursuant to section,subdivision a,the commission was given until september,to designate sensitive coastal resource areas within the coastal zone.the legislature gave the commission the authority to extend that deadline for up to a year.
the coastal act requires a person wishing to undertake development in the coastal zone to obtain a coastal development permit,subd.a.prior to certification of a local coastal program,and absent a local government procedure for issuing coastal development permits,the commission or local government shall issue coastal development permits,subd.c.after certification of its local coastal program or pursuant to the provisions of section,a coastal development permit shall be obtained from the local government as provided for in section or section,subd.d.section provides that after certification,and after all implementing actions have become effective,the development review authority provided for in c hapter commencing with s ection shall no longer be exercised by the commission over any new development proposed,except for appeals to the commission.the review authority shall be delegated to the local government that is implementing the local coastal program,or any portion thereof,subd.a.
section,subdivision a of the coastal act provides in relevant part prior to certification of the local coastal program,a coastal development permit shall be issued if the issuing agency,or the commission on appeal,finds that the proposed development is in conformity with the provisions of c hapter of division and that the permitted development will not prejudice the ability of the local government to prepare a local coastal program that is in conformity with the provisions of c hapter subdivision b provides after certification of the local coastal program,a coastal development permit shall be issued if the issuing agency or the commission on appeal finds that the proposed development is in conformity with the certified local coastal program,subd.b.
the los angeles county land use plan for the santa monica mountains 
in,los angeles county adopted a land use plan for the coastal zone in the santa monica mountains land use plan.the commission certified the land use plan.but the commission never approved any implementing ordinances or zoning maps for the land use plan,and los angeles county does not have a certified local coastal program in the santa monica mountains the land use plan provides for the additional designation of environmentally sensitive habitat areas in unspecified areas through biotic review process or other means,california coastal com.th,d.
the commission retained permitting authority.
the doudas application for a coastal development permit 
on november,the doudas filed an application for a coastal development permit with the commission they sought to construct a square foot,foot high,single family residence,a square foot garage,a septic system,and a pool and spa.
the commission staff recommended denial.it asserted that the proposed development would be highly visible by the public traversing mulholland highway and planned public trails,and would be inconsistent with section.next,it concluded that the coastal sage scrub and chaparral on the doudas property met the definition of an environmentally sensitive habitat area under the coastal act.the staff also concluded that the proposed development would prejudice the ability of los angeles county to prepare a local coastal program for the santa monica mountains and that the california environmental quality act required less invasive proposals.by a vote of eight to zero,the commission denied the doudas application.
the petition for writ of administrative mandate 
the doudas filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate to vacate the denial of their petition for a coastal development permit,and a related complaint for declaratory relief.in part,they alleged that the commission did not have the authority to designate an environmentally sensitive habitat area,or to impose scenic and visual resource regulations on the property.
after trial,the trial court issued a statement of decision,which provided because the doudas did not object to the commission authority to protect scenic and visual resources in the coastal zone when considering permit applications,the doudas did not exhaust their administrative remedies as to that issue.furthermore,the denial of the doudas application must be upheld based on the commission finding that the property contains an environmentally sensitive habitat area.once the commission certifies a land use plan,it has no authority to designate additional environmentally sensitive habitat areas,except as provided by the land use plan.the los angeles county land use plan provides for the identification of additional environmentally sensitive habitat areas through biotic review process or other means.thus,the commission had to determine whether the proposed development conformed to chapter of the coastal act,which required it to determine whether the property contained an environmentally sensitive habitat area.substantial evidence supported its finding that section,subdivision a was implicated.
judgment was entered against the doudas.
this timely appeal followed.
standard of review 
when asked to rule upon a petition for writ of administrative mandate,a trial court is called upon to inquire whether the agency in question prejudicially abused its discretion that is,whether the agency action was arbitrary,capricious,in excess of its jurisdiction,entirely lacking in evidentiary support,or without reasonable or rational basis as a matter of law.citations.sierra club county of napa th,d.on appeal,we review the administrative record under the same standard that governs the trial court.gentry city of murrieta th,d.
discussion 
the issuing agency whether it is the commission or a local government can identify environmentally sensitive habitat areas prior to the certification of a local coastal program.
in,the court held that the commission can designate environmentally sensitive habitat areas in the santa monica mountains pursuant to the land use plan,supra,th at,d.the doudas argue that was wrongly decided and should not be followed.in their view,the commission and therefore the issuing agency,regardless of who it is has only one function,which is to determine whether a proposed development conforms to a certified land use plan or certified local coastal program.the commission,on the other hand,contends that the issuing agency is obligated to uphold section,even if that means designating a new environmentally sensitive habitat area.
we turn to the issue at hand.
under the coastal act,the commission is required to protect the coastal zone delicately balanced ecosystem.bolsa chica land trust superior court th,d bolsa chica.when considering a proposed project governed by the coastal act,the commission must examine the effect of a project on the coastal environment.id.at,d.the coastal act establishes that environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall be protected,subd.a.the policies in chapter of the coastal act constitute the standards by which the adequacy of local programs and the permissibility of proposed developments subject to the provisions of division are determined,subd.a.these last two statutory directives apply,by nature of their generality,to the issuing agency,regardless of whether that is the commission or a local government 
our task is to interpret an issuing agency authority to protect an environmentally sensitive habitat area in light of these statutes.when interpreting a statute,we must ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.we must look first to the words of the statute themselves,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and according significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose.a construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.citations.where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citation.both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.citations.citation.a close cousin of the foregoing quote is the rule that the objective sought to be achieved by a statute as well as the evil to be prevented is of prime consideration in its interpretation.citations.citation.carson redevelopment agency padilla th,d.finally,and in addition to the foregoing rules of construction,the coastal act specifically provides that it shall be liberally construed to accomplish its purposes and objectives.
the coastal act does not identify who is empowered to designate environmentally sensitive habitat areas.impliedly,it contemplates the designation of environmentally sensitive habitat areas in land use plans and local coastal programs because they are,in part,the means by which the policies of the coastal act are implemented.local coastal programs are prepared either by the commission,or by the local government in full consultation with the commission,subds.a b.a land use plan is part of a local coastal program,and it must be submitted to the commission for approval and certification,subd.a.if the commission rejects a land use plan,it may suggest modifications,subd.b.as explained by section,a land use plan is the relevant portion of a local government general plan which indicates the applicable resource protection and development policies.thus,the coastal act envisions that land use plans and local coastal programs will be collaborative efforts between local governments and the commission.
once a local coastal program is certified,the issuing agency has no choice but to issue a coastal development permit as long as the proposed development is in conformity with the local coastal program,subd.b.in other words,an issuing agency can not deviate from a certified local coastal program and designate an additional environmentally sensitive habitat area.but prior to the certification of a local coastal program,the issuing agency has a different task.it must determine whether the proposed development,inter alia,is in conformity with the provisions of chapter of the coastal act,which includes section.
if a local coastal program has not been certified,can the issuing agency designate an environmentally sensitive habitat area the coastal act is silent.in resolving this uncertainty,we must keep in mind the purpose of the coastal act and examine the consequences that will flow from the differing interpretations that the commission and the doudas urge upon us.also,we keep in mind that the coastal act specifically provides heightened protection for environmentally sensitive habitat areas through section.sierra club california coastal com.th,d sierra club.
if we accept the doudas interpretation,it is possible that land which meets the definition of an environmentally sensitive habitat area will be subject to irrevocable alteration through development that violates the policies of the coastal act.this is so because the issuing agency will be powerless to protect any such areas prior to their designation by a local government in a certified land use plan or a certified local coastal program thus,the issuing agency will be prohibited from carrying out its obligation under section,subdivision a at a time when certain natural resources have no protection.on the other hand,the commission interpretation will allow the issuing agency to protect natural resources for the benefit of the public by designating new areas for protection when they meet the definition of an environmentally sensitive habitat area.undeniably,this interpretation more closely comports with the declared and salutary purposes of the coastal act.
notably,the oversight given to an issuing agency prior to the certification of a local coastal program is much broader than the oversight given to it after certification.in the latter case,the issuing agency must do no more than confirm compliance with the policies of the coastal act.in the former case,there is no such constraint.the coastal act does not parse what policies should be specifically enforced,or how they should be enforced.ostensibly,the issuing agency is given wide latitude to examine conformity with all coastal act policies.if the legislature intended to restrict the power of the issuing agency under section,subdivision a,it would have used language similar to the limiting language in section,subdivision b.for example,the legislature could have provided that prior to certification of a local coastal program,the issuing agency must do no more than confirm compliance with the certified land use plan.but the legislature chose broader language,which suggests that it intended to give subdivisions a and b of section divergent meaning.in re young cal th,d,where a statute referring to one subject contains a critical word or phrase,omission of that word or phrase from a similar statute on the same subject generally shows a different legislative intent.
it is no doubt true that the coastal act is premised on the theory that local governments will carry much of the load of implementation.indeed,section provides the legislature further finds and declares that a to achieve maximum responsiveness to local conditions,accountability,and public accessibility,it is necessary to rely heavily on local government and local land use planning procedures and enforcement.but insofar as this provision and others can be construed,as the doudas suggest,as representing a policy of giving sole power to local governments to control their land use and taking away all such power from the commission when it is an issuing agency,that policy conflicts with the policy of protection in section,subdivision a and section,subdivision a.to resolve that conflict,we turn to section,which provides the legislature further finds and recognizes that conflicts may occur between one or more policies of the division.the legislature therefore declares that in carrying out the provisions of this division such conflicts be resolved in a manner which on balance is the most protective of significant coastal resources.thus,section requires us to favor the commission interpretation over the doudas interpretation because it permits greater oversight and protection for environmentally sensitive habitat areas.
additionally,we find it significant that the coastal act is silent regarding who is responsible for implementing section.section provides the commission,unless specifically otherwise provided,shall have the primary responsibility for the implementation of the provisions of this division and is designated as the state coastal zone planning and management agency for any and all purposes,and may exercise any and all powers set forth in the federal coastal zone management act of or any amendment thereto or any other federal act heretofore or hereafter enacted that relates to the planning or management of the coastal zone.because it was not otherwise specifically provided,the primary responsibility for implementing section,by default,must go to the commission.
we do,though,have a concern regarding the commission interpretation.what role,if any,should a certified land use plan play in an issuing agency decision to deny or approve a coastal development permit to promote efficiency and goodwill between agencies,and prevent injurious reliance by property owners,we believe that the issuing agency should consider the contents of a certified land use plan in making a decision.if it ignores the certified land use plan,then the decision may be subject to reversal if a reviewing court finds that the decision was arbitrary and capricious.in other words,the issuing agency must have a good reason for ignoring a certified land use plan,such as a significant change of conditions.
section,which applies to the commission review of a land use plan,offers further guidance.under subsection b of section,t he commission shall require conformance with the policies and requirements of chapter commencing with section only to the extent necessary to achieve the basic state goals specified in section.section establishes that the legislature basic goals are to a protect,maintain,and,where feasible,enhance and restore the overall quality of the coastal zone environment and its natural and artificial resources.b assure orderly,balanced utilization and conservation of coastal zone resources taking into account the social and economic needs of the people of the state.c maximize public access to and along the coast and maximize public recreational opportunities in the coastal zone consistent with sound resources conservation principles and constitutionally protected rights of private property owners.d assure priority for and development over other development on the coast.e encourage state and local initiatives and cooperation in preparing procedures to implement coordinated planning and development for mutually beneficial uses,including educational uses,in the coastal zone.these provisions demonstrate that the legislature intended to curb the commission ability to champion its own agenda over the decisions made by local governments,and over the constitutional rights of property owners who live in a coastal zone.the commission and an issuing agency both have oversight functions,and their analogous functions provide a reason to apply the policy of these provisions to any issuing agency.thus,in reviewing an application for a coastal development permit prior to the certification of a local coastal program,an issuing agency should deny a permit based on a previously undesignated environmentally sensitive habitat area only when necessary to achieve the legislature basic goals.only by exercising such restraint can an issuing agency avoid becoming a de facto manager for a local government land use planning and development.
based on our interpretation of the statutory scheme,we conclude that was correctly decided.
an issuing agency ability to identify environmentally sensitive habitat areas is not curtailed by section.
according to the doudas,the legislature limited the commission power to designate environmentally sensitive habitat areas through section.that statute gave the commission only until september,to designate sensitive coastal resource areas.the doudas claim the environmentally sensitive habitat areas fall within the definition of sensitive coastal resource areas and are subject to the same restrictions on implementation.
our view of the statutes is otherwise.
the coastal act identifies sensitive coastal resource areas as those identifiable and geographically bounded land and water areas within the coastal zone of vital interest and sensitivity and include a special marine and land habitat areas,wetlands,lagoons,and estuaries as mapped and designated in part of the coastal plan.b areas possessing significant recreational value.c highly scenic areas.d archaeological sites referenced in the california coastline and recreation plan or as designated by the state historic preservation officer.e special communities or neighborhoods which are significant visitor destination areas.f areas that provide existing coastal housing or recreational opportunities for low and persons.g areas where divisions of land could substantially impair or restrict coastal access.
the phrase e nvironmentally sensitive habitat areas is not defined in the coastal act.but the phrase e nvironmentally sensitive area is defined in section,and that definition has been accepted as the description of environmentally sensitive habitat areas.sierra club county of napa,supra,th at,d.section provides environmentally sensitive area means any area in which plant or animal life or their habitats are either rare or especially valuable because of their special nature or role in an ecosystem and which could be easily disturbed or degraded by human activities and developments.
the court accepted that section provides the definition for environmentally sensitive habitat areas and,accordingly,held that t he term sensitive coastal resource area is not synonymous with environmentally sensitive area.it was only the commission authority to designate sen
