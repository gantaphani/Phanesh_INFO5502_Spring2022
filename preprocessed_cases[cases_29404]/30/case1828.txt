these two appeals require us to decide the appropriate level of review under the california environmental quality act ceqa for a subdivision project that was initially approved with a mitigated negative declaration but later languished in litigation for so long that its tentative map expired.the board of supervisors of the county of humboldt county determined an environmental impact report eir is now required for the subdivision,either because it should be considered as a new project under ceqa or because new information suggests the existence of potential environmental impacts.on a petition for writ of mandate from the landowner,michael moss,the trial court rejected the argument that the subdivision is a new project but upheld the county determination that an eir is required based on new information about environmental impacts.moss and the county separately appealed from this judgment,and we consolidated the appeals for decision.we agree with the trial court that the subdivision is not a new project for purposes of ceqa but that supplemental environmental review is required based on new information about certain potentially significant impacts.because we conclude substantial evidence supports some of the county findings regarding these impacts,but not others,the judgment is reversed in part and affirmed in part.
background 
on august,moss submitted an application to the county planning commission proposing to subdivide his parcel of approximately acres into four smaller parcels ranging in size from to acres.the site consists of undeveloped,recently harvested timberland,and the project would allow three additional parcels to be developed for agricultural and residential use.the north fork of luffenholtz creek runs through the middle of the land and would provide the water source for three of the planned parcels.this tributary flows into the much larger main fork of luffenholtz creek at the south end of the property.luffenholtz creek supplies the water for the city of trinidad,which is located downstream.water for the fourth parcel would be provided by deadman creek.
after extensive study and public hearings,on november,the planning commission approved a tentative subdivision map and adopted a mitigated negative declaration finding that the project environmental impacts were either insignificant or would be mitigated to a level of insignificance.several findings in the mitigated negative declaration are of particular note.first,planning staff found that although the project would reduce the surface water in luffenholtz creek slightly,it would not cause a substantial reduction in the amount of water available for supplying the city of trinidad.an engineering study conducted in january estimated that,based upon peak usage,additional could be supplied by the flows of luffenholtz creek even in a dry year.assuming each parcel of the proposed subdivision of the moss property consumed a full of water,would remain available for trinidad,thus allowing approximately a percent increase over the current number of water users.in addition,approval of the project was conditioned upon improvements to adams fox farm road and the implementation of fire safety requirements,which led the county planning staff to find that the project would have a positive effect upon fire protection services.moss was also required to undertake erosion control measures and establish streamside setbacks of feet to avoid any impact to the creeks.with these setbacks,planning staff found that the project would result in no impact to wetland habitats or to wildlife dispersal or migration corridors.staff observed that previous timber harvests on the property were more damaging to wildlife than the addition of four residences would be.
a citizens group called the friends of westhaven and trinidad appealed the planning commission approval to the county board of supervisors,but the board rejected the appeal as untimely.the group petition for mandamus was denied by the trial court,and we affirmed this ruling on appeal.friends of westhaven and trinidad county of humboldt,nonpub.opn.
meanwhile,in november,approval of the tentative map for the moss subdivision expired.friends of westhaven trinidad county of humboldt th,d friends see,subd.a an approved or conditionally approved tentative map shall expire months after its approval or conditional approval.on august,moss sought to stay expiration of the tentative map during the period it was subject to litigation.friends,supra,th at,d see,subd.e allowing stay of expiration period during pendency of a lawsuit challenging approval or conditional approval of tentative map.the board of supervisors granted moss request,and the citizens group challenged its decision in a petition for writ of mandate.friends,supra,th at,d.the trial court denied the petition however,we reversed on appeal,concluding the board of supervisors had no power to stay expiration of the tentative map after the map had already expired.id.at,d.because moss application for a stay was made four months after the litigation ended and nine months after the tentative map expired pursuant to government code section,subdivision a,we concluded it was untimely and thus should not have been granted.friends,supra,th at,d.
on january,moss filed a new application with the county planning commission for approval of the same tentative map that had previously expired.based on the belief that the new application represented a new project requiring full ceqa review,planning staff conducted an initial study and this time determined that an eir would be required before moss could proceed with the project.moss appealed this decision to the board of supervisors,but he was unsuccessful.on august,the board approved resolutions affirming the planning director decision on two alternative grounds.in resolution,the board concluded an eir was required because the initial treated the subdivision as a new project for ceqa a fair argument of potential adverse environmental impacts.the board adopted several findings from the initial study concerning potential impacts to agricultural and biological resources,geology,fire safety,hydrology and water quality,land use and planning,public services and transportation.in its alternative finding,resolution,the board observed a mitigated negative declaration had been prepared for the project in but determined additional ceqa review was required based on its receipt of new information of substantial importance.specifically,this information consisted of evidence from the water commissioner of the city of trinidad about the city increased water usage,the potential consequences of a water shortage,and potential impacts of the project on the city water quality and evidence that the mapped habitat area for coho salmon,a threatened species,includes luffenholtz creek and that the main fork of the creek is a habitat for coastal cutthroat trout,a species of special concern.
moss filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the board decision.after a hearing on the merits,the trial court found that the moss subdivision is a previously approved project,not a new project,for purposes of ceqa review.however,the court found substantial evidence supported the board alternative finding that an eir is required based on the existence of significant environmental effects not previously considered or more severe effects than were previously considered.accordingly,the court denied the petition for writ of mandate.after moss objected to the proposed order of judgment,the trial court issued an order clarifying that only those issues discussed by the board in resolution are required to be addressed in the eir.
moss has appealed from the court decision that an eir is required based on evidence of new or different significant impacts,and the county has filed a separate appeal challenging the court ruling that the subdivision is not a new project requiring full ceqa review 
discussion 
levels of review under ceqa 
when a local agency considers the environmental effects of a proposed project,ceqa provides three options.the agency must prepare and certify the completion of an eir if the project may have a significant effect on the environment,subd.a,italics added.if the agency determines the project will not have a significant effect on the environment,it must prepare a negative declaration to that effect,subd.c guidelines,subd.f.finally,if the project has potentially significant environmental effects but these effects will be reduced to insignificance by mitigation measures that the project proponent has agreed to undertake,ceqa requires the local agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration,subd.c guidelines,subd.f.
determination of whether an eir is required when a project is first reviewed depends upon the fair argument test.friends of davis city of davis th,d sierra club county of sonoma th,d.the fair argument test is derived from section,which requires an eir on any project which may have a significant effect on the environment.that section mandates preparation of an eir in the first instance whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact.citation.if there is substantial evidence of such impact,contrary evidence is not adequate to support a decision to dispense with an eir.citations.section creates a low threshold requirement for initial preparation of an eir and reflects a preference for resolving doubts in favor of environmental review when the question is whether any such review is warranted.citations.for example,if there is a disagreement among experts over the significance of an effect,the agency is to treat the effect as significant and prepare an eir.citations.sierra club county of sonoma,supra,th at,d.
the test is markedly different,however,if a project is evaluated after an initial environmental review has occurred.a fter an eir has been prepared for a project,section prohibits agencies from requiring a subsequent or supplemental eir unless s ubstantial changes are proposed in the project or in its circumstances which will require major revisions in the eir,or unless certain new information becomes available.see also guidelines.sierra club county of sonoma,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.although the statute speaks only in terms of the eir,ceqa guidelines apply section to project changes following an agency adoption of a negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration as well as an eir,and this interpretation has been upheld.guidelines,subd.b benton board of supervisors d.benton.american canyon community united for responsible growth city of american canyon th,d american canyon see also save our neighborhood lishman th,d applying section to further review of a project for which a mitigated negative declaration had previously been adopted save our neighborhood.
accordingly,after a project has been subjected to environmental review,the statutory presumption flips in favor of the developer and against further review.whereas t he question addressed by section is whether any environmental review is warranted bowman city of petaluma d,section comes into play precisely because review has already occurred,the time for challenging the sufficiency of the original eir has long since expired citation,and the question is whether circumstances have changed enough to justify repeating a substantial portion of the process.thus,while section is intended to create a low threshold requirement for preparation of an eir citation,section indicates a quite different intent,namely,to restrict the powers of agencies by prohibiting them from requiring a subsequent or supplemental environmental impact report unless the stated conditions are met.citation.bowman city of petaluma,supra,d at.
in this case,the county asserts further environmental review of the moss subdivision is required under both section and section.the distinction is important because if the subdivision is considered a new project for purposes of ceqa,the county may require an eir based only on a fair argument that the project will have significant biological impacts,and all doubts are to be resolved in favor of allowing such review.sierra club county of sonoma,supra,th at,d bowman city of petaluma,supra,d at.guidelines,subd.g.
ii.resubmitted application is not a new project 
standard of review 
generally speaking the question on judicial review of an agency decision under ceqa is whether the agency abused its discretion.abuse of discretion in this context means the agency failed to proceed as required by law or there was no substantial evidence to support its decision.thus in reviewing the adequacy of an eir the trial court does not determine whether the agency final determinations were correct but only whether the agency arrived at them in accordance with the law and on the basis of substantial evidence.on appeal we independently review the administrative record under the same standard of review which governs the trial court.lincoln place tenants city of los angeles th,d,fns.omitted lincoln place see also,american canyon,supra,th at,d river valley preservation project metropolitan transit development bd.th,d bowman city of petaluma,supra,d at.
although the standards for judicial review of an agency decision under sections and are well settled,the issue is not so clear with respect to the agency decision about which of these statutes governs the environmental review process.courts have reached different conclusions about the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny to be applied to an agency determination about whether a project is new,such that section applies,or whether it is a modification of a previously reviewed project,such that section applies.
in save our neighborhood,supra,th,d,the third district court of appeal held that this threshold question of whether we are dealing with a change to a particular project or a new project altogether id.at,d is a question of law for the court.citation.id.at,d.similarly,in considering whether the demolition of an apartment complex was part of a previously reviewed redevelopment project or was itself a new project,division seven of the second district court of appeal observed,the question of what constitutes a project for purposes of ceqa review is a question of law which we review de novo.lincoln place,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted accord association for a cleaner environment yosemite community college dist.th,d black property owners city of berkeley th,d kaufman bay,morgan hill unified school dist.th,d.
however,division two of the second district court of appeal recently disagreed with this holding of save our neighborhood.mani brothers real estate group city of los angeles th,d mani brothers.the mani brothers court strongly criticized the new project test it perceived save our neighborhood had employed to determine whether changes in a project required full ceqa review.mani brothers,supra,th at,d.the court observed drastic changes to a project might be viewed by some as transforming the project to a new project,while others may characterize the same drastic changes in a project as resulting in a dramatically modified project.such labeling entails no specific guidelines and simply is not helpful to our analysis.ibid.the court also disagreed with the observation in save our neighborhood that it is a question of law whether a project is new or is a modification subject to section.mani brothers,supra,th at,d.instead,the mani brothers court believed proper deference to agency decisions in administrative matters requires such decisions to be upheld by the courts so long as they are supported by substantial evidence.ibid.
the primary criticism mani brothers leveled against save our neighborhood was that its question of law approach would permit courts to decide the appropriate level of environmental review for a modified project without considering the environmental impacts of the modifications.mani brothers,supra,th at,d.in other words,mani brothers was particularly concerned about courts drawing their own conclusions about what is essentially a factual,whether the effect of changes to a project render it so drastically changed as to constitute a new project.the development at issue in save our neighborhood was planned for the same land and involved the same mix of uses described in an earlier project thus,even though the later project had different proponents and was not derived from designs or plans of the earlier project,it arguably imposed no different or greater environmental impacts than had previously been studied.see save our neighborhood,supra,th at,d.
unlike the situations in save our neighborhood and mani brothers,the county argument here does not raise or depend upon any factual assertions about the nature of the project.moss submitted the same tentative map to the county in that he had submitted in,and it is undisputed that the proposed subdivision project did not change in any substantial way.the only difference is that the project application does not describe an upgrade to adams fox farm road,an improvement which the county had required as a condition of the project approval in.but,as the county recognizes,the reason moss omitted the road upgrade from his description of the project was that he had already completed the upgrade in,with permission and approval from the county.although the county mentions completion of the road it had previously a difference of note,the county does not contend this single,minor change is sufficient to justify treatment of the subdivision as an entirely new project.instead,the county argues all proceedings related to the moss project bec a me void or terminated by operation of law when the previously approved tentative map for the project expired,and therefore the county was justified in treating the proposal as a new project under ceqa even though the project itself had not changed in any way.the legal effect that expiration of a project tentative map has on ceqa review of the project is not a factual question,nor is it a matter that would typically be within a local agency realm of expertise.it is a question of law subject to de novo review on appeal.save our carmel river monterey peninsula water management dist.th,d where an issue turns on interpretation of ceqa provisions or the guidelines,the appeal presents a question of law subject to de novo review lincoln place,supra,th at,d interpretation of what constitutes a project under ceqa is subject to de novo review bodega bay concerned citizens county of sonoma th,d whether a county has authority to extend expiration of tentative map is a question of law subject to de novo review.
expiration of tentative map did not alter the ceqa project 
in friends,the sole issue before us on appeal was whether the county board of supervisors had authority to approve moss request to stay expiration of the tentative map for his project in light of the fact that this request was made nine months after the map had expired pursuant to government code section,subd.a.friends,supra,th at,d.considering only applicable provisions of the subdivision map act,et,and without mentioning a single ceqa provision,we concluded moss could not obtain such a stay after the map had expired.friends,supra,th at,d.we noted that a stay prevents expiration from occurring therefore,based on the plain meaning of the word,only an unexpired period can be stayed.id.at,d.after expiration,we said,there is nothing left to stay.ibid.we also observed that when a tentative map expires,t he developer loses all rights to subdivide pursuant to that map and must start anew.ibid.
although our comments were directed only to the continuing vitality of a tentative map after it has expired pursuant to government code section,subdivision a,the county lifts them out of this context and insists they stand for the broad proposition that expiration of an approved tentative map extinguishes the development project for purposes of ceqa review as well.under the view set forth by the county,if the tentative map for a project expires months after its approval or conditional approval,subd.a,not only would the developer have to resubmit the map for a new approval,but the environmental effects of the project would have to be reevaluated from scratch,as if no prior ceqa review had occurred.this issue was not before us in friends,and we expressed no opinion on the ceqa consequences of an expired map.see county of ventura channel islands marina,th,d a case is not authority for matters not discussed therein.it is worth noting,however,that after friends was decided another panel of this division held that a county has authority to extend the expiration date of a tentative map,even after the map has expired,so long as an application for an extension was timely filed.bodega bay concerned citizens county of sonoma,supra,th at,d.this holding undercuts the county theory that expiration of a tentative map constitutes an irrevocable bar that terminates all proceedings related to the map under both the subdivision map act and ceqa.
beyond the friends case,which did not address the issue,the county cites no legal authority for its position,and we have found none.fund for environmental defense county of orange d.fund,involved a similar situation,in that after a developer had obtained a use permit for its project,with a certified eir,the use permit expired.when the developer applied for a new use permit five years later,the county approved it without requiring preparation of a subsequent or supplemental eir instead,the county relied on the previous eir and an addendum.id.at.although this decision was challenged by a petition for writ of mandate,no party suggested that expiration of the use permit transformed the proposed development into a new project for ceqa purposes.rather,the issue on appeal was whether changes in the project and the surrounding circumstances were so substantial that supplemental environmental review was required under section.fund,supra,d at.similarly,in security environmental systems,south coast air quality management dist.d,an air quality management agency approved a negative declaration and issued several conditional permits for construction of a hazardous waste incinerator.when the project proponent requested an extension of the permits,which were set to expire,the agency imposed several conditions on its approval,including a demand that the proponent prepare an eir for the project.id.at.although the court of appeal held the agency had discretion to deny an extension of the permits id.at,it ruled that,having previously approved a negative declaration for the project,the agency could not now require an eir unless significant new information justified further ceqa review under section.security environmental systems,south coast air quality management,supra,d at.
ceqa defines the term project broadly as an activity that may cause physical changes to the environment.see also guidelines,subd.a defining project as the whole of an action.the guidelines also explain,the term project refers to the activity which is being approved and which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies.the term project does not mean each separate governmental approval.guidelines,subd.c,italics added see also county of orange superior court th,d airport authority hensler d.thus,it is clear that new government action taken with respect to the same activity for which approval is sought does not convert that activity into a new project for purposes of ceqa review.see committee for a progressive gilroy state water resources control bd.d.holding water board reestablishment of discharge requirements for a wastewater treatment plant was merely a government approval of the original project and not a new project under ceqa citizens for sensible development of bishop area county of inyo d.holding agency improperly described shopping center development as two projects based on different phases of governmental approval.
a similar situation to the one before in in lincoln place,supra,th,d.in,after completion of an eir,the city of los angeles approved a project to redevelop an apartment complex in venice beach.id.at,d.the project was stalled for seven years in litigation,but in the city concluded the eir was still sufficient and certified it conditional upon certain mitigation measures.id.at,d.shortly thereafter,the developers obtained permits for the demolition of five structures without satisfying any of the conditions the city had attached to its approval.id.at,d.when these permits were challenged by writ of mandate,the city and the developers maintained that the demolition was a separate project from the redevelopment project.id.at,d.because the city had previously approved a tract map,which was an entitlement to build,the developer asserted the mitigation conditions applied only to the building project.ibid.this attempt to split the redevelopment into two projects based upon an interpretation of what the city had approved was firmly rejected on appeal,however,based on ceqa broad definition of project.ibid.under ceqa,a project is the whole of an action that has the potential to affect the environment it is defined based on the activity undertaken and not actions by governmental entities concerning its approval.see also guidelines,subds.a,c lincoln place,supra,th at,d.
based on the broad definition of project,we conclude expiration of the tentative map did not convert the moss subdivision into a new project for purposes of ceqa review.nothing significant about the activity to be undertaken on the land has changed in any way all that has changed is that the county previous approval of a map expired where the environmental impacts of a project have previously been studied,subsequent changes are meaningful only to the extent they affect the environmental impacts of a project.mani brothers,supra,th at,d.expiration of the tentative map was an abstract occurrence that had no effect on the project environmental impacts.rather,it was the expiration of a discretionary approval by a governmental agency,and the guidelines make it clear that a ceqa project is not to be defined by each of the discretionary approvals that may be required from government agencies.guidelines,subd.c.the county argument improperly conflates ceqa with the subdivision map act.these two statutory schemes,although closely related,operate independently.see topanga for a scenic community county of los angeles d.previous elimination of ceqa causes of action did not foreclose a challenge to project approval under the subdivision map act because this act provides for environmental impact review separate from and independent of the requirements of the ceqa italics added hunt county of shasta d.substantial differences between subdivision map act and ceqa undermined party argument based on analogy to a ceqa provision.
moreover,as a practical matter,the county position could have potentially absurd and wasteful consequences.if expiration of a tentative map rendered irrelevant all prior environmental review of a project,then mere inadvertence by a developer or local agency in preventing such an expiration could mean that months or years of environmental embodied in an have to be ignored and a completely new environmental analysis undertaken.surely,if the legislature intended the expiration of a tentative map to have such dramatic consequences,it would have made this intent clear in the subdivision map act or ceqa.
accordingly,the county was incorrect in determining that resubmission of the tentative map converted the moss subdivision into a new project,subject to full ceqa review.the appropriate question instead is whether supplemental environmental review is required for the project under section.we turn now to the parties arguments under this statute.
iii.substantial evidence supports supplemental review under section 
ceqa requirements and standard of review 
section states when an environmental impact report has been prepared for a project pursuant to this division,no subsequent or supplemental environmental impact report shall be required by the lead agency or by any responsible agency,unless one or more of the following events occurs a substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the environmental impact report.b substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken which will require major revisions in the environmental impact report.c new information,which was not known and could not have been known at the time the environmental impact report was certified as complete,becomes available.
section is intended to provide a balance against the burdens created by the environmental review process and to accord a reasonable measure of finality and certainty to the results achieved.bowman city of petaluma,supra,d at.the statute accordingly requires evidence of such substantial changes in the project or surrounding circumstances that major revisions of the prior eir are required.fund,supra,d at.likewise,under the third exception permitting subsequent review based on new information,a new eir is not required whenever any new,arguably significant information or data is proposed,regardless of whether the information reveals environmental bad news.citation.river valley preservation project metropolitan transit development,supra,th at,d.rather,the guidelines clarify that the new information justifying a subsequent eir must be of substantial importance and must show that the project will have significant effects not discussed in the previous eir or negative declaration,that s ignificant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than stated in the prior review,or that new mitigation measures now exist,or are now feasible,but are not being adopted by the project proponents.guidelines,subd.a laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal th,d,significant new information requiring recirculation of an eir under section must concern a substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a feasible mitigation that is not being implemented.
our standard of review for an agency decision under section is well settled.we independently review the administrative record.citation.we resolve reasonable doubts in favor of the administrative decision.citation.we do not judge the wisdom of the agency action in approving the project or pass upon the correctness of the eir environmental conclusions.citations.our function is simply to determine whether the agency followed proper procedures and whether there is substantial evidence supporting the agency determination citation.santa teresa citizen action group city of san jose th,d,fn.omitted.substantial evidence has been defined as relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion citation,or evidence of ponderable legal significance reasonable in nature,credible,and of solid value citation.bowman city of petaluma,supra,d at.in applying substantial evidence review,a court may not weigh the evidence ibid.rather,we simply determine whether the record contains substantial evidence to support the agency decision.a local regional monitor city of los angeles th,d fund,supra,d at.i f there are conflicts in the evidence,their resolution is for the agency.citations.sierra club county of sonoma,supra,th at,d see also laurel heights improvement regents of university of california,supra,cal th at,d,reasonable doubts must be resolved in favor of the administrative decision.
county findings of new information under section 
as an alternative to its resolution declaring moss submission to be a new ceqa project,the county board of supervisors issued a resolution finding that additional ceqa review of the project is required based on the existence of new information not previously available or discussed in the mitigated negative declaration.the board identified two categories of new information evidence about the project impacts on the water supply in the city of trinidad and evidence about impacts to biological resources,specifically the coho salmon and the coastal cutthroat trout.consistent with our standard of review,we must review the administrative record to determine whether substantial evidence supports the county findings that new information,not previously available,indicates t he project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the previous negative declaration,or that s ignificant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than previously understood.guidelines,subd.a see also,subd.c.
water impacts in city of trinidad 
the project original mitigated negative declaration relied in part on a water assessment evaluation conducted for luffenholtz creek in.this study showed that,even in a dry year,luffenholtz creek could supply an additional beyond the four that would be used by the moss subdivision.including from the moss project,the study projected the creek could accommodate approximately a percent increase over the current number of water users in the city of trinidad.based on this study,the county planning staff concluded the project would not cause a substantial reduction in the amount of water available for trinidad,although it would slightly reduce the surface water in luffenholtz creek.
in may and august,the city of trinidad water commissioner lin submitted two letters to the planning department asking the county to reevaluate the environmental impacts of the project.from these letters,which were considered to constitute an expert opinion,the board of supervisors determined that the study of luffenholtz creek is outdated and no longer valid.the board found that water usage in the city of trinidad had increased by percent since,thus bringing usage close to the maximum capacity the creek was expected to be able to provide.adopting lin opinion that any additional water demands would have a much more serious impact to the city water supply than they would have years earlier,the board predicted the situation will become even more dire in the next to years.
in addition to concerns about the increased quantity of water the project could draw from the creek,lin letters also worried that the project could add contaminants to the water,thus hindering trinidad ability to comply with stricter state water quality standards that became effective in.the board adopted lin opinion that any increase in contamination due to an increase in development will have a greater impact on the city ability to maintain the required water quality standards.finally,the board found that the threat of forest fires near trinidad had increased substantially in the preceding seven years and this fact,combined with the shortage of water generated by increased draws from luffenholtz creek,required the project impact on fire safety to be reexamined.
substantial evidence supports the board of supervisors finding that supplemental environmental review is required to analyze the project potential to contribute to a water shortage downstream in the city of trinidad.substantial evidence under ceqa includes fact,a reasonable assumption predicated upon fact,or expert opinion supported by fact,subd.e.the board based its decision on the trinidad water commissioner expert opinion that luffenholtz creek was already supplying water to users in trinidad at or close to the maximum capacity projected in the study.this opinion was supported by lin own charts and reports from the state department of water resources,which showed that between and trinidad increased its water production by percent from million to million gallons.thus,the data shows that,as of,the city demand for water from luffenholtz creek had increased by critical maximum capacity figure stated in the study upon which the mitigated negative declaration for the project relied.this evidence of increased water usage is new and could not have been known at the time the project was previously reviewed.although the additional water demand created by the project addition of four new parcels would likely be slight,as the county planners originally predicted,evidence that demand upon luffenholtz creek was at or near the creek maximum capacity in indicates even such a slight increase in demand from the project could have significant environmental impacts downstream.
moss attempts to impeach lin opinion by arguing that the study was an evaluation of the capacity of trinidad water treatment plant,not an analysis of how much water the creek can supply therefore,according to moss,the problem lies in trinidad treatment facilities and not the creek itself.however,the evidence submitted in support of lin opinion indisputably shows water demand increased significantly in trinidad in the several years since the project was first reviewed.the evidence thus undermined a fundamental assumption of the mitigated negative,that trinidad water demand was well below the threshold at which additional demand from the project could become a concern.moreover,if moss characterization of the study is correct,it means the ability of luffenholtz creek to supply adequate water to both the project and the city of trinidad has never actually been studied such a circumstance would equally justify the county conclusion that further study is required.
the board of supervisors made two additional findings regarding impacts of the project on water quality in luffenholtz creek and on trinidad capabilities.however,it is unclear whether the county is continuing to assert that further review of these potential impacts is required.moss challenged all of the board findings in his petition for writ of mandate.although the trial court found the record contained substantial evidence of new information about significant environmental effects,thus justifying further review under section,the court order describes only two categories of such new information the availability of water for the project,in light of the increased usage for the city of trinidad and s ignificant fisheries issues.a fair reading of the court order suggests the court found substantial evidence to support further review of these impacts only.the county did not appeal from this aspect of the trial court order,the county argue in its respondent brief that the record contains substantial evidence of new information regarding significant impacts on water quality or fire safety 
to the extent the county has not abandoned its position that supplemental environmental review is required under section,subdivision c based on new information about the project impacts on water quality and fire safety,we conclude the board of supervisors findings on these subjects are not supported by substantial evidence.the board adopted lin expert opinion that,in light of the state recent adoption of more stringent water quality standards,any increase in contamination due to an increase in development will have a greater impact on the city ability to maintain the required water quality standards.this opinion did not justify a subsequent or supplemental report under either of the first two alternatives specified in section substantial changes in the project or with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken,subds.a,b.the change in the water quality standards was new information that was not known and could not have been known when the mitigated negative declaration was prepared and thus satisfies the third criterion,subd.c.however,section of the guidelines amplifies this criterion by requiring that the new information be of substantial importance and make one of four possible showings lin opinion makes no showing of any of them.neither his opinion nor anything else in the record provides evidence that the project will in fact contribute contaminants to luffenholtz creek,much less that it will do so to any significant degree.indeed,the record does not even contain evidence about levels of contaminants currently found in trinidad water supply.lin opinion that any increase in development upstream could result in increased levels of contaminants,and make it more difficult for trinidad to meet state water quality standards,does not constitute substantial evidence because it is based on speculation,not fact,subd.e substantial evidence is not argument,speculation,unsubstantiated opinion or narrative.obviously,the addition to the water supply of even trivial amounts of a contaminant will theoretically make it more difficult for a downstream municipality to meet water quality requirements.this observation alone,however,is not new information of substantial importance showing the project will have significant or substantially more severe environmental effects than were previously understood.see guidelines,subd.a.
the board finding that the project could impair capabilities in trinidad also lacks adequate support in the record.this finding is based entirely on lin statement that the threat of forest fires in the trinidad area ha d increased substantially in the preceding seven years,and his prediction that any shortage of water created by the project additional draws upon the creek could cause an increase in the fire danger to trinidad.however,lin provided and the board considered no facts to support the claim of an increased fire hazard.although lin asserts the danger has increased,the project impact on fire safety was studied before,and the county planning staff concluded the project would have a positive effect upon fire protection services because of road improvements and other fire safety measures moss was undertaking.the only new information presented to the board in was lin observation that the threat of forest fire had apparently increased since the prior review.indeed,lin himself noted in his august letter to county planners,the issue of fire safety is not new.lin observation simply is not new information of significant or substantially more severe environmental effects sufficient to justify supplemental review.see,subd.c guidelines,subd.a.
as a practical matter,however,we realize that the issue of fire safety is closely related to the issue of the adequacy of the water supply to the city of trinidad.if the project increased draws from luffenholtz creek result in a water shortage downstream in trinidad,such a shortage could hamper the city ability to combat forest fires in the region.we have already concluded supplemental review is necessary to address the project environmental impacts on water supply to the city of trinidad.although substantial evidence does not support further review of the broad topic of fire safety,we believe the supplemental analysis of impacts on water supply should take account of and address mayor lin concerns about the availability of sufficient water for the city of trinidad to respond to fire hazards.
biological impacts 
the second category of new information the county board of supervisors cited in support of its decision to require a supplemental eir concerns the project potential impacts on two threatened fish species,the coho salmon and the coastal cutthroat trout.
coho salmon 
northern california coastal coho salmon were identified as a threatened species on the federal endangered species list in.based on analysis from the county planning staff,the board of supervisors found that luffenholtz creek is within the mapped habitat area for this group of salmon.the board concluded the new information listing coho as a threatened species and identifying luffenholtz creek as within the species critical habitat warranted further environmental review of the project impacts on this fish population.
the county points to various publications in the federal register to support these findings.the record does establish,and moss concedes,that coho salmon are now listed as a threatened species in the northern california coastal region.see.support for the board finding that luffenholtz creek is within this species critical habitat is less clear,however.the county relies on a rule published by the national marine fisheries service designating critical habitats for several species of salmon and steelhead trout.this rule identifies certain watersheds in humboldt county as the critical habitat for chinook salmon,but the only critical habitat it mentions for coho salmon is on the oregon coast.the county interpretation of this rule seems to deliberately confuse these two species of salmonids.yes,the rule designates a critical habitat for california coastal chinook salmon in the mad creek watersheds in humboldt county,and,yes,the rule states that critical habitat includes all waterways,substrate,and adjacent riparian zones below longstanding,naturally impassable barriers.however,even assuming the two creeks running through the moss property are adjacent to the mad creek watersheds a point asserted by the county but without support in the record,these facts only establish that the project may fall within a critical habitat for coastal chinook salmon.the critical habitat designated for coho salmon in this rule refers only to waterways in oregon.
evidence moss submitted below is in accord.an august,database listing of threatened species in all of humboldt county includes the southern california coho salmon,but when the region under review is narrowed to the trinidad quad,the database lists only coastal not a threatened fish species found within this critical habitat 
the county reliance on broad descriptions of the coho habitat is also inappropriate in light of evidence the county own planners discovered showing it is nearly impossible for anadromous fish,such as salmon,to enter luffenholtz creek from the ocean.in the initial study of the project completed in may,the planning department observed that at the point where luffenholtz creek reaches the pacific ocean,approximately a mile south of trinidad,two culverts have been constructed that would make anadromous fish passage very difficult if not impossible,according to a study.
the county has directed us to nothing in the administrative record establishing that luffenholtz creek is part of the critical habitat for coho salmon.instead,the county relies on federal rules regarding california coastal chinook and northern california steelhead and implies that,because the county senior planner testified about all of these species,evidence pertaining to any or all of them may be used to support the board findings the question before us on appeal,however,is whether substantial evidence supports the board of supervisors findings in resolution.the board did not make any findings about chinook salmon or steelhead in this resolution which was apparently drafted by the county therefore,evidence and arguments regarding these different species are not relevant.if the board of supervisors believed potential impacts of the project upon california coastal chinook or northern california steelhead required further study,it should have made such a finding.as it is,because the board findings are limited to coho salmon and cutthroat trout,the county reliance on evidence pertaining to different species strikes us as improper bootstrapping.
although substantial evidence does show that coho salmon are listed as a threatened species,we find no evidence in the administrative record to support the board finding that coho salmon have a habitat in or near the project waterways.when impacts on fish species were previously studied,the national marine fisheries service determined that,with the implementation of prescribed mitigation measures,the project was generally protective of listed salmonids.the only thing that has changed since the previous study,according to the evidence in the record,is that northern california coastal coho salmon have been identified as a threatened species.however,without information indicating the species may be found within or near the project,such a listing alone does not constitute substantial evidence of significant impacts justifying further environmental review under section.chaparral greens city of chula vista th,d recirculation of eir not required due to new listing of an endangered species where project impact on the species was previously studied and discussed in the eir.
coastal cutthroat trout 
in resolution,the board of supervisors also found that further environmental review of the project was necessary due to new information about significant impacts to coastal cutthroat trout.the board stated since,it has been determined that the main stem of luffenholtz creek provides habitat for coastal cutthroat trout,among other species.residents of the area contend that there are coastal cutthroat trout in the more upstream reaches of the creek that do not migrate to the sea in a truly anadromous fashion.coastal cutthroat trout are a species of special concern.
in contrast to the board findings re
