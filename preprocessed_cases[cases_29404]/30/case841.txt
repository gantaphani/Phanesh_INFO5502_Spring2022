we must decide,among other things,whether the city of colton,california,can recover response costs under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act allegedly incurred as a result of perchlorate contamination in its water supply.
the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla is a comprehensive statute that grants the president broad power to command government agencies and private parties to clean up hazardous waste sites.key tronic united states.under cercla section a,a,a private party may recover expenses associated with cleaning up contaminated sites.united states atl.research.
to establish a prima facie claim for recovery of response costs under section a,a plaintiff must demonstrate 
the site on which the hazardous substances are contained is a facility under cercla definition of that term,section,a release or threatened release of any hazardous substance from the facility has occurred,a such release or threatened release has caused the plaintiff to incur response costs that were necessary and consistent with the national contingency plan,a and a b and the defendant is within one of four classes of persons subject to the liability provisions of section a.

the city of colton colton draws its water supply from the groundwater basin basin in san bernardino county,california.in,colton began monitoring its municipal supply wells for perchlorate contamination.by,colton had detected perchlorate in three of its wells in concentrations ranging from about to micrograms per liter μg l.at the time,the california department of health services cdhs,which regulates water quality,had an advisory action level for perchlorate of μ.cdhs informed colton that because the perchlorate action level is an advisory action level,and thus,not enforceable,the three impacted wells may continue to be used to supply the system.nevertheless,in a meeting between its city council and city attorney,colton adopted a policy of prohibiting the use of water with perchlorate levels above μg pursuant to this policy,colton took the impacted wells out of service and instituted a wellhead treatment program to eliminate the perchlorate in.
in,colton filed suit against numerous entities that had engaged in industrial activities in the basin over the years,alleging that they caused the release of perchlorate into the groundwater.in its third amended complaint,filed in december,colton alleged that it had spent million to investigate the contamination and to implement the wellhead treatment program.colton asserted claims for cost recovery and contribution under cercla,a,f a claim for declaratory relief as to liability for future costs under the declaratory judgment act,and various claims under state law.
numerous defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that colton could not recover its wellhead treatment program costs under cercla in its opposition,colton argued that the defendants were liable for not only its wellhead treatment program costs,but also costs associated with a future cleanup estimated to cost between and million.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on colton federal claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over colton state law claims the district court held that colton could not recover its costs associated with the wellhead treatment program because it failed to show that such costs were necessary and consistent with the ncp furthermore,because colton could not show that it was entitled to recover any of its past costs,its claim for declaratory relief as to its future costs necessarily failed.colton timely appealed 
colton first seeks reversal of the district court summary judgment denying recovery of its past response costs.colton challenges the district court conclusion that the wellhead treatment program was unnecessary because there was no immediate threat to the public health or environment.see a b.colton concedes,however,that it failed to comply with the national contingency plan in its past response action.because colton concession is a sufficient ground upon which to affirm the summary judgment with respect to past response costs,we decline to review the merits of the district court conclusion that such costs were unnecessary.see dorsey enquirer,cir 
colton also contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment denying its claim for declaratory relief as to its future response costs.
before addressing the merits of the claim,we turn to the parties various jurisdictional arguments.
the parties dispute whether colton claim for declaratory relief is ripe.the constitutional ripeness of a declaratory judgment action depends upon whether the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.in re coleman,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in wickland oil terminals asarco,cir,we held that a claim for declaratory relief as to cercla liability is ripe when the essential fact establishing the plaintiff right to declaratory alleged disposal of hazardous substances has already occurred.id.at.later,in in re dant russell,cir,we held that a claim for cost recovery and declaratory relief under cercla becomes ripe only after plaintiffs spend some money responding to an environmental hazard.id.at.finally,in boeing cascade,cir,we held that a claim for declaratory relief for contribution under cercla section is ripe when t he pollution has been carefully studied,the parties litigated a genuine controversy about millions of dollars they had already spent,and the facts bringing about their relative responsibility have already occurred.id.at.
none of these cases imposed any requirement that a party incur,necessary and costs before its claim for declaratory relief is ripe.indeed,our cases make clear that so long as there has been a release of hazardous substances,and the plaintiff spends some money responding to it,a claim for declaratory relief is ripe for review.accord cal.ex rel.cal.dep t of toxic substances control neville chem,cir explaining in dicta that a s soon as the plaintiff expended its first dollar,it could have sued the defendant for this dollar and sought a declaratory judgment of defendant liability for future response costs.
here,the facts establishing colton right to declaratory relief have already occurred because there is no dispute that there is perchlorate contamination of the basin.moreover,there is no dispute that colton has incurred costs in responding to the contamination,and that colton will incur additional costs in the future.the only dispute is whether colton is entitled to recover these costs,which goes to the merits,not justiciability.because this controversy can not be deemed remote and hypothetical,wickland oil,at,we conclude that colton claim for declaratory relief is ripe.
we next turn to the argument that colton has mooted this appeal by filing a substantially new action in the same district court a case is moot on appeal if no live controversy remains at the time the court of appeals hears the case.nasd dispute resolution,judicial council of state of,cir.the test for mootness is whether the appellate court can give the appellant any effective relief in the event that it decides the matter on the merits in his favor.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the defendants argue that colton has effectively redressed the injury it seeks to remedy with this,the district court dismissal of its declaratory relief filing a new action seeking the same relief.therefore,our reinstatement of such claim would be superfluous.however,t here is a recognized defense to a claim of mootness in the appellate context when a party can demonstrate that a lower court decision,if allowed to stand,may have collateral consequences adverse to its interests.connectu llc zuckerberg,cir.here,colton faces a potential statute of limitations bar with respect to its claims against certain defendants,an argument these defendants have pressed in the action.a reversal by this court could put colton on better footing with regard to limitations defenses,which is a collateral consequence of the type that suffices to defuse a claim of mootness.id.at.we therefore conclude that this appeal is not moot.
finally,we consider whether the district court disposal of colton cercla past response claims deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction over the declaratory relief claim 
it is well settled that the declaratory judgment act does not itself confer federal subject matter jurisdiction but merely provides an additional remedy in cases where jurisdiction is otherwise established.staacke sec y of labor,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.any assertion of a federal claim suffices to establish federal question jurisdiction,even if that claim is later dismissed on the merits.cement masons health welfare trust fund for cal.stone,cir.
here,colton declaratory relief claim is predicated on cercla,a federal statute providing a private right of action.colton nonfrivolous assertion of a cercla declaratory relief claim is therefore sufficient to confer federal subject matter jurisdiction,regardless of the district court conclusion that colton cercla past response claims lacked merit.
turning to the merits,we note that the district court held that because it was granting summary judgment on the section claims,defendants are entitled to summary judgment in their favor on plaintiff claim for declaratory relief as well.colton argues that its failure to incur recoverable response costs in the past has no bearing on whether it will incur such costs in the future therefore,colton contends that it should still be allowed to seek declaratory relief as to liability for its future costs.
whether a cercla plaintiff failure to establish liability for its past costs necessarily dooms its bid to obtain a declaratory judgment as to liability for its future costs appears to be an issue of first impression in this circuit.our sister circuits have taken divergent approaches to this issue.some have held or suggested that recoverable past costs are a sine qua non for declaratory relief under cercla.see,trimble asarco,cir,overruled on other grounds by exxon mobil allapattah,gussack realty xerox,cir per curiam united states occidental chem,cir.others have held or suggested that declaratory relief may be available even in the absence of recoverable past costs.see,united states davis,cir county line inv.tinney,f d,cir per curiam.
the text of the declaratory judgment act provides,in relevant part,that i n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction,any court of the united states,upon the filing of an appropriate pleading,may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,whether or not further relief is or could be sought.a.cercla also contains a provision for declaratory relief.section g provides that in any initial action under section,the court shall enter a declaratory judgment on liability for response costs or damages that will be binding on any subsequent action or actions to recover further response costs or damages.g.
although colton complaint referred to the declaratory judgment act rather than cercla section g,the latter provision clearly governs this initial action.because a precisely drawn,detailed statute more general remedies,hinck united states,internal quotation marks omitted,we must consider whether colton was entitled to declaratory relief under cercla more detailed declaratory relief provision.see shapiro sons,rutland waste metal,d,declining to permit an indirect approach to declaratory relief under the declaratory judgment act when the direct approach is unavailable.
the declaratory judgment mandated by section g pertains to liability for response costs.g.such liability for response costs must refer to the response costs sought in the initial action,given that the sentence later refers to any subsequent action or actions to recover further response costs.id.emphases added.therefore,if a plaintiff successfully establishes liability for the response costs sought in the initial action,it is entitled to a declaratory judgment on present liability that will be binding on future actions.
here,colton has failed to establish present liability because of its conceded failure to comply with the ncp but seeks a declaratory judgment on future liability.section g,however,does not provide for such relief.i t is an elemental canon of statutory construction that where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies,a court must be chary of reading others into it.transam.mortgage advisors,lewis.in section g,congress specified a mechanism whereby a declaration of liability for costs already incurred has preclusive effect in future proceedings as to costs yet to be incurred.if congress had intended for a declaration of future liability to be available,it could have provided that the court shall enter a declaratory judgment on liability for further response costs.that it did not leads us to conclude that declaratory relief is available only if liability for past costs has been established under section.
colton would have us bypass the initial liability determination to further cercla goal of encouraging private parties to clean up hazardous sites.according to colton,denying declaratory relief would discourage private parties from taking future actions to clean up hazardous sites if they failed to comply with the ncp in taking past cleanup actions.cercla goal,however,is not simply to encourage private response,but rather to make the party seeking response costs choose a course of action to protect public health and the environment and to achieve a cleanup.carson harbor ii,at internal quotation marks omitted.providing declaratory relief based on mere assurances of future compliance with the ncp would create little incentive for parties to ensure that their initial cleanup efforts are on the right track.see dant russell,at noting that premature relief under cercla can create perverse incentives.
moreover,awarding declaratory relief before a plaintiff has incurred any recoverable costs would undermine the very purpose of declaratory relief,which is to economize on judicial time.pmc,cir.a court would have to make complicated determinations as to which defendants are responsible for what proportion of the release,without any assurance that the plaintiff would ever meet its burden of proving in an adversary proceeding that its expenses were necessary and incurred in a manner consistent with the national contingency plan.stanton road assocs.lohrey,cir.
we conclude that cercla purposes would be better served by encouraging a plaintiff to come to court only after demonstrating its commitment to comply with the ncp and undertake a cleanup.upon establishing liability under section,the plaintiff can obtain reimbursement for its initial outlays,as well as a declaration that the responsible party will have continuing liability for the cost of finishing the job.dant russell,at.such a declaration would allow the plaintiff to avoid costly and relitigation of liability once it has already been established.see kelley dupont de nemours,cir congress included language in section g to insure that a res
