we must decide whether the city of seattle seattle or the city can enforce specific provisions of two contracts it has with the olympic pipe line company olympic to provide safety oversight of a hazardous liquid pipeline within seattle city boundaries,despite the apparent federal preemption of hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulation by the pipeline safety improvement act of,et.psa.
after a section of olympic hazardous liquid pipeline exploded in bellingham,washington,killing three people and causing extensive environmental damage,seattle declined to renew olympic franchise for the section of pipeline within the city limits until olympic complied with the city list of pipeline safety demands if olympic failed to comply,the city said it would shut down the operation of olympic pipeline within seattle city limits.declining to comply with seattle demands,olympic filed suit for injunctive and declaratory relief,asserting that,even though the franchise agreement between seattle and olympic arguably included safety oversight provisions,seattle attempt to impose safety regulations pursuant to those provisions was preempted by the psa.the district court granted olympic motion for a preliminary injunction,halting seattle effort to shut down olympic pipeline.the district court then granted summary judgment in favor of olympic,determining that seattle regulatory efforts were preempted by the psa.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
the olympic pipe line company operates a pipeline system spanning parts of washington and oregon.olympic main pipeline is a conduit beginning about fifteen miles from the border,at a refinery near ferndale,washington,and running southward to its terminus in portland,oregon.lateral delivery lines carry petroleum products from the main pipeline to bulk terminals at seattle,international airport,tacoma,olympia,and vancouver,washington,as well as linnton and portland,oregon.the lateral pipeline at the center of this dispute is olympic seattle lateral line seattle lateral,which branches from olympic main pipeline in renton,washington,travels through the cities of renton,federal way,and seattle,and ends at the commercial shipping terminals on harbor island seven miles of the long seattle lateral are located in the city of seattle this section of the seattle lateral runs by elementary schools and a residential neighborhood,underneath interstate,and next to electricity transmission lines.
seattle originally granted olympic a franchise to operate its pipeline within seattle city limits in.the seattle city council adopted the most recent franchise agreement between the parties,effective january,as seattle city ordinance franchise agreement the franchise agreement permitted olympic to maintain and operate its pipeline under and along certain seattle public streets and for a term,with the possibility for two additional renewals.seattle conditioned olympic franchise on the execution of an indemnity agreement,ensuring the city that olympic pipeline would not result in the city incurring any liability,environmental or otherwise,as a result of olympic pipe line pipeline or operations pursuant to the permit.
on june,a section of olympic main pipeline exploded near whatcom creek in bellingham,washington,spilling approximately gallons of unleaded gasoline,killing three people,and causing millions of dollars of property and ecological damage.the accident caused olympic to shut down the northern half of its pipeline until february to spend millions of dollars to remediate the environmental damage caused by the accident and to repair,inspect,and upgrade its pipeline.relevant to seattle demands,after the rupture olympic entered into several agreements with the city of bellingham,which included giving some safety oversight powers to bellingham and agreeing to perform a hydrostatic test of the pipeline.olympic also conducted hydrostatic tests on three sections of its pipeline located in the cities of bellingham,woodinville,and renton.during each hydrostatic test,a portion of the tested pipeline failed along a longitudinal seam.
seattle did not automatically renew olympic franchise for the seattle lateral upon its december,expiration.instead,seattle first sought information from olympic and the applicable regulating state and federal agencies regarding pipeline safety.the city then hired a consultant,secor international,secor,to investigate possible pipeline integrity issues.secor investigation culminated in seattle requesting that olympic respond to safety concerns before the city would determine whether it would agree to a new franchise agreement.among the listed items,seattle requested that olympic complete a hydrostatic test of the seattle lateral.olympic refused to perform the test.
seattle responded with two letters,one from the director of transportation and one from the mayor.the transportation director letter notified olympic that seattle was suspending all pipeline operations no later than sixty days from the letter date until the parties agreed upon a new franchise agreement,and that olympic failure to comply would subject the company to criminal sanctions.the mayor letter notified olympic that,because of olympic bankruptcy and the refusal of olympic corporate parent to provide a corporate guarantee,seattle would not grant a new franchise agreement until a solvent olympic or its successor company emerged from bankruptcy.the mayor letter also stated that as of august,he would suspend olympic operation of the seattle lateral however,he would rescind that order if olympic could prove the pipeline was safe by performing a hydrostatic test of the pipeline and two inspection digs within sixty days,or before seattle schools returned to session.mayor nickels asked for a response indicating olympic intentions by july,
instead of responding,on july,olympic filed this action against seattle for injunctive relief restraining the city from ordering olympic to shut down the seattle lateral and a declaratory judgment that the psa preempts seattle attempts to control,regulate,or otherwise interfere with matters relating to the safety,design,construction,testing,or operation of olympic pipeline the termination or denial of olympic franchise would be a violation of the commerce clause and the franchise fees sought by seattle were arbitrary and unreasonable.see olympic pipe line city of seattle,d.on august,the district court granted olympic motion for a preliminary injunction,enjoining seattle from closing down the seattle lateral id.
the parties then both moved for summary judgment.the district court granted olympic motion in part,declaring that the psa preempted the city attempts to regulate the safety and inspection of the seattle lateral.id.at.contrary to seattle claims,the district court held that olympic did not waive its ability to claim federal preemption.id.at.the court also concluded that the city actions were preempted because,in attempting to enforce the safety provisions of its contract,seattle was acting in its regulatory rather than proprietary capacity.id.at.finally,the court noted that its determination did not preclude seattle from taking other actions possibly affecting olympic continued operation of the pipeline id.at.the court enjoined seattle from ordering olympic to undertake particular inspections or implement particular safety measures on the seattle lateral.seattle timely appealed 
on appeal,seattle argues that its attempt at safety regulation is not preempted by the psa because the psa does not fill the field of pipeline safety regulation.seattle also asserts that,even if the psa does preempt the city actions,olympic waived its right to raise preemption as a defense when the company entered into the franchise agreement and the indemnity agreement.finally,the city contends that public policy requires that the agreements be enforced.
we turn first to the question of federal preemption whether the psa preempts a municipality attempt to impose safety standards on a hazardous liquid pipeline 
the supremacy clause of article vi of the united states constitution grants congress the power to preempt state or local law.const.art.vi,agg,at.under the doctrine of preemption,a federal law can displace state law through express preemption,field preemption,or conflict preemption see,schneidewind anr pipeline,d cal.fed.sav.loan ass guerra,d.to determine whether the psa preempts seattle action,we begin with the statutory text.see schneidewind,at.
the purpose of the psa is to provide adequate protection against risks to life and property posed by pipeline transportation and pipeline facilities by improving the regulatory and enforcement authority of the secretary of transportation.a.federal legislation seeks to provide a national hazardous liquid pipeline safety program with nationally uniform minimal standards and with enforcement administered through a partnership.pt,app.
the psa differentiates between the regulation of interstate and intrastate hazardous liquid pipelines for interstate pipelines,state and local authorities generally may not adopt or continue in force safety standards for interstate pipeline facilities or interstate pipeline transportation.c provision entitled preemption.there are two exceptions to this prohibition.first,a state authority may enter into a pipeline safety agreement with the dot,through which the dot authorizes the state authority to participate in the oversight of interstate pipeline facilities.id.a.second,the dot may designate an agent with delegated authority to conduct inspections of pipeline operators and facilities to ensure compliance with federal safety standards on behalf of the dot.id.c.thus,a state authority may not impose safety requirements on an interstate hazardous liquid pipeline unless the dot has delegated authority to the state entity under a or c.federal preemption of the regulation of interstate pipeline safety in any other manner is manifest in the language of the psa provision entitled preemption.see id.c 
regarding intrastate pipelines,the psa provides 
a state authority that has submitted a current certification under section a of this title may adopt additional or more stringent safety standards for intrastate pipeline facilities and intrastate pipeline transportation only if those standards are compatible with the minimum standards prescribed under this chapter.
id.c.thus,a state authority may regulate intrastate pipelines and impose safety requirements in addition to the federal standards only if the state authority applies and is approved by the dot through an annual certification process pursuant to and the standards are compatible with the federal standards.id.c.alternatively,a state authority may receive authorization from the dot to regulate an intrastate pipeline under a pipeline safety agreement pursuant to a or through the designation of an agent under c.
the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc is the regulating state authority for pipelines in the state of washington.after the bellingham accident,the washington state legislature passed its own pipeline safety act,in an effort to protect the health and safety of washington citizens and the state environment.the act placed the state hazardous liquid pipeline safety authority and responsibility with the wutc and required the commission to apply for federal delegation for the state program to enforce the federal hazardous liquid pipeline safety requirements.
the wutc entered into an agreement with the dot,the interstate pipeline transportation agreement agreement,which delegated to the wutc the authority,under c,to participate in the interstate pipeline safety program,with the office of pipeline safety ops,to ensure compliance with the federal safety standards.the agreement also provided wutc with jurisdiction,pursuant to the certification provision of a,over all intrastate operators subject to the psa.through this statutory delegation and certification,the agreement granted the wutc the authority to address and oversee a wide variety of pipeline issues,including incident investigation,safety monitoring,inspections,and reporting,as the dot agent 
seattle contends that the provisions of the franchise agreement and the indemnity agreement that impose safety standards on olympic are not preempted by the psa we disagree.assuming arguendo that municipalities can seek agreements under a and a as they relate to hazardous liquid pipelines seattle did not seek any such agreement.further,the city has not been delegated authority by dot to conduct inspections of pipeline operators and facilities pursuant to c.rather,the dot delegated this authority to the wutc through the agreement we conclude,therefore,that the psa expressly preempts the city attempt to impose safety regulations on the seattle lateral 
our precedent supports this result.in shell oil city of santa monica,cir,we held that the hlpsa did not preempt santa monica from imposing safety standards in a franchise agreement with shell oil predecessor to operate an oil pipeline within city limits.id.at.we first noted that the hlpsa expressly preempts states from imposing any additional safety standards on inter state pipelines.id.at.the hlpsa,however,expressly permitted additional state regulation of intrastate pipelines by a ny state agency.id.at relying on the text of former d any state agency may adopt additional or more stringent safety standards for intrastate pipeline facilities and the transportation of hazardous liquids associated with such facilities,if such standards are compatible with the federal standards issued under this chapter.emphasis omitted.for purposes of summary judgment,we assumed that the pipeline at issue was an intrastate pipeline.id.at.we then determined that the hlpsa did not expressly preempt the city imposition of safety standards because the term state agency could include a municipality like santa monica.id.at if congress had intended to limit the term state agency to state agencies that are certified under a,one would have expected it to have done so expressly.
when the hlpsa was recodified as part of the psa in,congress changed the term a ny state agency to a state authority that has submitted a current certification under section a of this title.c see also.ii section d of the hlpsa is further amended by inserting that has submitted a current certification under section a after any state agency.congress now has declared its intent to limit any state agency to certified agencies.see shell oil,at.thus,our conclusion that the psa preempts seattle attempt to impose safety measures on olympic operation of the seattle lateral is consistent with and supported by our precedent in shell oil 
although the psa expressly preempts seattle attempted safety regulation of the seattle lateral,the city may still contractually require that olympic perform safety tests of the pipeline if,in entering into the franchise agreement,the city acted as a municipal proprietor rather than as a regulator.constr.trades council associated builders contractors,d associated contractors of am.metro.water,cir see also shell oil,at.to determine whether a government entity is acting in a proprietary or a regulatory capacity,we consider whether the challenged action essentially reflect s the entity own interest in its efficient procurement of needed goods and services,as measured by comparison with the typical behavior of private parties in similar circumstances and whether the narrow scope of the challenged action defeat s an inference that its primary goal was to encourage a general policy rather than address a specific proprietary problem.aeroground,city county of san francisco,d,quoting cardinal towing auto repair,city of bedford,cir.
the district court correctly concluded that,in requiring olympic to comply with certain safety demands,seattle was acting as a regulator rather than as a municipal proprietor.olympic pipe line,d at.the city interest is not that of a private market participant that owns a pipeline or competes in the pipeline market or a related market.rather,seattle in its sovereign capacity owns the streets and land under which the seattle lateral runs,for the purpose of maintaining a transportation system.see shell oil,at holding that the city of santa monica is not a market participant in the setting of franchise fees for purposes of the dormant commerce clause because the city holds the streets,under which the pipeline runs,in its sovereign capacity.also,seattle made the safety demands on olympic in an effort to prevent a pipeline accident in seattle similar to the bellingham accident the city thus acted pursuant to its general duty to protect the public health and duty grounded in the city regulatory,police than in an attempt to protect its role in the real estate market finally,in its letters to olympic requiring compliance with the city safety demands,seattle repeatedly invoked its police and regulatory powers for example,in a june,letter to olympic president,seattle transportation director stated the city hereby exercises its police and regulatory powers and orders olympic to cease all operation of the seattle lateral line under the earliest possible timeline further,in a june,letter from seattle mayor to olympic president,the mayor noted i do not consider olympic response acceptable to the public safety needs of seattle residents.because seattle was acting as a regulator when it imposed safety standards on olympic,the city actions do not fall within the market proprietor exception and are preempted by the psa.
seattle advances two reasons why,even if the psa preempts the city attempt to regulate the safety and inspection of the seattle lateral,we should still require olympic to comply with the city safety regulations.first,the city contends that olympic waived the right to argue that the safety regulations are preempted when it entered into the franchise agreement and the indemnity agreement.second,seattle asserts that if we do not require olympic to comply with the city safety regulations,olympic and other companies will continue to enter into contracts they know to be unenforceable.we address each argument in turn.
seattle argues that at the time olympic entered into the franchise agreement and the indemnity agreement,the company believed that the seattle lateral was an interstate pipeline,and therefore knew that the psa preempted seattle efforts to impose safety regulations on the pipeline in spite of this understanding,olympic chose to enter into the agreements,which include the city safety regulations.seattle contends that,by entering into these agreements,olympic knowingly and voluntarily consented to the city regulations and waived its right to argue that the regulations are preempted by the psa.
we reject seattle assertion that olympic waived its right to advance a preemption argument.federal preemption is the allocation of power and authority between the federal government and the state and local governments,based on the supremacy clause of the constitution.see gibbons ogden,wheat.stating that federal supremacy demands that state laws that interfere with,or are contrary to the laws of congress must yield.preemption is a power of the federal government,not an individual right of a third party that the party can waive.olympic could not,therefore,waive a right that it did not possess.
the cases on which seattle relies are not to the contrary.the city cites cases in which parties to contracts have waived individual constitutional rights or statutory rights.see,overmyer frick,d holding that a debtor waiver of his individual due process rights through the execution of a cognovit note was effective hotel employees,rest.employees union marriott,cir holding that an employer could waive its right to demand a national labor relations board election erie,city of erie,cir holding that a party waiver of first amendment,equal protection,and statutory rights by contract was valid legal aid soc y city of new york,d,holding that the legal aid society contractual waiver of its right to challenge the city action,a right provided for by the national labor relations act,was valid.no such right is at issue in this case.federal preemption is not an individual constitutional right,such as an individual right to due process,and the psa does not provide olympic with a statutory right to challenge seattle safety regulations.we therefore reject seattle argument that olympic waived its right to assert preemption.
seattle also argues that,by determining that the city pipeline safety demands are unenforceable,we will encourage olympic and other pipeline companies to agree in future contracts to safety provisions that the companies do not intend to honor.to discourage such behavior,the city asserts that we must require olympic to comply with seattle safety regulations for the seattle lateral.
we disagree.it is not our function to establish public policy in this area.rather,congress has selected the applicable public policy.it has chosen,through the express preemption provision of the psa,clearly to preclude seattle from imposing safety regulations on olympic.
moreover,it is not apparent that the city public policy solution is the best one overall.although a sound public policy might normally discourage companies from entering into contracts that they do not intend to honor,that policy concern is more than balanced by the superordinate federal need to maintain the psa policy of providing national uniformity in the establishment and enforcement of hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations.as the court in williams pipe line city of mounds view stated 
hazardous liquid pipelines run through states,and presumably through small and large plots of land belonging to vast numbers of persons.were each of these landowners entitled to demand compliance with their own safety standards,the clear congressional goal of a national standard for hazardous liquid pipeline safety would be thwarted.
at.accordingly,we do not find the city public policy argument to be persuasive.
these demands included the completion of a hydrostatic test.a hydrostatic test involves purging all natural gas or petroleum out of the pipeline,cleaning the inside of the pipeline,filling it with water and then pressurizing the pipeline to a pressure higher than the normal operating pressure.see office of pipeline safety,pipeline fact sheet,at http last visited.
the harbor island terminus is a distribution point for petroleum transportation,like tanker trucks and barges.about eighty percent of the product shipped in the seattle lateral is gasoline,but the pipeline also carries jet fuel for use at boeing field and high sulfur fuel for use by the washington state ferries.the majority of the petroleum product shipped through the seattle lateral is petroleum refined in the state of washington,but the pipeline also carries petroleum products refined in other states.
as a consequence of this sensitive geography,the section of the seattle lateral inside seattle has been designated a high consequence area under the applicable federal regulations.see,pt,app.
although the effective date of the ordinance was january,the seattle city council passed the ordinance on september,and the seattle mayor approved it on september.
on march,olympic filed a chapter bankruptcy proceeding,in re olympic pipe line,in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of washington.on april,seattle filed a motion for relief from the automatic bankruptcy stay,arguing that relief was appropriate under the for cause provision of d.the cause alleged was olympic purported failure to provide the city proof of adequate insurance coverage.the bankruptcy judge denied seattle motion,holding that seattle was a governmental unit for purposes of b,and its use of police power with regard to the seattle lateral was not automatically stayed by olympic bankruptcy filing.
olympic is owned by arco midcon and shell pipeline company lp.
on july,the office of pipeline safety ops of the department of transportation dot notified seattle that its position was that a hydrostatic test of the seattle lateral was not necessary to ensure the safe operation of the pipeline and that the pipeline met federal regulatory standards.
the city of federal way was also named as a defendant but was later dismissed without prejudice.
the court also granted olympic motion to remove the automatic reference of the matter
