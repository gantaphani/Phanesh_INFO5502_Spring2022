we must decide whether the endangered species act requires the united states fish and wildlife service to complete formal designation of critical habitat for an endangered fish species listed over years ago.
the united states fish and wildlife service service listed the unarmored threespine stickleback stickleback,a small,scaleless freshwater fish,as an endangered species in under the endangered species act esa.the stickleback is found chiefly in parts of santa barbara,los angeles,and san diego counties in southern california.the stickleback prefers to make its nest where there is ample vegetation and a gentle flow of water,avoiding areas with either too much or no water flow.in fact,the rate of water flow is a key factor in preferred stickleback habitat.
in,the service proposed a rule designating three stream zones of the santa clara river watershed as critical habitat for the stickleback but never completed the designation.
in,the bureau of land management blm awarded cemex,a contract to mine million tons of sand and gravel from a location in los angeles county soledad canyon.although the mining would not take place within the stickleback habitat,the project involves pumping water from the santa clara river and could cause portions of the river to run dry periodically.parts of the santa clara river commonly dry out during the summer season,trapping stickleback in isolated pools,which eventually dry completely.uncontrolled pumping during particularly dry periods could exacerbate the problem,significantly impacting the stickleback.because of the project potential impact,the blm initiated formal consultation with the service under the esa,submitting its final biological assessment for the project in june.
the service reviewed the project likely impact on the stickleback and cemex proposals to mitigate those impacts.ultimately,the service issued its january biological opinion,which concluded that the project was not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the stickleback.the biological opinion included an incidental take statement its which if followed,would exempt the service and cemex from the prohibition on takings found in section of the esa.wildlife fed marine fisheries,cir citing b and aluminum of america adm r,bonneville power,cir.the service was unable to predict how many stickleback might be taken by the project,particularly in light of the difficulty in isolating the cause of any particular stickleback death.
the service biological opinion requires cemex to take specific reasonable and prudent measures in order to minimize incidental take of stickleback.the measures include continuous monitoring of water levels in the santa clara river and the cessation of pumping from the river if the habitat requirements of the stickleback are not being met.the blm formal consultation process with the service ended with the issuance of the biological opinion 
the center for biological diversity cbd,an organization dedicated to the protection and restoration of natural ecosystems and imperiled species,filed suit in,claiming that the service violated the esa by failing to complete the designation of critical habitat for the stickleback.cbd subsequently amended its complaint to claim that the service violated the esa and its own regulations by issuing the its to cemex.following such amendment,the district court granted cemex motion to intervene as a defendant based on its interest in the mining project.
on september,the service published its finding that critical habitat should not be designated for the stickleback.designation of critical habitat for the unarmored threespine stickleback,critical habitat finding or finding.coincidentally,cbd moved for summary judgment on the same day.after the service also moved for summary judgment,cbd amended its complaint a second time,challenging the finding as arbitrary and capricious.
following for summary judgment in december and january,the district court granted summary judgment to the service and cemex.the court declared cbd original claim moot.the court rejected cbd other claims,concluding that the decision not to designate critical habitat was within the service discretion and that the service did not violate the esa by issuing an its to cemex.the district court also granted motions to strike several cbd exhibits that were not part of the administrative record.
cbd timely appealed 
cbd challenges the service finding on three grounds.first,cbd argues that the service exceeded its statutory authority because the esa requires designations of critical habitat to be made to the maximum extent prudent and determinable.second,cbd claims that the finding was arbitrary and capricious because the service did not articulate a rational connection between the facts and its decision.third,cbd insists that the finding is invalid because the service did not provide a notice and comment period.we consider each argument in turn.
to begin,cbd on its interpretation of the the service has a mandatory duty to complete the proposed designation of critical habitat for the stickleback.
the esa subsection governing designations of critical habitat states 
the service by regulation promulgated in accordance with subsection b of this section and to the maximum extent prudent and determinable 
a shall,concurrently with making a determination under paragraph that a species is an endangered species or a threatened species,designate any habitat of such species which is then considered to be critical habitat and 
b may,from thereafter as appropriate,revise such designation.
a a.under this provision,designations of critical habitat must be made at the time a species is listed as endangered,but this requirement was added to the esa in.indeed,the amendments to the esa specified that 
a ny regulation proposed after,or pending on,the date of the enactment of this act to designate critical habitat for a species that was determined before such date of enactment to be endangered or threatened shall be subject to the procedures for regulations proposing revisions to critical habitat instead of those for regulations proposing the designation of critical habitat.
esa amendments of,b,stat.emphasis added.
pursuant to the amendments,critical habitat designations for the as an endangered species in are governed by the procedures for critical habitat revisions.while the service shall designate critical habitat,it may revise critical habitat designations from as appropriate.a a.when may and shall are both used in a statute,the normal inference is that each is being used in its ordinary one being permissive,the other mandatory.haynes united states,cir.it follows that critical habitat designations are mandatory,but revisions are discretionary.
cbd concedes as much but argues that once a proposal is made the service has a mandatory duty to complete the designation to the maximum extent prudent and determinable.put another way,cbd contends that once the service proposes a designation of critical habitat,that designation must be completed unless not prudent or determinable.the service published a proposed rule for designation of critical habitat for the stickleback in.proposed designation of critical habitat for the endangered unarmored threespine stickleback proposed critical habitat designation.under cbd theory,the service has a mandatory duty to complete this proposed designation we are not persuaded.
the amendments state that pending proposals for designation of critical habitat are governed by the statutory provision on critical habitat revisions.esa amendments of b.as such,the service has discretion in choosing a course of action with respect to such proposals,just as it does in deciding whether or not to propose a designation.
we can not accept the contention that to the maximum extent prudent and determinable should be read as the controlling language of a a and that it mandates completion of the critical habitat proposal.such contention fails to account for congress use of shall for designations and may for revisions.if cbd interpretation is accepted,the statute use of the discretionary may for revisions is rendered superfluous because the service would be required to complete proposals pending at the time of the amendments to the maximum extent prudent and determinable.if this were truly congress intent,it would not have explicitly stated that pending proposals would be controlled by the provision on critical habitat revisions.significantly,cbd does not explain why,under its logic,all critical habitat revisions would not be mandatory to the maximum extent prudent and determinable,rendering meaningless the statute separate treatment of revisions and designations.we decline to interpret the statute in this manner,and thus,we reject cbd proposed interpretation see boise cascade epa,cir.
we also reject the argument that a mandatory duty to complete the critical habitat designation arose when the service failed to make a final determination on the proposal by october,year after enactment of the amendments.we previously held that the esa time requirements are meant to spur agency action rather than to prohibit it once the specified time lapses.see idaho farm bureau fed babbitt,cir.agency delay alone does not transform a discretionary duty into a mandatory duty,especially where congress provided a specific remedy for such a citizen suit to compel a decision.see id.
for these reasons,we conclude that the proposed designation of critical habitat for an endangered species listed prior to the amendments does not create a mandatory duty to make the designation.
cbd next argues that the service finding was arbitrary and capricious.
before reaching the argument merits,we must first address cemex claim that cbd lacks standing under the apa to challenge the finding because designation of critical habitat for the stickleback is discretionary.the review provisions of the apa do not apply when agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.a.we must therefore decide whether the service had a mandatory duty to issue its finding.
once a critical habitat revision proposal is published,the service has one year in which to publish one of four actions in the federal register.b a i.the service shall publish 
i a final regulation to implement the revision,
ii a finding that the revision should not be made,
iii notice that the period is being extended,or 
iv notice that the proposed revision is being withdrawn together with the finding on which the withdrawal is based.
id.although the service has some discretion in selecting one of these options,it must choose one of the four.
discretion means choice on whether or not to act,not required choice among several options.because the service had a mandatory duty to select one of the four actions in the statute based on its proposed designation of critical habitat for the stickleback,the action is not one committed to agency discretion by law.the apa review provision therefore applies,and cbd indeed has standing under the statute to challenge the service finding as arbitrary and capricious.
an agency decision is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,or offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency.pac.coast fed of fishermen ass ns,marine fisheries,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also rybachek epa,cir our function is to determine whether the agency has considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.internal quotation marks omitted.cbd argues that the service failed to articulate a rational connection between the fact that critical habitat is a high priority for the stickleback and its finding that the proposed designation should not be made.see rybachek,at.
we evaluate the service finding based on its stated rationale.see.cattle,at the basis for the decision must come from the agency.in its finding,the service examined the four available options and determined that it could not justify taking three of the four actions.critical habitat finding.at.
first,the service stated that it could not justify publishing a final regulation designating the area as critical habitat under b a i i because the proposal no longer satisfied the esa requirement that such designations be made on the basis of the best scientific data available after considering the economic impact of the designation.id.citing b.the existence of considerable new information would have required the service to reassess the proposed designation because both the scientific evidence and the economic impact analysis were seriously outdated.id.
second,the service stated that it could not defer its decision under subsection i iii to redo the economic analysis and update its scientific information.doing so would have forced the service to divert resources from its mandatory duties under the esa,including a backlog of designations of critical habitat for approximately mandated by court order and court approved settlement agreements.id.these mandatory designations were,by definition,a higher priority than the discretionary designation of critical habitat for the stickleback id.
third,the service similarly stated that it could not justify withdrawing the proposed designation because a notice of withdrawal must be accompanied by a finding that there is not sufficient evidence to justify the action proposed.see b a i iv,b ii.such a finding could not be made based on stale information,but gathering the required information would have compromised the service ability to address its backlog of mandatory duties.critical habitat finding.at.
having rejected the other three possible actions,the service concluded that the proposed designation of critical habitat for the stickleback should not be made.id.at.it did so after reviewing the existing protections for the stickleback that would be unaffected by the decision.id.
nevertheless,cbd claims that the critical habitat finding frustrates the policy mandate of the esa.however,the service stated that the finding would not alter the protection the stickleback and its habitat will continue to receive under the esa.id.at.indeed,the finding has no effect on an agency duty to consult with the service to ensure that its actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the stickleback.a.nor does it eliminate the esa prohibition on take of stickleback.a it is unlawful for any person to take any endangered species.in any event,in order to accept cbd contention,we would be forced to question congress decision to allow the service discretion regarding designation of critical habitat for species listed as endangered prior to.this,we can not do.therefore,we must conclude that the service finding is not at with the esa protection of the stickleback as an endangered species.
cbd next argues that the service may refuse to designate critical habitat only if the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such area.b.but subsection b only establishes a basis for determinations,requiring the service to base designations of critical habitat on the best scientific evidence available and after consideration of any resulting economic impact.further,it establishes a standard for excluding areas from mandatory designation only when the benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of inclusion.id.because we have already determined that designation of critical habitat for the stickleback is discretionary,b simply does not apply in this case 
based on our review,it is clear that the service considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.see rybachek,at.the service finding was not arbitrary or capricious.
finally,cbd argues that we should set aside the finding because the service did not provide an adequate opportunity for public comment.under the apa,agency actions must be set aside if taken without observance of procedure required by law.a.
with respect to critical habitat revisions,the esa specifically requires notice and comment in only two circumstances when the period for taking action is being extended and when a proposed revision is being withdrawn.b a i iii,iv.the statute does not expressly require notice for the remaining two available actions in b a i,including a finding that a revision should not be made.indeed,b a i ii directs the service to issue a final regulation to implement a finding that a revision or,as here,a designation,will not be made.we therefore infer that congress did not intend to require notice when the service takes one of these two actions see boudette barnette,cir noting that the expressio unius est exclusio alterius canon creates a presumption that when a statute designates certain manners of operation,all omissions should be understood as exclusions.
we are satisfied that congress did not intend to impose a notice requirement on agency actions taken under b a i i ii.we therefore decline to set aside the critical habitat finding on such ground.
based on the plain language of the esa and its amendments,we are convinced that congress conferred discretion on the fish and wildlife service to choose whether to designate critical habitat for endangered species listed before,including the stickleback.although the service was required to act on the proposed designation,we are satisfied that the service finding was a proper exercise of its discretion.in any event,neither the apa nor the esa require a notice and comment period that would force us to set the finding aside.the district court therefore acted properly in granting defendants motions for summary judgment.
we next consider cbd challenge to the incidental take statement its contained in the biological opinion that the service issued to cemex for the soledad canyon project.cbd claims that the service must ensure that agency action will not violate any federal or state law before it issues an its.before reaching the merits,we address cemex renewed claim that cbd lacks standing and the service contention that cbd claim is not ripe.
cbd does not ground its right to bring this claim on the esa private action provisions instead it relies on the apa,which provides a right to judicial review of all final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.this right applies universally except where a statute specifically precludes judicial review or agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.a.the esa does not expressly preclude review,and cbd alleges that the service has a mandatory duty to ensure that agency actions comply with all applicable laws before issuing an its.we are satisfied that cbd has standing to bring its claim under the apa.
the service contends that cbd claim is not ripe for review because cemex has not completed all of the permit requirements for the proposed project.to resolve a ripeness claim,we must consider whether delayed review would cause hardship to the plaintiffs whether judicial intervention would inappropriately interfere with further administrative action and whether the courts would benefit from further factual development of the issues presented.ohio forestry ass n,sierra club,d citizens for better forestry,at quoting ohio forestry.we analyze the present case with these three considerations in mind.
first,the service issuance of an its will cause hardship to cbd because it creates a legal right the its directly authorizes the incidental taking of stickleback.see ohio forestry,at.the service action is a definitive statement of the agency position,has a direct and immediate effect on the complaining parties,and has the status of law.ass of am.med.colls.united states,cir.
second,immediate judicial review of cbd claim will not interfere with further administrative action.see ohio forestry,at.the service policy on the soledad canyon project is fixed and will not be reconsidered because the consultation process is complete once the biological opinion is issued 
third and finally,further factual development will not assist us in resolving the legal question at issue.see id.at.the voluminous administrative record in the case covers virtually every conceivable angle of the project,and we may safely base our decision on it.
we can not agree with the service contention that we should follow the third circuit direction in new hanover township united states corps of engineers,cir.new hanover held a controversy unripe because future permitting was required,stressing pragmatic considerations where an order to begin the permitting process under the clean water act would be pointless if a required state permit were denied.id.at.significantly,the clean water act specifically contemplates dual permit requirements at the state and federal levels.see id.at.
pragmatic concerns bear far less consideration in this case.if cbd prevails,the service will be forced to withdraw its biological opinion until the mining project compliance with all applicable state and federal laws is ensured.unlike new hanover,the very existence of additional legal requirements is at the heart of cbd claim.cbd claims that no its should issue until the service addresses those other legal requirements.once cemex is in compliance with these laws,the service could reissue the biological opinion containing the its.additionally,the esa and its the clean water not explicitly involve compliance with other state and federal laws when issuing a biological opinion.for these reasons,we are not persuaded that new hanover is applicable 
instead,we are convinced that cbd challenge is ripe for review,and we turn to the merits of the claim.
cbd argues that no its can be issued unless the service ensures compliance with all federal and state laws although the district court based summary judgment on preemption grounds,we may affirm on any grounds supported by the record.mustang,chevron prods,cir.
under the esa,the service must issue an its to a federal agency as part of its biological opinion after confirming that the agency actions,including any incidental takings,will not jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered species.b.the recipient agency is immunized for incidental takings of endangered species as long as the agency complies with the reasonable and prudent measures specified by the service for minimizing the action impact on the endangered species.b i ii.
service regulations define incidental take as takings that result from,but are not the purpose of,carrying out an otherwise lawful activity.otherwise lawful activities are defined as those actions that meet all state and federal legal requirements except for the prohibition against taking.interagency species act of,as amended final rule,june.on the basis of these regulatory definitions,cbd argues that the service can not issue an its unless it first determines that an agency action will comply with all state and federal legal requirements.specifically,cbd claims that the service may not issue an its for the soledad canyon mining project because california law independently protects the stickleback,prohibiting any take of the species,incidental or not.cal.fish game code west known as the california fully protected fish statute.cbd insists that any take of stickleback will violate california law,and thus,the soledad canyon project can not be considered an otherwise lawful activity.cbd lone citation to support this contention is to a case which does nothing more than repeat verbatim the regulatory definition of incidental taking.see graham red squirrel,at.
according to the esa,once the service is satisfied that an agency action will not threaten an endangered species continued existence,it must issue the its.b the service shall provide a written statement.if the recipient agency complies with all the terms and conditions of the biological opinion,the its immunizes it from the prohibition against take of endangered species any taking that is in compliance with the terms and conditions specified in this statement shall not be considered to be a prohibited taking of the species concerned.o.
the esa says nothing about issuing a biological opinion or its only after ensuring a planned action compliance with all state and federal laws.indeed,an its does not immunize its holder for violations of any other law,be it state or federal.congress knows
