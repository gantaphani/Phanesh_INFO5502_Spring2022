robert friedland filed this contribution action pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla f,f,against the industrial company tic and geosyntec consultants geosyntec.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the based on its determination that friedland has already recouped all of his recoverable costs from other entities and therefore has no damages to recover in this case.friedland appeals.we have jurisdiction under and affirm.
background 
friedland is a former director and president of summitville consolidated mining company,scmci.from about to,scmci operated a large gold mine facility in the summitville mining district near del norte,colorado the summitville mine.tic helped construct the summitville mine.geosyntec provided quality assurance regarding the mine heap leaching system,a process in which a cyanide solution is sprayed on ore to precipitate the gold.
in december,scmci declared bankruptcy and abandoned the mine.that same month,the united states environmental protection agency epa took over management of the summitville mine and instituted response actions to address actual or threatened releases of contaminated water from the mine into the environment.in,after an investigation of numerous potentially responsible parties prps,the united states and the state of colorado sued friedland under cercla,to recover their response costs.as part of that lawsuit the action,friedland filed a contribution complaint under cercla,against twelve separate prps,including an entity called industrial constructors icc.he did not name tic or geosyntec in that complaint.in december,friedland settled the claims brought against him by the united states and colorado for.friedland spent approximately million on legal fees in the action.
prior to that settlement,friedland initiated at least two lawsuits relevant to this appeal.in,he sued icc and united states fidelity guaranty company usf g in montana state court.icc had performed work on the summitville mine from and was contractually bound to indemnify scmci against losses caused by icc,and to reimburse scmci for settlements it had to pay as a result of those losses.usf g had issued insurance policies covering friedland and icc for the contractual liabilities undertaken by icc.in his complaint,friedland contended that icc was obligated to pay all of his costs of defense,investigation,and legal liabilities,including all sums spent in settlement,in connection with the action.he further claimed that usf g was obligated under the insurance policies it had issued to provide a defense and indemnification for the claims raised in the action.
approximately nine months after friedland,the united states,and colorado reached the settlement agreement in the action,friedland and icc entered into a confidential settlement agreement as to friedland cercla contribution claim and to the claims he raised in the montana state proceeding.icc agreed to pay a certain sum to friedland and further agreed because icc had filed for bankruptcy to assign him the rights to all insurance claims icc might have against usf with all claims against icc resolved,friedland amended his montana state complaint to name only usf g as a defendant.usf g subsequently settled that suit for a specific dollar amount in december 
in the second lawsuit relevant to this appeal,in june friedland sued the travelers indemnity company travelers in colorado state court for a declaration that travelers is fully obligated to pay the costs of investigation,defense,and liability that friedland has incurred in connection with the legal actions brought against him claiming or asserting property damage and other alleged injuries at the summitville mine site.friedland alleged that he was a named insured under a travelers liability policy covering sums he was legally obligated to pay because of property damage,as well as costs he incurred to defend himself.friedland and travelers settled the suit in october.
friedland initiated this cercla contribution action against tic and geosyntec in june.in response to an interrogatory during discovery,friedland stated that he sought contribution for the he agreed to pay to settle the action brought against him by the united states and colorado.he also stated that he had already recovered more than that amount from other sources,including the usf g and travelers settlements.as a result of this disclosure,the defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that because friedland had already recovered from others amounts exceeding the payment he made to the united states and colorado,he has no damages and no right to contribution under cercla f as a matter of law.friedland advanced two theories in response.he contended that the collateral source rule prohibits crediting the defendants in the amount of the settlement money he received from usf g and travelers.alternatively,he urged the district court to allocate the settlement money to his million defense costs,rather than the settlement amount.in this way,friedland argued that he still has recoverable damages.the district court rejected both arguments and granted the motion.friedland maintains the same two positions on appeal.
ii.discussion 
a.the collateral source rule 
derived from the common law,the collateral source rule posits that p ayments made to or benefits conferred on the injured party from other sources are not credited against the tortfeasor liability,although they cover all or a part of the harm for which the tortfeasor is liable.restatement second of torts cmt.d.the rule thus permits an injured plaintiff to recover more than the damages he has suffered as the result of an injury 
the common law did not require setoffs against damage awards.rather,plaintiffs were allowed to recover the full damages awarded against defendants even though the plaintiffs also received compensation from collateral sources.this principle of double recovery,known as the collateral source rule,provided that compensation or indemnity received by an injured party from a collateral source,wholly independent of the wrongdoer and to which he has not contributed,will not diminish the damages otherwise recoverable from the wrongdoer subject to limited exceptions,courts would not reduce a judgment because the plaintiff had received compensation from a collateral source even if the result was that the plaintiff recovered twice for a single loss.
the purpose of the collateral source rule was to prevent the defendant from receiving credit for such compensation and thereby reduce the amount payable as damages to the injured party.to the extent that either party received a windfall,it was considered more just that the benefit be realized by the plaintiff in the form of double recovery rather than by the tortfeasor in the form of reduced liability.
van waters rogers,keelan,quotations and citations omitted.see also green denver rio grande,cir the rationale for the rule is that public policy favors giving the plaintiff a double recovery rather than allowing a wrongdoer to enjoy reduced liability simply because the plaintiff received compensation from an independent source.thus,courts have applied the rule when the injured plaintiff has been compensated by,for example,social security disability payments or unemployment compensation,see,or by the plaintiff insurance.see miera dairyland ins,cir.
turning to the case before us,it is far from clear that this tort principle applies to claims brought pursuant to cercla,a comprehensive federal statute that addresses liability for environmental cleanup costs.indeed,the section of cercla that governs contribution actions clarifies that s uch claims for contribution shall be governed by federal law.cercla f,f.but even assuming that cercla generally contemplates application of the collateral source rule,it is clearly inapplicable in the specific context of a f contribution action by a prp such as friedland.cercla provides for two types of actions to recoup environmental cleanup costs actions under a,a,and contribution actions under f,f.young united states,cir.in a contribution action,a person who has settled a claim with the government as friedland has may seek contributions from other prps.sun,cir cercla f,f.we have explained that a claim for contribution is a claim by and between jointly and severally liable parties for an appropriate division of the payment one of them has been compelled to make sun,at quotations omitted.thus,a cercla contribution action is not a personal injury action by an innocent plaintiff.instead,it is a claim between two or more culpable tortfeasors,and the policy underlying the collateral source provide the innocent party with the benefit of any simply not advanced in such cases.
at least one other federal court has reached the same conclusion on materially indistinguishable facts.in basic management united states,d,the plaintiffs filed a cercla contribution claim after they agreed to pay million in cleanup costs to the state of nevada.the plaintiffs insurance policies,however,covered nearly all of those costs,leaving the plaintiffs with only a relatively small amount of expenses.id.at.nonetheless,the plaintiffs argued that the collateral source rule precluded the defendants from offsetting their cercla liability in the amount of the insurance proceeds.id.at.the court disagreed.distinguishing tort cases in which the collateral source rule applies,the court explained that cercla contribution actions are not injury actions in which the injured party is seeking compensation for damages to be made whole again.id.at.the court went on 
in other words,plaintiffs have not been damaged and are not entitled to money as a damaged party but rather,plaintiffs can only receive reimbursement for the costs they expended beyond their share of actual responsibility for the environmental damage.there is an actual dollar amount associated with those costs,and in this case,almost all of those costs have been paid directly by plaintiffs insurers,and without further right of subrogation in the insurers.in other words,no party or potential party here has incurred a cost as a prp for which they could seek contribution from another prp.allowing plaintiffs to recover those costs again from defendants would in essence allow plaintiffs to profit from their own and prior contamination of the site simply because they are in the subsequent chain of title.the purpose of the contribution element of cercla was to reallocate the remedial cost to those who were ultimately responsible for the pollution,not to provide a windfall recovery for parties who happen to be in the chain of title.
id.at.thus,the court refused to apply the collateral source rule.id.at 
moreover,permitting a cercla plaintiff to recoup more than the response costs he paid out of pocket flies in the face of cercla mandate to apportion those costs equitably among liable parties.see cercla f,f in resolving contribution claims,the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.every federal court that has addressed the issue has reached the same conclusion,either with or without reference to the collateral source rule.see.reade,cir because the settlement credits from other prps to the plaintiff present a significant allocation factor under f the district court should have exercised its discretion to consider them when calculating the amount of the judgment.boeing cascade,cir o ne equitable factor is preventing someone from recovering for the same harm twice.basic mgmt,d at refusing to apply the collateral source rule because e quity and common sense dictate that plaintiffs can not recover the remediation costs paid for by their insurance policies.vine,llc keeling,d,refusing to apply the collateral source rule,reasoning that because the court has a broad duty to consider facts bearing on the proper equitable allocation of response costs,the monies the plaintiff has already recovered are relevant.united states davis,d,there is nothing equitable about the kind of an allocation that permits the plaintiff to recover a portion of the costs for which it already has been or will be compensated.raytheon aircraft united states,wl,at,following,boeing,davis,and vine street and refusing to apply the collateral source rule 
the two primary cases friedland cites in support of his argument do not undermine this conclusion.in louisiana department of transportation kansas city southern railway,so d,the louisiana department of transportation and development dotd cleaned up a site that had been polluted by kansas city southern railway.the federal government reimbursed the dotd for approximately of the remediation costs it incurred cleaning the site.id.at.thereafter,dotd sued kansas city southern railway under the louisiana environmental quality act leqa to recover the entire cleanup cost.id.emphasizing the policy behind the collateral source rule,id.at,the louisiana supreme court held that the rule permitted dotd to seek the entire cleanup cost from kansas city southern railway rather than only the it had not recouped from the federal government we hold that the collateral source rule applies in cases arising under the leqa,at least where a damaged party is seeking reimbursement only for remediation expenses.id.at emphasis added.
similarly,in town of east troy soo line railroad,cir,the town of east troy cleaned up ground water that had been polluted by soo line railroad company.the town paid for the cleanup costs with federal grant money.id.at.thereafter,the town sued soo line under a wisconsin nuisance statute to recover the full amount of the town cleanup costs.id.the seventh circuit affirmed the district court conclusion that under wisconsin law,the collateral source rule permitted the town to seek the entire amount of the cleanup.id.at.
louisiana department of transportation and town of east troy are distinguishable in at least two significant respects.first,the plaintiffs in those cases were innocent parties,not prps seeking contribution from other prps.indeed,the court in louisiana department of transportation specifically limited its holding to cases in which the plaintiff is the injured party seeking reimbursement for remediation costs.second,the causes of action in both cases arose under state law,not cercla.as we explained,cercla contribution actions are governed by federal law and permit the district court to consider equitable factors in allocating response costs.those factors include a prior payment to the contribution plaintiff.thus,we disagree with friedland that these cases have any bearing on the issue before us and hold that the district court did not err in refusing to apply the collateral source rule in this cercla contribution action.
common damages and settlement allocation 
relying on hess oil virgin islands uop,cir and united states burlington northern railroad,cir,friedland argues that the district court erred in reducing his damages by the full amount of the usf g and travelers settlements because those settlements do not represent damages in common with the ones at issue in this case.we disagree.
in hess oil,hess oil sued uop and other defendants after a fire caused several million dollars in damage to one of hess oil refineries.at.defendants other than uop settled with hess oil for million.id.at.after a jury verdict against uop,the district court credited it with the million settlement and required it to pay only the remaining balance on hess oil damages.id.at.we rejected hess oil argument on appeal that uop was not entitled to a credit.id.at.we reasoned that under the one satisfaction rule,when the conduct of multiple defendants results in a single injury with common damages,and one of the defendants settles with the plaintiff,the amount of the settlement is credited against the amount that may be recovered from the defendants.id.at.we found a single injury and common damages in that case because the settlement agreement referred to all damages and all causes of action it did not expressly apportion damages to specific claims.id.
we reinforced this proposition in burlington northern.the united states sued a wood treatment facility,bic,to recover cleanup costs on a tract of land.burlington northern
