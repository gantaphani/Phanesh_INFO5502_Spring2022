the mountains recreation and conservation authority 
in november,the conservancy entered into an agreement with the conejo recreation and park district,joined soon afterward by the rancho simi recreation and park district,to create the mountains recreation and conservation authority the conservation authority under the joint exercise of powers act,government code section et.the agreement express purpose was to establish as a local agency a legal entity separate from the parties to acquire,develop,and conserve additional park and open space lands an additional stated purpose was to provide for financing,maintenance,servicing,and operations of capital acquisitions and improvements.
the conservation authority governing board has four members,including a representative from the conservancy and from each of the two member districts,and one member.the agreement designates the executive director of the conservancy to serve as the conservation authority executive director,and the conservancy staff counsel to act as the conservation authority acting counsel,until otherwise determined by the conservation authority governing board.under the joint powers agreement,the conservation authority is to carry out those purposes,furthering the work of public and private environmental agencies,by providing the expertise of the conservation authority and its officers and employees to organizations that have compatible purposes to those of the conservation authority.
the conservancy grant of proposition funds to the conservation authority 
in february,the conservancy passed resolution,approving a grant to the conservation authority pursuant to its statutory mandate to a ward grants to state agencies,cities,counties,resource conservation districts,and park and recreation districts for the purpose of acquiring sites identified as necessary for park,recreation,or conservation purposes and for development of essential related public facilities.pub.resources code,subd.c.on august,the conservancy approved resolution,amending the earlier grant in various respects and expanding it to.and on november,the conservancy approved resolution,further amending and modifying the grant pursuant to its statutory authority to protect coastal watersheds,including acquisition,protection,and restoration of land and water resources and associated planning,permitting,and administrative costs,and for the acquisition and development of facilities to promote public access to and participation in the conservation of land,water,and wildlife resources pub.resources code,subd.a.

standard of review 
the single issue raised by the appeal is whether the conservancy grant of funds to the conservation authority exceeded the conservancy authority under the law the appellants do not challenge the trial court factual determinations they accept the respondents statement of the facts,so far as it goes,as undisputed.we independently review the trial court application of statutory provisions to the undisputed facts.international longshoremen warehousemen union los angeles export terminal,th.
discussion 
the appellants challenge to the conservancy funding grant is narrow.they argue that the conservancy lacks authority to make a funding grant to the conservation authority,a joint powers agency of which it is a member.they contend that such a grant is equivalent to a grant of funds to itself,which the conservancy lacks the authority to make.
but appellants do not challenge the conservancy power to join with the park and recreation districts in a joint powers agreement to create the conservation authority they confirm that under government code section,the conservation authority is an entity separate and independent from its members and they expressly concede that the conservancy would be authorized to make appropriate grants to the park and recreation districts that are the other members of the conservation authority.although appellants contest the conservancy power and authority to fund the conservation authority project,they point to no specific statutory language,legislative intent,or relevant case law that supports that position.
it is of course true,as the appellants argue,that the provisions of the conservancy act do not provide the conservancy with carte blanche to expend its funds in any manner without regard to the statutory limits of its powers.but the conservancy act does require that the appellants must bear the burden of proof to affirmatively demonstrate that the terms of the challenged grant exceed the conservancy authority,in order to overcome the rebuttable presumption that the conservancy acts are not in conflict with the enabling statute.fox san francisco residential rent.bd.d,see,party has burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to claim being asserted.that is a burden the appellants have failed to carry.appellants opening brief does not identify any way in which the challenged grant to the conservation authority exceeds the conservancy powers,other than that the legislature has not expressly conferred on the conservancy the power to grant funds to it 
the appellants challenge rests on the following logic a joint powers entity lacks authority to exercise powers beyond those that are shared in common by all of its members no law specifically authorizes the conservancy to grant funds to itself or to receive a grant of funds from itself the conservancy therefore lacks authority to grant those funds to the conservation authority.underlying that logic are at least two assumptions that the conservancy status as a member of the conservation authority means that its grant of funds to the conservation authority is equivalent to a grant of funds to itself and that because the conservancy lacks authority to grant funds to itself,it lacks authority to grant funds to the conservation authority,a joint powers agency of which it is a member.
we conclude that the assumptions that underlie appellants logic are unfounded,and the appellants conclusion is unsupported.
the joint exercise of powers act,et provides a means by which governmental agencies may join together to accomplish goals that they could not accomplish alone,or that they might more efficiently and more effectively accomplish together.under that act,when authorized by their governing bodies to do so,two or more public agencies by agreement may jointly exercise any power common to the contracting parties,and they may join in the creation of a separate entity to exercise those powers on their behalf,airport authority hensler th.the common powers rule that the powers that may be exercised by a joint powers agency can be no greater than the powers shared by each of the agency constituent from this provision.
the test for compliance with the common powers rule is whether each of the agency members had the power to perform the contested each had the power to do unilaterally what was actually done.beckwith stanislaus county d.the issue raised by the appellants challenge under the common powers rule therefore is whether the conservancy has the power to grant funds to the conservation authority,a joint powers agency of which it is a member.
we answer this question in the affirmative.the appellants have not identified any legal impediment to the conservancy power to grant funds for the purposes it sought to have the conservation authority accomplish,or any law that precludes the conservancy delegation of these projects,along with the funding to implement them,to the conservation authority.
the conservancy is not prohibited by law from sharing in a grant of proposition funds.
appellants have offered no authority that would support a determination that the conservancy lacked authority to make the challenged funding even to receive a grant of funds designated for those same purposes a corollary to the appellants parallel argument,discussed below,that a grant of funds to the conservation authority is equivalent to a grant of funds to the conservancy.
the conservancy is empowered by law to acquire and develop properties and facilities in order to promote public access and public participation in the conservation of land,water and wildlife resources,including funding projects to undertake corrective measures for the enhancement of the region natural and scenic character.pub.resources code,subd.e.it is empowered to acquire funds from any source pub.resources code,subd.a to contract with public or private agencies for required professional services pub.resources code,subd.b and to d o any and all things necessary to carry out the purposes of the conservancy act pub.resources code,subd.c.and it is empowered to grant funds to other local and state agencies in order to enhance the natural and scenic character of its resources and to advance its legislative mandates.pub.resources code,subds.a,c,e,subd.a.
the conservation authority is a local agency whose charter specifically contemplates that it will contract with,and receive funding grants from,the conservancy,public agency created under joint exercise of powers act,other than a federal or state department or agency,is local agency mckee los angeles interagency metropolitan police apprehension crime task force th,agency created as separate entity under joint exercise of powers act constitutes local public agency.as far as the record shows,the programs that are funded by the conservancy funding grant to the conservation authority are within the conservancy powers to advance,are within the conservancy power to grant funds to implement,and are within the conservancy powers to coordinate with local agencies including the conservation authority to undertake.
this conclusion mirrors the appellants own concessions on appeal.they do not contend that the purposes for which the funds were granted are beyond the conservancy powers to advance.according to appellants the question is not whether the conservancy has the power to make grants to or receive grants from other agencies the question
