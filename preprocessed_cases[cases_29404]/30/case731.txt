background 
the antiquities act authorizes the president of the united states to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks,historic and prehistoric structures,and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the government of the united states to be national monuments.in accordance with this authority,president clinton issued a proclamation establishing the upper missouri river breaks national monument in.see proclamation.
the proclamation explains that 
the upper missouri river breaks national monument contains a spectacular array of biological,geological,and historical objects of interest.from fort benton upstream into the charles russell national wildlife refuge,the monument spans miles of the upper missouri river,the adjacent breaks country,and portions of arrow creek,antelope creek,and the judith river.the area has remained largely unchanged in the nearly years since meriwether lewis and william clark traveled through it on their epic journey.in,the congress designated the missouri river segment and corridor in this area a national wild and scenic river public law,stat.the monument also encompasses segments of the lewis and clark national historic trail,the nez perce national historic trail,and the cow creek island area of critical environmental concern.
id.at.the proclamation declares that the monument,which comprises approximately acres of federal land,boasts the most viable elk herd in montana one of the premier big horn sheep herds in the continental united states essential winter range for sage grouse habitat for prairie dogs one of the few remaining fully functioning cottonwood gallery forest ecosystems on the northern plains large concentrations of antelope and mule deer spawning habitat for the endangered pallid sturgeon perching and nesting habitats for hawks,falcons and eagles habitat for great blue heron,pelican and a wide variety of waterfowl habitat for fish species archeological and historical sites,from teepee rings and remnants of historic trails to abandoned homesteads and lookout sites used by meriwether lewis and remnants of a rich native american and pioneer history scattered throughout the monument.see id.at.
the president established the monument for the express purpose of protecting the aforementioned objects.see id.at.to achieve that protection,the president directed the secretary of interior to develop a transportation plan limiting roads and prohibiting travel 
the secretary of the interior shall prepare a transportation plan that addresses the actions,including road closures or travel restrictions,necessary to protect the objects identified in this proclamation.
for the purpose of protecting the objects identified above,the secretary shall prohibit all motorized and mechanized vehicle use off road,except for emergency or authorized administrative purposes.
consistent with those mandates,blm began working on a resource management plan rmp,including a transportation plan,for the monument in.as part of the process,and to comply with nepa,blm prepared draft and final environmental impact statements feis.in,blm adopted the rmp.the rmp continues to authorize roads,airstrips and motorboats in the monument,but at reduced levels.the rmp closes miles of roads and ways yearround,closes another miles seasonally and leaves miles open prohibits vehicle use closes four airstrips,closes one seasonally and leaves five open and restricts motorized watercraft use to particular days of the week in wild and scenic segments and seasonally in the wild segment of the upper missouri national wild and scenic river.
the plaintiffs filed two lawsuits challenging the rmp,one brought by the montana wilderness association mwa and a second brought by the wilderness society,friends of the missouri breaks monument,the national trust for historic preservation and the oil and gas accountability project collectively,tws.the plaintiffs asserted violations of flpma,nepa and the nhpa.the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants and denied summary judgment to the plaintiffs.the plaintiffs timely appealed.

we have jurisdiction under.we review de novo the district court grant or denial of summary judgment.see te moak tribe of shoshone of dep t of interior,cir.the plaintiffs claims under flpma,nepa and the nhpa are reviewed under the administrative procedure act apa.see id.under the apa,an agency decision will be set aside only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.we will sustain blm interpretation of the proclamation so long as it is reasonable.kester campbell,cir in light of an agency presumed expertise in interpreting executive orders charged to its administration,we review such agency interpretations with great deference all that is required is that the interpretation adopted by the agency be reasonable.
discussion 
flpmaa.wilderness study 
flpma provides that the secretary of interior shall review those roadless areas of five thousand acres or more and roadless islands of the public lands,identified during the inventory required by section a of this title as having wilderness characteristics described in the wilderness act of september,stat.et and shall from time to time report to the president his recommendation as to the suitability or nonsuitability of each such area or island for preservation as wilderness.a.during the period of review of such areas and until congress has determined otherwise,the secretary shall continue to manage such lands according to his authority under this act and other applicable law in a manner so as not to impair the suitability of such areas for preservation as wilderness id.c.thus,as relevant here,flpma imposes two requirements on wilderness study areas wsas first,they must be roadless second,they must be managed so as not to impair their suitability for preservation as wilderness until congress either designates them as wilderness or releases them for other purposes.mwa contends that the monument rmp violates each of these mandates.
roadlessness 
flpma does not define the term roadless,but the house report on the legislation provides a definition that the parties agree is authoritative.under this definition,t he word roadless refers to the absence of roads which have been improved and maintained by mechanical means to insure relatively regular and continuous use.a way maintained solely by the passage of vehicles does not constitute a road,at,reprinted in,emphasis added.here,the rmp designates miles of ways within the monument six wsas as open.mwa argues that these are really roads,rather than ways,and that the rmp therefore violates flpma requirement that wsas be roadless.
mwa is correct that,on its face,the rmp appears to assign all routes within the monument,including ways within wsas,to maintenance level.mwa is also correct that maintenance level entails maintenance by mechanical means,installation and maintenance of drainage structures or use of suitable materials such as rock or gravel to control runoff,sedimentation and rutting grading as necessary to correct drainage problems and erosion brushing or tree removal to allow administrative access and sinkhole repair to address safety hazards.we presume that these types of maintenance would convert ways into roads,violating flpma requirement that wsas be roadless 
elsewhere,however,the rmp indicates that these types of maintenance do not apply to routes located within wsas.the rmp states that the monument wsas will continue to be managed under the blm interim management policy for lands under wilderness review imp.the imp,in turn,recognizes that wsas are roadless areas,that roadlessness refers to the absence of routes that have been improved and maintained by mechanical means,that roadlessness must be maintained throughout the wilderness study period and that ways within wsas are to be maintained solely by the passage of vehicles.thus,although one section of the rmp appears to assign routes within wsas to level maintenance,the section of the rmp devoted specifically to wsas directs that these routes will be maintained as before,solely by the passage of vehicles.
the government argues,and we agree,that the rmp specific directive that vehicle ways will be maintained under the standard of the imp trumps the general rule that will be subject to level maintenance.answering br.of federal defendants appellees,at because the government reading of the rmp is reasonable,we conclude that the rmp does not authorize ways in wsas to be maintained by mechanical means.we therefore reject mwa argument that the rmp violates flpma requirement that wsas remain roadless.
nonimpairment 
as noted,wsas must be managed so as not to impair the ir suitability for preservation as wilderness.c.blm has implemented this nonimpairment mandate through the imp the imp prohibits uses,facilities or activities in wsas unless they are temporary and do not create surface disturbance or involve the permanent placement of facilities.surface disturbance is any new disruption of the soil or vegetation requiring reclamation,recontouring of the topography,replacement of topsoil,restoration of native plant cover.in applying these standards,preservation of wilderness values including roadlessness,naturalness,solitude and opportunities for primitive and unconfined recreation is the paramount and overriding consideration.
consistent with these general standards,the imp defines a way as a trace maintained solely by the passage of vehicles which has not been improved maintained by mechanical means to ensure relatively regular and continuous use,and provides that ways may be used and maintained as before,as long as this does not cause new impacts that would impair the area wilderness suitability.
the imp also imposes procedural requirements on blm.it states that blm will review all proposals for uses facilities within wsas to determine whether the proposal meets the nonimpairment criteria uses facilities found to be nonimpairing may be permitted on lands under wilderness review.uses facilities found to be impairing will be denied.
in developing the rmp here,blm began by conducting an inventory of the monument,including the wsas,to map existing roads and ways.this inventory identified miles of preexisting vehicle ways within the monument six wsas.blm then adopted the rmp,closing some roads and ways and designating others as open.within the wsas,the rmp closes miles of vehicle ways and designates miles as open miles seasonally and miles.
mwa argues that blm decision to designate these ways as open violates the nonimpairment mandate 
blm decision to designate system roads in the wsas results in new surface disturbance and changes that will degrade the areas wilderness values pending a final decision from congress.if the miles of ways were left alone and remained ways,they would not be open for motorized use in the monument,they would not be included on the road system map,and no improvements or maintenance would be allowed.they would remain largely unnoticeable on the landscape and left to revegetate naturally.but now that the miles of ways are system roads,they are open to motorized use,depicted on monument maps,and subjected to blm minimum road maintenance requirements.
montana wilderness association opening br.record citations omitted in mwa view,the new roads will be subjected to increased use,now that they are depicted on the monument transportation map and open to the public for motorized travel.id.at.
mwa is correct that increased use has the potential to degrade wilderness values,and thus to violate the nonimpairment mandate.the feis recognizes that increased vehicular travel on roads could increase disturbances to soils resulting in increased soil compaction,rutting,surface runoff and subsequent erosion.we also accept,in principle,mwa contention that designating ways as open and depicting them on blm maps can fundamentally transform them from and to heavily trafficked thoroughfares.and we accept the proposition that,when such a transformation takes place,it may well degrade wilderness values,not only by producing new surface disturbances on and adjacent to the routes themselves,but also by interfering with wildlife,naturalness,solitude and opportunities for primitive and unconfined recreation.
in this case,however,the record does not support mwa assertions that blm actions will fundamentally transform these ways by significantly increasing use.the record therefore does not support the conclusion that the rmp will degrade wilderness values and violate the nonimpairment mandate.we reach this conclusion because the government has presented evidence,included in the record,that these ways were designated as open and mapped before the monument rmp.prior to the monument rmp,the lands within the monument were covered by two other resource management plans,the judith valley phillips rmp and the west hiline rmp.like the rmp at issue here,each of these earlier rmps designated ways as open and depicted them on blm maps.the west hiline rmp,for example,states that t ravel in wsas would be limited to existing roads and vehicular ways and that blm would publish maps showing designated areas and applicable restrictions.it required blm to i nventory roads,trails,and ways in wsas and to publish a map of road restrictions for each area.
in the absence of evidence in the record that the rmp designation and mapping of these ways is fundamentally different from existing designation and mapping,we can not say that blm actions degrade wilderness values.we therefore reject mwa argument that the rmp violates flpma nonimpairment mandate.that being said,we recognize the possibility that a variety of factors mapping,increased visitorship,more concentrated use brought about by the closure of more than half of the ways in wsas could increase use and degrade wilderness values under the imp,blm is under an ongoing obligation to monitor this use and its impact on wilderness values and to take corrective action if the evolving use of existing ways cause s new impacts that would impair the area wilderness suitability.as the rmp recognizes,t he road system could be modified if vehicle use traffic patterns or resource conditions change.
off road travel 
the proclamation prohibits all motorized and mechanized vehicle use off road,except for emergency or authorized administrative purposes.at.mwa and tws contend that the rmp violates this mandate by authorizing travel on vehicle ways that do not meet any reasonable definition of road.mwa also argues that the rmp violates the mandate by authorizing travel within feet of roads except in wsas for parking and camping.we address these arguments in turn 
definition of road 
for purposes of the travel ban,the rmp defines roads to include not only constructed and improved routes but also routes ways created and maintained solely by the passage of vehicles.it provides 
motorized travel is not considered off road on blm land when 
the motorized vehicle travels on constructed roads that are maintained by the blm.constructed roads are often characterized with cut and fill slopes.
motorized vehicle use takes place on clearly evident,routes with regular travel and continuous passage of motorized vehicles over a period of years.a is where perennial vegetation is devoid or scarce,or where wheel tracks are continuous depressions in the soil yet evident to the casual observer and are vegetated.
emphasis added.
the plaintiffs argue that this definition of road is unreasonable because it departs from two national definitions of road that existed at the time president clinton issued the proclamation in flpma roadless definition and the blm engineering manual.
the plaintiffs are correct that the rmp definition of road is a departure from these other definitions.for purposes of wilderness designation,flpma limits roads to routes that have been improved and maintained by mechanical means ways,maintained solely by the passage of vehicles,are excluded from flpma definition of road,as explained earlier,at,reprinted in.similarly,the engineering manual defines a road as a route maintained for regular and continuous use and a way as a route that receives no maintenance to guarantee regular and continuous use.the definition of road adopted by the rmp to carry out the proclamation travel ban defining roads to include maintained solely by the passage of vehicles indisputably departs from these definitions.we nonetheless uphold blm definition.
first,the proclamation does not define the terms road or off road.blm therefore has discretion to adopt reasonable definitions of these terms.see kester,at holding that we review agency interpretations of executive orders with great deference.second,it is not that flpma roadless definition should apply to the proclamation travel ban.flpma definition arises in a specific context identifying roadless areas for purposes of ascertaining their suitability for designation as wilderness.there is no reason to assume that flpma definition applies for all purposes beyond that context or specifically to travel policies.third,the rmp implementation of the proclamation travel ban is not unreasonable on its face.consistent with the evident intent of the proclamation,the rmp plainly restricts motorized use to designated routes,thus prohibiting travel in the ordinary sense of the term.
finally,although the rmp definition is contrary to the flpma and engineering manual definitions discussed above,it is also consistent with several seemingly relevant definitions of road that either existed or were in development at the time the proclamation was issued 
judith valley phillips rmp and west hiline rmp.at the time of the proclamation,the lands that now make up the monument were covered by the judith valley phillips and west hiline resource management plans.consistent with the monument rmp,these plans defined a road to include a route established from use of vehicles over a period of time.
policy governing blm lands in montana.in june,blm adopted an vehicle ohv policy for montana and the dakotas.consistent with the monument rmp,the ohv policy defines travel to exclude motorized vehicle use on clearly evident and routes with regular use and continuous passage of motorized vehicles over a period of years.although blm adopted this policy in,two years after president clinton issued the proclamation,blm issued a draft eis in,more than a year before the proclamation.see notice of availability of the draft off highway vehicle environmental impact statement and plan amendment.
blm h guidelines for inventorying roads.in,when president clinton issued the proclamation,blm guidelines for inventorying roads included routes and primitive roads ways maintained solely by the passage of vehicles.
for these reasons,we can not say that blm abused its discretion by defining roads to include vehicle ways for purposes of the proclamation travel ban.blm implementation of the travel ban therefore does not violate flpma 
parking within feet of roads 
the rmp allows parking and dispersed camping within feet of roads and ways within the monument,other than in wsas.it provides 
outside of the wsas,motorized or mechanized vehicles may park adjacent to a road to provide a reasonable safe distance for the public to pass.however,parking must be within feet of a road.parking will be encouraged at previously used sites.
in the wsas,motorized or mechanized vehicles may only park immediately adjacent to a vehicle way or cherry stem road.
mwa contends that this rule violates the proclamation travel ban by allowing travel.mwa further argues that the rule can not be justified by the proclamation administrative purposes exception because parking within feet of roads and ways is not necessary for members of the public to safely turn around.montana wilderness association opening br.
the government arguments to the contrary notwithstanding,we agree with mwa that the foot parking rule authorizes travel.see record of decision,off highway vehicle environmental impact statement and proposed plan amendment for montana,north dakota and south dakota treating camping within feet of roads and trails as a form of travel.we agree with the government,however,that the rmp parking rule constitutes a permissible interpretation of the proclamation administrative purposes exception.blm concluded that the parking rule provides a reasonable safe distance for the public to pass a parked vehicle.the proclamation does not define administrative purposes,and blm interpretation of the term,although broad,is not unreasonable.blm conclusion that the rule advances the interests of safety is also reasonable.the dispersed camping rule therefore does not violate the proclamation travel ban.
bullwhacker area 
the antiquities act authorizes the president to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks,historic and prehistoric structures,and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the government of the united states to be national monuments,and may reserve as a part thereof parcels of land,the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.emphasis added.
here,the proclamation declares that t he upper missouri river breaks national monument contains a spectacular array of biological,geological,and historical objects of interest.at.the proclamation proceeds to describe these objects,including in a paragraph referring to the bullwhacker area 
the bullwacker area of the monument contains some of the wildest country on all the great plains,as well as important wildlife habitat.during the winter months,mule deer and elk move up to the area from the river,and antelope and sage grouse move down to the area from the benchlands.the heads of the coulees and breaks also contain archeological and historical sites,from teepee rings and remnants of historic trails to abandoned homesteads and lookout sites used by meriwether lewis.
id.at.blm concluded that the bullwhacker area was not an object of the monument,although objects within the bullwhacker area were to be protected.
mwa argues that blm was required to protect the bullwhacker area as an object of the monument.the proclamation,however,is ambiguous as to whether the president intended to make the bullwhacker area itself,as opposed to the wildlife habitat and archeological and historic sites within the bullwhacker area,an object of the monument.blm interpretation is therefore entitled to deference,see kester,at,and we conclude that its interpretation is reasonable.
mwa appears to argue in the alternative that,even if the bullwhacker area itself is not an object of the monument,the rmp fails to protect monument objects within the bullwhacker area.specifically,mwa complains that the rmp permits three airstrips in the bullwhacker area,arguing that these airstrips are inconsistent with the proclamation.mwa relies on a letter written by a blm official in 
at this time,we are not interested in officially these airstrips,nor establishing new airstrips within the monument.we are currently managing the monument under the presidential proclamation and the june state director interim guidance for managing the monument though these documents are silent on airstrips within the monument,we do feel they would be in conformance with either.
mwa argument that this letter bound blm is unpersuasive.in the very next sentence the letter said,we are,however,about to begin scoping the issues for a resource management plan rmp for the monument,and we will consider addressing the need for these airstrips in the rmp.
mwa also complains that the rmp increases airstrips and roads within the bullwhacker area when compared to a inventory of the area.the inventory showed only miles of roads,whereas the rmp authorizes approximately miles of system roads in the area.mwa,however,does not explain why should be used as a baseline for assessing compliance with the proclamation.if the baseline is,when the proclamation was issued,then the rmp reduces the number of roads within the bullwhacker area and the monument generally.the operative question,moreover,is not how many roads are authorized,but rather whether monument objects are protected.mwa has not shown that blm failed to consider or adequately protect monument objects within the bullwhacker area.
cumulative impacts 
for major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,c,the agency is required to prepare an environmental impact statement eis.klamath siskiyou wildlands ctr.blm,cir.an eis is a thorough analysis of the potential environmental impacts that provide s full and fair discussion of significant environmental impacts and inform s decisionmakers and the public of the reasonable alternatives which would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment.id.alterations in original quoting.an eis must also consider cumulative impacts 
cumulative impact is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency federal or or person undertakes such other actions.cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.
here,mwa argues that blm failed to take a hard look at cumulative effects by neglecting to analyze how a host of activities authorized by the rmp including six airstrips,over miles of roads and jet boats,in conjunction with grandparented activities already occurring in the monument especially oil and gas development and livestock grazing,may cumulatively impact objects of the monument,including the most viable elk herd in montana one of the premier big horn sheep herds in the continental united states and the upper missouri national wild and scenic river umnwsr.
at the most basic level,mwa faults the feis because it does not include sections devoted exclusively to cumulative impacts on elk,bighorn sheep and opportunities for solitude in the umnwsr.mwa properly points out that a nepa analysis should be informed by the laws driving the federal action being reviewed.see or.natural desert ass blm,cir b ecause nepa places upon an agency the obligation to consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action,the considerations made relevant by the substantive statute driving the proposed action must be addressed in nepa analysis.citation omitted quoting.yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council.the proclamation and the antiquities act focus on the protection of objects,so mwa suggests that the feis should have included sections including cumulative impact analyses devoted to each of the monument objects.
an agency,however,has discretion in deciding how to organize and present information in an eis.see league of wilderness defenders blue mountains biodiversity project forest,cir holding that an agency is free to consider cumulative effects in the aggregate or to use any other procedure it deems appropriate.it is not for this court to tell the agency what specific evidence to include,nor how specifically to present it.here,blm structured the feis around specific subjects air quality cultural resources fish and wildlife geology and paleontology soils vegetation visual resources water forest resources lands and realty livestock grazing oil and gas recreation transportation fire management wilderness study areas social conditions and economic conditions rather than around the objects of the monument.although the feis does not include sections devoted exclusively to elk,bighorn sheep,the umnwsr and other objects of the monument,the feis discusses these objects throughout.bighorn sheep,for example,are discussed not only in the section addressing impacts on fish and wildlife,but also in the sections on livestock grazing,oil and gas,transportation,social conditions and economic conditions.blm decision to structure the feis in this fashion was within the agency discretion.
whether blm complied with nepa thus turns on the substance of the feis rather than its form the question boils down to whether blm took a hard look at impacts on the umnwsr,elk and bighorn sheep.we conclude that blm did so.
in,congress added a mile segment of the missouri river to the national wild and scenic river system.blm has long managed the river to support a range of recreational experiences,from motorized use to more primitive forms of recreation that afford visitors opportunities for solitude,and the rmp continues to manage the river corridor with this balance in mind.as the feis explains,b oating the missouri river just for the sake of being on the water occurs,but the beauty and the solitude along the route are highly important to many visitors.in addition to discussing opportunities for motorized recreation,the feis describes the river valley unique beauty and abundant wildlife and identifies its pristine scenery and opportunities for solitude and recreation in an unconfined setting as extremely important values.
mwa argues that blm failed to consider cumulative impacts on these values,especially opportunities for solitude 
from river mile to river mile,for instance,blm authorizes an airstrip,motorized use on eight roads,dispersed vehicle camping,motorboats,and a level developed boat camp.in addition,preexisting oil and gas development,livestock grazing fencing,water developments and utility corridors are also occurring within or on land adjacent to this wild segment of the river.
montana wilderness association opening br.mwa acknowledges that the feis considers the impacts of each of these uses individually but faults blm for failing to consider their cumulative impact.
mwa is correct that the feis does not include a section devoted exclusively to cumulative impacts on the river or to cumulative impacts on opportunities for solitude within the river corridor.the feis,however,plainly takes a hard look at these impacts.the feis discusses visual quality in the river the sight,sound and smell effects of motorized boats on primitive river experiences the effects of campsites and signs on the primitive nature of the river the effects of ranches and power lines visible from the river the noise and disturbance effects of personal watercraft the noise and intrusion of floatplanes on the natural and primitive setting of the river blm decision to limit commercial use permits to control the volume of use on the river and adjacent campsites blm decision to impose a camping limit to alleviate sight and sound impacts during the busy season blm decision to impose leave no trace camping rules in primitive settings blm decision to limit signage to protect visual quality and the primitive setting blm decision to prohibit personal watercraft and floatplanes on miles of the mile river segment falling within the monument blm decision to limit motorized watercraft to certain speeds,directions,days of the week and seasons the noise and visual impacts of motorcraft used for administrative purposes the effects of natural gas wells on visitors seeking a primitive setting the effect of closing percent of roads within the area on opportunities for visitors the effects of the dispersed camping rule and signage the effect of authorizing six airstrips on opportunities for a primitive experience the potential impact of future development,of campsites along the river blm decision to designate percent of the river to the most restrictive visual management category vrm class i and the effects of roads and airstrips on primitive experiences.
thus,notwithstanding the absence of a cumulative impact section devoted specifically to opportunities for solitude along the river,the feis certainly considers the effects of roads,airstrips,planes,motorized watercraft,signs,camping and development on opportunities for solitude and the primitive recreational experience.the impacts of the proposed rmp on opportunities for solitude in the river corridor,therefore,are set forth in sufficient detail to promote an informed assessment of environmental considerations and policy choices by the public and agency personnel upon review of the final environmental impact statement.lands council powell,cir.
elk and bighorn sheep 
mwa also faults blm for failing to provide a cumulative impacts analysis on elk habitat.it complains that the rmp authorizes five airstrips,hundreds of miles of roads,utility,jet boats,developed recreational sites,livestock grazing and oil and gas development within the elk winter range,but the feis does not consider the combined impact of these actions on the local elk herd.once again,mwa is technically correct the feis contains no section devoted exclusively to the cumulative impact of these uses on elk.
the feis,however,considers the impact of roads,planes,motorcraft,fences,developed campsites and oil and gas development on wildlife generally,and these analyses focus extensively on elk.the feis discusses the effect of road closures on elk habitat elk habitat and history impacts of water development on elk the effect of fire management on elk the positive impacts on elk winter habitat of limiting or disruptive activities in winter the effect of fences on elk and other wildlife benefits to elk from new water developments resulting in additional distribution of water sources and wetland habitat seasonal restrictions on construction to protect winter habitat for big game species the significance of requiring corridors to restore habitat to native vegetation after construction the possibility of limiting horn hunting to protect big game from excessive disturbance the effect of developed recreational sites on big game the impact of oil and gas drilling on wildlife,including elk,and restrictions adopted to minimize the impact the effect of roads on big game wildlife and the effect of airstrips on wildlife.the feis,moreover,includes a cumulative impacts analysis for fish and wildlife,and this analysis includes a specific subsection devoted to big game,including elk.thus,even though the feis does not offer a cumulative effects analysis specific to elk,blm adequately considered cumulative impacts on the monument elk population.
for similar reasons,we hold that blm adequately considered impacts on bighorn sheep.
reasonable range of alternatives 
environmental impact statements shall provide full and fair discussion of significant environmental impacts and shall inform decisionmakers and the public of the reasonable alternatives which would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment.to this end,an eis shall r igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives,so as to present the environmental impacts of the proposal and the alternatives in comparative form,thus sharply defining the issues and providing a clear basis for choice among options by the decisionmaker and the public.the existence of a viable but unexamined alternative renders an environmental impact statement inadequate.westlands water dist.dep t of interior,cir quoting morongo band of mission indians faa,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,blm considered six airstrip alternatives.two alternatives would have opened airstrips,one would have opened seven airstrips,one would have opened six airstrips,one would have opened five airstrips and a sixth seasonally and one would have opened no airstrips.no alternatives considered opening between zero and six airstrips.on this record,tws argues that blm failed to consider a reasonable range of airstrip alternatives.in tws view,blm failure to consider a middle ground airstrip alternative that would have opened less than a majority of the airstrips was unreasonable.appellants opening,at.
we disagree.although blm could have included an alternative that opened more than zero but less than six alternatives,nepa did not compel the agency to do so.first,blm did consider a alternative one that opened five of the airstrips and a sixth airstrip seasonally.second,the touchstone of the nepa inquiry is whether an eis selection and discussion of alternatives fosters informed and informed public participation.westlands water,at internal quotation marks omitted.although tws faults blm for failing to consider an additional alternative,it does not explain why another alternative was necessary to foster informed decisionmaking and public participation.
tws reliance on california block,cir,is misplaced.block involved the forest service classification of roadless areas into three planning categories wilderness,further planning and nonwilderness.the feis seriously considered eight alternatives,but none of those alternatives designated more than percent of the roadless acreage to undeveloped wilderness.see id.at.the court held that this range of alternative was unreasonable because,although the feis pose d the question whether development should occur at all,it uncritically assume d that a substantial portion of the roadless areas should be developed and consider ed only those alternatives with that end result.id.at.here,by contrast,blm considered not only alternatives that would have authorized at least six airstrips but also an alternative that would have authorized no airstrips at all.
reasonable identification efforts 
section of the national historic preservation act nhpa requires that,prior to any federal undertaking,the relevant federal agency take into account the effect of the undertaking on any district,site,building,structure,or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the national register of historic places and afford the advisory council on historic preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment with regard to such undertaking.muckleshoot indian tribe forest,cir per curiam second alteration in original quoting.section of nhpa is a stop,look,and listen provision that requires each federal agency to consider the effects of its programs.id.under nhpa,a federal agency must make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties,b determine whether identified properties are eligible for listing on the national register based on criteria in assess the effects of the undertaking on any eligible historic properties found,c,a determine whether the effect will be adverse,c,b and avoid or mitigate any adverse effects,e,c.id.
nhpa regulations provide that an agency shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to carry out appropriate identification efforts,which may include background research,consultation,oral history interviews,sample field investigation,and field survey.b.the blm manual sets out three types of surveys that may be used to identify historic and cultural resources.see te moak tribe of shoshone of dep t of interior,cir blm manual release,available at http manual.par.last visited july.
a class i survey is a professionally prepared study that includes a compilation and analysis of all reasonably available cultural resource data and literature,and a,interpretative,narrative overview,and synthesis of the data.blm manual.this alternative relies on existing information rather than entailing additional,surveying.the blm manual states that a class i inventory is most useful for gaining a comprehensive view of all the known archaeological,historic,cultural and traditional places within a large area,such as the area to be covered by a plan or an eis.id.
a class ii survey is a probabilistic field survey or statistically based sample survey that aid s in characterizing the probable density,diversity,and distribution of cultural properties in an area.blm manual.this alternative involves surveying,but it relies on sampling rather than evaluating every square foot of an area.the blm manual provides that a class ii survey is most useful for improving cultural resource information in a large area,such as for planning or eis purposes,where insufficient systematic identification work has been done in the past.id.
a class iii survey is an i ntensive survey that involves a professionally conducted,thorough pedestrian survey of an entire target area intended to locate and record all historic properties and that provides managers and cultural resource specialists with a complete record of cultural properties.blm manual.this alternative requires an survey of the entire subject area.the manual explains that an i ntensive survey is most useful when it is necessary to know precisely what historic properties exist in a given area.blm manual.the class iii survey is the most frequently employed method of inventory.see blm manual.
blm has also issued an instruction memorandum for complying with the nhpa when preparing transportation plans.see blm instruction memorandum,the memorandum suggests that a class i survey will suffice when a transportation plan proposes to maintain the status quo,but that a class iii inventory should be used when a plan authorizes new roads or increased traffic on existing roads 
proposed designations that will not change or will reduce ohv use are unlikely to adversely affect historic properties and will require less intensive identification efforts.these include designations that allow continued use of an existing route impose new limitations on an existing route close an open area or travel route keep a closed area closed or keep an open area open 
where there is a reasonable expectation that a proposed designation will shift,concentrate or expand travel into areas where historic properties are likely to be adversely affected,class iii inventory and compliance with section of the nhpa,focused on areas where adverse effects are likely to occur,is required prior to designation.

here,blm conducted a class i survey.the agency contracted with north wind,to conduct a literature review of previous surveys of the monument.the literature obtained by north wind showed that in the past,projects had examined approximately acres in the monument area.these projects generally dated to the and and had identified historic sites within the monument,including sites on public land.in addition to identifying these previously recorded sites,north wind identified additional potential historic sites by reviewing general land office and topographic maps.north wind also reviewed ethnographic literature to identify areas of native american spiritual concern.neither north wind nor blm conducted any class ii or class iii surveys.
north wind reported the results of its review in a page report.north wind report included a recommendation that blm conduct a class iii survey 
the review concludes with the observation that over half the sites were recorded in the and.generally,these site forms lack proper site descriptions,site sketches and topographic maps with site locations.the combination of minimal site information,inconsistent survey methods and a dynamic missouri river that has probably eroded away known cultural resources and exposed new cultural resources suggests that a class iii cultural resource inventory be conducted in the monument to locate and record cultural resources to today standards.
blm has not done so.
blm reviewed the north wind report and incorporated its findings,as well as other information,into an analysis of cultural resources in the feis.the feis acknowledged that most of the earlier surveys dated to the and and covered only to percent of the monument area.
mwa and tws contend that blm failed to make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historical and cultural resources.mwa argues that blm was required to conduct a class iii inventory in the areas where historic sites are most likely to be found the river corridor and the areas in which historic sites are most likely to be damaged or destroyed roads,airstrips and dispersed camping sites.tws argues that blm should be required to conduct a class iii inventory for the most affected areas,which tws says are the open road corridors 
the government argues that blm reliance on a class i survey was reasonable and in good faith,citing several considerations 
relying on blm instruction memorandum,the government maintains that a class i inventory was sufficient because the rmp allows continued use of existing roads and airstrips rather than authorizing new roads and airstrips.the government contends that,by authorizing only existing roads and airstrips,the rmp does not authorize any new surface disturbance that could mar historic sites and objects.
the government emphasizes that conducting class ii or class iii surveys of the acre monument would be both and expensive.
the government says it may conduct more intensive surveys in the future,such as if additional roads are authorized.
the government argues that blm approach here is consistent with blm information bulletin may,which suggests that a class i inventory will ordinarily suffice for purposes of general land use planning such as preparation of a resource management plan.
there are,however,a number of reasons to question whether blm class i inventory represents a reasonable effort in this case.first,the rmp here is not just any land use plan.it is a land use plan adopted to implement a national monument designated for the very purpose of protecting and preserving historic objects.see.at.in addition,the rmp is not solely a general land use plan it also authorizes specific uses,including over miles of roads and ways.the information bulletin upon which the government relies specifies that a more detailed level of identification of the scope and nature of cultural resources may be required when land use planning entails specific impacts see also blm manual.d providing that inventories should take place using the methods and at a level commensurate with the nature of the proposed undertaking and its likely effects on the protection and management of the cultural resources.
second,as the government concedes,only percent of monument lands have been subject to class iii inventories,and only percent of the monument has been subject to class ii or class iii inventories.see answering br.of federal defendants appellees,at.most of these inventories are four decades old.given the age and inconsistencies of work performed in the project area,north wind recommended that a class iii cultural resources inventory be conducted to locate and record previously recorded sites to today standards and to ascertain the existence of potential historic sites.the state of montana also commented that f urther investigations of cultural and historic sites are necessary to develop strategies for their protection.
third,the government reliance on the instruction memorandum is unpersuasive.although the memorandum provides that proposed designations that will not change or will reduce motorized vehicle use ordinarily will require less intensive identification efforts,it also provides that p roposed designations of new routes or new areas as open to ohv use will require class iii inventory.the plaintiffs argue persuasively that ways in the monument are more akin to new routes than existing routes because they have never been subject to an nhpa survey previously.as blm acknowledged in the feis,the roads and ways within the monument were,before the rmp,not federal undertakings and therefore have not required section surveys.for purposes of the memorandum,then,the roads and airstrips within the monument may be best understood as new rather than existing impacts.as tws explains unlike the usual case,where the existing routes have been analyzed before and where redundant analysis would be pointless,the impacts of the routes in the monument have never been analyzed.appellants reply,at.
fourth,even if the rmp is viewed as continuing existing routes rather than designating new ones,the instruction memorandum provides that a class iii inventory is required w here there is a reasonable expectation that a proposed designation will shift,concentrate or expand travel into areas where historic properties are likely to be adversely affected.the rmp closes miles out of miles of roads and ways and closes another miles seasonally,closes four out of airstrips and closes a fifth seasonally and allows dispersed camping within feet of a road as opposed to within feet under rules.these consolidations wil
