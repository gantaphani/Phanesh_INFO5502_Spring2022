plaintiff organizations ecological rights foundation erf and mateel environmental justice foundation mateel brought this lawsuit against pacific lumber company alleging various violations of the federal water pollution control act of,better known as the clean water act,see et,at pacific lumber yager camp and carlotta mill operations in humboldt county,california.the district court granted pacific lumber motion for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue.erf and mateel appeal the district court standing ruling.we conclude that the district court approach to standing can not be squared with friends of the earth laidlaw,d,decided after the district court judgment issued in this case,and that applying laidlaw,the two plaintiff organizations do have standing to pursue this litigation.because pacific lumber other arguments,whether valid or not,would not support dismissal of this case,we reverse the judgment and remand the case for further district court proceedings.
yager creek 
yager camp and the carlotta sawmill both abut yager creek.runoff from these two facilities drains into the creek and waterways further downstream.the creek flows through yager camp,a site that includes a truck wash operation,a composting area,and log decks to store logs before they are sent to the carlotta sawmill.the mill,located just downstream of yager camp,occupies more than acres alongside the creek.the mill facility also includes truck shops,an aggregate crusher,and more log decks.
yager creek flows into the van duzen river about a mile below the carlotta mill.the van duzen in turn empties into the eel river,and the eel reaches the pacific ocean about miles from pacific lumber facilities.yager creek and the other rivers in the eel river system are used for swimming,boating,and other recreational activities.various forms of wildlife inhabit the area nourished by yager creek,and fish use the creek to migrate to their spawning grounds.
several members of erf and mateel use yager creek for recreation.they particularly enjoy their visits because they can view wildlife in and around the creek.the organizations members avoid some activities they would otherwise enjoy in and around yager creek,however,because they fear that runoff from pacific lumber two facilities is damaging the creek and its wildlife,and enjoy other activities less than they would if there were no such runoff.among the several members of the plaintiff organizations who use the creek for recreational activities,two are particularly significant for this case.
christopher hinderyckx,a member of mateel,began visiting the creek in when he was commuting from his home in southern humboldt county to attend classes at the college of the redwoods in arcata.since completing his coursework,he has continued to drive to arcata often,sometimes stopping along the creek.over the years,hinderyckx has gone swimming in yager creek at least a dozen times.although hinderyckx has enjoyed swimming in yager creek,he is less likely to swim there in the future,because he now has information that suggests to him that the creek may be polluted.hinderyckx also hesitates to fish in the creek because he is concerned about harmful pollutants in the water.and because the creek is not as clean as it should be,hinderyckx maintains,he aesthetically enjoys his recreational activities there less than he otherwise would.
similarly,frederic evenson,a humboldt county resident since and an erf member,takes part in various recreational activities on and downstream of yager creek,including swimming and snorkeling in the creek near carlotta and observing wildlife.he derive s immense pleasure,strength and inspiration from these visits.evenson plans to continue these visits to yager creek,but his enjoyment of yager creek and the downstream waterways is impaired by discharges of pollutants from carlotta and yager camp.
statutory background 
yager camp and the carlotta sawmill are subject to the mandates of the clean water act cwa.see et.a linchpin of the cwa regulatory scheme is the national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit program,which allows certain discharges of pollutants only if in compliance with permits,and imposes related monitoring and reporting requirements.see.the clean water act makes illegal any discharges of pollutants that are not specifically allowed by an npdes permit.a.
under the clean water act,the states,with epa approval,may issue and administer npdes permits.see b see also cal.water code expressing california intent to implement an npdes program at the state level.in california,the state water resources control board swrcb issues and administers a general permit that regulates discharges of pollutants into california waters.industrial facilities in california subject to the clean water act must either comply with the general permit or obtain individualized npdes permits.see swrcb water quality order,npdes general permit no.at hereinafter general permit.
among the conditions imposed by the general permit are prohibitions on water discharges of pollutants into the state waterways except those specifically allowed,as well as strict limits on the discharge of pollutants into storm water in addition,each facility subject to the general permit must develop and implement an effective storm water pollution prevention plan swppp to reduce or prevent pollutants associated with industrial activity in storm water discharges and authorized water discharges.general permit at.substantially similar,albeit less detailed,requirements were in place in the precursor to the general permit that was in effect from through.
this litigation 
the plaintiff organizations brought this action pursuant to the cwa citizen suit provision,claiming violations of the general permit.the clean water act allows any citizen to sue any person who is alleged to be in violation of an effluent standard or limitation under this chapter or an order issued by the epa administrator or a state with respect to such a standard or limitation.an effluent standard or limitation is further defined to include a permit or condition thereof issued under section of this title.f.
at least days before filing a lawsuit,a potential plaintiff must notify the alleged violator of her intent to sue.see b a see also national environmental foundation abc rail,cir compliance with b is a mandatory prerequisite to citizen suit.such notice must include 
sufficient information to permit the recipient to identify the specific standard,limitation,or order alleged to have been violated,the activity alleged to constitute a violation,the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation,the location of the alleged violation,the date or dates of such violation,and the full name,address,and telephone number of the person giving notice.
to comply with this notice requirement,erf and mateel sent letters to pacific lumber on october and november,giving notice of intent to sue regarding alleged cwa violations at yager camp and carlotta,respectively.the yager camp letter alleged the following violations of the general permit unpermitted discharges of contaminated storm water failure to prepare and implement an adequate swppp failure to comply with the general permit reporting and monitoring conditions and failures to conduct required visual observations and to collect storm water samples.the carlotta letter alleged discharges of pollutants in violation of the general permit failure to prepare and implement an adequate swppp failure to monitor discharges of pollutants in violation of the general permit conditions failures to conduct visual observations and to collect and analyze storm water samples inadequate and reporting failure to mitigate discharges of pollutants and failure to properly operate and maintain facilities to minimize pollution.the letters also alleged that both sites were in violation of california proposition,cal.health safety code 
on january,erf and mateel filed a complaint against pacific lumber,reiterating the allegations of general permit violations that were set forth in the yager camp and carlotta letters the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint,alleging violations of the general permit then in effect,on august,without first sending new notice letters to pacific lumber.both the complaint and the amended complaint sought injunctive and declaratory relief,civil penalties,and attorneys fees.pacific lumber sought dismissal of the lawsuit on several grounds,including standing,mootness,and the sufficiency of the notice letters.
on for summary judgment,the district court concluded that erf and mateel lacked standing,and dismissed their lawsuit.ecological rights foundation pacific lumber,d.because the district court dismissed the case,it had no reason to and did not reach the other issues raised by the parties in their summary judgment motions.the plaintiffs seek reversal of the district court decision on standing,while pacific lumber urges us to affirm the district court either on standing grounds or on the mootness or inadequate notice arguments raised but not decided in the district court.
standing issue 
the cwa citizen suit provision extends standing to the outer boundaries set by the case or controversy requirement of article iii of the constitution.see middlesex county sewerage authority national sea clammers ass n,d.because the statutory and constitutional standing issues therefore merge,the only standing issue before us,which we determine de novo,is whether the plaintiffs have standing under article iii to proceed to the merits of their lawsuit.alaska wildlife alliance jensen,cir.we conclude that mateel and erf have article iii standing based on hinderyckx and evenson use,respectively,of yager creek,and therefore do not address the plaintiffs alternative standing theory based on direct injuries to the plaintiff groups organizational interests 
organizational standing in environmental cases 
an organization has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when a its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right b the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purposes and c neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.hunt washington state apple advertising com n,d see also international union,united,aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america brock,d individual members would have standing in their own right under article iii if they have suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual and imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical,the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.laidlaw.at citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the dispute in this case hinges principally on whether any individual members of erf and mateel have alleged an injury in fact,and therefore would have standing to sue in their own right.
the injury in fact requirement in environmental cases is satisfied if an individual adequately shows that she has an aesthetic or recreational interest in a particular place,or animal,or plant species and that that interest is impaired by a defendant conduct.see,laidlaw.at defenders of wildlife,at.sierra club morton,d oregon natural desert ass dombeck,cir.the district court in this case so recognized,but concluded nonetheless that none of the members of erf and mateel who submitted affidavits in support of the organizations standing alleged contacts with yager creek sufficient to state an injury in fact to their recreational and aesthetic interests,explaining its decision as follows 
despite the low threshold required for satisfying the injury in fact requirement,the court does not find that plaintiffs submissions regarding harm to their members and their members connection to yager creek to be adequate e ven in view of the statements of plaintiffs members construed in a light most favorable to plaintiffs,the court finds that the members spatial and temporal contacts with yager creek are too sporadic or attenuated to satisfy the injury in fact prong of the standing analysis.importantly,none of the plaintiffs affiants state that they live in the vicinity of yager creek or regularly use yager creek for recreational or aesthetic purposes.
the district court standing ruling,it thus appears,turned on the supposition that a plaintiff can only establish standing in an environmental case on the basis of aesthetic or recreational interests if she lives some specified distance from the area covered by the lawsuit and repeats her use of the area at some prescribed interval.the injury in fact requirement in environmental cases is not,however,reducible to inflexible,judicially mandated time or distance guidelines,as laidlaw makes clear.
injury in fact under laidlaw 
before laidlaw,the supreme court examined the injury in fact requirement in environmental cases in detail in two cases.see defenders of wildlife,at.affirming grant of summary judgment for lack of standing because plaintiffs did not meet their obligation under.e to allege sufficiently specific facts demonstrating their use of the contested area lujan national wildlife federation,d denying standing because plaintiffs could show only speculative someday intentions to visit endangered species halfway around the world the plaintiff organizations in defenders of wildlife and national wildlife federation sought to litigate the validity of broadly applicable environmental rulings.a few of their members made allegations concerning their connections to the extensive areas covered by those rulings,but the averments supporting those allegations were either extremely vague in national wildlife federation or extremely speculative in defenders of wildlife.because the plaintiffs in both defenders of wildlife and national wildlife federation failed to show any tangible,continuing connection to any particular location affected by the challenged decision,they could not assure that the legal questions presented to the court will be resolved,not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society,but in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action.valley forge christian college americans united for separation of church and state,d.
laidlaw,on the other hand,involved a situation,like this one,in which the litigation was narrowly focused and the plaintiffs allegations of injury quite specific.in laidlaw,several environmental organizations brought a clean water act citizen suit for injunctive relief and civil penalties alleging that laidlaw environmental services was violating its npdes permit at a hazardous waste incinerator on the banks of south carolina north tyger river.at.several of the plaintiff organizations members filed declarations detailing the injury they had or would suffer because of suspected pollution of the river.of those members,some lived within two miles of the incinerator,another lived miles away,and still others did not specify where they lived.some of the members filing declarations said that they had engaged in recreational activities on the river in the past,while others were deterred from such activities by laidlaw alleged discharges of pollutants.one affiant claimed only that he had canoed on the river some miles downstream from the incinerator.considering the standing question sua sponte the supreme court held that all these individual members of the plaintiff organizations had stated injuries to their aesthetic and recreational interests sufficiently specific to allow standing,because all of them use the affected area and are persons for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened by the challenged activity.at quoting sierra club,at.
under laidlaw,then,an individual can establish injury in fact by showing a connection to the area of concern sufficient to make credible the contention that the person future life will be less he or she really has or will suffer in his or her degree of aesthetic or recreational the area in question remains or becomes environmentally degraded.factors of residential contiguity and frequency of use may certainly be relevant to that determination,but are not to be evaluated in a,mechanistic manner.
daily geographical proximity,for instance,may make actual past recreational use less important in substantiating an injury in fact,because a person who lives quite nearby is likely to notice and care about the physical beauty of an area he passes often.see laidlaw.at foe member alleged injury in fact because he lived a from laidlaw facility he occasionally drove over the north tyger river,and it looked and smelled polluted friends of the earth consolidated rail,cir affiant who passed the hudson river regularly and found its pollution offensive to his aesthetic values stated injury in fact.on the other hand,a person who uses an area for recreational purposes does not have to show that he or she lives particularly nearby to establish an due to possible or feared environmental degradation.repeated recreational use itself,accompanied by a credible allegation of desired future use,can be sufficient,even if relatively infrequent,to demonstrate that environmental degradation of the area is injurious to that person.id.at finding that an individual who has canoed in the river and would do so again,closer to the discharge point,were it not for the discharges has made a sufficient showing.an individual who visits yosemite national park once a year to hike or rock climb and regards that visit as the highlight of his year is not precluded from litigating to protect the environmental quality of yosemite valley simply because he can not visit more often.
this flexible approach is the only one consistent with the nature of the aesthetic and recreational interests that typically provide the basis for standing in environmental cases.as the supreme court has explained,a esthetic and environmental,like economic,are important ingredients of the quality of life in our society.sierra club,at.yet,aesthetic perceptions are necessarily personal and subjective,and different individuals who use the same area for recreational purposes may participate in widely varying activities,according to different schedules.laidlaw confirms that the constitutional law of standing so recognizes,and does not prescribe any particular formula for establishing a sufficiently concrete and particularized,defenders of wildlife,at,aesthetic or recreational 
injury in fact in this case 
evaluating the record in this case in accord with laidlaw,there is no doubt that both plaintiff organizations have come forward with sufficient factual averments to survive summary judgment on the standing issue.both hinderyckx,a member of mateel,and evenson,a member of erf,stated longstanding recreational and aesthetic interests in yager creek,the specific place at issue in this case.both have used the creek for recreational activities several times in the past,and both have alleged that pacific lumber conduct has impaired their enjoyment of those activities.hinderyckx,like the affiants in laidlaw,testified that he is deterred from fully enjoying yager creek because of his concerns about pollutants discharged from pacific lumber facilities adjacent to the creek although he likes to fish,he refrains from fishing in the creek because of concerns about pollution,and he is less likely to swim at some places along the creek than he used to be.and both hinderyckx and evenson,like the affiants in laidlaw,expressed an interest in participating in recreational activities in and around yager creek in the future,and in continuing to enjoy the beauty of the area 
like the affiants on whom standing was based in laidlaw,then,hinderyckx and evenson use the affected area and are persons for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened by the challenged activity.laidlaw.at internal citations omitted.we conclude that erf and mateel have standing to sue based on the injuries alleged by hinderyckx and evenson.
other standing issues raised in this appeal 
one last point requires mention pacific lumber argues that the plaintiffs lack standing because they have demonstrated neither actual environmental harm to yager creek itself,nor that the company caused any such harm.as the district court correctly recognized,however,see d at,the threshold question of citizen standing under the cwa is whether an individual can show that she has been injured in her use of a particular area because of concerns about violations of environmental laws,not whether the plaintiff can show there has been actual environmental harm.see laidlaw.at friends of the earth,gaston copper recycling,cir en banc.this is so for at least two reasons.
first,under many environmental protection statutes,harm to the environment need not ever be proved the clean water act allows citizen suits based on violations of any conditions of an npdes permit,even those which are purely procedural.see f citizen suit may allege violation of permit or condition thereof outlining procedural requirements of npdes permits,including reporting,monitoring,and.as the laidlaw court explained,requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate actual environmental harm in order to obtain standing would,in many clean water act lawsuits,compel the plaintiff to prove more to show standing than she would have to prove to succeed on the merits.at.requiring the plaintiff to show actual environmental harm as a condition for standing confuses the jurisdictional inquiry does the court have power under article iii to hear the case with the merits inquiry did the defendant violate the law.
second,laidlaw recognized that an increased risk of harm can itself be injury in fact sufficient for standing.the irreducible constitutional minimum conditions for standing do not require a plaintiff to demonstrate that she has already suffered physical injury,but allow her to obtain standing based on an injury that is imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.laidlaw.at quoting defenders of wildlife,at.see also gaston copper,at.in the wake of laidlaw,for example,the en banc fourth circuit held that an affiant sufficiently alleged injury in fact under the clean water act when the defendant alleged npdes permit violations threatened the environmental quality of waters adjoining the affiant property,although the plaintiff environmental organizations had not produced evidence of actual environmental degradation.gaston copper,at.as the gaston copper court cogently explained,to require actual evidence of environmental harm,rather than an increased risk based on a violation of the statute,misunderstands the nature of environmental harm,and would undermine enforcement of the clean water act 
the supreme court has consistently recognized that threatened rather than actual injury can satisfy article iii standing requirements threatened environmental injury is by nature probabilistic.and yet other circuits have had no trouble understanding the injurious nature of risk itself a plaintiff need not wait until his lake becomes barren and sterile or assumes an unpleasant color and smell before he can invoke the protections of the clean water act.
id.at internal citations omitted.
mateel and erf have clearly alleged that pacific lumber has violated conditions of its npdes permits at yager camp and carlotta hinderyckx and evenson have demonstrated that pacific lumber alleged conduct has impaired their aesthetic and recreational interests in yager creek.each has averred that he enjoys the area less than he otherwise would,and is reluctant to swim and fish there,because of concerns about the effects of pollutant discharges from pacific lumber facilities adjoining the creek.they need not prove to a scientific certainty that pacific lumber has,in fact,discharged pollutants in violation of its permits in order to obtain standing this,as just explained,is one of the merits questions in the case.
pacific lumber further argues that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that their asserted injuries are fairly traceable to any conduct by the company.we disagree.the issue in the causation inquiry is whether the alleged injury can be traced to the defendant challenged conduct,rather than to that of some other actor not before the co
