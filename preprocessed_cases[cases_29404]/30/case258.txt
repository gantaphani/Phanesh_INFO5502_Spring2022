opinion of the court 
this is an appeal of the approval of a consent decree under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act,as amended,et,substantially resolving more than a decade of litigation involving contamination of the tutu water wells aquifer in the united states virgin islands.three parties appeal the district court approval of the consent decree,contending that the consent decree is arbitrary and unreasonable in its damage assessments and that the district court erred in not conducting a full evidentiary hearing prior to its decision.
this matter has been in litigation for several years.we have reviewed different aspects of this case on three separate occasions.in,we dismissed claims against corporations.in re tutu wells contamination,cir table.in,we reversed sanctions imposed upon defendant esso by the district court.in re tutu wells contamination,cir.finally,in,we denied without discussion a petition for a writ of mandamus.
before us now is the district court approval of a consent decree resolving the underlying litigation.the consent decree resolves two lawsuits arising out of the tutu site contamination the first suit was filed by the commissioner of the department of planning and natural resources,dean plaskett,in his capacity as trustee for the natural resources of the territory of the united states virgin islands,against esso,texaco,gal,lazare,and certain other parties under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act,as amended,et,and territorial statutory and common law.in the second lawsuit,esso and texaco sought to recover contribution under cercla for remediation costs incurred under prior environmental protection agency administrative orders.
in support of their joint motion to the district court,the settling parties filed a appendix,including the consent decree and various epa and other expert reports.the trustee retained industrial economics to conduct a damage assessment,one of two nationally known firms that performs these assessments.comm r of the dpnr esso standard oil,civ,at filed.the assessment here examined two types of losses use related loss represented the cost to rehabilitate the contaminated portions of the tutu aquifer and related loss assessed the lost value to the public from of the aquifer.industrial economics calculated the use related loss at million and estimated the related loss at approximately million.its work was by raymond kopp,a senior fellow at resources for the future,and kevin boyle,a professor of environmental economics at the university of maine.
in march,all parties convened a settlement conference where the trustee disseminated the industrial economics assessment to all defendants,including the laga parties.in conjunction with the epa and the united states department of justice,the trustee also prepared a spreadsheet to allocate fault percentages to the various parties.based on relevant factors,including the volume and toxicity of the parties contamination,their financial resources,and their degree of cooperation,the trustee allocated a share to esso,a share to texaco,and a share to the laga parties 
the laga parties elected not to participate in settlement discussions beyond the initial march meeting.in contrast,esso and texaco participated in settlement negotiations with the trustee between march and september.these negotiations were conducted at arm length and in good faith.they resulted in the parties agreeing in principle to a consent decree,with esso agreeing to pay million and texaco million to settle the trustee claims.
on february,the district court heard the settling parties joint motion to enforce the consent decree and permitted all parties to submit evidence and make arguments.both the settling parties and the laga parties presented the court with proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.on october,the district court approved the consent decree and the laga parties now appeal.
this appeal presents two questions.first,was the district court approval of the consent decree fair,reasonable,and in the public interest second,did the district court err by approving the consent decree without holding a full evidentiary hearing 
in enacting cercla,congress crafted a complex statutory scheme designed to ensure the cleanup of the nation hazardous waste sites.in fmc department of commerce,cir,we noted cercla broad remedial purposes and cited as most important cercla essential purpose of making those responsible for problems caused by the disposal of chemical poisons bear the costs and responsibility for remedying the harmful conditions they created.
to this end,cercla provides the epa with a variety of tools for achieving the efficient and cleanup of the nation hazardous waste sites.united states occidental chem,cir.notable for our purposes here is that the act expressly provides that w henever practicable and in the public interest the government shall act to facilitate agreements in order to expedite effective remedial actions and minimize litigation.a.under cercla,the epa and other environmental agencies like the dpnr are authorized to agree to settlements that shall be entered in the appropriate district court as a consent decree.d a.
we recently had occasion to consider judicial approvals of consent decrees in cercla actions.united states septa,cir.in septa,the united states brought a cercla action against septa,conrail,and amtrak,all prior owners of a contaminated rail yard.the parties resolved the dispute and sought entry of a consent decree.but another prior owner of the rail yard,american premier,objected to the proposed settlement.the district court approved the consent decree and american premier appealed.
on appeal,we considered the proper standard of review.as we stated 
we approach our task mindful that,on appeal,a district court approval of a consent decree in cercla litigation is encased in a double layer of swaddling.the first layer is the deference the district court owes to the epa expertise and to the law policy of encouraging settlement the second layer is the deference we owe to the district court discretion.thus,a litigant is faced with a heavy burden in its attempt to persuade us that the district court abused its discretion by approving the consent decree.
id.quoting,in part,united states cannons eng g,cir.
appellate review,therefore,is encased in a double layer of swaddling.id.first,there is deference to the administrative agencies input during consent decree negotiations and the law policy of encouraging settlement.where the appropriate agency has reviewed the record and has made a reasonable determination of fault and damages,that determination is owed some deference.see cannons,at if the figures relied upon derive in a sensible way from a plausible interpretation of the record,the court should normally defer to the agency expertise.second,there is deference accorded the district court under an abuse of discretion standard.
a court should approve a consent decree if it is fair,reasonable,and consistent with cercla goals.septa,at.in evaluating the fairness of a consent decree,a court should assess both procedural and substantive considerations.procedural fairness requires that settlement negotiations take place at arm length.a court should look to the negotiation process and attempt to gauge its candor,openness and bargaining balance.cannons,at.substantive fairness requires that the terms of the consent decree are based on comparative fault and apportion liability according to rational estimates of the harm each party has caused.septa,at.as long as the measure of comparative fault on which the settlement terms are based is not arbitrary,capricious,and devoid of a rational basis,the district court should uphold it.id.at quotations omitted.a consent decree only need be based on a rational determination of comparative fault,whether or not a district court would have employed the same method of apportionment.id.
once a district court determines procedural and substantive fairness and approves the consent decree,we review its judgment for abuse of discretion.occidental,at.parties challenging a
