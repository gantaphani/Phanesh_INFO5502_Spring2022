it is ordered that the opinion filed herein on january,be modified as follows 
on pages and,the last paragraph on page continuing to page is deleted and replaced by the following 
in,the legislature enacted section,which provides in pertinent part the following 
this change has the further effect of deleting footnote on page.
on page,the last full paragraph beginning with the interim authority granted by sections and,the reference to section is stricken,so that the sentence now begins with the interim authority granted by section 
on pages and,the last two paragraphs on page and the first two paragraphs on page are stricken and replaced with the following 
subdivision b of section provides in pertinent part the following prior to certification of its local coastal program,a local government may,with respect to any development within its area of jurisdiction in the coastal zone and consistent with the provisions of sections,and,establish procedures for the filing,processing,review,modification,approval,or denial of a coastal development permit.sections,and,in turn,set forth procedures for issuance and review of permits and standards by which coastal development will be evaluated.although sections and both govern issuance of coastal development permits by a local government prior to certification of a local coastal program,the procedures and standards to be followed pursuant to section,which was enacted in stats,ch,are different from those applicable under section,enacted in stats,ch.whether the latter statute superseded the former is not at issue today.
these modifications effect no change in the judgment.

under the california coastal act of pub.resources code,et hereafter the coastal act,any person wishing to develop property in a coastal zone in california must first obtain a coastal development permit,which is issued in some zones by the california coastal commission the commission and in others by local governments.a person who develops coastal property without a permit may be exposed to substantial civil penalties and subjected to a restoration order.
stefan,kathryn and rahel hagopian appellants or petitioners developed coastal property without first seeking or obtaining coastal development permits and were issued cease and desist and restoration orders by the commission.they appeal from the judgment entered after the trial court denied their petition for a writ of mandate against the commission and the county of los angeles.the trial court rejected petitioners challenge to the commission jurisdiction and proceedings,rejected their argument that the county should be compelled to assume permitting authority under the coastal act,and denied their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.
on appeal,petitioners argue the county of los angeles is the proper permitting body for the coastal zone in which their property is located the county should be ordered to assume this permitting authority the commission should be ordered to compel the county to fulfill this obligation the commission violated petitioners due process rights and denied them a fair hearing and the commission findings were unsupported by substantial evidence.
we conclude the commission is the duly authorized permitting agency for the coastal zone in which petitioners property is located and did not err in finding petitioners development to be in violation of the coastal act.we further conclude the county of los angeles has breached no statutory duty.we therefore affirm.
background 
the facts are largely undisputed.on august,the commission approved a coastal development permit authorizing everett rollins to construct a square foot single family residence at topanga skyline drive,topanga,an unincorporated area of western los angeles county.the property was situated in an undeveloped,environmentally sensitive mediterranean biome consisting of coast live oak woodlands and mixed chaparral.rollins coastal development permit was subject to his compliance with several conditions,including conformance with an engineering geologist recommendations and recordation of the permit and its conditions as a deed restriction.the permit provided that any deviation from the approved plans must be reviewed and approved by the staff and may require commission approval.
four years later,in,stefan and kathryn hagopian purchased the parcel from rollins parcel and in purchased an adjoining parcel parcel.in,they and rahel hagopian purchased a third adjoining parcel parcel.
in,stefan and kathryn applied to the commission for a permit exemption to construct a square foot guest house on parcel.commission staff denied the exemption,informed the hagopians that such construction would require a coastal development permit,and sent them a blank permit application.
the hagopians thereafter ignored permit requirements and by had begun or completed construction on at least eight structures on the property,graded for a second residence on parcel,and created commercial vineyards by removing substantial swathes of vegetation,grading and filling several areas,and installing an access road,a large solar panel array,and a pool and tennis court.
the commission issued a notice of violation of the coastal act on march,again invited the hagopians to apply for a coastal development permit,and informed them they ran the risk of incurring fines of up to per day and penalties of up to per day of noncompliance.
on april,the hagopians informed the commission they intended to apply for a coastal development permit and sought an extension of time to do so.monthly letters and telephone and conversations followed over the next fifteen months,during which the hagopians sought several more extensions of time,made and then withdrew an application for a permit exemption,and raised various arguments why they did not need a coastal development permit.they argued the development on their property was exempt from the coastal act,the commission had no jurisdiction because the county of los angeles was the sole permitting authority under the act,the developed areas of the property had contained no environmentally sensitive habitat,and their right to install vineyards was vested by virtue of prior use of the property for agricultural primarily grazing purposes.coastal commission staff dutifully responded to each of the hagopians arguments,invited them to substantiate their claims of prior agricultural use and lack of sensitive habitat,and granted at least six deadline extensions.the hagopians never attempted to substantiate their claims or apply for a coastal development permit,but instead continued to grade and develop the property.
the commission issued a notice of intent to record notices of violation against the subject property and commenced cease and desist and restoration order proceedings.on may,the commission mailed the hagopians a statement of defense form with which they could dispute allegations that they had violated the coastal act.after requesting and obtaining two extensions of time to submit their statement of defense,the hagopians ultimately failed to return the form or provide any defense.on july,the hagopians informed commission staff they were no longer interested in further communications.
on august,the commission held a public hearing concerning the matter,during which commission staff presented extensive evidence of habitat destruction on the property,including photographs showing woodland ridges had been turned into commercial vineyards.several members of the community voiced opposition to the hagopians development activities,and two neighbors spoke of extensive environmental devastation caused by six years of heavy construction on the hagopians property.
the hagopians presented no evidence at the hearing,but indicated they stood upon their prior communications with commission staff.their counsel objected to the hearing on due process grounds,argued the commission had no jurisdiction to issue coastal development permits because the coastal act vested that authority in the county of los angeles,and argued the commission had no authority to hold a violation hearing because the commission was an adversarial party in the proceedings.counsel further argued,without explanation,that the coastal development permit issued to rollins in authorized the hagopians landscaping,and their viniculture was permissible under unspecified los angeles county zoning regulations.
after the presentation of evidence,several of the commission members present commented that a very egregious case of ongoing massive commercial development had occurred without commission approval,resulting in wholesale destruction and mountain top removal reminiscent of west virginia coal mining.the commission unanimously found the hagopians violated the coastal act and issued cease and desist and restoration orders.
on october,the hagopians filed the petition,asserting the commission lacked jurisdiction to enforce the coastal act in the santa monica mountains area and had violated their due process rights.petitioners admitted they had graded on the property,erected structures,and removed vegetation in a coastal zone but asserted they needed no coastal development permit to do so because they had disturbed no environmentally sensitive habitat and had obtained county building permits for all structures erected.
the petition sought a peremptory writ of mandate directing the commission to vacate and set aside its findings of violation,rescind its cease and desist and restoration orders,and cease requiring the petitioners to apply for coastal development permits from the commission as opposed to the county.the petition also sought a declaration that permitting authority under the coastal act was vested in the county of los angeles,not the commission,and that the county had issued all necessary permits for the petitioners actions.petitioners further asked the superior court to order the commission and the county of los angeles to agree on the terms of a local coastal program and to order the county to adopt ordinances prescribing procedures to be used in issuing coastal development permits.
the trial court,judge james chalfant presiding,bifurcated proceedings.on september,judge chalfant found the commission was the duly authorized body to issue coastal development permits,and the county of los angeles was under no mandatory obligation to take over that authority before its own local coastal program was certified.on february,the court found the commission did not violate petitioners due process rights and substantial evidence supported its enforcement orders.
the hagopians timely appealed from the ensuing judgment.
discussion 
coastal commissiona.standards of review 
public resources code section gives an aggrieved person,defined as anyone who appears at a public hearing of the commission,the right to judicial review by filing a petition for writ of mandate pursuant to code of civil procedure section.the inquiry in such a case shall extend to the questions whether the commission has proceeded without,or in excess of,jurisdiction whether there was a fair trial and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the commission has not proceeded in the manner required by law,the order or decision is not supported by the findings,or the findings are not supported by the evidence.code civ,subd.b.
petitioners contend the commission proceeded without jurisdiction,denied them a fair hearing,and abused its discretion by making findings unsupported by the evidence.respondents disagree with these contentions and argue petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.
where it is claimed that the findings are not supported by the evidence,abuse of discretion is established if the court determines that the findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence.in all other cases,abuse of discretion is established if the court determines that the findings are supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.code civ,subd.c.the reviewing trial court considers all relevant evidence,including that which detracts from the decision.a court may reverse an agency decision only if,based on the evidence before the agency,a reasonable person could not reach the agency conclusion.paoli cal.coastal com.d.in making this determination the court presumes substantial evidence supports the agency decision ross california coastal com.th,and resolves reasonable doubts in favor of the findings and decision topanga for scenic community county of los angeles cal d.our review of the trial court decision is for substantial evidence.fukuda city of angels cal th.

b.the commission jurisdiction 
petitioners first contend the commission lacked jurisdiction to require permits or issue notices of violation and cease and desist and restoration orders because los angeles county,not the commission,is the permitting authority for property in the coastal zone in which petitioners reside.
the coastal act 
in,justice mosk recited the statutory background of the coastal act in recent decades,the people of california have become painfully aware of the deterioration in the quality and availability of recreational opportunities along the california coastline due to the combined factors of an increasing demand for its use and the simultaneous decreasing supply of accessible land in the coastal zone.growing public consciousness of the finite quantity and fragile nature of the coastal environment led to the passage of proposition,an initiative measure entitled the california coastal zone conservation act the coastal act.citation.the coastal act created the california coastal zone conservation commission and directed it to oversee the orderly process of planning for the future development of the california coastline one of the stated purposes of the coastal act was to increase public access to the coast.the coastal act was an interim measure,destined by its own terms to expire at the beginning of.it authorized the interim coastal commission to prepare a study summarizing the progress of planning in the coastal zone and delineating goals and recommendations for the future of california shoreline for the guidance of the legislature.the study,labeled the california coastal plan,was completed in december and submitted to the legislature,which used it as a guide when drafting the california coastal act of the coastal act.citation.the coastal act created the california coastal commission the commission to succeed the california coastal zone conservation commission.pacific legal foundation california coastal com.cal d,fn omitted.
under the coastal act,the commission is required to protect a coastal zone delicately balanced ecosystem,subds.a c,subd.a city of san diego california coastal com.d.to serve this end,a coastal development permit is required for development within a coastal zone,subd.a.development includes grading,removing,dredging,mining,or extraction of any materials and the removal or harvesting of major vegetation other than for agricultural purposes.
the commission has initial authority to issue coastal development permits,subd.c.in addition to this permitting duty,the commission is authorized to notify a landowner it intends to record a notice of violation if it finds evidence of unpermitted development,subd.a.if the property owner objects,the owner may present evidence at a hearing before the commission.if the commission finds substantial evidence of a violation of the coastal act,it may record a notice of violation against the property,subds.b d,h.the commission may also issue an order directing a property owner who has undertaken or is threatening to undertake any activity requiring a permit,without securing the permit,to cease and desist,subd.a and to restore a site to its undeveloped condition.
appellants do not dispute that the commission was initially authorized under the coastal act to issue notices of violation and cease and desist and restoration orders,but argue that authority passed to the county of los angeles long ago or should pass now.
authority to issue coastal development permits may pass to a local government by way of either section or section.
section preparation of a local coastal program comprising a land use plan and a local implementation plan 
the coastal act e ncourage s state and local initiatives and cooperation in preparing procedures to implement coordinated planning and development in the coastal zone,subd.e.toward that end,the coastal act requires each local government lying within a coastal zone to prepare a local coastal program for that portion of the coastal zone within its jurisdiction,subd.a.the parties and case law abbreviate local coastal program as lcp.a local coastal program comprises a local government a land use plans,b zoning ordinances,c zoning district maps,and d within sensitive coastal resources areas,other implementing actions,which,when taken together,meet the requirements of,and implement the provisions and policies of,this division at the local level.the parties and case law abbreviate land use plan or program as lup and local implementation plan as lip.land use plan means the relevant portions of a local government general plan,or local coastal element which are sufficiently detailed to indicate the kinds,location,and intensity of land uses,the applicable resource protection and development policies and,where necessary,a listing of implementing actions.
the commission reviews a proposed local coastal program to determine whether it comports with the policies of the coastal act.after such review,the commission may approve or disapprove the program.city of chula vista superior court d.the commission may approve only a portion of the program,for example the land use portion,but reject the implementation portion,subd.b.once the commission approves both the land use and implementation portions of a local coastal program,the program is certified in full,and development permitting authority passes to the local government,subd.a,subd.d.
anyone who wants to build on his own coastal zone property must obtain a coastal development permit,subd.a.the application for a coastal development permit must be submitted either to the coastal commission or to the local governmental agency in this case,the county of los angeles,depending upon which entity has permitting jurisdiction which,in turn,depends upon whether the local governmental agency has obtained the coastal commission certification of a local coastal program lcp.fn.if a local governmental agency has obtained certification of its lcp,the local agency becomes the permitting authority,subd.d.if certification has not been obtained,the coastal commission is the permitting authority unless the local government establishes procedures for handling permits,which the county of los angeles has not done,subds.b,c,d.healing california coastal com.th.
it is undisputed the commission has refused to certify los angeles county local coastal program for the santa monica mountains area,where petitioners reside.
beginning in,the county submitted three different local coastal programs to the commission covering three distinct areas santa catalina,marina del rey,and the santa monica mountains.a local government may seek certification of coastal programs covering separate geographic units.the commission eventually certified the local coastal programs for catalina and marina del rey,but rejected the santa monica mountains program as inadequate.healing california coastal,supra,th at.the county subsequently submitted a revised version,and o n december,the coastal commission certified the land use plan segment of the local coastal program but the county never submitted the required zoning ordinance and maps,and the local coastal program itself was therefore never certified.as a result,permit jurisdiction was not transferred to the county and remained with the coastal commission.healing california coastal,supra,th at.
in short,although the commission certified the county local land use plan for the santa monica mountains area,it rejected the county local implementation plan.therefore,the santa monica mountains area is as yet under no local coastal program,and the authority to regulate coastal development remains with the commission.
although appellants contend los angeles county breached its mandatory duty under section to prepare a local coastal program for the santa monica mountains area,an issue we address below in part ii,they acknowledge that whatever the reason,authority to regulate coastal development never passed from the commission to the county pursuant to section.respecting the commission,appellants rely instead on section.
a local entity may assume limited interim permitting authority under section prior to certification of its local coastal program under section.
subdivision b of section,enacted in,introduced an interim shortcut to the procedure set forth in section,et.it authorized a local government to establish procedures for the filing,processing,review,modification,approval,or denial of a coastal development permit,subd.b.in,the legislature enacted section,which governs this transfer of authority.section provides in pertinent part,the following 
a prior to the certification of a local coastal program the authority for issuance of coastal development permits shall be delegated to local governments pursuant to the provisions of this section.
b t he authority for issuance of coastal development permits shall be delegated to the respective local governments within days after the effective date of certification of a land use plan 
e the commission shall,following a public hearing and within days after the effective date of this section,adopt minimum standards for public notice,hearing,and appeal procedures to govern local government review of coastal development permit applications within days prior to assumption of authority for issuance of coastal development permits pursuant to this section,the local government shall provide drafts of all procedures for issuance of coastal development permits to the executive director of the commission.delegation of the authority to issue coastal development permits pursuant to subdivision b shall not occur until the local government has provided copies of all the adopted procedures for the issuance of coastal development permits to the executive director of the commission 
f prior to the delegation of authority to issue coastal development permits as provided in subdivision b,a local government,after appropriate notice and hearing,shall adopt an ordinance prescribing the procedures to be used in issuing such coastal development permits 
h the time limits set forth in subdivision b shall be extended,by right,for not more than days if a local government,by resolution of its governing body,so requests.
i the provisions of this section and of any local ordinance enacted pursuant thereto shall have no further force or effect or application after that local government local coastal program has been certified and taken effect pursuant to the provisions of this division.
the interim authority granted by sections and is only in nature,as a local coastal development decision made under it may be appealed as a matter of right to the commission,subd.d.in contrast,an action taken by a local government under the permanent authority described by section,et may be appealed only if it involves a development that exists between the sea and the first public road paralleling the sea or within feet of the inland extent of any beach or of the mean high tideline of the sea where there is no beach,whichever is the greater distance on tidelands,submerged lands,public trust lands,within feet of any wetland,estuary,or stream,or within feet of the top of the seaward face of any coastal bluff or in a sensitive coastal resource area,subd.a.
section in full employs the word shall times,four of which concern us today,two relating to the commission and two to the county of los angeles.subdivision a states the authority for issuance of coastal development permits shall be delegated to local governments.this imposes a duty on the commission to cede permitting authority to local governments.subdivision b states this delegation shall occur within days after certification of a land use plan.it is undisputed the county land use plan for the santa monica mountains area was certified in.
the remaining shalls impose duties on local governments subdivisions e and f state that prior to delegation of permitting authority,the local government shall provide drafts of all procedures for issuance of coastal development permits to the commission and shall adopt an ordinance prescribing the procedures to be used in issuing such coastal development permits.
petitioners argue this mandatory language makes transfer of permitting authority from the commission to the county mandatory rather than discretionary.we conclude,as did judge chalfant,it does not.
when we interpret the meaning of statutes,our fundamental task is to ascertain the aim and goal of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.if we find no ambiguity,we presume that the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citation.if,on the other hand,the statutory language is unclear or ambiguous and permits more than one reasonable interpretation,we may consider various extrinsic aids to help us ascertain the lawmakers intent,including legislative history,public policy,settled rules of statutory construction,and an examination of the evils to be remedied and the legislative scheme encompassing the statute in question.citation.in such circumstances,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the aim and goal of the legislature to promote rather than defeat the statute general purpose and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd and unintended consequences.citation.mcallister california coastal com.th.although we have final responsibility for interpreting a statute,an agency interpretation of its governing statutes is entitled to great weight.gualala festivals committee california coastal com.th.
use of the word shall in a statute does not necessarily create a mandatory duty there may be other factors that indicate that apparent obligatory language was not intended to foreclose a governmental entity or officer exercise of discretion.citations.guzman county of monterey cal th.to determine whether a particular statutory provision is mandatory or directory,the court must ascertain the legislative intent.when the object is to subserve some public purpose,the provision may be held directory or mandatory as will best accomplish that purpose citation,and the courts will look to see whether the provision is of the essence of the thing to be accomplished citation.pulcifer county of alameda cal d.
in section,seemingly mandatory language use of the word shall is sometimes qualified and sometimes not.for example,subdivision e of section states the commission shall adopt minimum standards governing local government review of coastal development permit applications made pursuant to that section.this is an unqualified,unrestricted mandate with which,petitioners acknowledge,the commission has complied.
on the other side,subdivision h of section provides that the time limits set forth in subdivision b shall be extended,by right if a local government so requests.italics added.no one would argue or at least no one does today that the commission must extend time limits set forth in subdivision b whether or not a local government so requests.
as pertinent here,the commission purportedly mandatory duty,set forth in subdivisions a and b,to delegate permitting authority to a local government within days of certification of the government land use plan,is conditioned on the local government first establishing permitting procedures,adopting ordinances prescribing them,and informing the commission,as set forth in subdivisions e and f.but here,los angeles county has neither apprised the commission of any permitting procedures it intends to implement nor adopted an ordinance prescribing them.the commission duty to transfer permitting authority to the county therefore never arose.
petitioners insist that pursuant to the mandatory language of subdivision b,permitting authority transferred to the county of los angeles by operation of law days after certification of its land use plan,despite the county having no procedures to actually issue permits.and they argue the requirement of subdivision e that a local government inform the commission of its permitting procedures is purely informational,and is trumped by the goal of prompt delegation of coastal permitting authority to local governments.petitioners admit the county,having adopted no procedures,of course could not actually issue any coastal development permits,but argue members of the public seeking coastal development permits would pressure the county by litigation or other means to adopt the necessary procedures promptly.
we reject these arguments.although prompt delegation of permitting authority to local agencies may be a desirable goal,the primary purpose of the coastal act is to protect california coastal zones.this object would not be served by ceding permitting authority to a local government unprepared to issue permits.
and as the primary steward of california coastal zones,the commission has more than an informational interest in ensuring proper standards and procedures are in place before it cedes that stewardship to a local government.under petitioners reading of section,the commission authority to enforce the coastal act in the santa monica mountains area lapsed in,and neither the commission nor the county thereafter possessed authority to issue coastal development permits,and may never possess it.and a similar situation could play out in any other coastal area of the state wherever a local land use plan is approved but no implementation measures adopted,jurisdiction to issue development permits would lapse,perhaps forever.
this would be an absurd result.protective statutes are not to be construed in a way that potentially removes all protections.the legislature relies on the commission,not the impulse of members of the public seeking development permits,to protect california coastal zones.that responsibility may pass to a local government within days after its land use plan is certified,but only if the local government has apprised the commission of its permitting procedures and adopted an ordinance setting them forth.the county of los angeles did neither.
petitioners argue that even if permitting authority did not transfer by operation of law to the county of los angeles in,the transfer was accomplished three years later,when the county enacted ordinance,entitled coastal development permits.the argument is without merit.
in,los angeles county adopted ordinance,los angeles county codes lacc chapter,part,to ensure that any development,public or private,within the coastal zone conforms to the policies and programs of the county of los angeles local coastal program land use plans and implementation program.lacc,italics added.ordinance grants the county department of regional planning authority to issue coastal development permits where the proposed development is in conformity with the certified local coastal program.lacc,subd.a,italics added.
ordinance has nothing to do with interim transfer of permitting authority under section and does not satisfy the requirements of that section.
first,as a matter of logic,if the county of los angeles had designed the ordinance to establish its permitting authority in the absence of a certified local coastal program,as section prescribes,it would not state the ordinance was intended to ensure compliance with the local coastal program.lacc.on the contrary,an ordinance adopted pursuant to the authority set forth in section is to have no effect once a local government local coastal program has been certified and taken effect,subd.i the provisions of this section and of any local ordinance enacted pursuant thereto shall have no further force or effect or application after that local government local coastal program has been certified and taken effect pursuant to the provisions of this division.
second,as a practical matter,ordinance grants the department of regional planning no permitting authority.it states the department may issue coastal development permits where the proposed development is in conformity with the certified local coastal program.but los angeles county has no certified local coastal program for the santa monica mountains area.because no proposed development could possibly conform with a nonexistent coastal program,regional planning could issue no permits.
ordinance sets forth coastal development permit procedures only for the catalina and marina del rey zones,which already have local coastal plans.even if ordinance was intended to apply also to the santa monica mountains area and to satisfy subdivision f of section,nothing in the record suggests the county of los angeles ever satisfied subdivision e of that section,which requires that it inform the commission of its interim permitting procedures.
conclusion 
in sum,for coastal development permitting authority to pass from the commission to the county of los angeles the county must either obtain certification of a local coastal program pursuant to section or obtain certification of a land use program and institute interim procedures for issuing permits pursuant to section.the county of los angeles has completed neither of these steps.permitting authority thus remained with the commission,which therefore had jurisdiction to record the notice of violation and cease and desist and restoration orders at issue here.
due process 
petitioners argue they did not receive a fair hearing before the commission,in four respects.first,they argue the hearing was unfair because the commission predetermined the outcome,as evidenced by one of the commissioners referring to petitioners on three occasions as violators rather than alleged violators.
if a record of administrative proceedings shows bias and prejudice upon the part of the administrative body,its decision will not be upheld by the courts.perlman shasta joint.college dist.bd.of trustees d.here,at the beginning of the administrative hearing one of the commissioners referred to petitioners as alleged violators,but later in the proceedings referred to them three times as violators.we think such references result more from absentmindedness than bias.at any rate,the comments of one commissioner are not evidence the commission as a body,which voted unanimously to issue the orders it did,was biased.
petitioners next argue the commission was biased against them because it acted as both prosecutor and judge,in that a commission staff member prosecuted the case,which was adjudicated by the commission itself.we reject the argument,as this common practice comports with due process.of alcoholic beverage control alcoholic beverage control appeals bd.cal th,howitt superior court th,the mere fact that the decision maker or its staff is a more active participant in the factfinding process will not render an administrative procedure unconstitutional.
petitioners argue the commission was prejudiced against them because it uses fines and penalties it collects to fund itself.petitioners cite to no evidence in the administrative record indicating this is true,and at any rate the commission here did not impose any fine or penalty on petitioners.we also note,as did judge chalfant below,that funds derived from commission activities under the coastal act are deposited in the violation remediation account of the coastal conservancy fund until appropriated by the legislature.there is no evidence the commission may control or appropriate incoming funds.
finally,petitioners argue the commission bias is evidenced by the fact that it has never ruled against itself in an enforcement action.the record is devoid of any evidence supporting the argument,which at any rate would not establish bias.
substantial evidence 
petitioners contend the commission findings and orders were unsupported by substantial evidence,as the construction on their property did not constitute development for purposes of the coastal act because it was exempt under an agricultural exception to the coastal act permit requirements development means the removal or harvesting of major vegetation other than for agricultural purposes,and the outbuildings were necessary to that exempt development.the trial court rejected the arguments because petitioners failed to make them at the administrative hearing.we similarly conclude petitioners waived the contentions by failing to raise them at the hearing.
where an administrative remedy is provided by statute,this remedy must be exhausted before the courts will act.abelleira district court of appeal cal d,unnamed physician board of trustees th,failure to exhaust administrative remedies prevents a party from seeking relief through administrative mandamus.this is not a matter of judicial discretion,but is a fundamental rule of procedure laid down by courts of last resort,followed under the doctrine of stare decisis,and binding upon all courts.citations.citizens for open government city of lodi th.the rationale for the rule is that an agency is entitled to learn the contentions of interested parties before litigation arises,so it will have an opportunity to address the contentions and perhaps render litigation unnecessary.mani brothers real estate group city of los angeles th.to advance this purpose an interested party must present the exact issue to the administrative agency that is later asserted during litigation or on appeal.ibid.general objections,generalized references or unelaborated comments will not suffice.porterville citizens for responsible hillside development city of porterville th.t he objections must be sufficiently specific so that the agency has the opportunity to evaluate and respond to them.citation.id.at.
the petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that the issues raised in the judicial proceeding were first raised at the administrative level.citation.porterville citizens for responsible hillside development city of porterville,supra,th at.
as noted,petitioners made no substantive showing at the hearing,objecting primarily on due process and jurisdictional grounds.petitioners argued,without explanation,that the coastal development permit issued to rollins in authorized their landscaping years later and installation of vineyards was permissible under unspecified los angeles county zoning regulations,but presented no evidence supporting any of their contentions,instead indicating they stood upon prior communications with commission staff.had petitioners made before the commission the arguments they attempt to make here concerning prior agricultural use,the commission,which has primary authority and expertise to pass on such matters,would have addressed them.we are in no position to examine the historical use of petitioners property to determine whether their vineyards qualify for any particular agricultural exemption as a matter of law.
declaratory and injunctive relief 
petitioners sought declaratory,injunctive and mandamus relief below compelling the commission to adopt procedures that will bring about the certification of the county local coastal program.they argued the coastal act obligates
