the issue before us is whether a taxpayer expenses for environmental of its industrial sites,mandated by changes in environmental law,qualify for the beneficial tax treatment afforded by section of the internal revenue code.section applies when a taxpayer must restore a substantial amount of money,which the taxpayer had received in a prior tax year under a claim of right.section allows the taxpayer to take a deduction in the current tax year for the amount of taxes the taxpayer would have saved if the amount restored had not been included in its reported gross income in the prior tax year.
we hold that alcoa environmental expenses,incurred in the tax year for pollution created in past years,do not qualify as restored moneys under section.
factual and procedural background 
the facts of this case are simple and mostly undisputed.alcoa is a producer of aluminum and aluminum products.from to,alcoa operations produced waste byproducts,which alcoa disposed of during the ordinary course of business.alcoa claims that it included disposal costs for these waste byproducts in its cost of goods sold cogs calculations for the relevant years,thereby excluding them from its reported income during those years 
after the enactment of new environmental laws,including the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla,state and federal agencies found that a number of alcoa industrial sites were polluted and ordered alcoa to conduct environmental at these sites.as a result,in alcoa expended substantial funds on environmental remediation.
in its tax return,alcoa claimed these costs as a tax deduction the internal revenue service irs did not challenge that treatment.subsequently,however,alcoa filed with the irs a claim for a refund of over twelve million dollars.alcoa maintained that under section,alcoa was entitled to enjoy not the tax benefit yielded by the deduction,but rather the much larger benefit due to the then generally higher corporate tax rates of a reduction of its tax liability.the irs disallowed the refund and alcoa filed this action in the district court.
after discovery the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court noted that a practically identical case had recently been decided in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia against the reynolds metal company.see reynolds united states,d.finding itself in full agreement with the opinion of the virginia court,the district court adopted that opinion as its own and granted summary judgment in favor of the government.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under a,which provides that district courts have original jurisdiction of civil actions against the united states for the recovery of any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected.we have jurisdiction of this appeal under.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard the district court applied.doe county of centre,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact to be resolved and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,d.
iii.discussion 
the issue in this case is whether alcoa expenditure for environmental remediation qualifies for the beneficial tax treatment allowed by section.if it does not qualify,as the government argues,alcoa can reduce its tax liability for the year only to the extent it deducts its remedial expenses from its income which will be taxed at the corporate tax rate of.if alcoa environmental expenses do qualify under section,however,alcoa is entitled to a deduction in equal to what it would have saved in taxes in the years by excluding the remediation expenses from its reported income for those prior tax years this treatment would be beneficial to alcoa because corporate tax rates were generally far higher in than in.for the reasons we set out below,we conclude that the environmental remediation expenses that alcoa incurred in do not qualify for beneficial tax treatment under section.alcoa proposed interpretation of the statute,while artful,is not convincing.
a.the claim of right doctrine and section 
the united states tax code operates on an annual accounting system,under which each year tax must be definitively calculable at the end of the tax year.united states skelly oil,d.under the claim of right doctrine,i f a taxpayer receives earnings under a claim of right and without restriction as to its disposition,he has received income which he is required to return,even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the money,and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent.id.at.internal quotation omitted.thus,a taxpayer must include in his tax return even those items of income which are subject to competing claims,so long as he has full control of those moneys at the end of the tax year.
for many years,if a taxpayer filed a tax return but later was forced to relinquish some of the reported income,the taxpayer would be entitled to a deduction in the year of repayment the taxes due for the year of receipt would not be affected.skelly oil,at.this system had the potential to create inequities because a taxpayer might be forced to pay taxes on the item of income at a certain tax rate and take a deduction at a lower rate because of an intervening change either in the taxpayer tax bracket or in the tax rates themselves.id.at.the case which focused attention on these inequities is united states lewis.in,the taxpayer in lewis had received a bonus from his employer,on which he had properly paid income taxes in the year of receipt.two years later,in,a state court ordered lewis to repay his employer part of that bonus because it had been improperly computed.until payment of the judgment in,lewis had at all times claimed and used the full bonus amount unconditionally as his own,in the good faith though mistaken belief that he was entitled to the whole bonus.id.at.the government argued that lewis should deduct the amount he returned to his employer as a loss from his tax return lewis wished to recompute his tax for.the court sided with the government and held that under the claim of right doctrine,the tax year in which the contested amount was received could not be reopened,whether this would result in an advantage or disadvantage to a taxpayer.id.at.
in order to correct the inequities made apparent by the lewis decision,congress enacted section,which,as an alternative to the deduction in the year of repayment which prior law allowed,permits certain taxpayers to recompute their taxes for the year of receipt.skelly oil,at.section is designed to put the taxpayer in essentially the same position he would have been in had he never received the returned income in the first place.dominion,united states,cir.under the title computation of tax where taxpayer restores substantial amount held under claim of right,section provides in relevant part 
a general rule.if 
an item was included in gross income for a prior taxable year or years because it appeared that the taxpayer had an unrestricted right to such item 
a deduction is allowable for the taxable year because it was established after the close of such prior taxable year or years that the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right to such item or to a portion of such item and 
the amount of such deduction exceeds,then the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable years shall be the lesser of the following 
the tax for the taxable year computed with such deduction or 
an amount equal to 
reported below,a the tax for the taxable year computed without such deduction,minus 
b the decrease in tax under this chapter or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws for the prior taxable year or years which would result solely from the exclusion of such item or portion thereof from gross income for such prior taxable year or years.
a.the net effect of the provision is that the taxpayer can recompute his taxes for the year in which he originally received the money,excluding from his income that amount which he later repaid.reynolds,d at.by allowing the taxpayer the choice between a simple deduction and a recalculation of the prior year tax liability,section ensures that any change in tax rates or in the taxpayer tax bracket is a tax neutral event with respect to the disputed item of income.
for a taxpayer to qualify for the beneficial tax treatment of section,the taxpayer must have appeared to have an unrestricted right to an item included in gross income for a prior taxable year,must have included the item in income under a claim of right it must be established after the close of that prior year that the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right to the item the taxpayer must be entitled to deduct the amount of the item in the year in which the taxpayer restored the item and the amount of the deduction must exceed.dominion,at the taxpayer bears the burden of proving his eligibility for section treatment.kappel united states,cir.
in the district court,the government conceded as it does here that alcoa has met the third and fourth requirements of section because it was entitled to a deduction in that exceeded the government contended,however,that alcoa could not satisfy the first or second requirement for eligibility under the provision,inclusion of an item in gross income under claim of right,and later determination that the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right to that item restoration of that item.the government argued that alcoa could not characterize as an item included in gross income the funds it did not spend in on additional waste disposal activities.the government position was that gross income means gross receipts gross income does not include money the taxpayer failed to spend.alcoa disagreed,reasoning its gross income for the years in question was overstated because alcoa cost of goods sold was understated.
the government response to this argument was that,even if the amounts not spent by alcoa could qualify as an item included in gross income,the claim of right doctrine applied only when the taxpayer was subject to an adverse claim at the time it included the item in gross or not the taxpayer was aware of the adverse claim at the time of the initial return.in the government view,section does not apply where the taxpayer had an actual and not simply an apparent right to the item,but later lost its right to the item through an intervening change in factual circumstances.under this theory,even if alcoa insufficient waste disposal expenses could qualify as an item included in gross income,alcoa had an an to the funds it saved by failing to conduct proper waste disposal.this is so because there was no rival claim to those funds.alcoa replied that something can be apparent and also be true in alcoa view,all a taxpayer must show to qualify under section is that the taxpayer lost the right to the item at some point before claiming the deduction 
the district court,pursuant to the reynolds decision,grudgingly accepted alcoa argument that its insufficient environmental expenditures during the period amounted to the inclusion of an item in gross income under an apparent claim of right.see reynolds,d at noting that the taxpayer had skillfully the definition of gross income for its own means.as for the requirement of a determination in a later year that the taxpayer did not have a claim of right to that item,however,the district court held that alcoa could not satisfy it and therefore could not avail itself of the beneficial treatment of section 
b.the same circumstances,terms and conditions test 
we agree with the district court that alcoa expenditures in do not qualify as the restoration of income to which alcoa found it did not have a claim of right.how then can a taxpayer satisfy section requirement that it was established after the close of a prior taxable year or years that the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right to an item of income or a portion of such item a.the district court,adopting reynolds,held that a taxpayer later arising obligation to remedy environmental ills is not a determination that the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right to an item of income or to a portion of such item,as required by the statute,because the taxpayer had not demonstrated restoration of an item of income to an entity from whom the income was received or to whom the item of income should have been paid.reynolds,d at see also kappel,at t he requirement that a legal obligation exist to restore funds before a deduction is allowable under the claim of right doctrine is derived from the language of a of the code.
on appeal,alcoa argues that,in order to take advantage of section,it needs to show only that it discovered it could not keep the money it had not spent on more effective in because after the enactment of cercla and other environmental laws it was forced to spend the money on remediation efforts.the government responds that this interpretation would extend the benefits of section far beyond its intended scope and that a taxpayer must show it has restored the amount at issue to another claimant with actual right to it.the government urges that a taxpayer is entitled to section treatment if the repayment arose from the same circumstances,terms and conditions as the original payment of the item to the taxpayer.see,kraft united states,cir dominion,at cinergy united states,blanton comm r.in other words,there must be a substantive nexus between the right to the income at the time of receipt and the subsequent circumstances necessitating a refund.dominion,united states,d,aff,dominion.
alcoa claim fails under this same circumstances,terms,and conditions test.even if we were to credit alcoa theory about its new obligation to engage in in,that it is equivalent to the discovery that it did not have a claim of right on the money it saved by not engaging in more extensive environmental efforts in is clear that the new obligations did not arise from the same circumstances,terms,and conditions as the initial failure to spend additional funds on environmental.rather,the obligations were created by new circumstances,terms,and conditions,namely,by an intervening change in environmental legislation.there is no substantive nexus that can be recognized for our purposes between the waste disposal expenses alcoa did not incur in to and its expenses in.
taxpayers claims have been rejected in analogous situations.for instance,in cinergy,the court of federal claims held that a utility company refund to current customers of payments for deferred taxes made by former customers arose from subsequent and unrelated events.at.the refund did not arise from a recognition that the amounts originally collected were excessive or otherwise unneeded rather,customers began protesting the utility rates and,faced with an investigation into the rates reasonableness,the utility proposed a reduction but paired it with a plan for accelerated reversal of certain tax reserves so as to reduce the effect of the impending rate reduction on its equity.id.the court found that the obligation to reverse the tax reserves did not arise from the same circumstances,terms,and conditions as the original accumulation of the reserves,but from the later dispute with customers and wrote that nothing in the case law suggests that the requisite nexus is satisfied simply because the receipt of income and its later return both derived from the same regulatory process.id.here,the obligation to clean up certain undoubtedly connected in some way to the earlier polluting not arise from some inherent fault in alcoa waste management choices.the moneys not spent did not fall under the pall of a latent competing claim.instead,the need to expend money for remediation arose from the more stringent regulations that were later enacted.
we conclude then,as the government proposes,that because alcoa expenditure of funds in was not the restoration of particular moneys to the rightful owner and did not arise from the same circumstances,terms,and conditions as alcoa original acquisition of the income,alcoa cleanup expenditures do not qualify for the beneficial tax treatment pro
