utah environmental congress filed suit in federal district court challenging the forest service approval of the trout slope west timber sale project in the ashley national forest.uec brought its suit pursuant to of the administrative procedure act,arguing that the forest service approval of the project was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.see a citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d.specifically,uec argued that the forest service failed to adequately monitor the colorado river cutthroat trout a management indicator species,that it improperly assessed the project impact on trees and that it failed to comply with standards,that it failed to maintain water quality standards,and that it failed to assess the cumulative effects of the project on the colorado river cutthroat trout and water quality.
we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to.for the reasons stated below,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
background 
the ashley national forest consists of acres of land in northeastern utah and wyoming.the trout slope west project the project area comprises acres of land in the vernal ranger district of the ashley national forest in utah.the project area includes portions of three watersheds and is covered with pine,spruce,fir,and aspen trees.as a result of a beetle infestation,a significant number of trees in the project area are dead or fallen.the project was designed to clear out these dead or fallen trees,recover their economic value,and improve habitat within the project area.the project includes a number of mitigation measures to protect the watersheds from increased and erosion resulting from the trees removal.
the forest service began planning the project in.in february,it issued a draft environmental impact statement eis and sought public comment.at the same time,it issued a biological evaluation and biological assessment addressing the project expected impact on sensitive,threatened,and endangered species.the assessment concluded that the project impact on colorado river cutthroat trout crct would be minimal.after reviewing public comments,the forest service issued a record of decision rod and approved the project on july.
the rod discussed the project expected impact on water quality,stream channels,fisheries,and other aquatic resources.it concluded that the project adverse effects would be adequately mitigated by requiring that no trees be removed within feet of any stream,or within feet of any other stream,pond,lake,reservoir,or wetland.the rod also concluded that the project was consistent with the ashley national forest plan forest plan standards for trees and that it would not have a significant impact on the amount of trees in the forest.
utah environmental congress uec challenged the approval of the project through administrative review.those appeals were denied.uec then filed its complaint in the district court under of the apa,alleging that the forest service approval of the project violated the national forest management act nfma and its implementing regulations,the national environmental policy act nepa,the forest plan,the forest service manual,and department of agriculture regulations.the district court affirmed the forest service approval of the project.
discussion 
i.the federal regulatory frameworka.national forest management act 
the forest service is an agency within the department of agriculture.it manages the national forest system under a multitude of federal statutes and regulations.among those statutes is the nfma,which is primarily concerned with planning.it directs the forest service to develop a land and resource management plan for each unit of national forest.see a,e.
there are two levels of planning under the nfma program planning and project planning.see ohio forestry sierra club,d silverton snowmobile club forest,cir.program planning refers to the forest service creation of general,planning goals set out in a forest plan.see utah envtl.cong.bosworth,cir hereinafter uec iii because the forest service must account for a variety of interests,each forest plan contemplates that the forest will be used for multiple purposes,including outdoor recreation,range,timber,watershed,wildlife and fish,and wilderness.id.citing e.project planning refers to the forest service approval or disapproval of specific projects that implement and consequently must comply with the forest plan.id.citing i.
the secretary of agriculture has promulgated a number of regulations that set forth the procedures for planning under the nfma.the first set of regulations relevant to this case was implemented in part.see,and included provisions directing the forest service,as part of its planning process,to identify and monitor management indicator species the regulations required the forest service to collect population trend data for management indicator species.they also directed that f ish and wildlife habitat shall be managed to maintain viable populations of existing native and desired vertebrate species id.the regulations were superceded in november with new,substantially revised regulations.see,codified at part.the regulations included several transition provisions specifying when the substantive planning provisions of the new regulations would become effective.those transition provisions also set transition planning standards to govern forest plan amendments and project decisions during the transition period.uec iii,at.
for forest plan revisions and amendments adopted during the transition period,agency officials could elect to use the substantive planning standards of either the regulations or the regulations.see b.for project decisions made during the transition period,however,the transition rules directed that agency officials consider the best available science in implementing and,if appropriate,amending the current plan.id.a,d the transition period for project decisions was set to expire on november,bringing other substantive provisions of the regulations into effect.see id.d.however,that transition period was extended for projects by an interim final rule issued on september.that interim final rule extended the transition period for projects until january,when the department of agriculture replaced the regulations with a new final rule.id.at see also.thus,project decisions made from november,to january,that implemented,forest plans,were to be made only under the best available science standard.see.n either the remainder of the planning regulations nor any of the regulations were binding on decisions during this period.ecology,forest,cir.
b.the ashley national forest plan 
the forest plan was adopted in and is intended to guide all natural resource management activities and establish management standards and guidelines for the ashley national forest.ii.at.the plan designates twelve management indicator species for the ashley national forest,one of which is the crct.id.at.the forest plan includes a provision directing the forest service to 
complete an inventory of management indicator species on the forest to determine their occurrence,abundance,distribution,habitat requirements,and populations trends.
with respect to crct,the forest plan gives specific directives for how the species should be monitored.it directs that crct be monitored using population estimates and that such estimates be conducted and reported every five years.id.at.the plan states that further evaluation of crct populations will be necessary,or a change in management direction could occur,if there is a reduction in population or if the biotic condition index drops below.id.at.
the forest plan also contains standards governing trees.it directs the forest service to d esignate and protect old growth areas for dependent species and provides that o ld growth should be a minimum of contiguous acres and have old growth characteristics.id.at.the plan specifically directs the forest service to r etain of area in old growth conditions at all times id.the forest plan does not define old growth or specify a method for its identification.for purposes of this project,the forest service defined old growth by using three attributes identified in hamilton,united states department of agriculture,characteristics of old growth forests in the intermountain region.
c.the national environmental policy act 
the nepa requires federal agencies to examine and disclose the environmental impacts of their proposed actions.baltimore gas natural res.def.council,d.the nepa imposes only procedural requirements and does not mandate results.robertson methow valley citizens council,d.relevant to this case,the nepa requires federal agencies to prepare an eis for all major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment c under the nepa implementing regulations,an agency prepares a draft eis in which it evaluates the proposed action and its direct,indirect,and cumulative impact on the environment.specifically,the nepa requires that an eis provide cumulative effects analysis based on actual data.the nepa defines cumulative effects as the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions id.
in the draft stage,the agency must compare the proposed action to other reasonable alternatives,including taking no action at all.id.after a period of public comment and review,the agency responds to any comments,makes appropriate changes,and circulates a final draft of the eis.id.the agency ultimately adopts a course of action by issuing an rod.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court decision affirming approval of the trout slope west project de novo.see olenhouse commodity credit,cir.neither the nfma,the nepa,nor the forest plan provides for a private right of action,so our review of the forest service decision to approve the project is governed by of the apa,which allows us to set aside an agency action only if the action is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a uec iii,at.under this standard,we must consider whether the agency decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.overton park,at.an agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or if the decision is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.
although our inquiry must be thorough,the forest service decision is entitled to a presumption of regularity.see overton park,at.this deference is especially strong where the challenged decision involve s technical or scientific matters within the agency area of expertise.uec iii,at citing marsh or.natural res.council,d.additionally,we give great deference to the forest service interpretation of its own regulations,and we will only reject those interpretations when they are unreasonable,plainly erroneous,or inconsistent with the regulation plain meaning.bar mk ranches yuetter,cir.thus,the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one and we are not empowered to substitute our judgment for that of the agency.overton park,at.
iii.uec challenges to approval of the trout slope west project 
a.the monitoring of crct 
uec argues that the decision to approve the project was covered by the planning regulations of the nfma and their specific rules regarding the monitoring of indicator species.it argues that those regulations required the forest service to provide quantitative population trend data for all indicator species including the crct.see and.it argues that the forest service never gathered actual population trend data,but instead relied on stream inventory and stream condition data as a proxy.the forest service argues that it was not required to comply with the regulations,but that it had only to use the best available science as required by the transition regulations.the district court found that the regulations applied,and it affirmed the forest service approval of the project under those standards.uec richmond,tc,wl,at.
at the onset,we note that uec has established the required nexus between the forest service monitoring of crct and the project approval to give it standing.we may only review a monitoring program to the extent it bears on the approval of a particular project.uec iii,at.the forest service argues that despite its monitoring of crct,the project impacts on crct are so minimal,that deficiencies in crct monitoring are irrelevant.aplee.br.at.in uec iii,however,we stated that population trend data is necessary to evaluate a proposed project actual effect on the as where a proposed project will create a significant impact on the environment,thus requiring an eis id.at.
an eis was issued in this case.additionally,the parties agree that crct are present in the project area.furthermore,the project contains a number of mitigation measures designed to reduce negative effects the project would otherwise have on crct populations.without data on crct populations,the forest service could not have fully evaluated whether the project mitigation measures were adequate.nor could it evaluate the efficacy of those mitigation measures in the future.taken together,these facts suggest that adequate monitoring data would be necessary to evaluate the project effect on the environment as part of the initial administrative approval.
as previously discussed,the regulations were entirely superceded by the transition regulations with respect to project decisions implementing,forest plans.the forest plan in this case was adopted in the project rod was issued on july,during the transition period.accordingly,the decision to approve the project was governed by the best available science standard,not the specific monitoring requirements of the regulations.see uec iv,at.
uec argues that,despite the transitional best available science standard,the forest service was bound to follow the monitoring requirements because those requirements were incorporated into the forest plan and spelled out in the forest service manual.to be sure,the forest service is required to comply with existing forest plans,see i,which here includes the requirement to monitor certain management indicator species,including the crct.moreover,the forest service manual is useful in identifying the forest service standard policies and practices.however,the forest plan did not expressly reference the regulations then codified at in adopting requirements to monitor management indicator species designated by the plan furthermore,the forest plan expressly stated that the administration and management of the forest will be guided by existing and future laws,regulations,policies and standards and guidelines.ii.at emphasis added.we made clear in uec iii that such language in a forest plan does not incorporate the monitoring regulations.see at and.therefore,the forest service is obligated to apply the new regulations,see ecology,at,and is also bound to apply the terms of the forest plan,including the obligation to monitor the management indicator species listed in the plan,to the extent the plan does not conflict with the best available science standard 
while significant portions of the parties briefs discuss whether the forest service met the monitoring regulations,neither brief discusses whether the forest service planning actually complied with the best available science standard.indeed,there is no evidence that the forest service intended to make use of the best available science when approving the project.see richmond,wl,at.thus,we are faced with the same scenario we encountered in ecology center.
in ecology center,the district court analyzed the forest service approval of a logging project for compliance with the monitoring regulations.see ecology,russell,d.the district court found that the forest service had complied with the regulations and that its approval of the project was not arbitrary and capricious.id.at.while the forest service argued on appeal that the transitional best available science standard governed,there was no evidence that it actually considered the best available science standard when approving the project.ecology,at.although ecology center never argued that the forest service failed to use the best available science,we vacated and remanded the forest service approval of the project,holding that the forest service failure to consider or mention the best available science standard rendered its approval of the project arbitrary and capricious.id.at citing forest watch forest,cir.
in this case,there is no evidence that the forest service utilized the best available science standard in approving the trout slope west project.indeed,the rod approving the project never used the phrase best available science,much less considered the substantive quality of the science utilized in approving the project.see iii.at.even on appeal,the forest service fails to explain how the science it utilized was in fact the best available science.
the fact that uec never argued that the forest service failed to use the best available science standard brings into conflict two established lines of precedent.the first is that we will not,absent manifest injustice,vacate or reverse a district court decision based on an argument not made by the plaintiff.see sussman patterson,cir.the second,is that we may not affirm an agency decision based on reasoning that the agency itself never considered.see ecology,at citing sec chenery.forest watch,at.this conflict was resolved by ecology center and uec iv which dictate that we must vacate the forest service approval of the trout slope west project for failure to consider the best available science standard.see uec iv,at ecology,at we offer no opinion as to whether the forest service monitoring of crct complied with the best available science standard,the forest plan,or the forest service manual 
on remand,as discussed above,the forest service will be governed by the requirements in the current forest plan and the most recent version of the nfma implementing regulations,which were adopted in.those regulations require the forest service to 
document how the best available science was taken into account in the planning process within the context of the issues being considered evaluate and disclose substantial uncertainties in that science evaluate and disclose substantial risks associated with plan components based on that science and document that the science was appropriately interpreted and applied.
a.as we stated in ecology center,the forest service need not necessarily collect new data,but it must seek out and consider all existing scientific evidence relevant to the decision and determine which data are the most accurate,reliable,and relevant.at internal quotations and citations omitted.after considering this best available science,the forest service may then issue a new rod on the trout slope west project.
water quality standards 
uec argues that the trout slope west project will damage water quality and thereby violate the regulations and the forest plan.specifically,the regulations mandate that there should be no management practices that cause detrimental changes in water temperature,chemical composition,or deposits of sediment,all of which adversely affect water conditions.see e.similarly,the forest plan requires the forest service to m aintain or improve current stream channel stability ratings,ii.at,and to maintain a biotic condition index of at least in all streams,id.at.uec argues that the project will adversely affect all of these standards.the forest service responds that the substantive standard of e did not apply to the project approval because the regulations were superceded in.regardless,it argues it complied with the regulations and the forest plan requirements concerning stream channel stability and the biotic condition index.
as is clear from our discussion above,the substantive standard of e did not apply to the project approval because the regulations were superceded in.again,however,there is no evidence that the forest service considered the best available science concerning water quality.consequently,as with the monitoring of crct,the forest service must reevaluate the project effect on water quality utilizing the best available science as required by the current nfma regulations.for the same reasons stated above,we offer no opinion as to whether the forest service evaluation of water quality complied with the best available science standard and the forest plan.see supra.
uec remaining challenges 
while the forest service failure to consider the best available science standard causes us to remand the case for an order vacating the project approval,two other substantial arguments regarding whether the forest service complied with the forest plan and the nepa were raised by uec and adequately briefed and addressed by the parties.as these issues would likely be reargued in a subsequent appeal,we elect to address them now and so narrow the scope of our remand order 
the forest plan requires that the forest service designate and protect old growth areas for dependent species.old growth should be a minimum of contiguous acres and have old growth characteristics and the forest service must r etain of area in old growth conditions at all times ii.at.the forest plan does not define old growth,so in order for the trout slope west project to comply with the standards,the forest service was required to identify a method to delimit what old growth means in the ashley national forest.as previously noted,the eis and project rod referenced the measurement criteria identified in hamilton.that publication defines old growth based on six criteria for live trees and four criteria for dead trees.
uec argues that the forest service only relied upon stand exam data in an attempt to meet standards adopted for the project.uec argues that the stand exam data considered only three of the six criteria for live trees and no criteria for dead trees.consequently,uec argues that no meaningful conclusion of what areas constitute old growth can be extrapolated from stand exam data.aplt.br.at.uec argues it was arbitrary and capricious for the forest service not to use all the standards it referenced from hamilton.
additionally,uec argues that the forest service failed to apply the contiguous acre standard.it argues that a stand of trees could qualify as old growth under hamilton,but not under the forest plan which requires contiguous acres for old growth.uec argues that the forest service had tree stand data for only of the management area encompassing the project.of that acres the forest service designated acres as old growth,which constitute roughly of the management area.however,of the acres designated as old growth,the forest service admits that only acres occur in stands greater than acres.thus,uec argues that only of the management area was reserved for old growth,not the that was required.
however,hamilton indicates that the three criteria actually used by the forest service for the project are required minimums.iii.at.thus,the forest service argues that it was not necessary to consider all ten hamilton criteria,when three are sufficient.furthermore,the forest service argues that it never adopted all the hamilton criteria in the first place,because the eis specifically notes that the hamilton criteria are useful for classifying individual stands of old growth,but are not a management requirement and do not address old growth retention across a landscape.id.at emphasis added.the eis went on to note stands that meet hamilton minimum old growth characteristics can be estimated from common stand exam data.id.emphasis added.even so,the forest service considered additional criteria,aside from the three hamilton criteria,including data on stand composition,stem density,roadless areas,and past harvest activities.i aplee.at.given the forest plan lack of direction on what constitutes old growth,and the forest service expertise in this area,we determine that its use of the three minimum hamilton criteria,along with the common stand exam data and the additional criteria,is reasonable in these circumstances.
