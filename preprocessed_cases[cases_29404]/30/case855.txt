tribe of western shoshone of nevada,a indian tribe the tribe,the western shoshone defense project wsdp and great basin mine watch gbmw collectively,plaintiffs appeal the district court denial of their motion for summary judgment,and the grant of summary judgment to the department of the interior doi,the bureau of land management blm,several officers of the blm,and intervenor cortez gold mines,cortez collectively,defendants plaintiffs contend that the blm approval of cortez amendment to a plan of operations for an existing mineral exploration project in nevada violated the national environmental policy act nepa,the national historic preservation act nhpa,and the federal land policy and management act flpma.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we affirm the district court with respect to plaintiffs nhpa and flpma claims,and we reverse and remand for further proceedings with respect to one of their nepa claims.
factual and procedural background 
this appeal involves cortez proposal to amend the plan of operations for an existing mineral exploration project,the horse unified exploration project the hc cuep,located in lander and eureka counties in northeastern nevada the blm approved the original plan of operations for the in pursuant to the plan of operations,cortez conducted exploration activities in a area designated for the project project area.
the,in its original and amended plans,is a phased exploration project.phase i includes drill sites,as close as feet apart,to determine what minerals are in the target areas.depending on what cortez discovers,it may move into phase ii of the,in which there are about drill sites,with three or more drill rigs working in close proximity to one another.finally,if cortez chooses to continue exploring,it may move into phase iii,in which cortez can use approximately drill holes within the phase ii drill sites footprints.
under the original plan of operations,cortez was permitted to disturb a total of acres of land within the entire project area over the course of all three phases of the project.in july,cortez proposed an amendment to the plan of operations the amendment that would permit cortez to disturb a total of acres throughout the project times the amount approved by the blm for the original project.under the amendment,cortez exploration would proceed according to the same phased operations as outlined in the original plan of operations,and cortez could not disturb more than acres at any given time.cortez estimated that the as amended would last five years.
cortez exploration activities under the represent only a small part of a long history of exploration and mining activities in this area of nevada.active mining operations have existed since the,and the mining industry continues to explore the area for further mineral deposits.in addition to the,cortez currently operates a number of mines in the area,and cortez has plans to develop in the near future two mineral deposits as the hills mine project the hills project 
after cortez proposed the amendment in july,the blm prepared an environmental assessment ea pursuant to nepa,assessing the environmental and cultural resources of the project area and the potential impacts on the environment.the ea tiered to,and thus incorporated,previous environmental impact statements and environmental assessments,including those for the original and for the south pipeline project,another mining project located near the project area 
although miners have been mining this area for generations,native americans have been there much longer.according to their oral history,and other western shoshone tribes have inhabited this area since time immemorial,and their religion and culture is inextricably linked to the landscape of the area.the project area is located on their ancestral lands mount tenabo,located within the project area,is considered a traditional locus of power and source of life for the western shoshone,and figures in creation stories and world renewal.the top of mount tenabo is used by the western shoshone for prayer and meditation and although mining activities have impeded this practice,the association of the top of the mountain to western shoshone beliefs,customs,and practices remains.the project area also contains many pinyon pine trees,a source of pine nuts that were once a key component of the western shoshone diet and remain a focal point of western shoshone culture and ceremony.although mining has impeded the collection of pine nuts,remnant stands of pinyon pine continue to be used as traditional family gathering areas by contemporary western shoshone.finally,because of the tribe burial traditions,the ancestors of the western shoshone are likely buried throughout the project area.
as a result of the western shoshone undisputed connection to the land,the blm has consulted with the tribe,as required by nepa and the nhpa,about sites of cultural and religious significance in areas slated for exploration and mining,including areas covered by the,its predecessor project the horse canyon exploration project,and the pediment project.this consultation led the blm to designate two sites within the project area as properties of cultural and religious importance or pcris that are eligible for inclusion on the national register of historic places horse canyon and the top of mount tenabo and the white cliffs of mount tenabo.
the blm sent a letter to the tribe about the amendment one year after the blm received cortez proposal in july.the blm noted that there was already extensive documentation of traditional,cultural,and spiritual use sites within or near the project area,but asked the tribe for help in identifying any additional concerns and in developing any alternatives or methods that might eliminate or reduce potential adverse impacts.the tribe did not respond to this letter.
about one month after soliciting the tribe input,the blm submitted the draft ea for public comment on september,and sent the tribe a copy to review.although the blm attempted to contact the tribe by telephone in the middle of september to ascertain whether the tribe would be commenting on the ea,the tribe did not respond to those calls.wsdp and gbmw,however,did contact the blm in early october regarding the proposed action and requested information on the blm consultation with the western shoshone and the location of drill holes,access roads,and other details of the project.the blm responded on october,but did not provide the organizations with the requested project details.
the blm could not provide the organizations with the precise locations of the project exploration activities because they were not specified in the proposed amendment plan of operations.instead,the blm conditionally approved the amendment,requiring cortez to provide detailed maps prior to activities and to follow specific avoidance measures to protect cultural resources.the blm issued a decision record dr and finding of no significant impact fonsi together a on october.
plaintiffs petitioned the state director of the blm for review of the blm on november.after granting plaintiffs request for review,the state director met with the tribal chairman,counsel,and other representatives from the tribe,wsdp,and gbmw,and also considered arguments from cortez.after completing his review,the state director affirmed a modified version of the that imposed additional mitigation measures.one such modification was an exclusion zone protocol to protect pcris eligible for inclusion on the national register of historic places.
dissatisfied with the state director modified,plaintiffs sought judicial review of the blm action in may by filing suit against the doi,the blm,and several blm officers under the administrative procedure act apa.see et.the district court subsequently granted cortez motion to intervene.ultimately,the parties filed for summary judgment.concluding that the blm had complied with nepa,the nhpa,and the flpma,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.plaintiffs timely appealed.

national environmental policy act 
we first consider plaintiffs argument that the blm approval of the amendment violated nepa.nepa imposes a procedural requirement to ensure the agency will have detailed information on significant environmental impacts when it makes its decisions and to guarantee that this information will be available to a larger audience.inland empire pub.lands council forest,cir.the nepa procedures used by agencies must insure that environmental information is available to public officials and citizens before decisions are made and before actions are taken.b.the nepa process is intended to help public officials make decisions that are based on understanding of environmental consequences,and take actions that protect,restore,and enhance the environment.c.pursuant to these goals,nepa requires federal agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement eis for all major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment c.an agency may first prepare an ea,however,to determine whether it must prepare an eis or may issue a fonsi.a.if the agency issues a fonsi,then it may proceed with the proposed action.wildlands ctr.bureau of land,cir.
here,the blm prepared an ea,concluded on the basis of the ea findings that the amendment would not significantly affect the environment,and issued a.as noted above,after plaintiffs objected,the blm state director affirmed the with modifications that imposed an exclusion zone protocol,in addition to the avoidance measures imposed in the original,to protect pcris eligible for listing on the national register.plaintiffs challenge the blm modified on the grounds that the blm failed to take a hard look at the amendment cultural and environmental impacts because it approved all three phases of the amendment without obtaining sufficient information about each particular phase of exploration activities the blm did not conduct sufficient analysis of reasonable alternatives and the blm did not conduct sufficient analysis of cumulative impacts.we consider these arguments in turn.
failure to take a hard look at cultural and environmental impacts 
plaintiffs argue that the blm failed to take a hard look at the amendment,effects on western shoshone cultural it approved all three phases of the amendment without knowing the precise locations of the project activities,such as drill sites,access roads,and support facilities.plaintiffs contend that,without these details,the blm neither conducted a hard look analysis of the project,nor adequately informed the public of the potential impacts of the project,as nepa requires.the blm and cortez argue that,in light of the exploratory nature of the project,the blm analysis and decision comply with nepa.they argue that the blm sufficiently analyzed the potential impact that the project could have and imposed avoidance and mitigation measures that account for any unpredictable impacts on cultural resources.
although we have not previously reviewed the blm approval of a phased exploration project,the interior board of land appeals ibla reviewed a similar nepa challenge to a phased exploration project in great basin mine watch,ibla similar to the situation here,in great basin mine watch,a mining company submitted to the blm a proposal to expand an earlier exploration project.the proposed expansion would disturb an additional acres of land for a total of acres,within a project area.id.at.the blm analyzed the proposed amendment without specific details regarding the location of the phase ii and iii operations.id.at.the ibla determined that the blm failure to include details for phases other than the first phase of the project did not violate nepa,because blm compensate d for the omission of precise sites for future activities by analyzing the impacts of approximately acres of additional surface disturbance anywhere within the project area and imposing stipulations and mitigation measures for all activities throughout the entire project area.id.at.
we agree with the ibla that the blm,in some cases,may adapt its assessment of environmental impacts when the specific locations of an exploration project activities can not reasonably be ascertained until some time after the project is approved.nepa ultimate focus is on the assessment of environmental impacts and a project details are usually a means to that end.an exploration project,however,inherently involves uncertainties if mining companies knew the precise location of mineral deposits before drilling,exploration would not be required.in approving mineral exploration projects,the blm must balance these uncertainties with its duty under nepa to analyze possible environmental impacts.the ibla approach in great basin mine watch strikes an appropriate balance by holding that the blm may approve an exploration project without knowing the exact locations of drill sites and other project activities.in order to do so,the blm must analyze the impact of drilling activities in all parts of the project area and impose effective avoidance and mitigation measures to account for unknown impacts.
we recognize that in great basin mine watch,unlike here,the mining company provided the blm with access road and drill site locations for phase see ibla at.we do not believe,however,that this deficiency renders the blm approval of the amendment unreasonable.phase i exploration activities,like those for phases ii and iii,are uncertain by design because cortez must adjust the location of drilling throughout the course of phase here,as in great basin mine watch,the blm was provided with dimensions of drill sites and access roads,the methods used to construct them,and the total surface disturbance area that would result from the amendment.with this information,the blm assessed the potential impacts from all three phases that might occur throughout the project area.
additionally,as in great basin mine watch,the blm imposed effective avoidance and mitigation measures to protect western shoshone cultural resources from impacts resulting from all three phases of the amendment.in the modified,the blm state director outlined these measures,which prevent cortez from disturbing land in exclusion zones around pcris that are eligible for inclusion on the national register unless later authorized to do so by the blm.accordingly,before beginning exploration activities,cortez must submit scale maps of the areas to be disturbed.cortez may start exploration activities only if past surveys show that no cultural resources are in the area.if the blm determines that a class iii cultural resources survey is needed,an archaeologist and a native american observer will survey the land and make recommendations if cortez finds previously undiscovered cultural resources while conducting exploration activities,it must cease activities within meters of the discovery until the blm determines whether or not the site is eligible for the national register and should thus be protected by an exclusion zone.the blm will delineate exclusion zones to surround any newly discovered sites that might be eligible for inclusion on the national register.
these measures compensate for cortez inability to identify the locations of drill sites and related activities for phases i through iii before beginning exploration activities,provide for phased assessment of areas not yet surveyed for cultural resources at a class iii level,and permit the blm to protect cultural resources when so required by law.we therefore conclude that the blm did not violate nepa by approving the amendment without knowing the precise locations of drill sites,access roads,and other project activities for phases i through iii.
failure to consider reasonable alternatives 
plaintiffs also argue that the blm violated nepa because the agency discussion of reasonable alternatives in the amendment ea is inadequate.the purpose of nepa is to require disclosure of relevant environmental considerations that were given a hard look by the agency,and thereby to permit informed public comment on proposed action and any choices or alternatives that might be pursued with less environmental harm.lands council powell,cir see e requiring agencies to study,develop,and describe appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action in any proposal which involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.agencies are required to consider alternatives in both eiss and eas and must give full and meaningful consideration to all reasonable alternatives.native ecosystems council forest,cir see also b.the existence of a viable but unexamined alternative renders an environmental impact statement inadequate.idaho conservation league mumma,cir quoting citizens for a better henderson hodel,cir.
plaintiffs first argue that the blm should have considered the alternative of approving only phase i of the amendment,rather than approving all three phases of the project,or that the blm should have considered an alternative where the operator would be required to at least set forth its phase i plans.as discussed earlier,given the uncertainty of the exploration activities,the blm imposed mitigation measures designed to adequately protect cultural resources in all phases of the amendment.nepa does not require a separate analysis of alternatives which are not significantly distinguishable from alternatives actually considered,or which have substantially similar consequences.headwaters,bureau of land,cir citing plains res.council lujan,cir.because of the mitigation measures,the environmental consequences of approving only the first phase of the project versus all three phases are substantially similar therefore,the blm was not required to address this alternative in the ea.
plaintiffs next argue that the blm violated nepa by failing to seriously analyze any alternative except cortez chosen project.specifically,plaintiffs argue that the blm analysis of the no action alternative was insufficient because it consisted of only one paragraph plaintiffs argument is not persuasive.although brief,the blm discussion was sufficient because the no action alternative maintains the status quo,the original plan of operations.the amendment ea tiered to the ea for the original,in which the direct impacts of the exploration activities were analyzed.see idaho cmty.action network dot,cir a n agency obligation to consider alternatives under an ea is a lesser one than under an eis w ith an ea,an agency only is required to include a brief discussion of reasonable alternatives.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
failure to assess cumulative impacts 
plaintiffs finally contend that the blm cumulative impact analysis in the amendment ea was insufficient.nepa requires that where several actions have a cumulative environmental effect,this consequence must be considered in an eis.neighbors of cuddy mountain forest,cir quoting city of tenakee springs clough,cir see c.we also require that an ea fully address cumulative environmental effects or cumulative impacts.see,kern blm,cir given that so many more eas are prepared than eiss,adequate consideration of cumulative effects requires that eas address them fully.quoting council on environmental quality,considering cumulative effects under the national environmental policy act,also available at last visited june,emphasis added.cumulative impact is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.
here,the blm designated an area in which it needed to analyze the amendment cumulative impacts the cumulative effects area.the hills project is a proposed mining operation located within the cumulative effects area.the blm acknowledged in the amendment ea that the hills project was a reasonably foreseeable activity.the blm knowledge of the hills project in can also be reasonably inferred by its december publication of a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement to analyze the proposed amendment to the pipeline plan of operations for the cortez hills expansion project.therefore,the blm was required to analyze the cumulative impacts of the amendment and the hills project.see.
in a cumulative impact analysis,an agency must take a hard look at all actions.an ea analysis of cumulative impacts must give a sufficiently detailed catalogue of past,present,and future projects,and provide adequate analysis about how these projects,and differences between the projects,are thought to have impacted the environment.lands council,at.general statements about possible effects and some risk do not constitute a hard look absent a justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided.neighbors of cuddy mountain,at.s ome quantified or detailed information is required.without such information,neither the courts nor the public can be assured that the agency provided the hard look that it is required to provide.id.at.
here,the amendment ea included a cumulative impacts section that purported to review past,present,and reasonably foreseeable activities in the cumulative effects area,by examining specific resources that may be affected.the ea,however,failed to include the required quantified or detailed information.see id.a comparison of the amendment ea with the eas in clearly demonstrates that the blm analysis of cumulative impacts in the cumulative effects area did not adequately address the reasonably foreseeable mining activities of the hills project.see at.
a review of the blm analysis of the amendment cumulative impact on two of these resource resources and native american religious instructive.we note that the bulk of the ea discussion in these two sections focuses on the effects of the amendment itself,rather than the combined impacts resulting from the activities of the amendment with other projects.although part of the blm analysis discusses t he effects of the activities to be conducted under the proposed amendment within the cumulative effects study area,only two of the seven paragraphs in these two sections refer to cumulative effects.the majority of the discussion focuses on how effects of the amendment additional exploration activities will be avoided or mitigated.the ea discussion of the amendment direct effects in lieu of a discussion of cumulative impacts is inadequate.see id.at holding that an ea cumulative impact analysis was inadequate when,among other deficiencies,a considerable portion of each section discusses only the direct effects of the project at issue on its own minor watershed.
moreover,although the ea refers to cumulative effects in two paragraphs in the cultural resources and native american religious concerns sections,the ea does not,in fact,discuss the existence of any cumulative impacts on these resources instead,it concludes that n o incremental cumulative effects would occur to cultural resources as a result of the proposed project.to reach this conclusion,the ea reasons that all of the impacts from the expanded exploration activities will be avoided or mitigated and that all e xisting,proposed,and reasonably foreseeable activities would avoid or mitigate all known and discovered resources.
this type of conclusory analysis can be found throughout the cumulative impacts section.for example,the amendment ea devotes a scant three sentences to the cumulative impacts to water resources,stating only that i mpacts to water resources may include increased sedimentation and potential for erosion.this,despite the discussion earlier in the ea that the amendment could potentially result in direct impacts to groundwater resources where groundwater is encountered in the drill holes,and the blm prediction of significant impacts from dewatering as a result of the hills project and other cortez projects previously approved within the cumulative effects area.the ea vague discussion of cumulative impacts can be found in virtually every subpart of the section.
in,we rejected as inadequate eas that listed different environmental concerns air quality,water quality,with checkboxes marked no,indicating that the environmental factor in question would not suffer any cumulative effects.at.a number of these factors,however,were annotated to note that they would or could be impacted by the project,but that i mpacts are being avoided by project design.id.we held that this was insufficient because t he ea s are silent as to the degree that each factor will be impacted and how the project design will reduce or eliminate the identified impacts.id.
we acknowledge that the ea here,unlike the eas in,does describe some of the ways in which the amendment impacts will be mitigated.the amendment ea contains a description of some mitigation measures,and the blm state director imposed additional measures in his april decision.the ea,however,fails to explain how cortez will mitigate or avoid impacts to the different resources resulting from the other existing,proposed,or reasonably foreseeable projects,including the hills project.further,as in,the ea fails to explain the nature of unmitigated impacts of the amendment expanded exploration activities with other existing,proposed,and reasonably foreseeable activities 
despite the above deficiencies,cortez argues that there was no need for a cumulative impact analysis because there are no cumulative impacts to analyze.cortez suggests that it is not enough to show that potential cumulative impacts were not analyzed rather,plaintiffs must prove that cumulative impacts will actually occur.cortez thus adopts the district court reasoning,which concluded that the cumulative impacts analysis of the amendment ea was sufficient because plaintiffs failed to identify how the pediment cortez hills project will have a cumulative impact when combined with the amendment project.
although we have not yet precisely articulated the burden that a plaintiff must bear to demonstrate that an agency should have analyzed the cumulative impacts of a proposed project along with other projects,our case law suggests that the burden is not an onerous one.in city of united states department of transportation,cir,we observed that the plaintiffs met their burden in raising a cumulative impacts claim under nepa,despite failing to specify a particular project that would cumulatively impact the environment along with the proposed project.id.at.we declined to impose a greater burden,noting that the defendants failed first they did not properly describe other area projects or detail the cumulative impacts of these projects.id.moreover,in,we noted that when the potential for serious cumulative impacts is apparent,the blm needed to provide more details of its cumulative impact analysis in an ea before concluding that there were no significant cumulative effects.at.
applying city of carmel and here,we conclude that in order for plaintiffs to demonstrate that the blm failed to conduct a sufficient cumulative impact analysis,they need not show what cumulative impacts would occur.to hold otherwise would require the public,rather than the agency,to ascertain the cumulative effects of a proposed action.see id.such a requirement would thwart one of the twin aims of ensure that the agency will inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process.balt.gas natural res.def.council,d emphasis added.
instead,we conclude that plaintiffs must show only the potential for cumulative impact.here,plaintiffs more than carry their burden by demonstrating that both the amendment and the hills project will directly impact the same resources within the cumulative effects area,and thus have the potential for cumulative impacts.although not necessary,plaintiffs bolster their claim of cumulative impacts to cultural resources and native american religious concerns by submitting the ethnographic study prepared by the blm for the original pediment deposit mining project.the study predicted that the mine could impede the western shoshone visual and physical access to tenabo decrease the supply of pinyon pine available for harvesting by the western shoshone and disturb western shoshone burial sites.these same concerns could be affected by the exploration activities conducted under the amendment,potentially resulting in a total impact that is greater than that caused by either the hills project or the amendment see,at sometimes the total impact from a set of actions may be greater than the sum of the parts t he addition of a small amount here,a small amount there,and still more at another point could add up to something with a much greater impact.
we conclude that blm analysis of the cumulative impacts of the proposed amendment and the hills project was insufficient,and therefore violated nepa.nepa requires the blm to take a hard look at the cumulative impacts of the amendment and other projects within the cumulative effects area this it failed to do.we therefore hold that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for defendants on this issue and remand to the district court with instructions to grant summary judgment for plaintiffs and remand to the blm for further proceedings.in light of our disposition of this issue,we need not address plaintiffs argument that the amendment and the hills project are cumulative actions under nepa and should be considered in one comprehensive eis.see,at,observing that in light of an insufficient cumulative impact analysis,the court could not determine whether a single ea or eis was needed a 
in sum,although we conclude that in the ea,the blm took a hard look at the direct impacts of the amendment and that its discussion of reasonable alternatives was proper,we hold that the blm violated nepa mandate by failing to conduct a proper analysis of the cumulative impacts of the amendment and the hills project on western shoshone cultural resources in the area.we therefore conclude that the blm approval of the amendment was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law a.
national historic preservation act 
plaintiffs also argue that the blm approval of the amendment violated section of the nhpa.section requires the blm to take into account the effect of an undertaking on any district,site,building,structure,or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the national register of historic places.u.like nepa,s ection of nhpa is a stop,look,and listen provision that requires each federal agency to consider the effects of its programs.muckleshoot indian tribe forest,cir united states acres of land,cir nhpa is similar to nepa except that it requires consideration of historic sites,rather than the environment.
the nhpa explicitly delegates authority to the advisory council on historic preservation to promulgate such rules and regulations as it deems necessary to govern the implementation of section.we have previously determined that federal agencies must comply with these regulations.see pit river tribe forest,cir muckleshoot indian tribe,at.the section process requires an agency to 
make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties determine whether identified properties are eligible for listing on the national register assess the effects of the undertaking on any eligible historic properties found determine whether the effect will be adverse and avoid or mitigate any adverse effects.the agency must confer with the state historic preservation officer shpo and seek the approval of the advisory council on historic preservation council.
muckleshoot indian tribe,at citations omitted.
in some cases,p roperties of traditional religious and cultural importance to an indian tribe may be determined to be eligible for inclusion on the national register.d a.the blm refers to such properties as properties of cultural and religious importance or pcris.the nhpa implementing regulations require the blm,at all stages of the section process,to consult with tribes that attach religious and cultural significance to historic properties that may be affected by an undertaking.c ii.the goal of consultation is to identify historic properties potentially affected by the undertaking id.
the blm consulted with the tribe in to determine if there were any pcris within the project area,in connection with cortez original proposal to conduct exploration activities.on july,the tribe responded to the blm inquiries by submitting a map outlining the boundaries of what it called traditional cultural property.on the basis of this submission,further consultations with the tribe,and various ethnographic reports regarding the area,the blm evaluated several sites to determine whether they were eligible for listing on the national register in april,the blm determined that two sites were eligible horse canyon and the top of mount tenabo and the white cliffs of mount tenabo a combination of two of the evaluated pcris 
under section,the blm was required to consider the amendment effects on the two sites,identify any adverse effects,and avoid or mitigate any adverse effects.see.the blm,in the original for the amendment,concluded that because of the avoidance measures outlined in the ea,there is no potential for impacts to cultural resources from surface disturbance exploration activities.after plaintiffs complained that the ea violated the nhpa,the blm state director reviewed the and added the exclusion zone protocol.plaintiffs continue to argue,as they did before the blm state director,that the blm violated the nhpa because the blm failed to adequately consult with the tribe and the blm state director decision was incorrect and unsupported by the record.
insufficient consultation with the tribe 
we first consider plaintiffs argument that the blm approved the amendment without complying with its duty under the nhpa to consult with the tribe.the nhpa implementing regulations require agencies to provide a tribe with a reasonable opportunity to identify its concerns about historic properties,advise on the identification and evaluation of historic properties,including those of traditional religious and cultural importance,articulate its views on the undertaking effects on such properties,and participate in the resolution of adverse effects.c ii a further,c onsultation with indian tribes should commence early in the planning process,in order to identify and discuss relevant preservation issues,and must recognize the relationship between the federal government and indian tribes,id.c ii c.
plaintiffs argue that the blm failed to initiate consultation with the tribe in a timely fashion.cortez proposed the amendment to the blm in july.the blm waited a full year to contact the tribe,notifying the tribe about the proposed amendment in a july,letter after it had contacted all other consulting parties.the blm sent this letter to the tribe approximately one month before the blm submitted the ea for the amendment for public comment and three months before the blm issued its first.the blm also left at least two phone messages with the tribe in september.although consultation about the amendment between the blm state director and the tribe eventually took place,the consultation occurred after the blm issued its.
the blm and cortez argue that,in light of the blm previous consultation with the tribe for the original and other projects in the area,the blm provided the tribe with a sufficient opportunity to identify its concerns about historic properties as provided by c ii a.we agree.notably,this case has a somewhat unique historic background,because the blm began consulting with the tribe while working on the original hc cuep and other projects.indeed,as a result of one of the ethnographic studies that was a part of this earlier process,mount cliffs and horse canyon were designated as national register eligible pcris.we also note that the amendment did not propose to enlarge the project area in which exploration would take place rather,it increased the amount of land that could be disturbed within the project area.plaintiffs acknowledge these past efforts by explicitly stating that they do not challenge the blm previous efforts to identify historical,cultural,or religious sites within the project area.as emphasized by plaintiffs,t he issue is whether blm properly conducted consultation on this project 
here,plaintiffs do not identify any new information that the tribe would have brought to the attention of the blm had it been consulted earlier in the approval process for the amendment.significantly,they concede that the blm research and investigation of culturally important sites was adequate for the original ea.they thus fail to show or even argue that early consultation would have prevented any adverse effect on any identified national register eligible pcri.additionally,plaintiffs do not identify any new information regarding how the additional exploration would adversely affect the identified pcris,again failing to demonstrate how early consultation with the tribe might have affected the blm determination.
moreover,the fundamental purpose of the nhpa is to ensure the preservation of historical resources.see d a requiring the secretary to promulgate regulations to assist indian tribes in preserving their particular historic properties and to encourage coordination in historic preservation planning and in the identification,evaluation,protection,and interpretation of historic properties see also indian youth council watt,cir the purpose of the national historic preservation act nhpa,is the preservation of historic resources.early consultation with tribes is encouraged by the regulations to ensure that all types of historic properties and all public interests in such properties are given due consideration d a pit river tribe,at holding that dilatory environmental review is insufficient to comply with nepa because inflexibility may occur if delay in preparing an eis is allowed after major investment of both time and money,it is likely that more environmental harm will be tolerated.quoting save the yaak comm.block,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.while the plaintiffs are correct that the nhpa implementing regulations recognize the relationship between the federal government and indian tribes,they do so to ensure that consultation be conducted in a manner sensitive to the concerns and needs of the indian tribe c ii c.
in sum and as reflected in the record,the blm has consulted with the tribe regarding pcris within the project area for many years.in addition,the tribe has made no showing that it would have provided new information had it been consulted again earlier in the amendment approval process.we therefore conclude that the blm did not violate its obligation to consult with the tribe and thus did not violate the nhpa.see also muckleshoot indian tribe,at morongo band of mission indians faa,cir pit river tribe,at 
incorrect or unsupported no effect determination 
next,plaintiffs argue that,even if the tribe was properly consulted,the blm no effect determination under the nhpa was improper.we are not convinced.
first,we do not agree that approval of a phased project in its entirety always results in a violation of the nhpa.as noted above,the nhpa,like nepa,is a procedural statute requiring government agencies to stop,look,and listen before proceeding with agency action.for the same reasons that we concluded in the nepa context that a phased exploration project in some circumstances can be fully approved without all the details of the separate phases of exploration,we reach the same conclusion in the nhpa context.see,great basin mine watch,ibl
