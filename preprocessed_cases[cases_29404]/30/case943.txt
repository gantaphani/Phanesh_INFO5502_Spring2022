the california department of toxic substances control the state brought this cost recovery action under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla,et,seeking cleanup costs arising from the release of hazardous substances at a former lead processing facility the site operated by alco pacific,and morris kirk collectively,alco.the state asserts that defendants rsr corporation rsr,quemetco,quemetco,davis wire corporation davis,pasminco,pasminco,and kay metal supply,pkm collectively defendants sold lead content materials to alco and thus are subject to arranger liability for contamination of the site under cercla a,a.the district court granted summary judgment for defendants after concluding as a matter of law that the subject sales fell within the useful product doctrine and thus did not constitute arrangements for disposal or treatment of hazardous wastes under cercla.california department of toxic substances control alco pacific,no.we have jurisdiction over the state timely appeal under.we reverse and remand.
background 
alco operated a lead processing facility on the site from approximately to.during that period alco refined and reclaimed lead from raw materials acquired from thousands of sources.these materials included lead ingots,automobile batteries,scrap metal,wheel weights,dross and slag.
the latter two materials are particularly important in the context of the instant appeal.dross is the material that rises to the surface of melted metal that is not perfectly pure.dross typically is skimmed off the molten metal and stored for later use or disposal.depending on the care taken in skimming,the dross thus removed may contain a significant percentage of the metal itself.slag also results from the separation of impurities from metal during the smelting and refining process.alco purchased high lead content dross and slag that were of other lead processors operations.material was deemed to have high lead content if it contained approximately thirty percent recoverable lead.the price alco paid for the dross,slag and other raw materials it purchased was based upon an analysis of the lead content of the material and the published market price of lead at the time of the transaction,as measured by the commodities price index quoted in daily newspapers.
after processing the materials supplied by defendants and others,alco sold the resulting refined and reclaimed lead in various forms.for example,alco cast lead sailboat keels and produced sheet metal and lead anodes.alco also sold lead in the form of ingots or babbitts.alco disposed of the waste material resulting from its lead content a facility authorized to accept hazardous wastes.alco did not dispose of dross generated during its operations,but rather used the dross again in its smelting process.
defendants rsr and quemetco 
rsr is the parent corporation of quemetco.rsr did not sell or transfer any materials to alco,but it allegedly arranged for the sale of materials to alco on behalf of quemetco.quemetco is a lead smelter that reclaims lead from scrap and automobile batteries.though quemetco sold several different types of lead content materials to alco,the parties have focused on sales of lead content slag.
quemetco generates three types of slag first run slag or reverb slag,which is produced during the initial processing of scrap through a reverberatory furnace second run slag or rerun slag,which has been processed a second time and inert slag or waste slag,which has been processed at least twice and is ready for disposal.on october,quemetco sold to alco pounds of rerun antimonial lead slag.on october,quemetco sold to alco pounds of rerun antimonial lead slag.alco paid seven cents per pound on both transactions,resulting in total payments of on the first purchase and on the second purchase.
defendant davis 
davis operated a wire manufacturing company that used molten lead to treat wire.a of this process was lead content dross that was composed of lead and coke.between and,davis periodically sold lead content dross to alco at varying prices,depending on the amount of lead contained in the particular shipment.alco paid davis at least for lead content dross during this period.
defendant pasminco 
pasminco operated a zinc smelting facility.between and,pasminco periodically sold lead content dross and other materials to alco.
defendant pkm 
pkm operates a solder manufacturing facility,reclaiming tin and lead in a manner similar to that used by alco.pkm reclaims tin,lead and other metals and converts them into solder that it sells to others.pkm sold various materials to alco,including lead dross,solder dross and antimonial lead dies.the parties have focused on the dross transactions.between and,pkm periodically sold lead and solder dross to alco at varying prices.pkm characterizes these transactions as part of a conversion agreement whereby alco processed the dross to strip it of impurities and then returned the extracted refined metal to pkm.pkm paid a fee for this conversion process.
contamination of the site 
during alco operations,molten lead,slag and other materials,including dust and residue from the materials,occasionally spilled or otherwise were deposited onto the ground at the site.additionally,solidified lead and slag were stored on the ground at least temporarily.the state determined that surface dust,soils and slag piles at the site were contaminated with lead.it incurred significant cleanup costs at the site and filed the instant action seeking reimbursement from defendants on the theory that the transactions constituted arrangements for the disposal or treatment of hazardous waste under cercla a,a.the state also seeks declaratory relief with respect to any future cleanup costs.
the district court granted summary judgment for defendants,concluding as a matter of law that defendants transactions with alco were within the scope of the useful product doctrine.the state subsequently reached settlement with the remaining defendants in the case,and the district court entered a final order and consent decree resolving all outstanding issues.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.olsen idaho state bd.of,cir.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.we may affirm on any ground supported by the record.id.
discussion 
under cercla,a plaintiff may attempt to recover cleanup costs from four categories of persons,defined at a.only the third category,persons defined as arrangers,is at issue here 
a ny person who by contract,agreement,or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment,or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment,of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person,by any other party or entity,at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances 
a.we recently held that arranger liability encompasses not only transactions in which the central purpose is the disposal of hazardous waste but also transactions that contemplate disposal as a part of,but not the focus of,the transaction.united states burlington santa fe ry,cir.
cercla itself does not define the terms disposal and treatment,but instead incorporates the definitions of those terms as set forth in the solid waste disposal act swda.see.the swda defines disposal as 
the discharge,deposit,injection,dumping,spilling,leaking,or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water so that such solid waste or hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters,including ground waters.
treatment is defined as 
any method,technique,or process,including neutralization,designed to change the physical,chemical,or biological character or composition of any hazardous waste so as to neutralize such waste or so as to render such waste nonhazardous,safer for transport,amenable for recovery,amenable for storage,or reduced in volume.
we have held that these definitions necessarily implicate the concept of waste,and have developed a body of case law distinguishing between the disposal or treatment of waste and the sale of a useful product.see,burlington,at a w smelter refiners,clinton,cir catellus dev.united states,cir.a person may be held liable as an arranger under a only if the material in question constitutes waste rather than a useful product.a w smelter,at catellus,at.application of this distinction has been referred to as the useful product doctrine.
because the doctrine has developed piecemeal through case law,its contours are not entirely clear.in asarco,cir,one of our early cases touching on the useful product doctrine,the relevant issue was whether a copper smelter sale of slag to logyards via a middleman gave rise to liability under cercla.the logyards used the slag like gravel,spreading it on the ground to provide a firmer surface to aid in the storage of logs and operation of heavy equipment.id.at.when the slag became mixed with wood waste and other debris,the logyards hauled it to a landfill and put down a new load of slag.id.at.the logyards and landfill eventually became contaminated with heavy metals from the slag,and the smelter,asarco,was held liable under cercla.id.
on appeal,we did not refer explicitly to the useful product doctrine,but phrased the question before us as whether the sale of slag to the logyards can simultaneously be both the sale of a product with intrinsic value in trade or commerce under washington law,and the disposal of a hazardous substance under cercla.id.at.we answered this question in the affirmative,concluding that slag was a of asarco principal that the slag had only nominal commercial value in that the logging companies paid only per ton.id.at.prior to attempting to develop a market for its slag,asarco had dumped the slag into a nearby bay with the permission of the local park district.id.we distinguished other cases in which the sale of products was not considered disposal of hazardous waste on the ground that those cases involved the producers principal business products,not that the producers had to get rid of.id.at.under the circumstances,asarco could be held liable as an arranger for contamination caused by the slag ultimately sold to logyards.id.at.
in catellus dev.united states,cir,the defendant auto parts dealer,general,accepted used automotive batteries from customers as.id.at.general in turn sold the batteries to a battery cracking plant that extracted and smelted the lead and dumped the battery casings.id.at.tons of crushed battery casings ended up on the property of the plaintiff,catellus,and contaminated it with lead.id.at.
we declined to read asarco as announcing a broad rule that any sale of a nonprincipal business product or necessarily is an arrangement for disposal or treatment under a.catellus,at.asarco was limited to the situation where the being sold will have to continue to be used in its identical state until it is disposed of.id.however,given the battery recycling procedure at issue,a n inescapable fact is that the leftover battery casings must be disposed of.id.at.the battery casings had to be gotten rid of either by general,which could have cracked the casings itself before selling the scrap lead,or by the purchaser who bought the entire battery.id.we concluded that general can not escape having the battery casings defined as discarded material simply by selling the battery to another party who then disposed of the casings.id.
we expressly rejected general argument that it could not be held liable as an arranger under cercla because it did not control the eventual disposition of the batteries remnants.catellus,at.requiring continued ownership or control for section a liability would make it too easy for a party,wishing to dispose of a hazardous substance,to escape by a sale its responsibility to see that the substance is safely disposed of.id.it is sufficient that the substance has the characteristic of waste at the time it is delivered to another party.id.we likewise held that there is no requirement in treatment cases that there be a contract specifying how treatment will take place,stating that,a s with our interpretation of the arrangement for disposal provision,all that is necessary is that the treatment be inherent in the particular arrangement,even though the arranger does not retain control over its details.id.at.
in cadillac,united states,cir,we addressed the appropriate characterization of a series of transactions between manufacturers of synthetic rubber and dow,a supplier of styrene used in rubber production.the rubber companies purchased styrene from dow,but could convert only sixty to seventy percent of that styrene into rubber.id.at.the unconverted styrene contained contaminants from the rubber manufacturing process,so the rubber companies sent the contaminated styrene to dow for.id.dow cleaned the styrene of contaminants,which were deposited in pits near the styrene plant,and returned the recovered styrene to the rubber companies for use in rubber manufacturing.id.dow charged the rubber companies nine cents a pound for styrene and credited them seven cents a pound for contaminated styrene returned to dow for.id.when it was sued for contamination caused by styrene and other hazardous substances at the site of its operations,dow sought contribution from the rubber companies as arrangers under section a of cercla.id.
citing asarco and catellus,we held that it was not dispositive that the rubber companies did not own the contaminated styrene during the process and did not control the process that resulted in the release of contaminants.id.at.we likewise held that it was not dispositive that the transactions in question were characterized as sales.id.at.noting that the question on summary judgment is,whether the could infer from all the circumstances that a transaction in fact involves an arrangement for the disposal or treatment of a hazardous substance,id.at internal quotation marks,alterations,and citations omitted,we concluded that,a trier of fact could find the substance of the transactions to have been that the rubber companies paid dow two cents per pound to remove the contaminants from the used styrene and return the fresh styrene to they simply arranged and paid for treatment of the contaminated styrene by dow.id.at.we found that,r emoval and release of the hazardous substances was not only the inevitable consequence,but the very purpose of the return of the contaminated styrene to dow.id.
in a w smelter refiners,clinton,cir,the united states environmental protection agency epa ordered a w to dispose of an ore pile at its smelting facility because the pile contained quantities of naturally occurring lead and slag.a w complied and filed a complaint seeking reimbursement of its compliance costs under cercla.id.at.the district court granted summary judgment for the epa and its.we reversed and remanded on the ground that there were triable issues of material fact as to whether the ore pile constituted waste or a useful product.id.at.although the district court had been persuaded that the pile could not be a useful product because it was unusable in its current state,we noted that raw materials,by definition,ca be used in their current state but rather must be process which separates the useful portion from the waste.id.at.the pile was waste only if the ore was mixed with so much slag that it was no longer useable for a w principal business id.at.whether this was the case could not be answered on the existing record,but required consideration of other relevant evidence regarding a w actions and the market value of the ore pile,if any.id.
