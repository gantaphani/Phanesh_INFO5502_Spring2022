the miccosukee tribe of indians the tribe and the friends of the everglades the friends together plaintiffs brought a citizen suit under the clean water act cwa against the south florida water management district the water district.the suit alleges that the water district was violating the clean water act by discharging pollutants from the pump station into water conservation area without a national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit.
the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court denied the water district motion,granted plaintiffs,and enjoined the water district from operating the pump station without an npdes permit.the water district appeals from the district court order declaring unlawful the water district operation of the pump station without an npdes permit and from the injunction prohibiting the same 
background 
the south florida water management district manages the central southern florida flood control project.this management is through the operation of many levees,canals and water impoundment areas.the areas now called the basin and the water conservation were historically part of the everglades.but,in the early,the army corps of engineers began digging the canal to facilitate the draining of the western portion of broward county which is part of the basin.then,in the,the corps constructed the and levees to create to the west of the basin and completed construction of the pump station.
the canal runs through the basin and collects water from the basin and seepage through the levees from.the pump station then pumps this water through three pipes from the canal through the and levees into at a rate of cubic feet per second per pipe.without the operation of the pump station,the populated western portion of broward county would flood within days 
the water which the canal collects and which the pump station conveys into the contains pollutants.in particular,this water contains higher levels of phosphorus than that naturally occurring in.the pump station,however,adds no pollutants to the water which it conveys.
the district court concluded that,because the waters collected by the canal contained pollutants and this water would not flow into without the operation of the pump station,added pollutants to the in violation of the cwa.on appeal,the water district contends that the district court erred as a matter of law in concluding that conveyance of water from the canal into the constituted a discharge of pollutants.
ii.discussion 
pumping of polluted water 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment to plaintiffs de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.hendrickson.power,cir.for summary judgment to be proper,no genuine issue can exist on a material fact and the moving party must be entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in reviewing the evidence,we must draw all reasonable,factual inferences in favor of the party.carriers container council,mobile ass n,cir.
the clean water act prohibits the discharge of pollutants from a point source into navigable waters without an npdes permit.see.the discharge of a pollutant is defined as any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.see.no party disputes that the pump station and,in particular,the pipes from which water is released constitute a point source or that the water released by the station contains pollutants.also,both parties agree that the canal and the constitute navigable waters.the parties mainly dispute one legal issue whether the pumping of the already polluted water constitutes an addition of pollutants to navigable waters from a point source.
relying on a line of cases,the water district argues that no addition of pollutants from a point source can occur unless a point source adds pollutants to navigable waters from the outside world.see wildlife fed gorsuch,showing deference to epa interpretation that an addition from a point source occurs only if the point source itself physically introduces a pollutant into water from the outside world wildlife fed consumers power,cir same under the water district interpretation,when a point source conveys one navigable water into another,no addition of pollutants will occur unless the point source itself is the source of the pollutants which it releases.and,because does not itself introduce pollutants from the outside into the water which it conveys,the water district contends no addition of pollutants occurs.
first,we conclude that,in determining whether pollutants are added to navigable waters for purposes of the cwa,the receiving body of water is the relevant body of navigable water.thus,we must determine whether pollutants are being added to.they are nevertheless,for an addition of a pollutants to navigable waters to require an npdes permit,that addition of pollutants must be from a point source.and,for an addition of pollutants to be from a point source,the relevant inquiry is for the point pollutants would have been added to the receiving body of water we,therefore,conclude that an addition from a point source occurs if a point source is the of the release of pollutants into navigable waters.
when a point source changes the natural flow of a body of water which contains pollutants and causes that water to flow into another distinct body of navigable water into which it would not have otherwise flowed,that point source is the of the discharge of pollutants and,because the pollutants would not have entered the second body of water but for the change in flow caused by the point source,an addition of pollutants from a point source occurs.neither party disputes that,without the operation of the pump station,the polluted waters from the canal would not normally flow east into the the pump station,therefore,is the of the addition of pollutants to the.we,therefore,conclude that the release of water caused by the pump station operation constitutes an addition of pollutants from a point source.
b.the injunction 
next,the water district contends that the district court abused its discretion by enjoining the water district from operating the pump station without an npdes permit.the water district argues that the court erred by not applying traditional equitable standards in its grant of the injunction.see weinberger,d prohibition against discharge of pollutants in cwa does not foreclose exercise of equitable discretion.and,according to the water district,had the district court balanced the potential harm caused by enjoining the operation of against the harm prevented the court would have concluded that should not be enjoined from operating without an npdes permit.
we review for an abuse of discretion the district court decision to grant an injunction under the cwa,at.at.in determining whether an injunction is proper,not only should a district court balance the conveniences of the parties and possible injuries to them according as they may be affected by the granting or withholding of the injunction,but the court should also pay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.id.at.at citation omitted see also million youth march,safir,cir an injunction is an exercise of a court equitable authority,and the exercise of that authority,in the vindication of any legal protection must sensitively assess all the equities of the situation,including the public interest.okaw drainage dist.distillers chem,cir a n injunction may not be granted without consideration of the equities,including the costs that the injunction is likely to impose on third parties.because the cessation of the pump would cause substantial flooding in western broward county which,in turn,would cause damage to and displacement of a significant number of people we conclude that the people of broward county have a very significant interest in whether the pump station operation should be enjoined.
the district court injunction prohibits the water district from operating without an npdes permit.if this injunction were enforced,the water district could not continue to operate while applying for an npdes permit and although on appeal plaintiffs defend
