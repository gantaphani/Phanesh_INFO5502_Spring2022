does the director of the department of conservation director have standing to file a petition for a writ of mandate challenging reclamation plans and financial assurances for surface mining operations approved by defendant el dorado county county under the surface mining and reclamation act of smara pub.resources code,et we conclude he has.
background 
smara,enacted in stats,ch,requires that california surface miners provide reclamation plans for their mining operations and financial assurances to implement those plans,subd.a.a reclamation plan under smara is a written plan specifying how mined land will be treated so as to minimize the environmental impacts of mining and render a mined site usable in the future for alternative purposes.see.financial assurances are a mine operator pledges of funds sufficient to perform reclamation in accordance with an approved reclamation plan,subd.a.smara prohibits the continuation past stated dates of any surface mining operation not covered by a reclamation plan and financial assurances that have been approved by the lead agency responsible for that operation,subd.d.
respondent and real party in interest loring brunius operates two surface mines,weber creek quarry and diamond quarry,in respondent county.county,as designated lead agency,was primarily responsible for ensuring compliance with smara in its jurisdiction,subd.f.the director is vested with control of the department of conservation department see and also is assigned various responsibilities under smara see,as will be explained.
both the director and the state mining and geology board board see et in the sought to enforce smara against brunius,who at the time was operating both of his quarries without approved reclamation plans or financial assurances.in june,the director obtained a stipulated judgment requiring brunius to pay in administrative penalties subject to reduction if brunius complied with smara by certain dates.when brunius failed timely to comply,the director ordered him to cease all mining activity at weber creek quarry and diamond quarry.brunius,however,having subsequently submitted reclamation plans and financial assurances,obtained a preliminary injunction against operation of the director order,in light of brunius pending applications for county approval of his plans and assurances.the board,for its part,finding that county had,in violation of smara,allowed weber creek quarry to operate since without an approved reclamation plan and since without approved financial assurances,commenced smara prescribed procedures for assuming lead agency powers in the county.
as part of the review process of brunius reclamation plans and financial assurances,the director submitted extensive comments as to their inadequacy.in july,county planning commission nevertheless approved the plans and assurances,as well as a mitigated negative declaration under the california environmental quality act ceqa et see also,tit,et,especially,for both weber creek quarry and diamond quarry.the director appealed these approvals to county board of supervisors,which adopted the mitigated negative declarations and approved the plans and assurances.
our question arises out of the director filing,in september,two petitions for writs of administrative mandate code civ,against county and brunius,seeking to vacate county approvals as in violation of both smara and ceqa.the director alleged that brunius reclamation plans did not meet smara specifications and that his financial assurances were inadequate.the director also alleged that county had violated ceqa in approving the mitigated negative declarations for brunius operations.
the director two petitions subsequently were consolidated.in march,the director filed amended petitions,adding allegations that county had erroneously concluded brunius possessed a vested right to operate weber creek quarry without a permit,and allowed brunius unlawfully to expand operations at diamond quarry.
the california mining association,the construction materials association of california,and the southern california rock products association interveners,all trade associations,were granted leave to intervene.county,brunius,and interveners each demurred on the ground the director lacked standing.the trial court overruled the demurrers,and the court of appeal denied interveners and county petitions for writs of mandate or other relief from the trial court ruling.
in answering the director petitions,county and brunius alleged the director lack of standing as an affirmative defense the interveners complaint also alleged the director lack of standing.the trial court granted county summary adjudication on the director claim in the weber creek quarry writ that county erred in finding the weber creek quarry was a vested use,exempt from various smara and permitting requirements.the trial court then granted county and brunius motion to dismiss the ceqa claims for the director failure timely to request a hearing.finally,the trial court dismissed the director remaining smara claims on the ground the director lacked standing to maintain them.the trial court awarded attorney fees to county,brunius,and the interveners under code of civil procedure section.
a divided court of appeal affirmed on standing grounds the dismissal of the director smara and ceqa claims,but reversed the trial court attorney fees award.the department,brunius,and county each filed a petition for review.we granted all three petitions 
discussion 
we are concerned here not with the merits of the underlying dispute,but only with the procedural question whether the director has standing to petition for a writ of mandate.answering this question requires us to examine the director role,generally,as the executive officer of a state department and,more specifically,within smara.
statutory background 
the majority in the court of appeal below accurately detailed the relevant statutory background 
within the resources agency is the department of conservation the department.the head of the department is an executive officer appointed by the governor,known as the director.the department work is divided into at least four divisions mines and geology oil,gas,and geothermal resources land conservation and recycling.
also in the department is the state mining and geology board.the board represents the state interests in the development,utilization,and conservation of mineral resources in california and the reclamation of mined lands,and in federal matters pertaining to mining.the board also determines,establishes,and maintains an adequate surface mining and reclamation policy.although the director is the head of the department,he does not control the board the director has no power to amend or repeal any order,ruling,or directive of the board.
the legislature in adopting smara intended to create and maintain an effective surface mining and reclamation policy to prevent or minimize adverse environmental effects,reclaim mined lands to a usable condition which is ad a ptable to alternative uses,and encourage the production and conservation of minerals while giving consideration to values relating to recreation,watershed,wildlife,range and forage,and aesthetic enjoyment.
at the heart of smara is the requirement that every surface mining operation have a permit,a reclamation plan,and financial assurances,subd.a.the financial assurances must remain in effect for the duration of the mining operation and until reclamation is complete and shall be made payable to the lead agency and the department,subd.a.the financial assurances may be forfeited if the lead agency or the board determines the operator is financially incapable of performing reclamation in accordance with the approved reclamation plan,or has abandoned its surface mining operation without commencing reclamation,subd.b.
in keeping with the recognition of the diverse conditions throughout the state,smara provides for home rule,with the local lead agency having primary responsibility.a lead agency is usually the city or county.the mining operator submits the reclamation plan and financial assurances to the lead agency for review,subd.d.the board,through regulations,specifies minimum statewide reclamation standards.a lead agency,however,may permit a mining operation to deviate from these standards,if necessary based on the approved end use,tit.
to implement its review of proposed reclamation plans and financial assurances,every lead agency is to adopt ordinances in accordance with state policy,subd.a.the board shall review these ordinances and certify that they are in compliance with state policy.if the board finds deficiencies in the lead agency ordinance,the board shall communicate the deficiencies to the lead agency,subd.a.after an opportunity to revise the ordinance to comply with state policy,if the board finds the ordinance is still deficient,the board shall assume full responsibility for review of reclamation plans,subd.b.if the lead agency does not have a certified ordinance,reclamation plans shall be submitted to and approved by the board,subd.c.the board may amend any reclamation plan that was approved by a lead agency at the time the lead agency ordinance did not comply with state policy,subd.c.
prior to approving reclamation plans and financial assurances,the lead agency submits the proposals and all supporting documentation,including information from any document prepared,adopted or certified pursuant to ceqa,to the director for review,subd.c.the director then may prepare written comments,if he chooses,within days for reclamation plans and days for financial assurances,subd.d.the lead agency shall prepare written responses to the director comments,describing disposition of the major issues raised.in particular,the lead agency shall explain in detail why any specific comments and suggestions were not accepted,subd.d.thus,although the lead agency must evaluate and respond to the director comments,it need not always accept them.
if a lead agency fails to approve a reclamation plan or financial assurances,an appeal may be taken to the board,subd.e.as originally enacted,smara did not contain enforcement provisions.stats,ch.as the author explained,smara did not contain enforcement provisions because the bill provides for a local regulatory program.enforcement provisions would be embodied in local ordinances.
in,in response to concerns about deficiencies of lead agencies in carrying out their responsibilities under smara,the legislature substantially amended smara.the amendments provided for various types of enforcement,against both mine operators and lead agencies.enforcement against mine operators includes notices of violations and fines,subds.a c.the lead agency has primary responsibility for enforcing smara against mine operators,subd.f.where the board is not acting as the lead agency,the director may initiate enforcement actions where the director has notified the lead agency of the violation and the lead agency fails to take action within days,or the director determines the violation amounts to imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or safety,or to the environment,subd.f.similarly,the director may take actions to seek forfeiture of financial assurances where the lead agency has failed to act or has been unsuccessful,subd.d.
where the lead agency fails to fulfill its duties under smara,the board may take over the powers of a lead agency,except for permitting authority.the board may step in if it finds that a lead agency has approved reclamation plans and financial assurances that are not consistent with smara failed to inspect mines as required by smara failed to seek forfeiture of financial assurances to carry out reclamation failed to take appropriate enforcement actions intentionally misrepresented the results of inspections or failed to submit the required information to the department,subd.a.the board may take over as lead agency where the lead agency fails to submit a copy of the mining permit for every surface mining operation within its jurisdiction by july,or fails to submit amendments to the permit or reclamation plans for such mines by july of each subsequent year,subd.e.
smara contains three specific provisions for petitioning for a writ of mandate.any person may petition for a writ of mandate to compel the board,the state geologist,fn.omitted or the director to carry out any duty imposed on them by smara.an operator may petition for a writ of mandate to review any administrative penalties imposed,subd.e.a lead agency,an operator,or an interested party may obtain writ review of the board action in taking over as lead agency,subd.f.
the parties highlight three considerations bearing on the question whether the director has standing that a writ of mandate must be issued upon the verified petition of the party beneficially interested code civ,that the director is vested with significant,but limited,powers and responsibilities under smara and that t he head of each state department may make investigations and prosecute actions concerning matters relating to the business activities and subjects under the jurisdiction of the department,subd.a.we briefly explain each.
beneficial interest requirement 
as noted,standing to seek a writ of mandate ordinarily requires that a party be beneficially interested code civ,have some special interest to be served or some particular right to be preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the public at large.carsten psychology examining com.cal d.this standard,we have stated,is equivalent to the federal injury in fact test,which requires a party to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it has suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest that is both a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent associated builders and contractors,san francisco airports com.cal th,d.
director role under smara 
the majority in the court of appeal below based its decision primarily on deference to the legislative scheme and what it discerned therein to be the legislature delicate balancing between home rule,which permits local elected officials to make land use decisions,and effective and consistent statewide enforcement of smara.the majority saw as especially significant the limited advisory role of the director as compared to the board ability to take over the powers of a lead agency.it reasoned that the director limited role under smara,especially when compared to the board role in overseeing lead agencies,establishes that smara does not give the director standing to petition for judicial review of a lead agency actions in approving reclamation plans and financial assurances that do not comply with smara.we examine the director role under smara in detail below.
government code section 
in concluding the director had standing to pursue this mandate action,the dissenting justice below relied primarily on government code section.the statute provides that the head of each state department may make investigations and prosecute actions concerning a all matters relating to the business activities and subjects under the jurisdiction of the department.in the dissenting justice view,the statute confers standing on a department head if the department head is bringing an action relating to the business of the department.
while we have construed government code section grant of investigatory powers liberally see shively stewart cal d,we have not addressed whether the statute grant of prosecutorial powers warrants similar construction.and while the two california courts that have considered government code section implications for standing have concluded that the department head involved had standing to pursue the action at issue,neither court relied exclusively on government code section in reaching that conclusion.see people ex rel.of conservation triplett th,d triplett department standing rested in part on interest in williamson act cancellation fees tieberg superior court d.tieberg director of department of employment standing to challenge unemployment insurance appeals board decision rested in part on interest in proper administration of unemployment insurance fund.as will appear,we likewise eschew exclusive reliance on government code section in concluding the director had standing to bring the actions at issue here.
as we shall explain,neither standing analysis proffered in the court of appeal below is entirely correct.the majority misread smara as impliedly depriving the director of standing to seek judicial review of inadequate reclamation plans and financial assurances and too narrowly construed the concept of beneficial interest with respect to the director responsibilities.the dissenting justice,in turn,while reaching the right result,mistakenly identified government code section as an independent source of the director standing.
as the majority below discerned,government code section only authorizes the director to sue it does not of itself confer standing.there is a difference between the capacity to sue,which is the right to come into court,and the standing to sue,which is the right to relief in court,abrams th,d.the statutory authorization granted department heads to sue,no matter how broadly construed,can not alone confer on the director standing to pursue a writ of mandate here,because such authorization does not necessarily create in him a beneficial interest code civ,in the writ issuance.notwithstanding government code section,nothing logically precludes the legislature from crafting a departmental director powers and duties such that he or she lacks a beneficial interest sufficient to confer standing to sue respecting some particular business activities and subjects under the jurisdiction of the department,subd.a.
no party or amicus curiae identifies an instance of the legislature having so limited a department head authority,however,nor are we aware of any.we conclude that,in any event,the legislature has not crafted smara to deprive the director of standing to seek mandate as a remedy when a local lead agency approves allegedly inadequate reclamation plans or financial assurances.rather,correctly understood,the director standing to prosecute this petition for a writ of mandate derives from his beneficial interest code civ,under smara and,generally,as a state officer charged with serving the public the adequacy of approved reclamation plans and financial assurances.
first,the director powers and responsibilities under smara raise in him a beneficial interest in lead agencies approving adequate plans and assurances.as noted,the director is entitled to review and comment on every reclamation plan submitted to a lead agency for approval.pub.resources code,subds.c,d see also,tit.it is on this basis,presumably,that the majority below characterized the director responsibilities as primarily advisory.but the director review and comment power is not merely advisory rather,its exercise triggers significant statutory obligations on the part of the lead agency.
initially,the lead agency must submit to the director for review the mining operator reclamation plan or plan amendments and financial assurances,together with any related documents prepared,adopted,or certified pursuant to ceqa,subd.c.in so doing,the lead agency is required to certify to the director that the reclamation plan is in compliance with the applicable requirements of the california code of regulations implementing smara,subd.c.the lead agency also is required to evaluate,within a reasonable amount of time,subd.d,the director written comments relating to the submitted plan or assurances and must prepare a written response describing its disposition of the major issues raised,subd.d.in this response,the lead agency must address,in detail,why specific comments and suggestions were not accepted ibid.while the director responsibilities in this part of the smara process are advisory in form in that the lead agency is not required to accept his suggestions,the general interest his review serves,patently,is smara compliance.
we note that,even were the director responsibilities limited to an advisory role,that would not necessarily deprive him of a beneficial interest in the approval by local agencies of adequate reclamation plans and financial assurances.as one california court has recognized in the related context of agricultural land conservation,the legislature having invested the department with power to advise any interested person or entity about a conservation statute purposes and implementation points to the conclusion that the state has standing to enforce the statute substantive provisions,even if a local agency has the primary responsibility for implementing the statute.triplett,supra,th at,d see.
in any event,the director powers and responsibilities under smara are not limited to advice and comment.once a reclamation plan has been approved,the director has express authority to ensure that state law and the reclamation plan are implemented.see generally.the director has power to inspect any mining operation and,if he determines it is not in compliance with smara,he is empowered to order the operator to comply,subd.a.if after a hearing before the board the operator fails to comply,the director may impose administrative penalties of up to per day,subds.b,c.and if the director determines the violation presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or the environment,he may request the attorney general on his behalf to seek a court order enjoining the operation,subd.d.finally,upon the director complaint,the attorney general may bring an action to recover administrative penalties against a person violating smara or any regulation adopted pursuant thereto,subd.e.
plainly,these broad enforcement powers and responsibilities,directed as they are towards overall smara compliance and the fulfillment of state reclamation policy generally,confer on the director a special interest to be served or some particular right to be preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the public at large carsten psychology examining,supra,cal d at.
for instance,if a mine operator manages,through whatever device,to obtain local lead agency approval of reclamation plans that do not comply with smara or its attendant regulations,or that lack safeguards sufficient to facilitate effective administrative oversight and implementation,the director may be hampered or frustrated in subsequent efforts to enjoin or penalize mining that,on inspection,he determines compromises or threatens to compromise smara public health and environmental goals.under such circumstances,of course,simply enforcing the mine operator statutory obligation to perform reclamation in accordance with his approved reclamation plan,subd.b would by hypothesis be inadequate.accordingly,the director has an interest in adequate review of the original approval.
similarly,the director may be hampered or frustrated in the execution of his statutory powers and responsibilities if he is not permitted to seek judicial review when a lead agency approves allegedly inadequate financial assurances.a fundamental purpose of smara is that surface mine operators,rather than the taxpaying public,bear the expense of reclaiming lands disturbed by surface mining.to that end,lead agencies must require that a mine operator financial assurances be sufficient to perform reclamation,subd.d.the mine operator is responsible for posting adequate assurances,subd.a and for payment of any costs of reclamation in accordance with the approved plan that are in excess of the assurances,subd.b.
the director statutory powers and responsibilities relating to financial assurances submitted under smara reveal his substantial interest in their adequacy.pursuant to smara,such assurances are to be made payable to the department,as well as to the lead agency,subd.a.under specified circumstances,the director may seek forfeiture of financial assurances and undertake reclamation of mines,subd.d.specifically,if the lead agency or the board,following a public hearing,determines an operator is financially incapable of performing reclamation in accordance with its approved plan,or has abandoned its mining operation without commencing reclamation,the director may notify the operator that he intends to take appropriate action to forfeit the financial assurances and,after allowing the operator days to commence reclamation,may p roceed to take appropriate action to require forfeiture of the financial assurances if the operator does not substantially comply,subd.b,using the proceeds from the forfeited financial assurances to conduct and complete reclamation in accordance with the approved reclamation plan,subd.b 
obviously,if in a case implicating the director statutory power to seek forfeiture of financial assurances and conduct reclamation,those assurances prove inadequate to accomplish the task,the director can not effectively discharge his responsibility.in such circumstances,instead of the operator paying the full cost of reclamation,the taxpaying public likely will bear part or all of the burden.accordingly,whenever a local lead agency approves allegedly inadequate financial assurances,the director has an interest in obtaining a writ of mandate to address the deficiencies.
thus,the director statutorily conferred powers and expressly granted him under smara,as well as those inhering in his capacity as the executive officer of the state department charged with smara in him a substantial interest in reclamation plans and financial assurances being both legally consistent with smara and practically adequate to accomplish smara goals and state reclamation policy promulgated thereunder therefore,when a local lead agency approves allegedly illegal or inadequate plans or assurances,the director is beneficially interested code civ,in the issuance of a writ of mandate to address the deficiencies.
second,while it is true,as the majority below observed,that the lead agency has primary responsibility for enforcing smara while the director role is a backup one see fns.and,ante,that fact is not determinative.primary responsibility is not exclusive responsibility.generally,where the legislature wants only one agency to have jurisdiction over a matter,it says so unequivocally triplett,supra,th at,d discussing pub.smara contains no such statement.on the contrary,the legislature expressly has provided that the remedies smara accords the director are in addition to,and do not supersede or limit,any and all other remedies,civil or criminal pub.resources code,subd.g.the writ of administrative mandate,a civil remedy,is thus preserved for the director use when he is beneficially interested and must be issued in all such cases where he lacks a plain,speedy,adequate remedy,in the ordinary course of law code civ.
smara contains several specific provisions,but none affords a remedy when an operator obtains lead agency approval of allegedly inadequate reclamation plans or financial assurances this omission,however,does not signify that lead agencies are immune from judicial review,as it has never been held that all laws must be contained,or references thereto made,in one statute.it is sufficient that a remedy exists whether it is expressed in the statute expressing the power or in another statute.tieberg,supra,d at,citing,inter alia,bodinson california emp.com.cal d.here,the director mandate remedy is expressed in the code of civil procedure and in the government code.code civ,circumstances under which writ must issue,administrative mandate,capacity to sue see also brown superior court cal d,official with responsibility to implement disclosure laws has standing to seek a writ of mandate to enforce them.
our acknowledging the director beneficial interest in obtaining a writ of mandate neither diminishes the board authority as conferred by smara nor upsets any implicit legislative balance in the statute while the director has no power to amend or repeal any order of the board,here the director seeks no such thing.in fact,as the court of appeal observed,the record contains no evidence the board disapproves of the instant lawsuits.nor,contrary to the majority suggestion below,does the director seek authority to commence a mandate proceeding against a lead agency in place of the board authority to take over a lead agency powers under section.indeed,after the director filed the instant petitions,the board assumed lead agency functions from county.but the board takeover authority includes no power retroactively to alter a reclamation plan that has been approved by a local lead agency under a certified ordinance the board may amend approved reclamation plans only when they were approved by the board in the first instance because the lead agency in the jurisdiction did not have a certified ordinance or were approved by the agency under an ordinance that was not in accordance with state policy,subd.c.and even reclamation plans the board amends in the exercise of this power must be remanded to the lead agency upon certification of the lead agency ordinance,subd.d.
in determining whether the director has standing to enforce smara,we must consider the consequences that might flow from a particular construction and should construe the statute so as to promote rather than defeat the statute purpose and policy.escobedo estate of snider cal th,d.one possible result of the foregoing scheme,as county acknowledges,is that a smara violation,like county approval of allegedly inadequate reclamation plans and financial assurances in this case,could remain in place even after the board exercises its takeover authority accordingly,unless we acknowledge the director interest in exercising his capacity to seek judicial review,such lead agency approvals could become final despite their noncompliance with smara standards.we thus agree with the attorney general that the legislature can not have intended the board limited lead agency takeover authority to substitute,generally,for the director authority to seek judicial review of a local lead agency approval of inadequate reclamation plans or financial assurances.
the statutes that permit a beneficially interested party to obtain a writ of mandate code civ,and a state department head to bring an action relating to the department business,subd.a both had been in effect many decades when the legislature enacted smara the legislature is deemed to have been aware of those laws and to have enacted smara in light of them.see viking pools,maloney cal d.and the legislature having authorized each department head to prosecute actions concerning matters related to the business activities and subjects under the department jurisdiction,subd.a,while not of itself creating the beneficial interest,nevertheless constitutes a recognition that such an executive ordinarily has an interest which is proper to be determined in such proceedings tieberg,supra,d at.our conclusion that the director has standing to seek judicial review of allegedly unlawful local lead agency decisionmaking thus reflects discernible legislative intent.
third,recognizing the director beneficial interest in a writ of mandate accords with our prior pronouncements,and the pronouncements of other california courts,in similar situations.see,people ex rel.younger county of el dorado cal d,attorney general had standing to enforce people beneficial right to compel counties to pay regional planning expenses triplett,supra,th at,d state through department had standing to seek writ,inter alia,because department was authorized to interpret williamson act state board of pharmacy superior court d.state board of pharmacy standing to seek writ of mandate derived from its beneficial interest in proceeding to determine attorney fees tieberg,supra,d at.director of department of employment had sufficient interest in unemployment insurance appeals board proceedings to justify seeking mandamus review.
to deny the director standing here would free surface mine operators who manage to obtain local lead agency approval of inadequate reclamation plans or financial assurances to do less than smara requires.if the reclamation plan does not require the operator to reclaim the site in accordance with smara,accomplishment of smara goal of protecting public health and safety,as well as the environment,is at risk.and if the operator financial assurances are inadequate to accomplish the reclamation plan,taxpayers are at risk of bearing the burden.thus,the director standing to pursue a writ of mandate is essential to protect th
