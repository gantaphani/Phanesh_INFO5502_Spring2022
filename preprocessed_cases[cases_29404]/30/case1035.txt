great basin mine watch petitions for review of a final rule of the environmental protection agency epa allowing nevada to split one of its clean air areas area into two lower and upper.great basin contends that the epa,by approving the split,violated its statutory and regulatory duties under the clean air act because it failed to consider the effect of a major pollution emitter,barrick goldstrike mine,in area.we deny great basin petition for review because we conclude that the epa did not act arbitrarily,capriciously,or contrary to law when it granted nevada request to divide area,and that the existence and operation of the mine did not preclude the division.
background 
the clean air act includes a program for the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality psd program,which applies to areas that are actually or potentially low in air pollution.several of the program restrictions on emissions are triggered when a major stationary source,a major pollution emitter submits an application for a permit for new construction or major modification within the area under the appropriate regulations.b ii.a central issue in the present appeal is whether the psd restrictions were triggered,or must be deemed triggered,in area by the actions of the barrick mine.great basin contends that the psd restrictions were triggered,and that as a consequence epa decision to allow division of area was impermissible.we agree with the epa,however,that the restrictions were not triggered,and that division of area was not arbitrary,capricious,or contrary to law.before we explain our reasons,we think it best to describe briefly the relevant framework of the act.
the clean air act psd program 
the clean air act regulates air pollutants such as particulate matter,sulfur dioxide,and nitrogen oxide.see.the act requires the division of states into air quality planning areas baseline areas.these baseline areas are assigned one of three,unclassifiable,or on the quality of their air.if an area fails to meet national air quality standards,it is classified as a nonattainment area.if an area meets national standards,it is classified as an attainment area.if it is unclear whether the area meets the standards,the area is denominated unclassifiable.the psd program applies to the latter two categories,and it is undisputed that area falls within them 
in attainment and unclassifiable areas,the psd program attempts to maintain the relatively clean air by limiting the total pollution increment per year.the psd restrictions are not automatic,however they come into effect when an application is filed under the appropriate regulations for new construction of a major stationary source or for major modification of an existing major source within the area.b ii.it is important for our purposes to note that application for a permit is the trigger,not simply the existence of substantial pollution emissions.the filing of such an application establishes a minor source baseline date for which the epa determines the ambient baseline concentration for the area.b,ii.thereafter,the psd program places strict limits on aggregate increases in pollution within the baseline area whether the increases come from minor or major sources.
if no major source within a baseline area has applied for a permit,however,the psd restrictions are not triggered.in that event,pollution emitters are free to operate under the less restrictive national air quality standards,rather than the stricter standards of the psd program.see,indian colony epa,cir.
discretion to redesignate baseline areas 
because the psd program is administered by baseline areas,the number and size of these areas has a very considerable effect on potential polluters.the greater the number and the smaller the size of the baseline areas,the less likely it is that a major source has applied for a permit within any one area,thereby establishing a baseline date.id.at.thus a minor source is more likely to find an area in which to operate where it is not subject to the requirements of the psd program.id.on a smaller scale,the division of one baseline area into two might have a similar effect if a major source were to seek a permit in only one of the two areas,the other might escape psd regulation that would have applied had the original area not been split.
despite this consideration,the epa has broad discretion to grant a state request to divide an area for which no baseline date or baseline concentration has been established.the epa may grant redesignation requests on the basis of air quality data,planning and control considerations,or any other air considerations the administrator deems appropriate.d a.this decision also must rely on sufficient data.a.
the situation is different when psd restrictions have already been triggered in an area.division of such an area into two new areas raises additional problems.one is the question whether one of the new areas may or should be untriggered because the major source that triggered the psd restrictions lies in the other new area.perhaps in recognition of this and other problems,the discretion of the epa is more limited when dealing with redesignation of an area for which psd restrictions have been triggered.the epa can not redesignate,for example,if the new area would intersect or be smaller than the area of impact of any major stationary source or major modification which e stablishes a minor source baseline date.b ii,b ii.moreover,the epa has indicated that it is more likely to deny a request to split an area in which the psd caps apply because the redesignation may allow greater deterioration of the air quality.
the present controversy 
this dispute arose when the state of nevada submitted its request to the epa to divide baseline area square miles into two,lower and upper.nevada claimed that the split would aid its air quality management because the two new areas more accurately reflect the local air transport processes,industrial development,and the region topography,among other reasons.much of the present dispute arises from the fact that,in nevada view,the barrick mine,although a major source,has never applied or been required to apply for a permit for new construction or a major modification.this situation presumably results from the fact either that the mine was a major source before the clean air act requirements took effect,or that it became a major source by small increments not subject to permits.nevada reflected its view in its redesignation request,in which it asserted that area does not contain any psd sources,and it has not been significantly impacted by any major source or modification,although it acknowledged that barrick goldstrike mine was a major source for,nox nitrogen oxide,and.
in response to nevada request,the epa issued a proposed rule granting the request to split area into lower and upper.see.the epa proposed to approve the request because of its policy to provide states a fair degree of autonomy to balance air quality management with economic planning and because the redesignation would not interfere with nevada management of air quality in the area.id.in concluding that the change met the statutory and regulatory requirements of the act,the epa relied on its conclusion that no psd source has located in area,and the newly created baseline areas do not intersect the area of impact of any major psd source nor do they have boundaries that are smaller than such impact area.id.
in a footnote,the proposed rule acknowledged that the barrick mine was a major source,but disregarded it because the source has not been subject to psd review.id.at.the proposed rule also stated that the redesignation did not result in an untriggering of the baseline area,and thus there was no elimination of already consumed pollution increment and no consumed increment would be added to the baseline for the area.id.at.moreover,the division did not carve out small postage stamp areas encompassing only the significant impact area around a major psd source.id.at.the epa also solicited public comment on its proposed rule.
relying on the reasons listed in the proposed rule,the epa final rule granted nevada re
