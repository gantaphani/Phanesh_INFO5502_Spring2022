introduction 
the city and county of san francisco city prevailed in this california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et writ proceeding brought by the coalition for adequate review and alliance for comprehensive planning collectively,petitioners.after securing judgment,the city filed a memorandum of costs totaling,largely for costs incurred in preparing a supplemental record of the proceedings.petitioners filed a motion to tax.the trial court granted the motion and denied all costs.the court reasoning was first,it relied on the fact petitioners had elected to prepare the record,themselves,as allowed by ceqa record preparation statute,subd.b.second,it feared sizeable cost awards would have a chilling effect on lawsuits challenging important public projects.neither rationale is a legally permissible basis for denying record preparation costs to the city.we therefore reverse in part and remand for further proceedings.
ii.factual and procedural background 
in our prior opinion affirming the denial of petitioners writ petition on the merits coalition for adequate review city and county of san francisco june,nonpub.opn,we discussed at length the land use plans,rezoning,and projects around octavia and market streets at issue in this case.we need set forth here only the facts relevant to the city appeal from the order granting petitioners motion to tax costs.
initial record preparation 
petitioners chose to prepare the record of proceedings,themselves,as permitted by ceqa record preparation statute,specifically,section,subdivision b.the city maintains it thereupon made available some pages of material to facilitate petitioners preparation of the record.petitioners contend the city,in fact,obstructed and delayed access to these documents and made the process of copying unduly cumbersome and expensive.petitioners also contend that at the day before they were,by agreement,to present the record to the city for its review and certification,the city suddenly notified them of an additional pages of material and a cd of unknown volume,and claimed it was going to prepare a supplemental record containing these items.the city did not produce this material to petitioners until a few weeks later.nevertheless,on august,the date,petitioners presented the city with a volume record,totaling pages in length.
two weeks later,on september,the city certified the record petitioners had prepared,but only in part,stating it was incomplete.it appeared to the city that petitioners had omitted documents statutorily required to be in the record under section,subdivision e,and which the city had,at least at some point,made available to petitioners.the city therefore notified petitioners it reserved the right to seek inclusion of any of the additional plus pages of material it had produced to petitioners which were not already in the record.
the city then made several attempts to add materials to the record both through ex parte applications and by negotiations with petitioners.during negotiations,the city proposed augmenting the record when it filed its opposition to the writ petition in order to avoid including unnecessary materials.
as part of a november,case management statement,the city attached an index of its proposed additions to the record,totaling pages in volumes.a month later,on december,the city formally moved to supplement the record of the proceedings with these volumes.
petitioners opposed the motion.they argued they were in control of the record,and the city had no right to make additions.they also asserted the city sought to add irrelevant and duplicative materials,and the proposed supplement was a ploy to raise costs.petitioners denied having excluded from the record any materials that supported the city approval of the project.
the city disputed petitioners contentions about the proposed supplemental record,except for documents which it acknowledged were duplicates or near duplicates of materials already in the record prepared by petitioners.the city also maintained it timely produced most of the required documents,except for certain studies cited in the eir,which it made available to petitioners after learning of the omission.
on may,the trial court judge feinstein granted the city motion to supplement the record,finding petitioners had omitted materials statutorily required to be in the record under section,subdivision e.it disallowed,however,the concededly duplicative documents approximately pages of the page proposed supplement.the court also expressly rejected petitioners assertion that the city efforts to supplement the record violated its statutory duty to control record preparation costs,set forth in section,subdivision f.the court noted in this regard petitioners had rejected the city proposal to file a supplemental record when it filed its opposition to the writ petition and,instead,had insisted the record be fixed before briefing on the merits.the court also ruled w ithout prejudice to the city ability to seek cost recovery at the conclusion of this litigation,as appropriate,petitioners shall pay to the city the reproduction costs associated with petitioners copy and the court copy of the city supplement.petitioners moved for rehearing,arguing the immediate order to pay for reproduction costs was improper.in august,the court denied rehearing,concluding the issue of interim reproduction costs had been briefed and properly determined 
document requests 
in addition to the supplemental record dispute,the parties also sparred over whether certain document requests petitioners made at the outset of the litigation were overbroad and burdensome.petitioners,for instance,requested production of a ll files relating to all projects,including all proposed developments,public works and building projects and building permits of any kind that are either within the pipeline or not within the pipeline but within the market octavia project area emphasis omitted.the city viewed these requests as creating busywork unrelated to the writ petition.petitioners viewed them as essential to their writ petition,and even without regard to the pending litigation,legitimate under the state public record act,et and city sunshine ordinance.
merits hearing and cost proceedings 
ultimately,the trial court judge sullivan denied the petition for writ of mandate on the merits.in so doing,the court adopted a lengthy proposed statement of decision prepared by the city.the statement largely cited to the record prepared by petitioners,but made a few citations to the supplemental record.
the city then filed a memorandum of costs,seeking for administrative record,professional messenger,and service.this included for production copying,binding,and page numbering of the supplemental record for production copying and binding of a excerpts of record the petitioners had charged the city for a copy of the record they prepared for paralegal time for city planning department time and for professional couriers.
petitioners moved to tax costs.they maintained section,subdivision b pursuant to which petitioners had prepared the record precluded the recovery of any record preparation costs by the city.they also specifically objected to the city claimed costs related to the excerpts of record,paralegal and staff costs,and courier fees,and additionally claimed that,even if allowable,all the costs were unnecessary and unreasonable.in the latter regard,petitioners maintained the supplemental record played no meaningful role in the resolution of the writ petition.the city opposed the motion on all grounds.
following a hearing,the trial court judge sullivan issued an order granting the motion to tax and denying all costs.the court concluded petitioners were not liable for costs under section b,reasoning the city,not petitioners,sought to supplement the record and therefore the city should bear the cost of supplementation.ancillary to this conclusion,the court concluded petitioners discovery requests were not extraordinary and not the but for cause of the city claimed costs.the court further concluded a cost award as large as the city sought would certainly chill any desire by members of the general public to seek court review of important civic undertakings,observing petitioners had made neither a frivolous nor bad faith challenge to an important project.the city timely appealed.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
the standard of review applicable to a cost order depends on the issue raised on appeal.when the question is whether a claimed cost comes within the general cost statutes and is recoverable at all,the question is one of statutory interpretation,subject to de novo review.baker hoey lockheed martin th,d.similarly,the interpretation of ceqa record preparation provisions set forth in public resources code section,subdivisions a f,presents a question of law subject to de novo review.hayward area planning city of hayward th,d hayward area planning.whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the litigation,however,presents a question of fact for the trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.gorman tassajara development th,d gorman,quoting ladas california state auto.th,d.similarly,w hether a particular cost to prepare an administrative record was necessary and reasonable is an issue for the sound discretion of the trial court.california oak foundation regents of the university of california th,d california oak foundation,quoting river valley preservation project metropolitan transit development bd.th,d river valley.
ceqa record preparation statute 
public resources code section is one of several statutes spelling out the procedures for challenging a ceqa determination.see pub.resources code,et the statute applies to any ceqa challenge,whether brought as a traditional mandamus proceeding under code of civil procedure section pub.resources code,or as an administrative mandamus proceeding under code of civil procedure section pub.resources code.it addresses both the preparation of the record of proceedings upon the commencement of an action pub.resources code,subds.a f and the preparation of the clerk transcript on appeal if an appeal is taken from the judgment in such an action,subd.g.see madera oversight coalition,county of madera th,fn.d madera oversight coalition c are must be taken to distinguish the administrative record,the record of proceedings from the record on appeal,disapproved on other grounds by neighbors for smart rail exposition metro line construction authority cal th,d.we are concerned here with the preparation of the record of proceedings 
section provides flexibility as to how the record of proceedings is prepared.the traditional procedure is set forth in subdivision a,which provides in pertinent part at the time the action or proceeding is filed,the plaintiff or petitioner shall file a request that the respondent public agency prepare the record of proceedings the request,together with the complaint or petition,shall be served personally upon the public agency not later than business days from the date that the action or proceeding was filed,subd.a.the statute also provides for other record preparation options to help reduce record preparation costs.subdivision b,thus,provides the plaintiff or petitioner may elect to prepare the record of proceedings or the parties may agree to an alternative method of preparation of the record of proceedings,subject to certification of its accuracy by the public agency,within the time limit specified in this subdivision,subd.b see generally vincent school for boys,catholic charities cyo city of san rafael th,d vincent school.
additional specifics with respect to the handling of the record are set forth in subdivision b.it provides the public agency shall prepare and certify the record of proceedings not later than days from the date that the request specified in subdivision a was served upon the public agency.upon certification,the public agency shall lodge a copy of the record of proceedings with the court and shall serve on the parties notice that the record of proceedings has been certified and lodged with the court.the parties shall pay any reasonable costs or fees imposed for the preparation of the record of proceedings in conformance with any law or rule of court,subd.b.subdivision c,in turn,provides the day period for certification may be extended by stipulation of the parties or by court order,subd.c.
thus,ceqa record preparation cost provision,in particular,appears at the end of the subdivision that begins by spelling out an agency day certification obligation upon being served with a request to prepare the record,subd.a or upon being provided with a record prepared by the petitioner or party or by some other,means,subd.b.the cost provision,by its plain terms,places the costs an agency incurs in preparing the record on the parties,not the public agency.see black historical society city of san diego th,d black historical society.the rationale for doing so is that taxpayers should not have to bear the cost of preparing the administrative record in a lawsuit brought by a private individual or entity.black historical society,supra,th at,quoting river valley,supra,th at.
accordingly,a petitioner can be ordered to pay for a requested record during the early stages of the litigation,before the merits of the case are ever heard.see,san diego citizenry group county of san diego th,d san diego citizenry prior to merits hearing,the county moved for an order determining and directing payment of record preparation costs court issued single ruling both denying relief on the merits and ordering reimbursement of record preparation costs black historical society,supra,th at,when petitioner failed to pay agency record preparation costs after agency request that it do so,followed by a court order that it do so,trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing case for lack of prosecution.indeed,a public agency can refuse to release a record it has been asked to prepare until the petitioner making the request has paid the agency preparation costs.black historical society,at.
this does not mean a public agency can charge a petitioner or party whatever it wants for preparing the record.section,subdivision f,mandates the party preparing the record shall strive to do so at reasonable cost in light of the scope of the record,subd.f see generally vincent school,supra,th at pp.discussing the policy embodied in section.a petitioner can also,by interim motion,challenge an agency record preparation charge as excessive or unreasonable.see,river valley,supra,th at,during initial stages of the litigation,petitioner filed motion to determine the costs of preparing the administrative record.similarly,a petitioner can,by interim motion,challenge a record prepared by a public agency as being incomplete or as including documents not properly part of the record.see,citizens for ceres superior court th,during early stages of litigation,petitioner filed objection to certified record claiming city exclusion of documents on and work product grounds was erroneous appellate court granted interlocutory writ review of trial court interim order and granted writ relief in part madera oversight coalition,supra,th at pp.case management order specified record disputes were to be raised no later than merits briefing petitioners then filed multiple requests that certified record be augmented,which trial court ruled on at same time it ruled on merits.
with this overview of ceqa record preparation statute,we turn to the principal issue on appeal whether petitioners election to prepare the record,themselves,under section,subdivision b,precludes an award of record preparation costs to the city.
c.a pe titioner election to prepare the record does not preclude a public agency from recovering supplemental record prep aration costs when incurred to e nsure a statutorily complete record 
petitioners maintain the whole point of ceqa alternative record preparation provisions is to avoid agency preparation costs,and,therefore,their election to prepare the record under section,subdivision b,precludes any award of such costs to the city.the trial court appears to have taken a more nuanced approach and concluded a petitioner election under subdivision b precludes an agency from recovering record preparation costs except in extraordinary circumstances like those in vincent school.
in vincent school,the plaintiff also chose to prepare the record.vincent school,supra.app th at.to enable it to do so,the city was required to locate documents,totaling more than pages,which ultimately took up more than boxes.id.at.noting few were included,the plaintiff filed a public records act,et request asking the city for all writings evidencing or reflecting communications,stored on any city computer hard drive or server relating to the property in question.vincent school,at.this required the city to review nine more boxes of materials.ibid.after the city provided copies of all responsive,nonprivileged documents,the petitioner made yet another demand to inspect documents.id.at pp.before this last set of demands was resolved,the plaintiff filed its merits brief in support of its writ petition.id.at.after the city prevailed on the merits,it sought and was awarded in costs incurred in searching its computer files.id.at.
the court of appeal affirmed.it first addressed and rejected the same argument the plaintiffs make here that because the plaintiff chose to prepare the record under subdivision b,the city was foreclosed from recovering any record preparation costs.vincent school,supra,th at pp.the court pointed out the city was not seeking to recover the entire cost for preparation.id.at.it further concluded disallowing the city costs would undermine the policies embodied in section,subdivision f,and reward the petitioner for abusive document demands.vincent school,at pp.vincent actions,which caused the city to expend considerable time and resources in responding to its discovery demands,reflect a complete abandonment of its statutory responsibility to strive to prepare the record at reasonable cost.id.at.the appellate court thus concluded section does not preclude an award of costs in favor of the city.ibid.it also concluded the trial court had not abused its discretion as to the amount awarded.ibid.
we agree with vincent school that the fact a petitioner elects to prepare the record under section,subdivision b,does not ipso facto bar the recovery of record preparation costs by a public agency.subdivision b contains no such prohibition.moreover,that subdivision expressly refers to and incorporates the day period for record certification set forth in the first sentence of subdivision b,subd.b.thus,the two subdivisions are.the record preparation cost provision specifying the parties,not the public agency,are to pay for the record is,as we have discussed,set forth in the third and final sentence of subdivision b and,significantly,does not refer to any particular means by which the record is prepared,subd.b.finally,as vincent school recognized,the fact a petitioner makes an election to proceed under subdivision b,does not mean the agency will never,under any circumstances,incur record preparation costs.
the trial court appears to have read vincent school as identifying the only circumstance in which an agency can recoup record preparation costs where the petitioner has chosen to prepare the record under subdivision b,where the petitioner has made extraordinary production demands purportedly in connection with its preparation of the record.the appellate court did not suggest,however,it was doing anything other than addressing the particular circumstances before it.we therefore do not read vincent school as drawing the bounds of an agency recovery of record preparation costs where the petitioner has opted to prepare the record under subdivision b.
there is no question the alternative record preparation procedures authorized by section,subdivision b,are intended to reduce record preparation costs.see generally hayward area planning,supra,th at pp.discussing cost control provisions of.
but just as a record prepared by an agency at the request of a petitioner under subdivision a must be complete,so,too,must a record prepared by alternative means under subdivision b.see,subd.e see madera oversight coalition,supra,th at r egardless of which record preparation method is chosen,the administrative record is subject to certification of its accuracy by the public agency quoting,subd.b.when a record prepared under subdivision b is incomplete,and an agency is put to the task of supplementation to ensure completeness,the language of the statute allows,and the purpose of the record preparation cost provision to protect public monies counsels,that the agency recoup the costs of preparing the supplemental record.
ceqa is clear about what the record must contain it shall include,at a minimum,the documents enumerated in section,subdivision e.see san diego citizenry,supra,th at pp.subdivision e specifies the materials required to be in the record.this language is mandatory all items described in any of the enumerated categories shall be included in the administrative record.madera,supra,th at see also eureka citizens for responsible government city of eureka th,d content of administrative records in ceqa proceedings is governed by section,subdivision e.
we see no reason why parties can not agree to a smaller and thus less expensive record if it will provide the court with all the materials relevant to the issue s raised by the petitioner.see,subds.b the parties may agree to an alternative method of preparation of the record of proceedings,f party preparing the record shall strive to do so at reasonable cost in light of the scope of the record kostka zischke,practice under the cal.environmental quality act,parties should consider stipulating to exclude extraneous documents from the record.
however,where no such agreement is reached,a public agency is not required to put itself at risk of a statutorily incomplete record.see county of orange superior court th,d when it comes to the administrative record in a ceqa case,any reduction in its contents is presumptively prejudicial to project proponents,as it is they who will be saddled with the task of pointing to things in the record to refute asserted inadequacies in the eir,italics omitted protect our water county of merced th,d the consequences of providing a record to the courts that does not evidence the agency compliance with ceqa is severe reversal of project approval.madera,supra,th at friends of lagoon valley city of vacaville th,d because it risked reversal of the project approval if the record lacked supporting evidence,triad properly took pains to ensure the court was provided with a complete record of all relevant proceedings.
here,the city offered to defer supplementation of the record until it filed its opposition to the writ petition,since only then would it know with certainty what additional materials,if any,were pertinent to its defense of the project approval.petitioners,however,rejected this suggestion and,instead,insisted the record be fixed before they filed their opening merits brief.
moreover,the city did not unilaterally prepare a supplemental record.rather,it filed a motion for leave to do so,identifying the documents it intended to include.petitioners filed opposition,making some of the same arguments they have made in opposition to the city claimed record preparation costs.the trial court granted the city motion,but not entirely,excluding from the supplemental record documents that essentially duplicated documents already included in the record petitioners had prepared.as to the documents the trial court allowed,it expressly found they were statutorily required to be in the record under section,subdivision e.the court also expressly found the city preparation of a supplemental record to include these documents did not violate the city obligation under subdivision f to minimize record preparation costs.in our prior opinion we affirmed the court supplementation order,including on the ground petitioners failed to carry their burden on appeal to demonstrate error.coalition for adequate review city and county of san francisco,supra.
under these circumstances,we have no trouble concluding the city was effectively put to the task of preparing a statutorily complete record and,therefore,may recover its re
