the merced river flows through the glaciated yosemite valley and then cuts more steeply,westward,through the merced river gorge and some of the region oldest rock formations.this appeal challenges the sufficiency of the remedy granted by the district court in friends of yosemite valley norton,d.the district court granted only part of the declaratory and injunctive relief sought by friends of yosemite valley and mariposans for environmentally responsible growth collectively,friends against the national park service nps for alleged deficiencies in the merced wild and scenic river comprehensive management plan cmp.friends contends that the nps failed to prepare a valid cmp to protect and enhance the natural values of the merced river,thereby violating the wild and scenic rivers act wsra,et,the national environmental policy act nepa,et,and the administrative procedures act apa,et.the district court rejected each of friends claims.
we agree with friends that the cmp inadequately addresses user capacities by failing to set the maximum quantity of use for the river area and too narrowly defines the boundaries for the el portal segment of the merced and,therefore,we reverse in part.we affirm in part,however,because the district court correctly determined that the cmp data and information satisfied the requirements of both the wsra and nepa,it had jurisdiction over friends water pollution claim under the wsra,and the nps cooperated with the environmental protection agency and the california regional water quality control board.
procedural background 
in a prior action challenging the nps failure to comply with the wsra by neglecting to develop a cmp for the merced,the district court ordered the agency to prepare and adopt a valid comprehensive management plan pursuant to d in regard to the merced river as designated under the wsra no later than twelve months after the entry of this decision.sierra club babbitt,d.following a brief extension of the deadline,and after completing the nepa process,the nps published the merced wild and scenic river comprehensive management plan on august,with a revised record of decision being signed on november.
in the present litigation,friends challenges the validity of the cmp following a bench trial on november,the district court ruled that the nps did not violate the court prior sierra club order requiring the agency to prepare and adopt a valid cmp pursuant to d,and concluded that the cmp as issued did not violate the wsra,nepa,or the apa.friends of yosemite valley,d at.
on appeal,friends argues that the cmp inadequately address es user capacities,in violation of the wsra,d the boundaries selected by the nps for the portion of the river flowing through el portal disregard the wsra mandate that the river area must be administered in such manner as to protect and enhance the values which caused it to be included in the wild and scenic rivers system,a the nps prepared the cmp which incorporates the final eis as a programmatic document and,as such,it contains insufficiently specific data and information,in violation of the wsra,d,a,nepa,et,and nepa implementing regulations,et and the nps has failed to cooperate with federal and state agencies to eliminate or reduce pollution of the merced river,in violation of the wsra,c.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over this appeal under.we review the district court findings of fact after a bench trial for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.see zivkovic cal.edison,cir.we review the nps actions under the wsra and nepa pursuant to the apa,which states that a decision may be set aside only if it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.hells canyon alliance united states forest,cir.
the determination whether the nps acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner rests on whether it articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.pub.citizen dot,cir.c ourts must carefully review the record to ensure that agency decisions are founded on a reasoned evaluation of the relevant factors,and may not administrative decisions that they deem inconsistent with a statutory mandate or that frustrate the congressional policy underlying a statute id.nevertheless,we may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency but must simply ensure that the agency has adequately considered and disclosed the environmental impact of its actions,bearing in mind that nepa exists to ensure a process,not particular substantive results.hells canyon,at.
iii.the merced river 
a.the wild and scenic rivers act 
congress enacted the wsra in to identify and protect certain rivers which,with their immediate environments,possess outstandingly remarkable scenic,recreational,geologic,fish and wildlife,historic,cultural,or other similar values.the wsra establishes that its component rivers shall be preserved in condition,and that they and their immediate environments shall be protected for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations.id.in addition to initially designating certain rivers to the national wild and scenic rivers system wsrs,see id.a a,the wsra provided that other rivers may be added to the wsrs,including through congressional amendment of the wsra.see id.a i.
the wsra protects designated wsrs segments and surrounding areas by implementing certain conservation measures.see id.restricting construction of water resources projects,such as dams,water conduits,and reservoirs id.restricting sale of public lands id.providing regulatory authority over new mining and mineral leasing claims.it also sets forth a framework for ongoing management of designated wsrs areas.
the location of a wsrs segment determines whether it is administered by the secretary of the interior,including the nps,or the secretary of agriculture.see id.c,d.the administering agency must manage each wsrs segment in such manner as to protect and enhance the values which caused it to be included in said system without,insofar as is consistent therewith,limiting other uses that do not substantially interfere with public use and enjoyment of these values.id.a.p rimary emphasis is to be given to protecting esthetic,scenic,historic,archaeologic,and scientific features.id.management plans for any wsrs component may establish varying degrees of intensity for its protection and development,based on the special attributes of the area.id.nevertheless,to the extent that the wsra conflicts with the wilderness act,id,or statutes administering the national park system and national wildlife system,the wsra mandates that the more restrictive provisions shall apply.id.b,c.
the wsra also requires the administering agency to take such action respecting management policies,regulations,contracts,and plans as may be necessary to protect such rivers in accordance with the wsra,and cooperate with the environmental protection agency and appropriate state water pollution control agencies for the purpose of eliminating or diminishing the pollution of waters of the river.id.a,c.
the designation of a river as part of the wsrs triggers several statutory deadlines.first,within one year of the designation,the administering agency is required to establish detailed boundaries for the river that shall include an average of not more than acres of land per mile measured from the ordinary high water mark on both sides of the river.id.b.second,the administering agency must prepare a comprehensive management plan to provide for the protection of the river values,within three full fiscal years of the designation.id.d.the cmp shall address resource protection,development of lands and facilities,user capacities,and other management practices necessary or desirable to achieve the wsra purposes.id.
designation of the merced 
in,congress designated segments of the merced river to the wsrs,including sections flowing through yosemite national park yosemite and yosemite administrative site,el portal.see an act to amend the wild and scenic rivers act by designating a segment of the merced river in california as a component of the national wild and scenic rivers system,pub,stat,codified at a a designating approximately miles of the merced main stem and approximately miles of its south fork.the nps administers the approximately miles of the designated section falling within national park lands.the remainder of the merced designated portion is administered by the secretary of the interior through the forest service and the bureau of land management.
in designating the merced,congress also provided that the establishment of wsra boundaries for,and classification of,those parts of the merced falling within yosemite or el portal would be accomplished through amendment of the general management plan for yosemite.congress mandated that any such amendment shall assure that no development or use of park lands shall be undertaken that is inconsistent with the designation of such river segments.a a.
c.the merced river cmp 
the cmp provides seven management elements that govern all future actions affecting the designated portions of the merced under the nps administration.in an effort to comply with specific provisions of the wsra,the cmp delineates river area boundaries,see b classifies segments of the designated section as wild,scenic,or recreational,see describes the outstandingly remarkable values orvs of each area,see id,a and provides for compliance with the wsra restrictions on water resources projects,see id.additionally,the cmp establishes a minimum buffer zone called the river protection overlay rpo creates management zones for lands within the selected boundaries and institutes a framework called visitor experience and resource protection.because the latter three management concepts are not specifically mentioned in the wsra,but are instead promulgated in the cmp,we describe them more fully below.
river protection overlay 
the rpo is a minimum buffer zone that extends outward from the river channel to a distance of or feet,depending on the elevation,from the merced ordinary high water mark.the cmp provides relatively stringent limits on actions to be taken within the rpo.for example,nonessential facilities,such as bridges,roads,buildings,and levees,can be located within the rpo only if they satisfy two conditions they must be required for access to or across the river,for health or safety,or for maintenance of historic properties and they could not perform their functions if they could not be located within the rpo.the cmp permits nonessential facilities already existing within the rpo to remain,however,and to be replaced,repaired,or relocated within the rpo only if such action does not directly and adversely affect orvs.the cmp also allows for the construction,replacement,repair,and relocation of essential facilities such as primary roads and electrical infrastructure within the riverbed and banks if the project is designed to minimize impacts to the condition of the river,its tributaries,and backwaters.
management zoning 
the cmp defines management zones as areas for which management directions or prescriptions have been developed to determine what can and can not occur in terms of resource management,visitor use,access,facilities or development,and park operations.the purpose of management zoning is to provide overall guidance for over the long term.category wilderness zones describe areas having the lowest degree of visitor and facility use.areas falling within category diverse visitor experience zones have at most a moderate range of facility development.category developed zones are characterized by intense visitor use or more developed facilities,or both.these general zoning categories are further subdivided by letter to reflect increasingly intense use within each category.
visitor experience and resource protection 
the nps describes the visitor experience and resource protection verp element as the primary mechanism for addressing user capacity as required by d.in lieu of specific numerical limits on visitors,which the nps claims would be insufficiently precise given the wide variety of resources and patterns of usage in yosemite,the verp framework focuses on the prescription and maintenance of selected desired conditions.
the cmp explains that the verp framework provides an ongoing,iterative process of determining desired conditions including desired cultural resource conditions,desired natural resource conditions,and desired visitor experiences,selecting and monitoring indicators and standards that reflect these desired conditions,and taking management action when the desired conditions are not being realized.the cmp,however,establishes no specific indicators or standards to implement the verp process instead,it provides examples,such as measuring the percentage of bare ground or exposed roots in a particular area and the number of people encountered on a trail within a particular time frame as possible indicators for protecting biological and recreational orvs,respectively,from excessive degradation due to overuse.the verp thus anticipates that user capacities would be addressed by monitoring user impact on the environment,and taking management action to maintain acceptable environmental conditions.
iv.analysis 
user capacities 
the district court erred in determining that the cmp adequately address ed user capacities as required by d.the current cmp is deficient in its approach to user capacities because its principal method for addressing user capacities,the verp framework,contains only sample standards and indicators.thus,the cmp fails to yield any actual measure of user capacities,whether by setting limits on the specific number of visitors,by monitoring and maintaining environmental and experiential criteria under the verp framework,or through some other method.
the wsra explicitly requires administering agencies to prepare a cmp that shall address user capacities within three full fiscal years of a wsrs segment designation.id.d.however,d does not define the phrase address user capacities.in the absence of a statutory definition of the phrase,we look to the plain meaning of its terms.see hells canyon alliance,at.address means to deal with or discuss.random house webster college dictionary.user is defined as a person or thing that avails oneself of something,id.at,and capacity is the maximum number that can be received or contained.id.at.thus,applied to this case,the plain meaning of the phrase address user capacities,is simply that the cmp must deal with or discuss the maximum number of people that can be received at a wsrs.based on this plain meaning,we do not read d to require that the administering agency advance one particular approach to visitor capacity in all circumstances,a head count of all entrants to yosemite.
this interpretation of d is buttressed by the interpretive guidelines jointly published in by the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of the interior.these secretarial guidelines are crafted to facilitate greater consistency in the agencies interpretation of the wsra.see national wild and scenic rivers system final revised guidelines for eligibility,classification and management of river areas,fed.reg,the secretarial guidelines.we defer to the secretarial guidelines as an exercise of the administering agencies authority to resolve ambiguities in the statute they administer.see united states mead,d.
the secretarial guidelines interpret the wsra to require the preparation of river m anagement plans that state the kinds and amounts of public use which the river area can sustain without impact to the orvs,and to mandate ongoing studies to determine the quantity and mixture of recreation and other public use which can be permitted without adverse impact on the resource values of the river area.fed.reg.at.although these references to setting limits on the amount or quantity of public use clarify that the wsra obliges the administering agency to provide actual limits in its cmp,the secretarial guidelines do not specify that this obligation can be satisfied only by capping the number of visitors.thus,we interpret d instruction that a cmp must address user capacities to require only that the cmp contain specific measurable limits on use.see also id.at explaining that a states a nondegradation and enhancement policy for all designated river areas,regardless of classification.
this does not mean that the nps is precluded from using the verp to fulfill the user capacities requirement.however,the wsra does require that the verp be implemented through the adoption of quantitative measures sufficient to ensure its effectiveness as a current measure of user capacities.if the nps is correct in projecting that it will need five years fully to implement the verp,it may be able to comply with the user capacity mandate in the interim by implementing preliminary or temporary limits of some kind.
because the present version of the cmp fails to provide any concrete measure of use,we conclude that it fails sufficiently to address user capacities.indeed,we note that the nps proposed timetable for the implementation of the verp framework would not satisfy d timetable even if the nps were to have begun implementation of the verp immediately upon congress designation of the merced.on remand,the nps shall adopt specific limits on user capacity consistent with both the wsra and the instruction of the secretarial guidelines that such limits describe an actual level of visitor use that will not adversely impact the merced orvs.
wsra boundaries at el portal 
the nps violated the wsra by drawing the boundaries at the merced el portal administrative site too narrowly.the wsra requires a cmp to delineate river boundaries that include an average of not more than acres of land per mile measured from the ordinary high water mark on both sides of the river.b.the cmp sets the river boundaries for the miles of the merced that do not flow through el portal at a distance of mile from the ordinary high water mark on either side of the river.these boundaries are consistent with the statutory maximum.however,for the approximately four miles flowing through el portal,the cmp sets the river boundaries to include only the greater of the rpo or the floodplain,plus adjacent wetlands and meadows.
we have not yet decided a case involving wsra river boundaries,but one of our sister circuits has reasoned that the setting of boundaries is an administrative act that falls within the agency statutory duty to administer the river area in such manner as to protect and enhance the orvs which caused it to be included in the wsrs.sokol kennedy,cir remanding for redetermination of boundaries consistent with a.although sokol involved boundaries that were potentially overinclusive,because they were not drawn on the basis of the outstandingly remarkable values criterion,we agree with the eighth circuit analytic approach.accordingly,we conclude that the boundaries at el portal are deficient because they were not devised pursuant to a protection and enhancement mandate.
while the cmp associates specific orvs with el portal,the record does not reflect the precise location of these orvs or how,in drawing the boundaries,the nps sought to protect them.the cmp lists five categories of orvs for el portal,and provides the following descriptions 
geologic segment contains a transition from igneous to metasedimentary rocks metasedimentary rocks are among the oldest in the sierra nevada.
segment provides a range of recreational opportunities,in particular rafting and kayaking class iii to v and fishing.
segment contains riverine habitats such as riparian woodlands and associated federal and state special status species,including tompkin sedge and valley elderberry longhorn beetle and its critical habitat elderberry shrub.expanses of habitat allow unlimited access to the riparian zone for wildlife species.
segment contains some of the oldest archeological sites in the yosemite area,as well as many historic indian villages and traditional gathering places.historic resources include structures related to early tourism and industrial development.
hydrological segment is characterized by continuous rapids.
the el portal segment also falls under the general scientific orv identified by the cmp for the river main stem because the river watershed is largely within designated wilderness in yosemite national park.
the record reflects that some of el portal orvs are not protected by the present boundaries and,indeed,that not all of el portal orvs have been fully located.for example,the cmp points out a significant deficiency with respect to el portal cultural orvs 
a systematic inventory for ethnographic resources has not been undertaken for el portal s everal individuals and families have traditional ties to this area.redbud,willow,sourberry,and other plant materials are known to be gathered here.there are at least three known cemeteries,two of which were used in historic times and are the burial places for ancestors of some local indian families.
in addition,although the cmp notes that a comprehensive evaluation of cultural landscapes and historic structures at the el portal administrative site,based on national register criteria,has been completed,it does not discuss whether such landscapes and structures are located within the present boundaries or if their protection and enhancement were considered when the boundaries were drawn.indeed,the record reflects that nps employees expressed concern about the effect of the boundaries on cultural orvs during the drafting stage of the cmp.for example,one employee noted that there are archeological sites,considered part of the cultural resource orv in el portal,that lie outside the ea r floodplain that would be directly and adversely affected by administrative purposes,construction of employee housing at hillside west.such omissions demonstrate that the cmp boundaries at el portal could not possibly have been promulgated to protect and enhance such orvs.
in concluding that the river boundaries at el portal were improperly drawn,we do not,as the nps fears,establish a preference for includ ing the absolute maximum number of acres on every part of the designated river,or place a special burden of justification on an agency if it chooses less than the absolute maximum average.instead,we hold that there is one burden of justification that generally applies to an administering agency determination of river boundaries boundaries set within the wsra acreage requirement,regardless where such boundaries fall within the statutory range,must be drawn so as to protect and enhance the orvs causing that area to be included within the wsrs.see a sokol,at fed.reg.at.because the nps failed to apply this standard,the cmp present boundaries at el portal were not determined in accordance with law.accordingly,on remand the nps must redetermine the river area boundaries at el portal under the proper standard.see a.
specificity of data and information in the cmp 
with the exception of the user capacities and river boundaries discussed above,the cmp was prepared with sufficiently specific data and information to satisfy a goal of protecting and enhancing orvs.moreover,the cmp contains satisfactory detail under both the wsra and nepa to fulfill its role as a programmatic management plan.
the wild and scenic rivers act 
the wsra itself supplies little guidance as to the data and information requirements for a cmp.the wsra only qualitative instruction concerning a designated river management plan is its use of the descriptive term comprehensive,which the statute does not define.nonetheless,the cmp,purportedly based upon the best data available at the time the plan was drafted,including nearly years of study and observation of river processes,falls well within the ordinary meaning of comprehensive.the statute requirement that a cmp be completed within three full fiscal years of designation demonstrates that congress envisioned a limit on the amount of additional data to be gathered.see d.
the wsra also requires the cmp to address resource protection,development of lands and facilities,user capacities,and other management practices necessary or desirable to achieve the purposes of the wsra.id.for reasons discussed above,d use of the word address,absent further statutory definition,indicates that the courts should defer to the agency reasonable determination of the
