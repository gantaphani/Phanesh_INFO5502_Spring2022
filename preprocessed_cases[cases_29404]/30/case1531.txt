chemical waste management,cwm appeals the district court may,opinion and order dated nunc pro tunc to march,denying its request for reimbursement from the united states for costs incurred in cleaning up portions of a polluted ravine basket creek site or site in douglasville,georgia.see,bush,d cnsi joint appendix ja.pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,et,the environmental protection agency epa or government in had ordered cwm and others to clean up the basket creek site,into which cwm through other parties had dumped at least drums of hazardous chemical waste.having expended nearly million in cleanup costs,cwm sought reimbursement for removing a certain amount of waste for which,it alleges,it was not responsible.cwm argued in the district court that it was not required to exhaust before the therefore could present to the claim that the waste from the drums was geographically divisible from the rest of the waste such that it was entitled to a partial reimbursement for costs not associated with the drums it had proven its geographic divisibility theory by a preponderance of the evidence,as required by cercla and the restatement second of torts and the government had not carried its ensuing upon it by the district court in a december,producing evidence linking to the site any further waste from cwm beyond the drums.declining to decide whether it via a different district judge had erred in placing that burden on the government,see cnsi,d at,the district court held that the government had in fact sustained the burden in any event,id.at,and entered judgment in its favor.we affirm the court decision but on a slightly different ground.we hold that the burden of proving that only cwm barrels were dumped at the site was always cwm to bear and that it has not proven,by a preponderance of the evidence on the record before us,that it is not liable for any additional waste at the site.
during the cwm collected and stored liquid chemical waste materials in drums at its barnwell,south carolina facility.in july cwm hired continental trading company continental to remove hundreds of the drums from barnwell.based on its knowledge of each of the chemicals to be removed,cwm recommended to continental that it sell,reprocess for sale,incinerate or solidify and bury the drums to be removed.see ja,cwm inventory as of may,listing chemicals,number of drums containing each chemical and recommended methods of drums disposal continental subsequently arranged with young refining corporation young owned and operated by young young to store cwm drums at young douglasville,georgia facility until continental could arrange for the waste to be sold,reprocessed for sale,incinerated or buried.between july and february continental transported from barnwell to douglasville approximately drums of chemical waste.
although young incinerated some unknown portion of the waste in the barrels at the douglasville facility,much of it could not be burned because it lacked sufficient btu value or contained water.moreover,the waste emitted a noxious odor when burned and,as a result,the georgia environmental protection division epd objected to its incineration.thereafter,young halted incineration.according to the parties stipulations,continental and young records indicate that on or about september,continental advanced young to move drums containing waste that could not be incinerated or reprocessed at a rate of per drum to young borden springs,alabama facility.ja.young deposition testimony indicated,however,that few if any of the drums or so,if the arithmetic holds made it to borden springs.in early march young arranged with one bartlett hulsey to transfer chemical waste from the douglasville facility to what hulsey claimed was a licensed disposal site.according to young testimony,hulsey stated that he would be willing and able to dispose of cwm drums,all or most of which apparently remained at young facility 
q y ou reached an agreement on a specific figure

a i do remember a specific number.he said,i can dispose of those drums for you.we had them off to themselves sitting on the ground in the back of the plant 
q how many drums were there 
a where at our plant 
q yes,there at the plant that you had gotten from cwm and continental that hulsey was going to move for you
