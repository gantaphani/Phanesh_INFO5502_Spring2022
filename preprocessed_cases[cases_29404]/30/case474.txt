the kalamazoo river study group krsg,an unincorporated association of paper manufacturers,brought suit in federal district court pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act of cercla,seeking contribution from rockwell international corporation for the latter role in contaminating the kalamazoo river with polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs.in a bifurcated bench trial,the district court first determined that rockwell release of pcbs into the kalamazoo river was significant enough for it to face liability under cercla.but the district court ultimately declined to allocate any response costs to rockwell,finding that its release of pcbs was minuscule less than of in comparison with that of the companies comprising the krsg.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
this case arises from the presence of pcbs in a portion of the kalamazoo river located in the state of michigan.the substance is a synthetic liquid with many industrial uses.it is also a hazardous material that poses significant health and environmental risks.because of these risks,the manufacture of pcbs ceased in the.at approximately the same time,the state agency now known as the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq began studying the level of pcbs in the kalamazoo river.the mdeq completed its initial investigation in,concluding that a mile stretch of the river was contaminated with pcbs.this stretch begins at the confluence of the kalamazoo river with portage creek,and continues downstream to the allegan city dam.
based upon the findings of the mdeq,the united states environmental protection agency epa placed this portion of the river,along with a portion of portage creek,on the national priorities list as a superfund site pursuant to of cercla collectively,the site.the epa subsequently authorized the mdeq to conduct an assessment of the site.following the,the mdeq identified three paper mills as being potentially responsible for the pcb contamination georgia pacific corporation,millennium holdings,incorporated,and plainwell,incorporated.these companies then entered into an administrative order by consent aoc that required them to fund a remedial investigation and feasibility study at the site and its surrounding area.fort james operating company later agreed to share the costs of the,joining with the other companies to form the krsg.
pursuant to the aoc,the encompassed a mile stretch of the kalamazoo river running both upstream and downstream from the site.this expanded area included the portion of the river that is adjacent to the former site of rockwell manufacturing facility in allegan,michigan.from approximately to,rockwell built universal joints for the automotive industry at its allegan facility.
in,the krsg brought suit against rockwell and several other companies in the united states district court for the western district of michigan.the krsg alleged that these companies were partly responsible for contaminating the site with pcbs.it therefore sought contribution from them for the costs associated with both the and the future of the site.although the krsg asserted various bases for its right to contribution,the district court and the parties focused exclusively on the krsg contribution claim pursuant to f of cercla f.the krsg contribution claims against the other companies subsequently settled or were otherwise resolved,leaving only its claim for contribution against rockwell for resolution by the district court.
a procedural ruling by the district court bifurcated the trial of the krsg contribution claim against rockwell into two stages,with the first limited to liability and the second focused on the allocation of response costs.both stages were tried to the bench.at the liability stage,the district court employed a threshold of significance standard of liability,a standard later rejected by this court.as articulated by the district court,this standard imposed cercla liability where a defendant release of hazardous material is of sufficient significance to justify response costs.kalamazoo river study group menasha,cir describing the threshold of significance standard.the district court determined that the krsg and rockwell had both released a sufficient amount of pcbs to face liability under the threshold of significance standard.it observed,however,that rockwell release of pcbs appeared to be minimal in comparison to the release of pcbs by the members of the krsg.although this court later rejected the threshold of significance standard because it improperly requires the plaintiff to show that a defendant release of hazardous materials caused response costs,see id.at,the adoption of a lower liability standard did not inure to the benefit of rockwell.the district court finding that rockwell had released a sufficient amount of pcbs to be held potentially liable even under the more onerous threshold of significance standard would obviously not change when subjected to the lower standard.
following the liability stage,the district court considered the proper allocation of response costs between the krsg and rockwell.the district court identified three factors as generally relevant to the allocation of response costs the relative quantities of pcbs released by the parties,the relative toxicity of those pcbs,and the cooperation of the parties with the regulatory authorities.after the court found that the latter two factors did not favor any particular allocation of response costs,it focused on the relative quantity of pcbs released by rockwell versus the amount released by the krsg.the district court determined that rockwell had likely released no more than pounds of pcbs from its allegan facility.in contrast,the court found that the members of the krsg had released hundreds of thousands of pounds of pcbs into the river.based upon these findings,the district court did not allocate any response costs to rockwell.the krsg now appeals the district court decision.

b.the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to allocate response costs to rockwell 
a holding of potential liability does not preclude a zero allocation of response costs 
the krsg argues that the district court refusal to allocate response costs to rockwell is inconsistent with its earlier conclusion that rockwell faced liability under cerlca for releasing pcbs into the kalamazoo river.specifically,the krsg maintains that the district court can not logically decline to allocate response costs to rockwell after determining that it faced liability under the threshold of significance standard.we disagree.
at the allocation stage of the trial,the district court focused on the relative quantities of pcbs released into the kalamazoo river by the parties.but in determining that rockwell faced liability under cercla,the district court did not make specific findings with regard to the amount of pcbs released by rockwell versus the amount released by the krsg.the district court explicitly stated that,at the liability stage,it was not called upon to quantify rockwell release of pcbs to the river.it instead focused on whether rockwell release of pcbs was more than incidental or sporadic.the district court ultimately concluded that rockwell faced liability under cercla after finding that rockwell released pcbs in measurable or detectable quantities.this finding did not obligate the district court to allocate response costs to rockwell irrespective of the court specific analysis of the relative amount of pcbs released by rockwell versus the krsg.
the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit faced this very issue in pmc,cir.in pmc,the seventh circuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to allocate response costs to a polluter who admitted to dumping toxic waste.id.at.the court explained that the polluter spills may have been too inconsequential to affect the cost of cleaning up significantly,and in that event a zero allocation to the polluter would be appropriate.id.as in the case before us,the other polluter in pmc was found responsible for substantially all of the total contamination of the site.id.
seeking to distinguish the pmc decision,the krsg points out that the court in pmc used a standard that imposed liability no matter how small the release of hazardous material.a liability determination under this standard does not necessarily require an allocation of response costs,according to the krsg,because liability may be imposed absent a finding of any significant release.under the threshold of significance standard of liability mistakenly employed by the district court at the liability phase in the present case,however,the krsg argues that a determination of liability necessarily means that the court found that the defendant had released a significant amount of hazardous material.
the krsg misses the mark,however,because the court in pmc was not concerned with whether the polluter had released a significant amount of hazardous material.instead,the court looked to whether the polluter release of hazardous material was too inconsequential in comparison to that of the other polluter to significantly affect costs.id.in other words,where the other responsible parties release vast quantities of hazardous material,a defendant release of what,standing alone,would be a significant amount of such material might have no impact on the total cost of cleaning up a contaminated site.
this is not to say that a defendant can always avoid paying response costs where its release does not significantly affect costs.if,for example,all of the responsible parties have each released only a relatively small amount of hazardous material,then each individual release in isolation would have little impact on the total cost of cleaning up a contaminated site.nevertheless,a court faced with these circumstances could reasonably allocate a portion of the response costs to each party.but this is not the situation in the present case.the district court concluded that the companies comprising the krsg each released exponentially more pcbs into the kalamazoo river than rockwell,so that rockwell release will have essentially no effect on the as costs.
even assuming that the district court liability determination did not require an allocation of future costs to rockwell,the krsg argues that this determination should have at least led the district court to require rockwell to pay for the some of the costs associated with the.these costs,according to the krsg,should be allocated to rockwell even if it released a relatively small amount of pcbs into the river.specifically,the krsg argues that cercla authorizes the allocation of investigation costs to any party that created a reasonable risk of contaminating a site.
in support of its argument,the krsg cites johnson james langley operating,cir stating that a plaintiff may recover the costs associated with environmental testing or sampling only if the party seeking to recover costs has an objectively reasonable belief that the defendant release or threatened release of hazardous substances would contaminate his or her property,and joint water auth.tonolli,cir stating that cercla liability for environmental investigation costs requires,among other things,that there was a reasonable risk although one that may not materialize that the defendant release or threatened release of hazardous substances would contaminate the plaintiff property.
both johnson and address the showing required to establish a party liability for investigation costs in an action brought by a landowner pursuant to a of cercla a.a liability determination,however,is just the first element of a contribution claim under f.recovery of response costs by a private party under cercla is a process.initially,a plaintiff must prove that a defendant is liable under cercla.once that is accomplished,the defendant share of liability is apportioned in an equitable manner.kalamazoo river study group menasha,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.neither johnson nor hold that a defendant who is subject to liability for investigation costs must necessarily be allocated a share of those costs in a contribution action.accordingly,these cases provide no guidance as to the proper allocation of such costs in the present case.
the district court has broad discretion to allocate the costs associated with the.franklin county convention facilities auth.am.premier underwriters,cir the apportionment of cercla liability under f among various responsible parties is an equitable undertaking within the broad discretion of the district court.in allocating these costs,the district court is authorized to consider any equitable factors that it considered appropriate.f.the district court decision not to allocate any costs for the to rockwell was based upon its finding that the krsg was responsible for more than of the pcbs in the river.although the krsg challenges this finding,a challenge that we address in part.below,it fails to show that the district court abused its discretion in looking to the relative quantities of pcbs released by the parties in allocating costs for the.
the krsg further argues that the district court failure to allocate response costs to rockwell after finding that it had released pcbs into the kalamazoo river defeats the central purpose of cercla namely,the prompt of hazardous waste.according to the krsg,the district court allocation of response costs in this case encourages parties to litigate in the hope of obtaining a zero share,rather than voluntarily joining in the investigation or settling.but the allocation of response costs is highly,so that an allocation of zero response costs in a particular case provides little incentive for defendants in other contribution actions to reject reasonable settlement offers or risk the uncertainties inherent in litigation.
for all of these reasons,we conclude that the district court liability determination did not obligate it to allocate response costs to rockwell.
the district court did not err in finding that rockwell had released an inconsequential amount of pcbs in comparison to the amount of pcbs released by the members of the krsg 
the relative quantities of pcbs released by the parties was the decisive factor in the district court allocation of response costs.it found that rockwell had likely released less than pounds of pcbs into the kalamazoo river.in contrast,the district court determined that the krsg members had released several hundred thousand pounds of pcbs into the river.the krsg concedes that its own members released massive amounts of pcbs,but maintains that the district court erred in concluding that rockwell had released such a small amount of the hazardous substance.
in assessing rockwell release of pcbs,the district court gave credence to the testimony of robert barrick,an expert in environmental chemistry.barrick testified that he formed an opinion as to the amount of pcbs that rockwell released into the kalamazoo river by analyzing estimates of both the amount of oil that rockwell had discharged and the concentration of pcbs in those oils.with regard to the amount of discharged oils,barrick used the estimate offered by kenneth crumrine,the krsg expert.barrick then estimated the concentration of pcbs in those oils by examining the oils remaining in the groundwater at the site of rockwell allegan facility.he determined that these oils contained no more than pcb.based upon his analysis of these t
