background 
experimental forests and the lookout mountain unit 
in,the forest service established the pringle falls experimental forest within the deschutes national forest as a center for silviculture,forest management,and insect and disease research in ponderosa pine forests.the experimental forest is located in the eastern cascades,about miles southwest of bend,oregon.it is administered by the service pacific northwest pnw research station and is one of about eighty experimental forests that the service manages in the united states and its territories.see generally ariel lugo et,long term research at the usda forest service experimental forests and ranges,bioscience discussing scientific contributions from research projects in experimental forests.
the service manages its experimental forests under the forest and rangeland renewable resources research act of research act.the research act recognizes that the federal government has an important and substantial role in ensuring the continued health,productivity,and sustainability of the forests and rangeland of the united states.id.a.it gives the secretary of agriculture broad authority to designate experimental forests and to conduct any research within them that he deems necessary to obtain,analyze,develop,demonstrate,and disseminate scientific information about protecting,managing,and utilizing forest resources.id.a,a see also a delegating the secretary authority to the service.one of the five major areas of research identified in the act is protecting vegetation and other forest and rangeland resources from fires,insects,and diseases.a.
the research act supplements,rather than limits or repeals,other laws that impose obligations on the service.id.e.these include nepa,which requires that agencies prepare an eis for any major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,c,as well as the national forest management act,which requires that actions approved by the service comply with forest resource management plans,i.the relevant management plan here is the deschutes forest plan,which provides that the goal of the pringle falls experimental forest is field research activities.
the lookout mountain unit the unit is located within the pringle falls experimental forest.when the service added the roughly acre unit to the experimental forest in the,it noted that the unit was especially for experiments in thinning and pruning and for studies of growth and site factors.the unit contains a large block of forest that may represent some of the most productive ponderosa pine sites in central oregon.the unit has experienced only minor disturbances since,when a wildfire burned most of the trees.the disturbances include thinning in the and,as well as several completed and ongoing research projects.aside from these disturbances,trees in the unit have grown exceptionally well.
in,the service observed that trees in the unit had grown to such an extent that their density put them at risk of beetle infestation and wildfire.the service had previously calculated an upper management zone umz with a prescribed stand density index sdi.a stand is a group of trees of similar size,species,and structure growing together.sdi measures density based on mean tree size and the number of trees within a stand.an sdi higher than the umz level means that trees are at imminent risk of beetle infestation.in,the service determined that stands within the unit had an sdi between and percent of umz.this density resulted in a reduced tree vigor,measured by the percentage of a tree canopy occupied by green branches,and a slowed growth rate.the service expressed concern that widespread infestation or wildfire would destroy some of the older trees in the unit and compromise ongoing and future research projects.
study plan 
in december,service officials at the pnw research station began to design a research project that would reduce the fire and insect risk in the unit while simultaneously addressing scientific objectives.they prepared a study plan entitled forest dynamics after thinning and fuel reduction in dry forests.the plan identified six specific research questions 
what set of fuel reduction treatments best accelerates the development of large trees while over the reintroduce s natural disturbance processes that provide greater ecosystem resiliency 
what is the influence of climate change interacting with a set of fuel reduction treatments on vegetation dynamics and forest structure 
can single cohort stands be readily converted to stands 
do stands share the same risks of multiple,interacting stresses as stands 
how does the dominant shrub,giant chinquapin chrysolepis chrysophylla,respond in the to a set of fuel reduction treatments 
how does the residual stand structure resulting from a set of fuel reduction treatments interact locally and in the with wind to cause additional structural changes 
a cohort is a group of trees that grew after a single disturbance and thus are roughly the same age.a stand is a group of trees with two or more age classes.
the study plan divided the study area into four blocks.it designated five areas within each block for specified levels of logging and controlled burning.it would leave one area undisturbed as a control group and would thin other areas to various sdis.the service would then compare the growth of trees in each area.the study plan working hypothesis for the first research question,put simply,is that removing more small trees should allow the residual trees to grow to larger diameters.the plan would answer some of the research questions within a few years,while others would take several decades.
the study plan underwent two rounds of peer review in first,by six individuals internally and second,by seven external reviewers.the director of the pnw research station approved the study plan in march.
nepa process 
the service began an environmental review of the project under nepa while it was still developing the study plan.in april,the service sent a scoping letter to interested parties describing the proposed action.the service also published in the federal register a notice of intent to prepare an eis for the project.see.in april,the service sent another letter to interested parties describing the project and the alternatives that were being considered for analysis.the service hosted two field trips to the unit to discuss the proposed project with interested groups,the first in august and the second in july.the league participated in the first field trip.
in september,the service circulated a draft eis for the project and received public comments.the service also consulted with other federal environmental agencies.in november,the environmental protection agency wrote that it was supportive of the proposed project,both as a means to address the risk of severe insect epidemic or catastrophic fire,and as an opportunity to study forest dynamics after thinning and fuels reduction in dry forests.in january,the fish and wildlife service issued a biological opinion pursuant to the endangered species act concluding that the project would not likely jeopardize the continued existence of the threatened northern spotted owl.
in march,the service issued the final eis for the project.the eis examines in detail three alternative and two action alternatives.the two action alternatives are variations of the experiment proposed in the study plan.alternative,the preferred alternative,would result in logging approximately to million board feet of timber on about percent of the trees larger than inches in diameter at breast height.it would thin from below by cutting the smallest trees in an area until the target sdi for a particular area is reached,thereby retaining the largest trees in that area.in order to reach the desired sdis,alternative would remove a total of about of all trees greater than inches in diameter within the logged areas,or an average of about nine such trees per acre.it would also construct about one mile of temporary road and perform maintenance over miles of existing roads.alternative would amend the deschutes forest plan to exempt part of the project area from geographic eastside screens restrictions that,inter alia,prohibit logging old growth trees greater than inches in diameter east of the cascade mountains.in the eis,the service describes the forest plan amendments as because they would affect only a small fraction of the eastside screens.
alternative uses the same research design and has the same target numbers as alternative for sdis in the various areas of the project.however,alternative would leave undisturbed acres of spotted owl habitat that would be thinned under alternative.this would reduce the total logged area in the project by about percent.the eis also briefly describes six additional alternatives that it does not consider in detail because they would not meet the project two purposes of risk reduction and research.
the same day it issued the eis,the service published a record of decision rod selecting alternative and approving the project.the rod explains that alternative would provide less risk reduction and would render the research design incomplete without any significant corresponding benefit to the spotted owl.the rod concludes that alternative does the best job of meeting the statutory mission of the experimental forest by reducing the risk of losing a large portion of it to fire or insects,and incorporating important research into the design of activities.
procedural background 
in september,the league filed suit against the service and service officials,alleging that the eis does not comply with nepa.the league sought declaratory and injunctive relief.
in may,the district court granted summary judgment to the service.the court relied heavily on the fact that the project involves research within an experimental forest.it wrote that it would be short sighted for the courts to intervene and dictate that the forest service consider alternatives that hamper or eliminate research objectives while the requirements of nepa still apply,the necessary range of alternatives and hard look are strongly informed by the research objectives of the forest itself.the court concluded that the eis is adequately supported by scientific data and takes a hard look at the significant impacts of the project.
the league timely appealed.in june,the league filed an emergency motion in this court for an injunction pending appeal to prevent logging pursuant to the first timber sale under the project.interfor pacific,which had been awarded the timber sale,joined the service as amicus in opposing the motion.a divided motions panel denied the emergency injunction.logging under the project commenced that month and will continue through.

iii.discussion 
the league argues that the eis is deficient in three ways.first,the eis improperly cabins its analysis by specifying a limited purpose and need for the project,and by considering only project alternatives that fit predetermined specifications contained in the study plan.second,it lacks scientific integrity because it overstates the risk of wildfire and beetle infestation.third,it fails to take a hard look at the project impacts on tree mortality and on wildlife species that depend on standing dead trees for nesting habitat.we take each argument in turn.
project purpose and alternatives analysis 
congress created nepa to protect the environment by requiring that federal agencies carefully weigh environmental considerations and consider potential alternatives to the proposed action before the government launches any major federal action.barnes dep t of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.specifically,an eis under nepa must inform decisionmakers and the public of the reasonable alternatives which would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment.see also c iii an eis shall include a detailed statement on alternatives to the proposed action.nepa regulations describe the alternatives analysis as the heart of the environmental impact statement.the analysis present s the environmental impacts of the proposal and the alternatives in comparative form,thus sharply defining the issues and providing a clear basis for choice among options by the decisionmaker and the public.id.
the scope of an alternatives analysis depends on the underlying purpose and need specified by the agency for the proposed action.city of carmel by the sea dep t of,cir the eis shall briefly specify the underlying purpose and need to which the agency is responding in proposing the alternatives including the proposed action.emphasis added.the agency need only evaluate alternatives that are reasonably related to the purposes of the project.westlands water dist.dep t of interior,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the league challenges the eis statement of purpose and need,as well as the range of alternatives that the service considered.we review the purpose and need,along with the choice of alternatives,under a reasonableness standard or rule of reason.id.at.we first determine whether the statement of purpose and need was reasonable,and then whether the range of alternatives considered was reasonable in light of that purpose and need.see id.at.
statement of purpose and need 
t his court has afforded agencies considerable discretion to define the purpose and need of a project.friends of southeast future morrison,cir.however,this discretion is not unlimited.westlands,at.because they determine the range of reasonable alternatives,an agency can not define the purpose and need of a project in unreasonably narrow terms.see parks conservation ass bureau of land,cir.a n agency may not define the objectives of its action in terms so unreasonably narrow that only one alternative from among the environmentally benign ones in the agency power would accomplish the goals of the agency action,and the eis would become a foreordained formality.friends of southeast,at quoting citizens against burlington,busey.
the statement of purpose in the project eis provides 
the primary purpose of the proposed project is to reduce risk to the site by reducing stand densities,and lowering susceptibility to catastrophic loss to insects,disease,and fire.by integrating the need to reduce risk to the site with the research goals of the pnw research station,treatments would be implemented in such a way that pertinent research questions regarding sustainability of ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forests in a changing climate can be answered.
the eis identifies two needs for the project.first,t here is a need to address the risk of a severe insect epidemic or catastrophic fire.second,t here is a need to provide operational scale research opportunities through a series of thinning and fuel reduction treatments applied across the landscape.the eis explains that this second need comes generally from the establishment record for the experimental forest,and specifically from the study plan.the eis then lists the six research questions from the study plan that the project is designed to address.
in assessing the reasonableness of a purpose and need specified in an eis,we must consider the statutory context of the federal action.see westlands,at where an action is taken pursuant to a specific statute,the statutory objectives of the project serve as a guide by which to determine the reasonableness of objectives outlined in an eis.here,two statutes inform the project purpose and need.the organic act gives the service authority to make provisions for the protection against destruction by fire.the research act gives the service authority to carry out in experimental forests any research experiments that it deems necessary.id.a.one of the five major areas of research identified in the research act is protecting vegetation and other forest and rangeland resources from fires,insects,and diseases.id.a.the eis dual purpose and need of risk reduction and research opportunities comes directly from these statutory authorities.
the league argues that the eis states an unreasonably narrow purpose and need and incorporates rigid implementation of the study plan.the league contends that,as a result of the narrowness of the stated purpose and need,only a single alternative the study plan could satisfy them.however,the statement does not incorporate the specifics of the plan proposed experiment.rather,the statement refers to the plan because it contains an extensive discussion of the research objectives and working hypotheses behind the six study questions.see muckleshoot indian tribe forest,cir per curiam statement of purpose and need appear ed too narrow when read in isolation,but was ultimately reasonable because it expressly incorporate d broader objectives.
as in muckleshoot,some language in the eis,when read in isolation,suggests that the statement of purpose and need contemplates implementation of the study plan.for example,the eis asserts that it compares the alternatives for their ability to implement the study plan.the eis also rejects a proposed alternative on the ground that it would not meet the purpose and need of implementing the study plan.when read in context,however,these and similar statements were directed to the six research questions and objectives described in the plan,rather than to any rigid implementation of the specifics of the plan.thus,the first sentence excerpted above reads in full that the eis compares the alternatives for their ability to implement the study plan and answer the specific research questions.emphasis added.moreover,the stated purpose and need could not have required rigid implementation of the study plan,as the league maintains,because alternative,the preferred alternative that the service ultimately selected,removed acres of logging from the plan proposed design in response to conservation groups concerns about a sensitive cinder butte in the northeast section of the project area.alternative deviated even further from the plan by removing an additional acres in order to reduce the potential impact on spotted owl habitat.
the league bases its challenge in part on an argument that the service created the study plan prior to initiating the nepa process.nepa regulations require that an agency integrate the nepa process with other planning at the earliest possible time.here,the service began the nepa process nearly a year before the plan was finally approved.as described above,in april the service sent a scoping letter to interested parties and published a notice of intent to prepare an eis in the federal register.a few months later,the service hosted a field trip in the unit to discuss the proposed project with interested parties and then modified its proposal as a result of these discussions.in reviewing an eis statement of purpose and need,the touchstone for our inquiry is whether the resulting alternatives analysis fosters informed and informed public participation.westlands,at quoting california block,cir.based on the record before us,we conclude that the purpose and need in the challenged eis adequately informed decisions by the service and participation by the public.
in sum,given the purpose of the research act,the project location in an experimental forest,and the considerable discretion we afford agencies in this area,friends of southeast,at,we agree with the district court that the eis statement of purpose and need is reasonable.
range of alternatives 
nepa regulations require that an eis r igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives to the proposed action,including alternatives not within the jurisdiction of the lead agency.a,c.the existence of a viable but unexamined alternative renders an environmental impact statement inadequate.natural res.def.council forest,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,the eis need not consider an infinite range of alternatives,only reasonable or feasible ones.westlands,at internal quotation marks omitted.an agency need not consider alternatives that extend beyond those reasonably related to the purposes of the project.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the agency must also briefly discuss the reasons why it eliminated any alternatives from detailed study.a.
the eis considers in detail a alternative and two action alternatives alternative contemplates no action alternative would log to million board feet of timber on acres and alternative would log to million board feet on acres.both action alternatives would divide the project into approximately units,each of which would be treated to one of five levels of thinning no thinning the control units thinning to umz thinning to percent of umz thinning to percent of umz with creation of small openings and thinning to percent of umz.the eis also briefly describes six additional alternatives that it excludes from detailed consideration because they would not meet the project dual purpose and need.
in another context,an eis analyzing in detail two action alternatives that differed only in proposed acreage would likely be inadequate.see,muckleshoot,at t he forest service failed to consider an adequate range of alternatives where t he eis considered only a no action alternative along with two virtually identical alternatives.but we agree with the district court that the special circumstances of a research project in an experimental forest necessarily narrowed consideration of alternatives.as the district court observed 
the pringle falls experimental f orest is,by design,intended to facilitate management,insect,and disease research in ponderosa pine forests east of the cascades.while the requirements of nepa still apply,the necessary range of alternatives and hard look are strongly informed by the research objectives of the forest itself.the forest service simply can not entertain every alternative without regard for elements that are unique to the research forest that accounts for protecting against a major disturbance event that would destroy the ability to carry out research in the area,or preclude important future research opportunities.
the league argues that the service failed to consider in detail a reasonable alternative that would have retained,either throughout the project area or within the eastside screens,all trees greater than inches in diameter.the league argues that such an alternative would be consistent with the need to reduce the risk of wildfire and beetle infestation,as well as with the need to provide operational scale research that addresses the service scientific objectives regarding the effects of removing small trees.the eis explains that the service briefly considered the league proffered alternative,but eliminated it from detailed study because modeling indicated that retaining all trees greater than inches in diameter would not achieve the targeted stand densities and thus not fulfill the project objectives.
in its briefing to us,the service justifies its rejection of the league proffered alternative on two grounds.first,the service contends that the proposed inch diameter limit would not achieve the project purpose.the eis purpose refers to thinning to the umz or below.the eis notes that retaining all trees greater than inches in diameter would result in densities above the recommended umz.under our prior case law,agencies need not consider in detail proposed alternatives that fail to meet specifically identified targets or densities.see,carmel,at upholding a statement of purpose and need for a highway project that included a specific level of desired traffic service.
second,the service contends that the inch diameter limit alternative would not fulfill the research purpose of the project.the service maintains that the alternative would not yield statistically valid comparative data among the areas specified for different densities of logging.the eis explains that leaving all,or more,of the larger trees than is proposed in the study plan would provide biased results that would be considered questionable.given the research purpose of the project and its location in an experimental forest,the eis does not have to consider in detail an alternative that would not provide the research data that the service seeks to obtain.
the league also argues that the eis fails to consider in detail an alternative that would retain all trees greater than inches in diameter.however,the eis expressly rejects the inch diameter limit alternative because it would not achieve the purpose of the project.the eis explains that t hinning only the smallest trees would not reduce stand density enough to reduce the risk of insect and mortality.accordingly,the eis does not have to consider this alternative in detail.
in sum,the eis only needs to consider in detail alternatives that would address both of the project stated purposes and needs by meaningfully reducing the risk of beetle infestation and wildfire while attempting to answer the six research questions.see.past future,lewis,cir alternatives that do not accomplish both purposes of the project may properly be rejected as imprudent.the league has failed to identify a viable but unexamined alternative that would satisfy both these goals.natural res.def.council,at.accordingly,we hold that the range of alternatives considered in the eis is reasonable.
scientific integrity 
nepa regulations require that an agency ensure the scientific integrity of the discussions and analyses in an eis and explicitly refer to the scientific and other sources relied upon for conclusions in the eis.as a reviewing court,we are most deferential when the agency is making predictions within its area of special expertise.lands council,at internal quotation marks omitted.at the same time,courts must independently review the record in order to satisfy themselves that the agency has made a reasoned decision based on its evaluation of the evidence.earth island inst.forest,cir internal quotation marks omitted,overruled on other grounds by winter.
the league argues that the eis overstates the risk of wildfire and beetle infestation in the unit.in particular,the league takes issue with the eis use of the terms imminent,catastrophic,and.for example,the eis states that trees in the unit 
have structural characteristics that indicate they are at imminent risk of catastrophic loss to bark beetles and high risk of loss to wildfire t here is a high and increasing probability that ponderosa pine across the lookout mountain u nit will support a western pine or mountain pine beetle outbreak,or a large event.
the league makes three arguments under the heading of scientific integrity the eis overstates the risk of beetle infestation,it overstates the risk of wildfire,and it fails to acknowledge that greater tree mortality would occur under the project than under the alternative.
first,the league argues that the eis relies on three scientific reports that do not support its assessment of the risk of beetle infestation.the league focus on these reports is misplaced.all three reports support the general proposition that excessive density presents a risk of beetle infestation leading to serious or excessive tree mortality,and that controlled thinning can reduce that risk.the studies do not use the terms imminent or catastrophic,but the eis does not cite these studies for the specific language that the league challenges on appeal.other documents cited in the eis refer to density levels where beetles caused imminent mortality and catastrophic losses at epidemic or landscape levels.a deschutes national forest report in established umz density levels above which particular stands would be considered imminently susceptible to insect attack.the study plan,which underwent both internal and external peer review,also concluded that trees within the unit currently have structural characteristics which place them at imminent risk of catastrophic loss to bark beetles.we therefore can not say that the eis lacks scientific integrity or misrepresents the scientific literature when it asserts that trees within the unit face such a risk.
the league contends that the service umz levels lack scientific integrity because,in its view,the density of trees in the unit has continued to increase well above the umz with only modest natural mortality every years or so.however,the umz levels have support in the scientific record and are entitled to deference as a calculation that is within the agency area of special expertise.see lands council,at.moreover,in challenging only the service reliance on density to determine susceptibility to infestation,the league overlooks the agency reliance on additional measurements of tree health within the unit,such as declining growth rate and low tree vigor.the league cites a district court case involving a successful nepa challenge to the service erroneous reliance on one of the same scientific reports on tree density at issue here.see earth island inst.morse,cv,wl,at.however,in that case,the service flatly misstated the significance of a particular density target identified in the report.id.at.the league does not point to a similar error here.
the league also contends that the eis use of imminent and catastrophic is inconsistent with the plain meaning of those terms.nepa regulations require that an eis be written in plain language so the public can readily understand it.see also pac.rivers council forest,wl,at cir.june.the league asserts that the agency use of the terms is hyperbolic and may have been designed to gain unwarranted public support for the project.although under the circumstances the eis probably should have defined the terms in its glossary,it does disclose in its analysis of the alternative that imminent risk does not mean immediate mortality.the eis states 
because the unit trees are at a relatively high susceptibility to insects,there is an increasing probability that the level of pine mortality will become more prevalent even in the short term less than years.in the long term,beyond years,increased levels of mortality will occur,and can be expected to reach epidemic levels.
the study plan,attached as an appendix to the eis,also explains that w hile wildfire and insect outbreaks are not a certainty,there is a recognized risk from both fire and insects and this risk increases with time.although it is a somewhat close question,we conclude that the eis use of these terms is not arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion.
second,the league argues that the eis assertion that trees within the unit face a high risk of loss to wildfire,including,possibly,a large event,is incorrect.the league points to the service fire models which,under current fuel and stand conditions,found a potential for a passive crown fire over only about half of the project area.a passive crown fire is a surface fire with individual tree torching,and generally represents moderate fire
