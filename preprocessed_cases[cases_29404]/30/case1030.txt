background 
appellants kim kafka,cindy kafka,and diamond ranch enterprises collectively the kafkas,and robert spoklie and spoklie enterprises collectively spoklie,formerly owned and operated alternative livestock ranches in montana,on which they raised elk,deer,bighorn sheep,mountain goats,and bison.montana defines alternative livestock as privately owned caribou,deer,mule deer,elk,moose,antelope,mountain sheep,or mountain goat s indigenous to the state of montana,privately owned reindeer,or any other ungulate as classified by the department.kim and cindy kafka own one alternative livestock ranch,the diamond k ranch.robert spoklie owns one alternative livestock ranch,spoklie enterprises,and is the of another,spoklie elk ranches.until the passage of proposition,the income from the kafka and spoklie ranches came primarily from fee shooting,a practice by which members of the public,many of them from out of state,paid to shoot a animal on the ranch under the supervision of a guide.
in october,an animal on a montana game farm ranch was diagnosed with chronic wasting disease.concerned about the risk of the disease spreading among stocks of alternative livestock,the legislature imposed a moratorium on applications for new alternative livestock ranches in may.meanwhile,opponents of fee shooting collected enough signatures to qualify for the november statewide ballot.montana voters passed on november.it became effective immediately.
changed montana law applicable to alternative livestock ranches in three major ways.first,it prohibited operating an alternative livestock ranch without a license obtained prior to november,and it prohibited the issuance of new licenses.ann.second,it prohibited the transfer of an alternative livestock ranch license for a specific facility.id.at.finally,it provided that an alternative livestock licensee may not allow the shooting of game animals or alternative livestock for a fee or other remuneration on an alternative livestock facility.id.at.however,existing holders of alternative livestock licenses were permitted to acquire,breed,grow,keep,pursue,handle,harvest,use,sell,or dispose of the alternative livestock and their progeny in any quantity and at any time of year.id.
appellants filed several lawsuits challenging in federal and state court.in february,the kafkas sued jeff hagener,director of the montana department of fish,wildlife and parks dfwp,and marc bridges,executive officer of the montana department of livestock,in their individual and official capacities,in federal district court.they sought a preliminary injunction against enforcement of on federal and state constitutional grounds.the district court denied the injunction on october.see kafka hagener,d.the kafkas voluntarily dismissed this suit on november.
on april,the kafkas sued the state of montana and dfwp in montana state court on several of the same federal and state constitutional grounds raised in their federal suit,as well as on several additional federal and state grounds.in late,the state trial court dismissed all claims other than the takings claims under the federal and the state constitutions.kafka montana of fish,wildlife and parks,october.on february,the state court dismissed the kafkas federal and state takings claims.kafka montana dep t of fish,wildlife,and parks,dv.
on september,spoklie sued the dfwp in state court,challenging its interpretation of.the state court granted spoklie a preliminary injunction,but the montana supreme court reversed.spoklie.dep t of fish,wildlife parks.spoklie then amended his state court complaint to include federal and state constitutional claims.so far as we are aware,no final judgment has been entered in that suit.
on november,the kafkas and spoklie filed this action in federal district court against the state of montana,dfwp,and jeff hagener,director of dfwp,in his individual capacity,challenging under the federal and state constitutions.shortly thereafter,the kafkas and spoklie moved to stay their federal action pursuant to the pullman abstention doctrine,pending resolution of their suits.on december,the district court denied the motion to stay.on september,the district court dismissed appellants claims in their entirety.they timely appealed.
ii.pullman abstention 
before reaching the merits,we consider appellants argument that the district court should have abstained under pullman.abstention under pullman is an equitable doctrine that allows federal courts to refrain from deciding sensitive federal constitutional questions when state law issues may moot or narrow the constitutional questions.san remo hotel city and county of san francisco,cir.pullman abstention is appropriate when the federal plaintiff complaint requires resolution of a sensitive question of federal constitutional law the constitutional question could be mooted or narrowed by a definitive ruling on the state law issues and the possibly determinative issue of state law is unclear.id.although it is unusual for the party that has chosen the federal forum to invoke the abstention doctrine,no bar exists to either party doing so.id.at.we review de novo the question of whether the requirements for pullman abstention are met.fireman fund ins.city of lodi,cir.
we may make short work of appellants argument under pullman.we hold that the third element of the test,supra,has not been satisfied,which makes it unnecessary to address the first and second elements.when the district court denied the motion to stay under pullman,the montana trial court in the kafkas case had already ruled adversely on most of their state law claims,and the federal district court in the kafkas case had ruled adversely on one of them.kafka,d at holding that the ban did not implicate any fundamental rights under the montana constitution.further,the montana supreme court in spoklie case had already sustained dfwp interpretation of.see spoklie,at.under these circumstances,the district court was entirely justified in concluding that appellants had not shown that state law was unclear.
iii.preclusion against the kafkas 
we next consider whether the kafkas claims against the state of montana,dfwp,and jeff hagener are barred by claim preclusion.the kafkas have brought two earlier suits against these defendants,one in state court and one in federal court.
a.the kafkas state court suit preclusion of claims against the state of montana and dfwp 
when the district court decided this case,no final judgment had been entered in the kafkas state court suit.however,the state trial court has now entered a final judgment dismissing their suit in its entirety.kafka montana dep t of fish,wildlife and parks,february.in determining the preclusive effect of the montana judgment,we apply montana law.the final judgment of a trial court is entitled to preclusive effect.hollister forsythe,meagher county newlan creek water dist.walter.under montana preclusion law,claims litigated in a former action as well as claims which might have been litigated are barred.balyeat law,hatch.a resolved claim will be res judicata as to subsequent claims if the parties are the same the subject matter is the same the issues are the same and relate to the same subject matter and the capacities of the persons are the same in reference to the subject matter and issues.see also loney milodragovich,dale dye,troutt colorado western ins,cir.
all four requirements are easily met here.first,the defendants in both cases are the state of montana and dfwp.second,the subject in both cases is.third,the issue in both cases is the legality o
