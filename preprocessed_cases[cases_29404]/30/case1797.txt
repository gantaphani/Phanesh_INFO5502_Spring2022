introduction 
this ceqa case involves the development by the march joint powers authority the authority with tesco,the british grocer,of a large warehouse distribution facility located on former march air force base.
since the,the authority has been developing and implementing a reuse plan for the former military base.tesco submitted a design plan application plot plan to the authority in may and june.the authority approved the application in september.construction was completed and the facility became operational early in.the distribution facility serves tesco fresh and easy neighborhood markets in several states.
in october,health first,a citizens group,filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the approval of tesco design plan application on ceqa grounds.in april,the court entered judgment granting the writ petition on the grounds that approval of the application was discretionary not ministerial.the authority and tesco,the real party in interest,appeal.
tesco and the authority argue that approval of the design plan application was a ministerial act,not a discretionary act,and was exempt from environmental review under ceqa.we agree and we reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
a.the master reuse plan and the redevelopment plan 
in,as part of the master reuse plan,the united states air force prepared a final environmental impact statement final eis for disposal of portions of march air force base.also in,the authority prepared a separate redevelopment plan,including a final environmental impact report final eir.no public comment by private citizens was made to the redevelopment eir.
b.the general plan 
the first ceqa review of the proposed development for the march property was the general plan completed in.the general plan included a master eir,as is appropriate for a plan to reuse a federal military base,subd.a.the general plan addressed the reuse of acres of the original base.it considered various land uses,including a business park and industrial uses.the for industrial use was estimated to be acres and square feet.the general plan anticipated using subsequent specific plans and a design review process for flexibility in development.the general plan and the master eir made detailed evaluations of transportation,noise,and air quality impacts.no public comment or testimony was received regarding the draft master eir.the final master eir provided future development and programs to implement the general plan will be subject to discretionary approval by the march jpa the authority,including review for conformity with the general plan,and incorporation of mitigation measures adopted in certifying the final eir with the general plan.in september,pursuant to ceqa,the authority adopted a resolution in which it certified the final master eir,adopted environmental findings,adopted a statement of overriding consideration,and adopted a mitigation and monitoring program.
c.the specific plan 
based on the general plan,in,the authority adopted as a discretionary project,the specific plan for the march business center.again,there was ceqa review,this time using the final focused eir and a mitigation monitoring and reporting plan.the final focused eir incorporated public comment,both written and by testimony,with appropriate responses 
the specific plan established guidelines for a future development accommodating business park,industrial,office,mixed use,commercial and open space land uses.the objective of the specific plan is to guide and regulate the development of the march business center in accordance with the march jpa general plan.
the focused eir prepared in accordance with the provisions of ceqa evaluates the land use plan,circulation and infrastructure improvements associated with the march business center specific plan and the potential impacts that would result from their implementation.the eir is intended to serve as the environmental document for the march business center specific plan a ny project which deviates or has impacts not considered in the focused eir shall require additional environmental documentation.together,the march business center specific plan,tentative map and eir provide a path to properly develop the project site,taking into account policies,goals,objectives and environmental considerations of the march jpa general plan.emphasis added.the final focused eir noted,the great majority of environmental impacts associated with the project were analyzed in the general plan meir.
the specific plan analysis,tit,guidelines evaluated anticipated land uses and intensities,traffic,air quality,and other environmental impacts for a full of acres of the march business center.the specific plan reduced the traffic that had been previously approved under the general plan.the general plan had analyzed anticipated daily trips and the specific plan analyzed only anticipated daily trips.after mitigation,only air quality impacts remained significant and a statement of overriding considerations was adopted for those impacts.
design guidelines 
in addition to the specific plan,the authority adopted the march business center design guidelines,setting forth standards for landscaping,parking,architecture,and other design elements.the design guidelines checklist lists specific questions for each design element.
the implementation committee was created to review design plan applications.the march business center implementation committee is charged with the review of ministerial actions,consisting of the review of design plans for future development with the existing march business center design guidelines.the scope of review is limited to reviewing design issues and verifying conformance with the march business center design guidelines.although some proposals could trigger discretionary review,t he implementation committee review of the proposed development,however,does not involve the exercise of judgment or deliberation but is merely a determination of whether the proposed plans conform with the existing design guidelines and existing land use plans.
e.the design plan application 
in may,tesco representative prepared a letter to the authority explaining how the proposed distribution facility was consistent with the specific plan and the focused eir and did not require further environmental review.the letter described the warehouse facilities as eventually occupying million square feet and acres.three warehouses would accommodate cold storage,dry goods storage,and manufacturing.construction would occur in two phases.additionally,n o stationary source emissions other than natural gas and electricity are anticipated for the proposed facilities.additional ceqa analyses and documentation will be required if future proposed uses involve stationary source emissions other than natural gas and electricity.the letter further explained how the anticipated uses would be consistent with the activities permitted by the specific plan,the focused eir and mitigation measures,and the design guidelines.a project narrative described the distribution facility similarly.
in response,the authority agreed the distribution facility was consistent with the final focused eir and the specific plan and was not subject to discretionary review.the authority scheduled it for ministerial review and approval by the implementation committee at the conclusion of the design review process.
tesco subsequent design plan application proposed the first phase of the distribution facility as occupying acres or square feet,mostly warehousing.as already described,the facility is located in the area designated by the specific plan for industrial use.
the implementation committee reviewed the design plan application and found it was consistent with the specific plan and the focused eir.specifically,the implementation committee found the design plan application complied with the applicable design guidelines.
notice was posted of a public meeting on approval of the design plan application.after no public comment was received,the committee approved the application on september,subject to certain conditions.the authority then filed a notice of exemption,identifying
