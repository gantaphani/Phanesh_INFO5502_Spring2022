the federal lands recreation enhancement act rea prohibits the united states forest service from charging fees s olely for parking,undesignated parking,or picnicking along roads or trailsides,for hiking through without using the facilities and services,and f or camping at undeveloped sites d a,d e.despite these clear prohibitions,the forest service collects fees from all drivers who park their vehicles in a piece of the coronado national forest running along the mile catalina highway,the only paved road to the summit of mount lemmon,a heavily used recreational area an hour drive from downtown tucson,arizona.
four recreational visitors sued seeking a declaration that the forest service was exceeding the scope of its authority under the rea by charging fees to those who drive to mount lemmon,park their cars,then picnic,hike,or camp in nearby undeveloped areas.plaintiffs also sought to enjoin the forest service from collecting such fees.the district court granted defendants rule b motion to dismiss.plaintiffs appealed.because plaintiffs are correct that the forest service fee structure contravenes the plain language of the rea,we reverse the district court dismissal of count and remand to allow plaintiffs to pursue that claim.

but the rea prohibits the forest service from charging that fee,even in a place where subsection f would otherwise authorize it,for certain activities or services.d.this blanket p rohibition on fees for certain activities or services forbids fees,among other things 
s olely for parking,undesignated parking,or picnicking along roads or trailsides 
f or persons who are driving through,walking through,boating through,horseback riding through,or hiking through federal recreational lands and waters without using the facilities and services and 
f or camping at undeveloped sites that do not provide a minimum number of facilities and services as described in g a.
before enacting the rea,congress conducted a experiment with collecting visitor fees at national forests.the recreational fee demonstration program,enacted in,required the forest service to select between and sites where it shall charge and collect fees for admission to the area or for the use of outdoor recreation sites,facilities,visitor centers,equipment,and services.the forest service selected several parts of the coronado national forest,including mount lemmon,where it promptly began charging an entrance fee for all recreational visitors.in response to concerns that fees were being collected from individuals who like plaintiffs wanted to use undeveloped land,not services and amenities,congress drafted the rea,an overly prescriptive regime designed to alleviate concerns of those who no longer trust certain federal land management agencies with the recreation fee authority.i,sess,wl,at.specifically,the rea made clear that the forest service will not be permitted to charge solely for parking,scenic pullouts,and other areas.id.
after the rea was enacted,the forest service drafted interim implementation guidelines.those guidelines interpreted the rea as authorizing the forest service to impose a standard amenity recreation fee in a high impact recreation area hira,defined as 
a clearly delineated,contiguous area with specific,tightly defined boundaries and clearly defined access points such that visitors can easily identify the fee area boundaries on the ground or on a that supports or sustains concentrated recreation use and that provides opportunities for outdoor recreation that are directly associated with a natural or cultural feature,place,or activity,waterway,canyon,travel corridor,geographic attraction the recreation attraction.
the guidelines require a hira to meet the same criteria as the rea requires for an area where the forest service may collect a standard amenity recreation fee,and add four more criteria the guidelines also include the heightened requirement that the six amenities be located in an integrated manner so they reasonably accommodate the visitor.
finding that the land adjacent to the catalina highway met all of the guidelines requirements,the forest service designated that area as a hira.the fee structure there remained essentially identical to the one under the recreational fee demonstration program,with one concession to the rea an exemption for visitors who drive through without stopping except at pullouts and overlooks the forest service also chose to exempt all visitors who enter the mount lemmon hira without a car.not exempted,however,are visitors who drive into the hira,park their cars,then picnic,camp,or hike in undeveloped areas accessible from the highway.any such visitor who fails to pay the fee and display a valid pass is subject to a fine.
based on their position that the forest service was impermissibly imposing fees on that group of visitors,plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as reimbursement of fees they had already paid,on behalf of a putative class defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint,which the district court granted.the sole issue on appeal is the district court ruling that count i alleging that the forest service violated d of the rea by collecting a standard amenity recreation fee for parking and hiking,picnicking,or camping in undeveloped areas in the mount lemmon hira failed to state a claim.
defendants argued that the forest service interpretation was entitled to deference,and under chevron its interpretation was reasonable.the district court disagreed that chevron deference was warranted,finding that the interim implementation guidelines indicated that the forest service might not have conducted notice and comment rulemaking.the court,however,applied deference,based on its conclusion that the forest service had crafted the guidelines through its official duty,based upon more specialized experience and broader investigations and information than is likely to come to a judge in a particular case.skidmore,at.under this less deferential review,the district court nonetheless agreed with defendants that the forest service interpretation of the rea in the guidelines was reasonable.
plaintiffs filed a rule e motion to reconsider,arguing that the statute was unambiguous,so the district court should not have deferred to the agency interpretation the court erred in applying skidmore deference to a statute carrying criminal consequences and even if skidmore review were proper,the court did not correctly apply it.the court largely disagreed,but did find that it had erred in failing to state that the statute was ambiguous before proceeding to apply skidmore.finding that the error was harmless,however,the court denied the motion.
