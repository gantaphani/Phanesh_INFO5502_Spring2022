this case involves efforts to clean up three old dumps in the bloomington,indiana,area,that became contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs,dioxin,and other toxic chemicals over the years.the federal environmental protection agency epa and cbs corporation formerly westinghouse,and now we will call it cbs as the parties have done reached agreement on a remediation plan.the task of cleaning and restoring toxic waste sites is a complex one,and it is subject to numerous federal and state laws.some bloomington area residents,however,including plaintiffs sarah frey,kevin enright,and protect our woods,pow,believe that the current plan does not comply with federal or state law.they sued under a number of those statutes and indiana common law,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,and sought a temporary restraining order tro to prevent cbs from initiating remediation work at one of the sites.after briefing and a hearing on the tro,the district court issued an order dismissing the plaintiffs complaint in its entirety for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.plaintiffs appeal.for the reasons stated below,we reverse in part and affirm in part.
in,the united states brought an enforcement action against cbs predecessor,westinghouse,under the com prehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla,et,to force cbs to clean up two dump sites contaminated with pcbs.the state of indiana intervened as a plaintiff.two years earlier,the city of bloomington,indiana,had filed a separate suit in federal court against westinghouse seeking cleanup of two other sites.the suits were consolidated,and the parties ultimately negotiated a consent decree that called for excavation and incineration of the toxic materials from the four named sites plus two more that were added later.years later,in,frey sued in an effort to attack the earlier consent decree on a variety of procedural grounds,but with the ultimate goal among others of overturning the epa decision to use an incinerator to dispose of the waste.the district court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and this court affirmed in schalk reilly,cir.
in,the indiana state legislature passed a law aimed at blocking the proposed incinerator.this obstacle pushed the formal epa,the state of indiana and its department of environmental management,the city of bloomington,the bloomington utilities service board,monroe county,indiana,and to the negotiating table,where they began discussions to modify the consent decree.under the direction of a special master appointed by the district court,and after a period of public comment,the epa issued record of decision amendments for the three dump sites that are now before us bennett dump,neal landfill,and lemon lane landfill.the appellants discussed a fourth site,neal dump,in their opening appellate brief,but that site was nowhere mentioned in their complaint and we thus agree with the appellees that any disputes with respect to neal dump are not properly before us.unlike the earlier consent decree,the new cleanup plans called for digging up only areas of highly contaminated hot spots and then centralizing the contaminated soil and capping it.the plans also called for a variety of measures designed to prevent seepage and groundwater contamination at the sites.notably,the new plans did not require the construction of an incinerator at any site.
the frey group filed suit on april,challenging the modified remedies at all three sites under both federal and state law.they asserted federal jurisdiction under the citizen suit provisions of cercla,the resource conservation and recovery act,a,the toxic substances control act,a,the clean water act,a,the administrative procedure act,as well as under,and,with respect to their indiana public nuisance and air pollution claims,diversity and supplemental jurisdiction.
shortly after filing suit,the frey parties moved for a temporary restraining order that would forbid initiation of cleanup activities at lemon lane landfill.they asserted that the safeguards in place were inadequate to prevent large quantities of pcbs from being volatilized during the excavation process and deposited in surrounding residential areas,at great risk to the health of local citizens.the parties filed memoranda in support of and in opposition to the tro,and the district court heard arguments that touched on the court subject matter jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs lemon lane claims,among other subjects.no other site was included in the motion,and no other site was formally before the court.two days after the hearing,on may,the district court issued its order denying the tro and,without further briefing or argument,it dismissed plaintiffs complaint in its entirety.
it is clear from the court order that it entered a final judgment in the case for purposes of.the judgment of dismissal talks only about lemon lane,however,even though it discusses other procedural flaws without specifying to which sites they apply.the order concludes with the statement i n sum,the court dismisses this cause for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
we review de novo the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.sapperstein hager,cir.the first problem we encounter is a consequence of the manner in which the court addressed this issue.not only did it raise the point on its own perfectly permissible,in itself,for a true jurisdictional problem,see wellness l wellness house,cir,but it also went forward with its ruling and dismissal without giving any notice to the plaintiffs that it was considering doing so.we have warned that sua sponte dismissals without prior notice or opportunity to be heard are hazardous and that unless the defect is clearly incurable a district court should grant the plaintiff leave to amend,allow the parties to argue the jurisdictional issue,or provide the plaintiff with the opportunity to discover the facts necessary to establish jurisdiction.joyce joyce,cir see also shockley jones,cir.unless our review of the plaintiffs complaint reveals incurable defects,we therefore must remand to the district court for further proceedings.
federal claims 
although the frey group relied on a number of federal statutes for their federal claims,they concede that plaintiffs challenging activities covered by cercla removal or remedial action provisions,see,must satisfy the requirements of cercla h,h,before a court can entertain the case.schalk,at.this is not,strictly speaking,a problem of subject matter jurisdiction in the sense of the federal court competence under article iii.see united states tarkowski,cir.it is instead a question about the prerequisites that the plaintiffs must satisfy to obtain relief.a person who does not comply with h will not prevail,but the court power to adjudicate the case is clear,and a dismissal should be predicated on federal rule of civil procedure b,not on b.a standard rule in considering jurisdictional challenges is that when the court jurisdiction and the claim for relief are predicated on the same federal statute but the basis for relief is subsequently found to be inapplicable,the district court should not dismiss the case under rule b,but rather proceed as if jurisdiction exists and determine the merits of the claim under rule b.central states,southeast and southwest areas health and welfare fund neurobehavioral associates,cir.this distinction matters not only because a dismissal for want of jurisdiction does not preclude a suit from being refiled in a proper court,but also because the district court finds jurisdictional facts in connection with a proper motion under rule b,while disputed facts are treated quite differently for purposes of rule b,for which the court indulges every reasonable presumption in favor of the complainant.
in our view,what we have here is the same kind of problem as the one the supreme court considered in steel citizens for a better environment,d,where the court observed that jurisdiction is a word of many,too many meanings,id.at.citation omitted,and concluded that the elements of the cause of action in the statute before it went to the merits of the claim,not to jurisdiction.we note as well that h itself does not speak of subject matter jurisdiction it merely uses the term jurisdiction in one of the more limited senses to which the supreme court was alluding in steel.see also hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,d amendment to qui tam statute essentially creates a new cause of action even though amendment was phrased in jurisdictional terms,the new claim is subject to normal retroactivity rules.following the guidance of steel,which was handed down well after schalk,we will avoid the inaccurate term subject matter jurisdiction in the remainder of this opinion and speak instead of the plaintiffs ability to state a claim.
the relevant portion of cercla h states 
no federal court shall have jurisdiction under federal law to review any challenges to removal or remedial action selected under section of this title in any action except one of the following 
an action under section of this title relating to citizen suits alleging that the removal or remedial action taken under section of this title or secured under section of this title was in violation of any requirement of this chapter.such an action may not be brought with regard to removal where remedial action is to be undertaken at the site.
we have interpreted this language to mean that a federal court may not hear a citizen suit challenging a cercla removal or remedial action until that action has been taken or secured.in other words,the removal or remedial action must be complete.schalk,at.
in dismissing the plaintiffs suit,the district court found that removal and remediation activities at lemon lane landfill were planned but not yet complete.at the time of the tro hearing,this was so.according to the plaintiffs,planned removal and remediation activities have since been completed at the site.the court made no factual findings,however,regarding what kind of removal and remedial actions were planned for and had been taken at neal landfill and bennett dump.this presents a problem.if the district court had been correct that this was a problem of subject matter jurisdiction,then it would have erred because the record is missing crucial findings of jurisdictional fact.in the absence of such findings,we would be unable to assess whether plaintiffs are correct when in their complaint they assert that,for purposes of h,removal and remediation are in fact complete at those sites.see tarpley jeffers,cir remanding for findings of jurisdictional fact on whether factual requirements for claim were met to establish jurisdiction.because the real problem is instead a potential failure to state a claim,two questions are pertinent first,we must construe the legal meaning of the word complete in the statute,and second,we must decide whether any set of facts consistent with the complaint would allow plaintiffs to recover.the plaintiffs right to proceed to the summary judgment stage and possibly beyond depends on the outcome of those inquiries.
conceptualizing the issue as one of subject matter jurisdiction,the frey group has urged us to remand the case to the district court for proper jurisdictional findings.presumably,a remand for further proceedings on any other ground would suit them just as well.the appellees would naturally prefer a straightforward affirmance.a broad reading of the appellees argument is that it is clear from the record that something related to the pcb removal and remediation plan remains to be done at each of the sites.this is enough,they argue,to preclude a suit over any aspect of the epa chosen remediation plan,regardless of how speculative that something may be or how remote from the challenged completed actions.in fact,the appellees are presenting an argument over the meaning of the term complete in the statute.complete could mean not only that the planned cleanup procedures have been carried out but also that all subsequent monitoring has ceased.on the other hand,it might mean,more modestly,that the remediation measures are finished,but that occasional visits of environmental authorities in the future could occur to ensure their effectiveness,or even that particular stages of the remedial plan have reached completion.
if it means the first of these,the appellees may well be correct but if it means the second or third,then the need for further proceedings to clarify the record is apparent.in our view,the middle ground is most consistent with the statute.it is important that the statute itself speaks of removal where remedial action is to be undertaken at the site.the remedial action to which it refers is logically different from a later effort to ensure that the action was effective.the frey group goes further and argues for the third possibility,namely,that the reference to remedial action means only a stage of a broader remediation plan.they have some support for this interpretation in both the legislative history of the statute and earlier decisions.see conf,at t he phrase removal or remedial action taken in h is not intended to preclude judicial review until the total response action is finished if the response action proceeds in distinct and separate stages.clinton county commissioners epa,cir citing separate stages legislative history with approval neighborhood toxic cleanup emergency reilly,applying separate stages analysis but see hanford downwinders coalition,dowdle,cir recognizing possibility that h might forever preclude judicial review.but we are concerned that this reading ignores the lack of a qualifier on the phrase remedial action.the statute does not say a remedial action,or a stage of a remedial plan.instead,it calls flatly for restraint from suit when remedial action period remains to be done.we thus reject the staged approach plaintiffs have suggested.
because we also see a distinction between the active steps designed to clean up a site and later measures designed to monitor success,we do not believe that this reading would have the undesirable consequence of converting h into a silent prohibition on judicial review.see north shore gas epa,cir suggesting h limitation on the timing of judicial review ought not extinguish judicial review.nor does our reading suggest that h precludes a lawsuit merely because there is a hypothetical possibility that later monitoring might lead the epa or the state authorities to devise a remediation plan.the key word there is hypothetical.one can always imagine some future action,especially in the area of environmental regulation,but the time limits in h are geared to concrete,existing,remedial measures not measures that might be devised at some future date.
the defendants have also invited us to comb the available record and take judicial notice of documents which,they argue,establish the scope of the planned removal and remediation activities at the sites,what has thus far been completed,and the fact that more remains to be done.we decline this invitation to make factual determinations that are properly the province of the district court.
the frey group has raised certain constitutional claims for the first time on appeal.they contend that if h indefinitely precludes judicial review of arbitrary and capricious agency actions that result in injuries to their health and property then the statute effectuates an unconstitutional deprivation of liberty and property without due process.we rejected similar arguments in schalk,at,and we find no reason to address them further here either.first,of course,the lack of any such constitutional arguments in the complaint is an obvious problem.perhaps plaintiffs can be forgiven for that omission,however,because of the unexpected way in which the district court ruling arose and their lack of any opportunity to amend the complaint.in light of our interpretation of the statute,however,we think it unnecessary to speculate about this constitutional issue.perhaps there is no claim to be made any more perhaps plaintiffs will try to renew some modified claim before the district court.either way,there is nothing for this court to discuss.
for these reasons,and because we do not find any incurable defects in the plaintiffs federal law claims with
