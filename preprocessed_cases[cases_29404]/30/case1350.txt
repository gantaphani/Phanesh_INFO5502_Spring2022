defendants mcwane,mcwane,james delk delk,and michael devine devine appeal their convictions for their roles in a clean water act cwa conspiracy count,as well as their convictions for substantive violations of the cwa counts,and after the defendants convictions,the united states supreme court addressed how to define navigable waters under the cwa in rapanos united states,d.the definition of navigable waters in the jury charge in this case was erroneous under rapanos,and the government has not shown that the error was harmless.accordingly,we must vacate defendants cwa convictions and remand the case for a new trial.
mcwane also appeals its conviction for making a false statement to the environmental protection agency epa count because mcwane was entitled to a judgment of acquittal on that charge,we vacate mcwane conviction on count as well.
background 
defendants 
defendant mcwane is a large manufacturer of cast iron pipe,flanges,valves,and fire hydrants.mcwane has numerous manufacturing plants.this case concerns mcwane plant in birmingham,alabama hereinafter the plant or mcwane plant.
defendants delk and devine,along with charles barry robison and donald harbin,worked in management positions at mcwane plant at all relevant times.
robison was mcwane vice president of environmental affairs.defendant delk was the general manager of the plant.defendant devine was the plant manager,and he reported to defendant delk.harbin was the maintenance manager,and he reported to defendant devine 
avondale creek 
the cwa violations at issue involve mcwane discharge of pollutants into avondale creek,which is adjacent to mcwane plant.
avondale creek flows into another creek called village creek.in turn,village creek flows approximately miles into and through bayview lake,which was created by damming village creek.on the other side of bayview lake,village creek becomes locust fork,and locust fork flows approximately twenty miles out of bayview lake before it flows into the black warrior river.
at trial,the government presented testimony,inter alia,from an epa investigator fritz wagoner that avondale creek is a perennial stream with a continuous uninterrupted flow into village creek.wagoner testified that there is a continuous uninterrupted flow not only from avondale creek into village creek,but also from village creek through bayview lake and into locust fork,and ultimately into the black warrior river.
on,wagoner admitted that he did not conduct a tracer test to check the flow of avondale creek into the black warrior river.wagoner explained that a tracer test is a procedure whereby a concentrated dye is put into a body of water and tracked to determine where that water body flows.wagoner conducted no tests to measure the volume of water discharged from avondale creek or between the bodies of water that connect avondale creek and the black warrior river.he conceded that the water level in avondale creek was so low that he was able to walk through avondale creek all the way down to its intersection with village creek.furthermore,wagoner testified that village creek is dammed creating bayview lake and that the dam runs all the way across village creek.wagoner only site visit was in april.this was more than four years after the violations at issue in this case.
the government presented no evidence,through wagoner or otherwise,of the chemical,physical,or biological effect that avondale creek waters had or might have had on the black warrior river.indeed,the district court observed that there was no evidence of any actual harm or injury to the black warrior river.
defendants conduct 
mcwane plant manufactures and lengths of pipe.mcwane utilizes a great deal of water in its pipe manufacturing processes.the water that runs out of the pipe manufacturing machines is generally referred to as process wastewater.the evidence at trial established that process wastewater accumulated in large amounts in basements under mcwane machine and machine.the process wastewater contained various contaminants,including hydraulic oil,excess iron,and trash.
the cwa authorizes the epa,and states with programs approved by the epa,to issue permits for the discharge of pollutants,in compliance with the national pollutant discharge elimination systems npdes.these permits are known as npdes permits.the alabama department of environmental management adem administers the npdes program in alabama.
mcwane obtained an npdes permit from adem that authorized mcwane to discharge some process wastewater.specifically,mcwane npdes permit allowed it to discharge some treated process wastewater into avondale creek,but only from one discharge point at the plant,and only if other discharge limits and bookkeeping requirements were met.mcwane npdes permit also allowed it to discharge storm water runoff from industrial activity from other discharge points at the plant through.mcwane,however,was not permitted to discharge process wastewater from any point at the plant other than.
at trial,the government established that mcwane discharged process wastewater into avondale creek from discharge points other than,in violation of the express provisions of its npdes permit.numerous former mcwane employees testified that the plant was in disarray by the late and that process wastewater was all over the plant.process wastewater overflowed on a regular basis when it was pumped from the machine and machine basements.the process wastewater would then spill into the storm water runoff discharge points and flow into avondale creek.
one mcwane employee described the extent of the process wastewater discharges as e nough to drown a small village.indeed,multiple witnesses testified that process wastewater from mcwane plant was regularly discharged into avondale creek.harbin,for instance,testified that between may and january,process wastewater was discharged into storm drains fifteen out of every twenty operating days per month.other witnesses testified that the plant basements were pumped which led to the corresponding noncompliant wastewater discharge every friday night.
mcwane npdes permit listed defendant delk as one of two people with the authority and responsibility to prevent and abate violations of adem regulations.trial testimony established that defendant delk was everybody boss at the plant,and that on multiple occasions,defendant delk ordered mcwane employees to pump process wastewater from the basements,despite knowing that the wastewater had nowhere to go but avondale creek.further testimony established that defendant delk watched as wastewater spilled or was pumped into the center courtyard of the plant,and that delk once instructed harbin to falsify a water sample for inspectors.
likewise,defendant devine also ordered mcwane employees to violate the npdes permit.one former employee,troy venable,testified that he overheard a conversation between defendant devine and a mcwane maintenance foreman in which devine said that it would be easier for mcwane to pay off its fines than to pay to fix one of the sources of the problem.there was also testimony about two separate incidents in which defendant devine ordered that excess process wastewater be pumped from the basements despite there being no appropriate place to put the water,and told employees that he did not care how the water got out of the plant as long as it was gone.
additionally,mcwane former safety and personnel director,john walsh,testified that on one occasion,an adem inspector came to inquire about pollutant discharges from the storm water discharge runoff points.according to walsh,defendant devine directed him to lie to the adem inspector and tell the inspector that the cause of the discharges was mcwane of fire hydrants.walsh testified that he complied with defendant devine instructions because he was told to and feared that if he did not,he would lose his job.
the epa inspected the plant in april,and subsequently required mcwane to submit plant inspection reports and other documents concerning the plant.mcwane responded with two separate document productions,on august,and september.the document productions were accompanied by certifications signed by robison.
indictment 
in may,a count indictment was issued against mcwane,delk,devine,robison,and donald bills the plant engineer.the indictment was superseded in july.
count of the superseding indictment alleged that defendants mcwane,delk,devine,robison,and bills conspired to knowingly discharge pollutants into the waters of the united states in violation of mcwane npdes permit and the cwa to defraud the united states to knowingly and willfully make false statements and to obstruct justice.counts alleged that defendants mcwane,delk,and devine knowingly caused discharges of pollutants from a storm water outfall into avondale creek in each month from may through february,in violation of mcwane npdes permit and the cwa.counts accused mcwane and delk but not devine of similar npdes and cwa violations from march through january.
count alleged that mcwane,delk,and devine knowingly caused discharges of pollutants from the wastewater outfall on may,in violation of the maximum limits allowed by mcwane npdes permit and the cwa.count charged mcwane and robison with making false statements to the epa on or about august,and september.finally,count alleged that mcwane obstructed justice by providing false and misleading information to the epa regarding its discharge of wastewater.
a jury trial was held in may and june.at the close of the government evidence,the district court dismissed bills from the case dismissed robison from count conspiracy,leaving robison only in count struck three of the four objects of the conspiracy in count,leaving the sole object of the conspiracy as the knowing discharge of pollutants into the waters of the united states in violation of the npdes permit and the cwa and dismissed counts and in their entirety.
on june,the jury returned guilty verdicts on all remaining counts except counts,and.all three appellants here,mcwane,delk,and devine,were convicted of conspiracy to violate the cwa count,as well as multiple substantive violations of the cwa.mcwane,delk,and devine were convicted on counts,and,and mcwane and delk were also convicted on counts,and.additionally,mcwane and robison were convicted of making a false statement to the epa count 
on december,the district court sentenced the defendants.
the district court sentenced delk to months probation including months of nighttime home detention,and a fine of devine to months probation including months of nighttime home detention,and a fine of and mcwane to months probation and a fine of million 
ii.discussion 
the parties disagreement as to what constitutes a navigable water under the cwa is at the heart of this appeal.
jury instruction on navigable waters 
the cwa generally prohibits the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters.see a.under the cwa,navigable waters are defined as the waters of the united states,including the territorial seas.id.the parties agree that the definition of navigable waters is a key element of the cwa criminal offenses in this case.
based on the supreme court rapanos decision,defendants contend that avondale creek is not a navigable water within the meaning of the cwa,and that the district court erroneously instructed the jury as to the definition of the term navigable waters.the government responds that avondale creek connection with the black warrior river village creek renders avondale creek a navigable water within the meaning of the cwa 
the problem in this case arises because the district court charged the jury that navigable waters include any stream which may eventually flow into a navigable stream or river,and that such stream may be and flow only intermittently,as follows 
as to counts through,a water of the united states includes any stream which may eventually flow into a navigable stream or river.the government does not have to prove that the stream into which the discharge is made is itself navigable in fact.what it must prove is that the stream into which the discharge is made may eventually flow directly or indirectly into a navigable stream or river.the stream into which the discharge is made may be a natural or manmade stream and may flow continuously or only intermittently,as long as it may eventually flow directly or indirectly into a navigable stream or river whose use affects interstate commerce.
a navigable stream or river is defined as one that is used or is susceptible of being used in its ordinary condition,as a highway for interstate commerce,over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water.
emphasis added.
the district court jury charge was based,inter alia,on this court decision in united states eidson,cir.in eidson,we observed that congress chose to define broadly the waters covered by the cwa that it was well established that congress intended to regulate the discharge of pollutants into all waters that may eventually lead to waters affecting interstate commerce and that courts repeatedly had recognized that tributaries to waters affecting interstate when or intermittently subject to the cwa.eidson,at.
however,the defendants trial occurred before rapanos,and the supreme court indicated in rapanos that eidson expansive definition of tributaries is no longer good law.rapanos.at plurality opinion citing,inter alia,eidson,at.even the government here tacitly concedes that the jury charge given by the district court in this case was erroneous to some extent in light of rapanos.see resp.br.of united states,at.nevertheless,the government contends that any error in the jury charge was harmless and does not require reversal.
accordingly,we consider rapanos in detail in order to determine exactly how and to what extent the district court navigable waters instruction was erroneous.we then consider whether the incorrect jury instruction was harmless error.
rapanos and the proper definition of navigable waters 
in rapanos,which involved two consolidated cases,the supreme court addressed how the statutory term navigable waters should be construed under the cwa.the consolidated cases involved the discharge of pollutants into four separate wetlands.see rapanos.at plurality opinion.the wetlands at issue varied in terms of their precise connections to bodies of water,but the wetlands were all near ditches or drains that eventually empt ied into traditional navigable waters.id.in the case of three of the four wetlands,it was not clear whether the connections between the wetlands and the nearby drains and ditches were continuous or intermittent,or whether the nearby drains and ditches contain ed continuous or merely occasional flows of water.id.in the case of the fourth wetland,the ditch running alongside the wetland was separated from it by a berm that was largely or entirely impermeable to water.id.
in both cases,the sixth circuit concluded that the wetlands were covered by the cwa.id.the supreme court consolidated the cases and granted certiorari to decide whether the wetlands actually constituted waters of the united states under the cwa.id.at.
the entire supreme court agreed that the term navigable waters encompasses something more than traditionally waters.id.at plurality opinion id.at kennedy,concurring id.at stevens,dissenting.however,five justices concluded that remand was necessary for consideration of whether the wetlands at issue were navigable waters covered by the cwa,and whether the epa and the army corps of engineers had impermissibly extended their regulatory authority under the cwa.id.at plurality opinion id.at roberts,concurring id.at,kennedy,concurring.
despite agreeing that the remand was necessary for further consideration of whether the wetlands at issue were covered by the cwa,the majority fractured with regard to the proper definition of the term navigable waters.justice scalia wrote for a plurality,while justice kennedy provided the fifth vote for reversal.justice stevens dissented,joined by the remaining three justices 
justice scalia plurality opinion 
although justice scalia plurality opinion recognized that the statutory term navigable waters includes something more than traditional navigable waters,the plurality also emphasized that the qualifier navigable is not devoid of significance.id.at plurality opinion.according to the plurality,navigable waters include only relatively permanent,standing or continuously flowing bodies of water forming geographic features that are described in ordinary parlance as streams,oceans,rivers,and lakes.id.at alteration in original citation omitted.the plurality emphasized that bodies of water such as streams,oceans,rivers,and lakes,navigable waters are continuously present,fixed bodies of water,as opposed to ordinarily dry channels through which water occasionally or intermittently flows.id.at.
moreover,while the plurality was of the view that relatively continuous flow is a necessary condition for qualification as a water,relatively continuous flow,in and of itself,is not an adequate condition under the plurality test.id.at.
the plurality also applied its test to the specific wetlands at issue in rapanos.noting that under prior precedent wetlands adjacent to navigable bodies of water were considered waters of the united states,the plurality stated that only those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are waters of the united states in their own right,so that there is no clear demarcation between waters and wetlands,are adjacent to such waters and covered by the act.id.at second emphasis added.wetlands with only an intermittent,physically remote hydrologic connection to waters of the united states lack the necessary connection to covered waters id.to summarize,the plurality test for establishing that wetlands are covered by the act requires two findings first,that the adjacent channel to the wetland contains a water of the united states,a relatively permanent body of water connected to traditional interstate navigable waters and second,that the wetland has a continuous surface connection with that water,making it difficult to determine where the water ends and the wetland begins.id.at alteration omitted.
the plurality also noted that although it did not reach the issue,there was no reason to suppose that its construction would significantly affect the enforcement of the cwa,in that lower courts have not characterized intermittent channels as waters of the united states.id.the plurality observed that from the time of the cwa enactment,lower courts have held that the discharge into intermittent channels of any pollutant that naturally washes downstream likely violates the cwa,even if the pollutants discharged do not emit directly into covered waters,but pass through conveyances in between.id.citations omitted.
justice kennedy concurrence 
justice kennedy supplied the fifth vote for reversal and agreed with the plurality that the sixth circuit had failed to apply the proper test as to what constitutes a navigable water.see id.at kennedy,concurring stating that the sixth circuit recognized the proper test applicability,but failed to apply it correctly.however,justice kennedy disagreed with the plurality over the substance of the proper test.
according to justice kennedy,the supreme court actually established the test for determining whether a water or wetland constitutes a navigable water under the cwa five years prior to rapanos,in solid waste agency of northern cook county united states army corps of engineers,d swancc.see rapanos.at kennedy,concurring.citing swancc,justice kennedy wrote in his rapanos concurrence that the applicable test for determining whether or not a water or wetland is navigable is the significant nexus test.see id.at kennedy,concurring citing swancc,at.at.in justice kennedy view,a water or wetland can only be navigable under the cwa if it possesses a significant nexus to waters that are or were navigable in fact or that could reasonably be so made.id 
because rapanos was a wetlands case,justice kennedy concurrence then focused on when a wetland meets the significant nexus test.a wetland meets the significant nexus test if,either alone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the region,it significantly affect s the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of other covered waters more readily understood as navigable.id.at.when,in contrast,wetlands effects on water quality are speculative or insubstantial,they fall outside the zone fairly encompassed by the statutory term navigable waters.id.
justice kennedy also emphasized that a mere hydrologic connection between a wetland and a body of water would not necessarily be sufficiently substantial to meet his significant nexus test.id.at.according to justice kennedy,a mere hydrologic connection may be too insubstantial for the hydrologic linkage to establish the required nexus with navigable waters as traditionally understood.id.at.under justice kennedy test,the required nexus must be assessed in terms of the statute goals and purposes,which are to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.id.at citation omitted.
justice stevens dissent 
justice stevens,writing for himself and three other justices,would have upheld the army corps of engineers and epa broad interpretation of cwa jurisdiction and concluded that the wetlands at issue in rapanos were navigable waters,waters of the united states.id.at stevens,dissenting.
as aptly noted by chief justice roberts in his concurrence,neither justice scalia plurality opinion,justice kennedy concurrence,nor justice stevens dissent command ed a majority of the court on precisely how to read congress s limits on the reach of the cwa.id.at roberts,concurring.in addition,justice stevens dissent noted that while both the plurality and justice kennedy agree that there must be a remand for further proceedings,their respective opinions define different tests to be applied on remand.id.at stevens,dissenting.
justice stevens dissent then stated that the four justices joining his opinion would uphold cwa jurisdiction in all cases in which either the plurality or justice kennedy test is met,as follows 
given that all four justices who have joined this opinion would uphold the corps jurisdiction in both of these in all other cases in which either the plurality or justice kennedy test is remand each of the judgments should be reinstated if either of those tests is met.
id.first emphasis added.
c.the governing rule of rapanos 
given the various opinions,the parties dispute what constitutes the governing definition of navigable waters under rapanos.the defendants argue that only justice kennedy concurrence,the significant nexus test applies.the government responds that if avondale creek can be shown to satisfy either the plurality test or justice kennedy test,that is sufficient to sustain cwa jurisdiction in this case.
the circuits likewise are split on the question of which rapanos opinion provides the holding.both the seventh and the ninth circuits concluded that justice kennedy concurrence controls and adopted the significant nexus test.see cal.river watch city of healdsburg,cir river watch ii united states gerke excavating,cir,cert.denied,wl.the first circuit,on the other hand,concluded that because the dissenting rapanos justices would find jurisdiction under either justice scalia plurality test or justice kennedy significant nexus test,the united states may elect to prove jurisdiction under either test.united states johnson,cir citation omitted,cert.denied,wl.because the ninth circuit in river watch ii expressly adopted the seventh circuit reasoning in gerke,we review gerke in detail,and then johnson.
in gerke,the seventh circuit,faced with a supreme court remand in light of rapanos,addressed which rapanos opinion governed the further stages of the case before it.gerke,at.citing marks united states,d,the seventh circuit first noted that when a majority of the supreme court agrees only on the result of a case,lower courts are to follow the narrowest ground to which a majority of the justices would have assented if forced to choose.gerke,at.the gerke court explained that it found justice kennedy test to be narrower so far as reining in federal authority is concerned in most cases,though not in all id.at.
in support,the gerke court noted that t he plurality justices also thought that justice kennedy ground for reversing was narrower than their own,because they concluded their extensive and in places harsh criticism of the concurrence by saying that justice kennedy tips a wink at the agency,the corps of engineers,inviting it to try its same expansive reading again.id.at quoting rapanos.at plurality opinion.in that regard,the gerke court observed that justice kennedy concurrence expressly rejected two limitations imposed by the plurality on federal authority over wetlands under the cwa.id.citation omitted.
the gerke court surmised that in some wetlands cases justice kennedy would vote against finding cwa jurisdiction due to the lack of a significant nexus,even when the plurality and the dissenting justices would vote for cwa jurisdiction due to a connection between wetlands however remote and a continuously flowing stream however small.id.at quotation marks and citation omitted.however,the gerke court dismissed such instances as rare and concluded that,as a practical matter,justice kennedy concurrence provides the least common denominator.id.
in contrast,the first circuit in johnson determined that it would uphold cwa jurisdiction in those cases in which either justice scalia test or justice kennedy test was satisfied.johnson,at.justice stevens four dissenting justices in rapanos would vote to uphold cwa jurisdiction whenever either of the two tests were met,the first circuit reasoned that the simple and pragmatic way to determine the governing standard was to find cwa jurisdiction in either situation.id.at.
the first circuit acknowledged marks language that the holding of a fractured decision is the position of the justices who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds id.at quoting marks,at.at.the first circuit nevertheless cited various cases in which,in the first circuit view,the supreme court itself had examined not only plurality and concurring opinions,but also dissenting opinions,in order to determine the holding of an earlier,fragmented supreme court decision.see id.at.the first circuit concluded that its approach was therefore particularly sound given that the supreme court itself has moved away from rigid application of the marks formula.id.at 
for the reasons stated below,we join the seventh and the ninth circuits conclusion that justice kennedy significant nexus test provides the governing rule of rapanos.
marks expressly directs lower courts,including this court,that w hen a fragmented supreme court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices,the holding may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.marks,at.at emphasis added quotation marks and citation omitted see also united states,cir,cert.denied,d.the narrowest grounds is understood as the less common ground.johnson bd.of regents,cir.we simply can not avoid the command of marks.
we are controlled by the decisions of the supreme court.dissenters,by definition,have not joined the court decision.in our view,marks does not direct lower courts interpreting fractured supreme court decisions to consider the positions of those who dissented.see king palmer,en banc w e do not think we are free to combine a dissent with a concurrence to form a marks majority.marks talks about those who concurred in the judgment,not those who did not join the judgment.marks,at.at.it would be inconsistent with marks to allow the dissenting rapanos justices to carry the day and impose an test,whereby cwa jurisdiction would exist when either justice scalia test or justice kennedy test is satisfied.see rapanos.at stevens,dissenting.the fact that the dissenting justices would uphold cwa jurisdiction under both justice scalia test and justice kennedy test is of no moment under marks.further,when the supreme court justices are interpreting their own prior opinions,they can always reconsider them and thus may look more broadly to the rationale in a dissent.we do not have that luxury 
thus,pursuant to marks,we are left to determine which of the positions taken by the rapanos justices concurring in the judgment is the narrowest,the least.see marks,at.at bd.of regents,at.the issue becomes whether the definition of navigable waters in the plurality or concurring opinions in rapanos was less,of cwa jurisdiction.see gerke,at.
notably,justice kennedy test,at least in wetlands cases such as rapanos,will classify a water as navigable more frequently than justice scalia test.see gerke,at rapanos.at stevens,dissenting see also johnson,at.this is because justice kennedy concurrence rejected two limitations imposed by the plurality test on the definition of navigable waters.rapanos.at kennedy,concurring.specifically,justice kennedy concurrence rejected the plurality requirement that navigable waters must be relatively permanent,standing or flowing bodies of water,and also rejected the plurality requirement of a continuous surface connection.id.at quotation marks and citations omitted.as discussed later,in factual circumstances different from rapanos,justice scalia test may be less restrictive of cwa jurisdiction however,in determining the governing holding in rapanos,we can not disconnect the facts in the case from the various opinions and determine which opinion is narrower in the abstract.thus,pursuant to marks,we adopt justice kennedy significant nexus test as the governing definition of navigable waters under rapanos.see gerke,at river watch ii,at.
d.the jury instruction was erroneous and not harmless error 
we next consider whether the district court jury charge comported with justice kennedy significant nexus test 
again,under justice kennedy concurrence,a water can be considered navigable under the cwa only if it possesses a significant nexus to waters that are or were navigable in fact or that could reasonably be so made.rapanos.at kennedy,concurring.moreover,a mere hydrologic connection will not necessarily be enough to satisfy the significant nexus test.id.at.the district court here did not mention the phrase significant nexus in its navigable waters instruction to the jury or advise the jury to consider the chemical,physical,or biological effect of avondale creek on the black warrior river.rather,the district court instructed the jury that a continuous or intermittent flow into a body of water would be sufficient to bring avondale creek within the reach of the cwa.as such,the instruction did not satisfy justice kennedy significant nexus test and was erroneous.
moreover,the government bears the burden of establishing that the jury charge error was harmless.see neder united states,d concluding that the omission of an element from a jury instruction is an error that is subject to analysis united states olano,d when a defendant has made a timely objection and review applies,the government has the burden of establishing that any error was harmless united states mathenia,cir same.
in order to carry its burden,the government must establish that the error did not affect defendants substantial rights.a.we have explained that in the case of error the government can meet this burden by showing that the error did not affect the verdict,or had but very slight effect.united states hornaday,cir quoting kotteakos united states.if the government can establish with fair assurance that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,the judgment is due to be affirmed even though there was error.id.at quoting kotteakos,at.at.nevertheless,t he harmless error standard is not easy for the government to meet.it is as difficult for the government to meet that standard as it is for a defendant to meet the prejudice standard for plain error review.mathenia,at.
here,the government failed to satisfy its burden.although wagoner the epa investigator testified that in his opinion there is a continuous uninterrupted flow between avondale creek and the black warrior river,he did not testify as to any significant nexus between avondale creek and the black warrior river.the government did not present any evidence,through wagoner or otherwise,about the possible chemical,physical,or biological effect that avondale creek may have on the black warrior river,and there was also no evidence presented of any actual harm suffered by the black warrior river thus,the government failed to establish that the jury instruction error did not affect the jury verdict or had but very slight effect,and the district court navigable waters instruction was not harmless error 
we recognize that the government,attempting to show harmless error,stresses that it presented evidence of a continuous flow between avondale creek a relatively permanent,fixed body of water and the black warrior river a water,and argues that this evidence satisfies justice scalia test.the government also emphasizes that even the seventh circuit in gerke noted that there may be some cases in which justice kennedy would find no cwa jurisdiction,but justice scalia and the dissenting justices would,and that as a practical matter,counting the rapanos votes,defendants convictions should be affirmed under justice scalia test.
this case arguably is one in which justice scalia test may actually be more likely to result in cwa jurisdiction than justice kennedy test,despite the fact that justice kennedy test,as applied in rapanos,would treat more waters as within the scope of the cwa.see gerke,at recognizing the potential for such cases but classifying them as rare.to be sure,the district court jury instruction was still erroneous even under justice scalia plurality opinion,because the instruction allowed the jury to find that defendants discharges were into a navigable water even if the jury also concluded that avondale creek flowed only intermittently.but under justice scalia test,that error may well have been harmless,because wagoner,the epa investigator,clearly and unambiguously testified that there is a continuous,uninterrupted flow between avondale creek and the black warrior river.under justice scalia test,the district court jury instruction error arguably did not affect the verdict,or had but very slight effect.hornaday,at citation omitted.thus,the decision as to which rapanos test applies may be in this case,and so it is not surprising that the government advocates a practical,approach whereby all plurality,concurring,and dissenting counted 
nevertheless,as we have already discussed,marks requires us to adopt the narrowest view of the justices who concurred in the judgment in rapanos.thus,justice kennedy test is the test against which we have measured the district court jury instruction for harmless error.justice kennedy test is also the test that the district court must apply on remand,for the reasons explained 
e.other cwa arguments 
defendants raise several other arguments related to their cwa convictions,all of which lack merit.
first,all defendants contend that the district court navigable waters error,discussed supra,entitles them to judgments of acquittal,and not merely new trials,because there was insufficient evidence that defendants discharged any process wastewater into a navigable water.
preliminarily,we observe that on appeal,defendants do not contend that there was insufficient evidence that their discharges were into a navigable water as that term was incorrectly defined for the jury by the district court in the actual trial.indeed,the government presented sufficient evidence that defendants discharges were into a navigable water as the term was incorrectly defined by the district court,and so acquittal is not warranted on that ground.
rather,defendants contention is that they are entitled to judgments of acquittal based on the district court rapanos error.this argument,however,ignores our precedent stating that r emand for a new trial is the appropriate remedy where any insufficiency of evidence is accompanied by trial court error whose effect may have been to deprive the government of an opportunity or incentive to present evidence that might have supplied the deficiency.united states,cir,overruled on other grounds by bryan united states,d.here,we need not evaluate whether there was insufficient evidence that defendants discharges were into navigable waters as that term is properly defined under rapanos.instead,it is enough to note that the district court erroneously defined navigable water and made it clear to the parties far in advance of trial that it would continue to use its erroneous definition throughout the case.that decision deprived the government of any incentive to present evidence that might have cured any resulting insufficiency or met justice kennedy significant nexus test thus,under,we conclude that remand for a new trial is the appropriate remedy in this case.
second,all defendants contend that there was insufficient evidence that any discharges of process wastewater occurred in specific months,as charged in the indictment,entitling defendants to a judgment of acquittal.however,defendants concede that the government put forth sufficient evidence that five of the charged cwa violations counts,and occurred as charged in the indictment.moreover,harbin testified that between may and january,process wastewater was discharged into storm drains at least fifteen out of twenty operating days per month,and several former employees testified that pumping regularly occurred on friday nights.
third,delk and mcwane argue that there was insufficient evidence that they participated in a cwa conspiracy,and delk further argues that there was insufficient evidence that he discharged any process wastewater or caused anyone else to discharge wastewater in violation of the cwa.we disagree.for example,delk was one of two mcwane employees designated as having responsibility for mcwane npdes compliance,and witnesses testified that delk gave orders to discharge process wastewater and once directed harbin to falsify a water sample so that mcwane could pass an inspection.
fourth,we reject delk and devine argument that they were deprived of their due process rights to a fair trial when the district court struck three of the four objects of the cwa conspiracy from the indictment at the close of the government case delk and devine primarily rely on united states adkinson,cir however,that case is materially distinguishable.in adkinson,four of the five objects of the conspiracy in the indictment did not state an offense under prevailing law,and the government presented evidence as to those four objects that was not relevant to the fifth object.adkinson,at.the district court in adkinson only permitted the government to present such evidence because the government assured the district court that the prevailing law would change before the end of the trial however,the expected change in the law did not occur in time.id.at.the district court in adkinson then struck the four legally impermissible objects of the conspiracy after the trial,but at that point,the district court had allowed into evidence m ountains of details relevant only tangentially,if at all,to the ultimately charged scheme.id.at.as this court observed on appeal in adkinson,the district court thus obviously invited the jury to convict for conduct not,ultimately,even alleged to be a crime.id.emphasis added.
in contrast,the four objects of the cwa conspiracy in this case were legally proper under prevailing law,and the district court simply determined that the evidence did not support the objects that were ultimately struck.adkinson,at noting that adkinson was not a case where perfectly proper charges were ultimately found by the court not to be supported by the evidence at trial.moreover,the district court stated that substantially all of the evidence relating to the stricken objects of the conspiracy also related to the cwa discharges,and defendants have failed to establish that the district court abused its discretion in that evidentiary ruling 
finally,we recognize that devine argues that the government had to prove that devine knew the terms of mcwane npdes permit and knowingly violated the permit.we need not determine whether the district court should have required the government to establish that devine knew the terms of mcwane npdes permit.any such error committed by the district court in this regard was harmless,because there was ample evidence presented that devine did in fact know the terms of mcwane npdes permit.
false statement in count 
mcwane last argument is that it is entitled to acquittal on count,the false statement count.under,a conviction for making a false statement in a matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the united states requires proof of five elements a statement,falsity,materiality,specific intent,and agency jurisdiction.united states herring,cir.
count against mcwane concerns certifications that robison signed on mcwane behalf and that mcwane submitted to the epa.there is no dispute that the statements in the certifications were material.rather,mcwane contends that the government presented insufficient evidence to satisfy elements two falsity and four specific intent.specifically,mcwane contends that what robison represented in the certifications was not false and that the government presented no evidence that robison opposed to the underlying plant inspection reports prepared by other persons and submitted with the false.
we first review the allegations in count and then explain why the record supports mcwane argument for several reasons.
first,the language of the certifications,introduced into evidence at trial,is materially different from the charge in count,and thus the certifications themselves do not support that charge.count charged mcwane and robison with making a false statement to the epa,in violation of,as follows 
mcwane,and charles barry robison,the defendants,in a matter within the jurisdiction of the epa did knowingly and willfully make a materially false,fictitious,and fraudulent statement and representation that is,the defendants certified that documents submitted on or about august,and september,to epa pursuant to a request under the cwa,including daily and monthly inspection forms,were true,accurate,and complete,when in truth and fact,as defendants mcwane and charles barry robison then well knew and believed,certain daily and monthly inspection forms included in the submission to epa were false.
in sum,count alleged that mcwane and robison certifications falsely represented that the plant inspection reports submitted to the epa were true,accurate,and complete,when in truth and fact,mcwane and robison well knew that certain of the submitted inspection reports for january through march false 
however,mcwane correctly points out that robison,on mcwane behalf,did not certify that he personally knew that the attached,the plant inspection accurate,or even that he had personally reviewed the inspection reports.rather,robison certified only that the documents were prepared under his direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to ensure that qualified personnel would properly gather and evaluate the documents,and that based on his inquiry of those persons who were responsible for gathering the documents,to the best of his knowledge,the documents were accurate.specifically,the certifications in evidence,which robison signed,state in full 
i certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision,in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted.based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information,the information submitted is,to the best of my knowledge and belief,true,accurate,and complete.i am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information,including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.
in other words,robison certified that other qualified persons had prepared the documents and advised him of the documents accuracy.because of the language in the certifications,robison could truthfully make the representations included in the certifications even if the underlying documents included with the submissions were false.
second,the government introduced no evidence that the plant inspection reports were prepared or gathered in a manner or a system other than that certified to by robison.the government also presented no evidence that robison did not inquire of the persons responsible for gathering the documents,as robison represented in the certifications.and the government presented no evidence that upon inquiring of such persons,robison learned from such persons that the documents were not true or accurate.indeed,the government acknowledged before the district court that it presented no evidence as to mcwane system or robison inquiries of the persons responsible for gathering the documents.thus,the government failed to prove that any of the statements actually certified to by robison were false.
third and most notably,mcwane points out that the epa previously required a certifying individual to certify that he or she had personally examined documents included in submissions,such as the one at issue here,but in,the epa eliminated the personal examination requirement.compare d requiring epa certifications to state that under penalty of law i have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted in this document and all attachments,with,eliminating the personal examination requirement.as such,the certifications in this case contained no representation that robison had personally reviewed the documents in question or that he was vouching for the documents accuracy based on his personal knowledge of the documents themselves.rather,robison only only had to others had prepared the documents,and that based on his inquiry of those who prepared the documents,the documents were accurate to the best of his knowledge.
the government responds that,notwithstanding the actual language of the certifications,robison had personal knowledge of the problems at the plant,the plant inspection reports showed no problems at the plant,and therefore,robison falsely certified that the inspection reports were accurate.even assuming without deciding that such offense conduct is adequately encompassed in count,the government still presented no evidence that robison ever personally reviewed the plant inspection reports or had personal knowledge of the contents of the plant inspection reports,which is needed to show that his certifications about the reports were false.
certainly,the government introduced evidence that some of the plant inspection reports themselves were false.indeed,walsh mcwane former safety and personnel director testified that he was the employee who prepared the inspection reports at issue and that some of them were false.however,walsh made clear that robison was not among the several mcwane employees who received copies of the inspection reports in the regular course of mcwane business additionally,there were approximately pages of documents attached to the certifications,and those documents included more than just the falsified inspection reports that accompanied the certifications at issue here the problem with the government conclusory the evidence showed that robison knew the inspection reports he submitted were that count is a specific intent crime,and the government can not point to any evidence that robison actually knew the contents of the particular inspection reports accompanying the certifications or that robison actually knew that those particular inspection reports contained false information 
the government thus failed to establish that robison certified statements were knowingly false.at most,the government proved that robison negligently submitted documents to the epa,but that is insufficient.see united states baker,cir stating that in order to sustain a conviction the government must prove that the defendant knowingly made a false statement with intent to deceive,and further stating that the specific intent requirement of excludes false statements made by inadvertence,mistake,or carelessness quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,we must conclude that mcwane is entitled to a judgment of acquittal on count.
