petitioners,a contingent of environmental and community groups,bring serious challenges to the state of california plans to improve air quality in the san joaquin valley,an area with some of the worst air quality in the united states.we must consider whether these state plans are sufficient in law,specifically,whether the regulating united states environmental protection agency epa erred in approving california state implementation plans sips to comply with national ambient air quality standards naaqs enacted under the federal clean air act caa concerning ozone and fine particulate matter in the san joaquin valley.we do this in the context of a cooperative federalism regime in which the federal agency sets required air quality standards but the state is a primary actor in creating plans to achieve them,followed by potential enforcement at both state and federal levels and by private citizens.
petitioners contend that the approved plans calculate the necessary emissions reductions and forecasts in part based on measures that are not themselves incorporated into the federally enforceable plan,in violation of the caa that other strategies to gain compliance with the naaqs proposed by the california air resources board carb and intervenor san joaquin valley unified air pollution control district the district that are in the plans are unenforceable goals,rather than the enforceable commitments that the caa requires that epa unlawfully approved the plan relating to ozone insofar as that plan lacked enforceable transportation control measures and that the circuit holding in nrdc epa,that epa relied on the wrong statutory provision of the caa in crafting its fine particulate matter implementation rule,pursuant to which the fine particulate matter plan at issue was approved,gives another important reason to grant the petition.
we hold that by approving california plans even though the plans did not include the mobile emissions standards on which those plans rely to achieve their emissions reductions goals,epa violated the caa.we also hold that epa did not violate the caa by not requiring inclusion of other state mechanisms in its plans,and that other control measures approved by epa are enforceable commitments as the caa requires 
states and the federal government must work together to improve air quality for individuals nationwide.this is so because the caa has established a uniquely important system of cooperative federalism in the quest for clean air.the caa makes the states and the federal government partners in the struggle against air pollution.jensen family farms,monterey bay unified air pollution control,cir quoting motors united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.the caa protects the nation air quality by authorizing epa to establish naaqs that apply to air pollutants.epa designates areas that fail to attain the naaqs as nonattainment areas.id.d.
the caa requires states to address nonattainment areas by developing a sip that lays out a plan for how a nonattainment area will eventually comply with the naaqs.a.after public notice and hearings,a state must adopt the sip and submit it to epa for review and approval.id.a.epa must then act on the sip,approving or disapproving it in part or in whole.k.once approved by epa,a sip bec o me s federal law,and c annot be changed unless and until epa approve s any change.safe air for everyone epa,cir emphasis omitted.the caa provides a private right of action for citizens to enforce a sip by bringing a civil action in federal district court.
the caa also regulates mobile source emissions,such as those from cars and trucks.congress has generally preempted states from setting mobile source emissions standards.jensen,at citing a.california,however,may set its own mobile source emissions standards,with epa approval.id.at citing b motor vehicles e nonroad sources.california thus relies on its own mobile source standards in the development of its sips.
the present challenge relates to epa approval of revisions to california sip,and specifically to plans for achieving compliance with national standards for two pollutants fine particulate matter and ozone.
in,epa promulgated hour and annual standards for.the relevant parts of california plan to meet these requirements are the district plan,revised in and and provisions of carb state strategy,as revised in and,that relate to the san joaquin valley collectively,the plan.the plan was proposed for inclusion in california sip.on november,epa approved in part and disapproved in part the plan in a final rulemaking,and the timely petition for review in case number followed.
as to ozone,epa promulgated the hour ozone standard to replace the hour standard in,and adopted a more stringent hour ozone standard in.the hour standard refers to the average concentration of ozone,which can contribute to lung disease,as measured over an hour period in a given area.the key parts of california plan to meet the hour ozone standard are the district ozone plan,as revised in and and the provisions of carb state strategy,as revised in and,that pertain to the san joaquin valley collectively,the hour plan.epa approved the hour plan on march,and the timely petition for review in case number followed.
we refer collectively to the and hour plans as the plans.because the two petitions are closely related and involve the same parties,we address the petitions together.
we have jurisdiction to review epa action pursuant to b.we review approval of a sip by considering whether the epa decision was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or contrary to law.sierra club epa,cir noting that when assessing caa challenges,we apply the general standard of review for agency decisions set forth in the administrative procedure act.with respect to the caa,congress has given epa general rulemaking authority,a,which,when exercised,requires our deference in accordance with chevron.id.at.
chevron,natural res.def.council,d,generally sets forth the framework by which we review an agency interpretation of a statute.id.at.under this framework at the first step we determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.i f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
sierra club,at.epa interpretation of its own regulations is given considerable deference and must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.thomas jefferson shalala,d internal quotation marks omitted see also auer robbins,d.
because the language and structure of the caa demand that all control measures on which the plans rely to attain the naaqs be included in the sip and subject to enforcement by individuals and by epa,we grant the petition for review in part.
as explained above,the caa makes the regulation of mobile source emissions a federal responsibility,and congress has expressly preempted states from setting emissions standards for mobile sources.jensen,at citing.the notable exception to this general rule is that california is permitted to set its own mobile emissions standards so long as it obtains epa approval.id.at citing.once approved,these measures waiver measures,which are more stringent than federal alternatives,allow the state to avoid the preemptive federal emissions standards.b.
a sip must include enforceable emission limitations and other control measures as may be necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable requirements of this chapter.id.a a.the caa provides a private right of action for citizens to enforce a sip provisions through a civil action in federal court,but only those provisions actually included in the sip are subject to such enforcement,see el comite para el bienestar de earlimart warmerdam,cir.
here,the plans control strategies are based in significant part on reductions that will be achieved through waiver measures,which allow consideration of the stricter state standards rather than federal standards.thus,although epa approved the waiver measures such that they are not subject to federal preemption,epa approved the plans at issue here without including those waiver measures on which the state strategy to comply with the naaqs for and hour ozone partially relied.petitioners argue that in so doing,epa violated the plain terms of the caa.we agree.
epa acknowledges that the plans rely in part on waiver measures but argues that because of epa longstanding policy of not requiring waiver measures to be specifically included in california sips and because of congress alleged ratification of that practice under the savings clause in the caa,see,the caa does not require waiver measures,which have already been subject to an epa approval process,to undergo an additional approval process by being included in a sip.
but,to the contrary,the plain language of a refutes epa position.the statute makes clear that sips shall include all emissions limitations,control measures,means,and techniques on which the state relies to assure compliance with the caa.a a emphasis added.the language associated with include is mandatory.moreover,the phrase necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable requirements of this chapter refers to the caa as a whole a chapter of title of the,rather than the section relating to sips.a.there is no viable justification for reading this section to simply permit,rather than affirmatively mandate,a sip to include all measures required to achieve compliance with the naaqs.instead,common sense tells us that a sip must include waiver measures to the extent that they are needed to achieve a state compliance with the federally required air quality standards.
as for epa ratification argument,the caa savings clause states in relevant part 
each regulation,standard,rule,notice,order and guidance promulgated or issued by the administrator under this chapter,as in effect before november,shall remain in effect according to its terms,except to the extent otherwise provided under this chapter,inconsistent with any provision of this chapter,or revised by the administrator.
id.emphasis added.the plain language of this section says that only official policies set forth in a pre regulation,standard,rule,notice,order,and guidance,and that are not inconsistent with the caa remain in effect.but,as noted,the epa interpretation that waiver measures need not be included in sips does contradict the plain language of a.because the meaning of the statutory language is clear,it is unnecessary to consider whether epa interpretation is reasonable.see chevron,nrdc,d if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.
this plain language reading is further supported by the necessary for meeting federal requirements are not a part of the sip,then,while the state agency,carb,perhaps could enforce them,the responsible federal agency,epa,would not be able to bring an action directly challenging violation of those state standards.it is the primary responsibility of epa to ensure that congress aims to ensure healthy air quality have been carried out,and it is fundamentally error if any of the standards necessary for federal compliance are not within the sip so as to be enforceable directly by the responsible federal agency.the federal agency,epa,not the state agency,carb,has the fundamental duty to carry the ball across the goal line to achieve compliant air quality levels or satisfactory progress toward that end.
epa interpretation of the savings clause as ratifying its practice of approving california sips without subjecting the waiver measures to review when the sip is approved is also inconsistent with citizens private right of action to enforce sip provisions.see.citizens can not enforce provisions that are not a part of the sip.epa in its briefing concedes that its interpretation would prevent both citizens and epa itself from enforcing the california waiver measures under the caa in the context of a sip because they are not in the sip.epa argues,however,that citizens have recourse under the caa to enforce federal standards,and that carb itself can enforce the waiver measures.but this frustrates congressional intent as expressed in the caa provision of a private right of action through which citizens may enforce sips and their constituent parts,and not merely enforce federal baseline standards for emissions generally.also,as petitioners point out,the federal standards are less stringent than california standards.this means that the sip provisions themselves,which depend on the more stringent waiver measures,can be only incompletely enforced by citizens in federal court,insofar as emission reductions in the plans depend on reductions created by the gap between federal measures and the waiver measures.
having any state law standards that are necessary for compliance with the federal law requirements incorporated as part of the sip,so as to be directly enforceable by epa and by citizens,is a more safe and sensible system of enforcement than that urged by epa.we conclude that the enforcement gap for private citizens and epa in the present sip is inconsistent with the caa requirements and the express aims of congress.because the plain language of the caa does not support epa interpretation that waiver measures need not be included in sips that depend on them,we conclude that epa violated the caa by approving the plans without the inclusion of the waiver measures on which they relied.
petitioners also contend that epa erred when it did not require the plans to include measures.these are other state enforcement measures that are not a part of the sip but that petitioners claim are also needed to meet attainment standards.for the reasons explained below,we reject this challenge.
specifically,petitioners challenge epa failure to require the sip to include three measures the heavy duty diesel engine chip reflash measure the diesel particulate matter control measure for on road heavy duty diesel fueled vehicles owned or operated by public agencies and utilities diesel particulate matter rule and the solid waste collection vehicle rule.
regarding the heavy duty diesel engine chip reflash measure,epa explains that because that rule was partially invalidated by the california supreme court and repealed four years before epa approved the plan,that rule could not have been included in the plan.see approval of san joaquin valley plan and state strategy,to be codified at pt.noting that any emissions reduction credit related to diesel engine chip reflashes were from those vehicles whose engine chips were reflashed before the rule was invalidated and adding that attempts to invalidate those reflashes could be prosecuted under caa provisions.epa did not give emission reduction credit based on the chip reflash rule itself,but instead based on actions taken under the rule before the california supreme court invalidated it.petitioners argument related to this measure fails.
regarding the diesel particulate matter rule and the solid waste collection vehicle rule,epa did not approve those mobile source measures into the plans because their overall emission reduction effects were de minimis and did not affect epa overall evaluations of california ability to meet the relevant air quality standards by the statutory deadline.see id.
we have applied in statutory interpretation the ancient principle that the law does not care about trifles.see,skaff meridien am.beverly hills,llc,cir we conclude that the caa allows epa to ignore trifling emission control measures when epa evaluates sips.here,epa has urged that these state law measures were not included in the sip because they had no measurable impact on california ability to meet required air quality levels.we can not say on the record before us that epa conclusion that these standards have de minimis impact on the relevant issue is arbitrary and capricious,or contrary to law.see a.further,the caa requires sips to include any of a variety of e
