the state of colorado brought an enforcement action against defendants power engineering company,redoubt limited,and richard lilienthal collectively referred to as pec for violations of the colorado hazardous waste management act.plaintiff united states,acting on behalf of the environmental protection agency epa,filed its own lawsuit against pec for the same violations,seeking financial assurances.the district court denied pec motion for summary judgment,finding that the epa lawsuit was not barred by statute or by res judicata.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to a and affirm.
background 
power engineering company has operated a metal refinishing and chrome electroplating business in denver,colorado since.redoubt limited owns land and buildings leased and used by power engineering.richard lilienthal is an officer of both power engineering and redoubt,as well as the sole shareholder of both companies.each month power engineering produces over kilograms of waste,including arsenic,lead,mercury,and chromium.this waste is covered by the resource conservation and recovery act rcra,and is defined as hazardous.after the colorado department of public health and environment cdphe learned of a discharge of hexavalent chromium into the platte river,it conducted inspections of pec and discovered that chromium emanating from pec was contaminating the groundwater.it also found that pec treated,stored,and disposed of hazardous wastes without a permit.cdphe issued a notice of violation on june,and an initial compliance order in july.cdphe issued a final administrative compliance order on june,requiring pec to comply with hazardous waste laws,implement a cleanup plan for soil,conduct frequent inspections,and submit periodic reports.
pec failed to comply with this order,and cdphe issued an administrative penalty order on december,assessing civil penalties of million.when pec refused to pay the penalties,cdphe brought suit in state court to force compliance with both orders.the colorado state court found on march,that the final administrative compliance order and the administrative penalty order were enforceable as a matter of law.
before cdphe issued its final administrative compliance order,the epa had requested that cdphe enforce rcra financial assurance requirements against pec.the epa notified cdphe that it would bring its own enforcement action if cdphe failed to do so.when cdphe did not demand financial assurances,the epa filed its own suit against pec.
the epa and pec filed for summary judgment.pec argued that the rcra statute and res judicata barred the epa from overfiling which has been defined in this context as t he epa process of duplicating enforcement actions.harmon indus.browner,cir.the district court granted summary judgment for the epa and held that pec must provide in financial assurances and obtain liability coverage for accidental occurrences.pec appeals the district court grant of summary judgment.
ii.discussion 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.wark united states,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.id.
permissibility of overfiling 
pec contends that the district court erred in not following the eighth circuit interpretation of rcra in harmon.under rcra,a state may apply to the epa for authorization to administer and enforce its own hazardous waste program if its program is equivalent to the federal program and provides adequate enforcement.b,c.the harmon court held that rcra allows the epa to overfile after providing notice to the authorized state only if the epa withdraws authorization or if the state fails to initiate an enforcement action.at.we review the district court construction of a statute de novo.foutz united states,cir.
a state program authorized pursuant to rcra operates in lieu of the federal program.b.pec contends that the in lieu of language renders the epa powerless to file a separate lawsuit when a state has been authorized to run its own program and initiates its own enforcement action.the epa disagrees and interprets rcra in its regulations to allow such overfiling.c note,see also united states power eng g,d,discussing the history and context of these regulations.
because the epa is charged with the administration of rcra,chevron nrdc guides our review of its interpretation of the statute,d.our first question is whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if the statute is silent or ambiguous,however,we defer to the agency interpretation if it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.more specifically,if there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation,we must accept the agency interpretation unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.alternatively,if there is only an implicit delegation of authority to the agency,we must accept a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of the agency.id.at.after reviewing the statute,we conclude that it is ambiguous,and we defer to the agency interpretation.
the epa argues that congressional intent to allow overfiling is demonstrated by a,which conditions epa enforcement only on providing notice to an authorized state t he epa administrator may issue an order assessing a civil penalty for any past or current violation t he administrator shall give notice to the state in which such violation has occurred prior to issuing an order or commencing a civil action under this section.as another circuit court held,read in context,section a simply conditions the exercise of federal authority on the provision of prior notice.wyckoff epa,cir.
the epa finds support for this interpretation in rcra citizen suit provision,which explicitly limits authority for citizen suits.this provision states,no citizen suit may be commenced if the epa or state has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil or criminal action b.no similar language is included in section,which only requires notice.w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.brown gardner,d.because congress explicitly prohibits citizens from duplicating a federal or state rcra action in section b,but omits such language from section,the statute suggests that congress intended to prohibit duplicative citizen suits but not duplicative federal suits.
pec argues,however,that several provisions of rcra support its interpretation that rcra unambiguously prohibits overfiling.pec relies largely on section b,which provides that,once a state hazardous waste program has been approved under rcra,s uch state is authorized to carry out such program in lieu of the federal program under this subchapter in such state and to issue and enforce permits b.pec argues that,because an authorized state program operates in lieu of the federal program,the epa may not file an enforcement action after a state has done so.the linchpin of pec argument is that the term program in incorporates the exclusive responsibility to enforce criminal provisions penalizing the disposal of hazardous wastes.united states elias,cir quoting united states macdonald watson waste oil,cir.the statute,however,does not define the term program,and the meaning of the term is ambiguous.wyckoff epa,cir.the epa argues that program refers only to the administration of the regulatory program,and not to enforcement.it argues that section b simply provides that once authorization has taken place,state requirements replace federal requirements,because the state requirements may be more stringent.i allowing states to adopt more stringent and extensive requirements than the federal requirements.
