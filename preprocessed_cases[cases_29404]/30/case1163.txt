this is an appeal from the summary dismissal by the federal energy regulatory commission commission or ferc of a complaint brought by two citizens groups dedicated to maintaining sustainable populations of anadromous and resident fish in the cowlitz river basin in southwestern washington state.the petitioners,friends of the cowlitz river and,allege that the city of tacoma tacoma has failed to comply with the terms of its license to operate a hydroelectric project on the cowlitz river.although we are concerned that the grounds for the commission summary disposition rested on an improper legal basis and lacked support in the record,we deny the petition on the ground that the ferc has virtually unreviewable discretion to enforce or,in this case,to not enforce any alleged license violations.
the cowlitz river project ferc project is a major hydroelectric project in lewis county,washington,consisting of two dams the upstream mayfield dam,completed in,and the downstream mossyrock dam,completed in.separated by thirteen miles,the two dams have a combined generating capacity of megawatts.the project is owned and operated by tacoma,under a license granted by the ferc in license.
the cowlitz river,a lower tributary of the columbia river,is home to native populations of anadromous fish,including chinook and coho salmon and steelhead trout.at the time of the licensing,opponents of the project,including the washington department of fisheries since renamed the washington department of fisheries and wildlife,or wdfw,argued that the dams would destroy the use of the river above mayfield dam for spawning.in response to these concerns,tacoma maintained that it could sustain fish populations by facilitating upstream and downstream fish passage through the construction of fish ladders and other facilities.in addition,it proposed creating extensive fish hatcheries as a complement to the fish protection measures.
accordingly,the following two articles were eventually incorporated into the license.article states,in pertinent part 
the licensee shall,for the conservation,and development of fish and wildlife resources,construct,maintain and operate,or arrange for the construction,maintenance and operation of such facilities and comply with such reasonable modifications of the project structures and operation as may be ordered by the commission upon its own motion or upon the recommendation of the secretary of the interior of fish and wildlife agency or agencies of any state in which the project or a part thereof is located,after notice and opportunity for hearing and upon findings based on substantial evidence that such facilities and modifications are necessary and desirable,reasonably consistent with the primary purpose of the project,and consistent with the provisions of the federal power act.
in addition,article of the license states 
licensee shall continue to cooperate with the fishery agencies in the development of details of design,operation,and maintenance of these and of other facilities needed to maintain the existing runs of anadromous fish at the project and in evaluating the degree of success of these facilities to maintain those runs.licensee shall submit to the commission for approval functional drawings of permanent downstream migrant fish traps and design drawings of the dam as proposed for construction on the cowlitz river adjacent to the salmon hatchery,and construction thereof shall not commence prior to commission approval.
in,tacoma and wdfw entered into an agreement agreement whereby the parties stated their intention to maintain the numbers of adult salmon returns at defined levels,through two methods by making use of the watershed above mayfield dam to spawn and rear salmon and by supplementing these populations through hatchery production.tacoma agreed to construct,operate,and maintain certain fish facilities,including an adult release site,a downstream migrant trapping facility in the mossyrock reservoir,downstream migrant bypass facilities at mayfield dam,a salmon hatchery along with facilities for supplying sufficient water to the hatchery,a barrier dam,fish ladders,and adult separation facilities.
at the same time,the agreement expressly recognized that it is subject at all times to the terms and conditions of the said license irrespective of the effect of any other wording or expression of intent otherwise set forth herein.tacoma submitted a preliminary draft in april to the commission,requesting comments and asking whether the license required the agency to approve the agreement.in its reply,the commission advised tacoma that its approval was not required,but suggested changes in several provisions and requested that a final copy of the agreement be included in the agency files.
in may,friends of the cowlitz river and filed a complaint with the ferc,alleging inter alia that tacoma had violated the terms of the agreement and the license by failing to maintain the levels of fish populations and by failing to cooperate with wdfw in instituting remedial measures.as relief for the alleged violations,these petitioner organizations requested that tacoma be ordered to comply with wdfw requests for additional hatchery facilities,that tacoma be required to make up the deficit in adult fish under the agreement or pay monetary compensation,and that tacoma be assessed a civil penalty for each day that the alleged violations continued.
according to the petitioners complaint,tacoma has failed to meet the required adult return numbers for at least one of the three anadromous species every year since the agreement inception.furthermore,the required numbers were not met for all three species during the five years immediately preceding the filing of the complaint,from through,when the numbers of returning fish dropped to crisis proportions.the complaint alleged that tacoma overreliance on a single salmon hatchery and the associated rearing densities constituted the primary reasons the mitigation levels in the agreement can not be met.although wdfw had proposed additional salmon rearing facilities since,tacoma consistently withheld its consent to these proposals.thus,according to the petitioners,tacoma refusal to cooperate has prevented the fish hatchery facilities from adequately mitigating for the fisheries resources damaged by the cowlitz river project.in addition,the petitioners claimed that tacoma had neglected its obligation under the license to operate downstream juvenile passage facilities through the dams,and that other key facilities had been allowed to languish with little or no use.finally,the petitioners charged that tacoma had failed to install and operate permanent downstream fish traps,or even to submit designs for such traps to the commission,in clear violation of article 
in the petitioners view,the agreement was intended by both parties to effectuate the terms of articles and,pursuant to which tacoma was required to design and construct facilities to sustain anadromous fish populations and to continue to cooperate with wdfw in the development of such facilities.as stated in the complaint,tacoma failure to provide sufficient rearing capacity to accomplish the adult fish returns required in the agreement,and its failure to cooperate with fish wildlife proposals or to submit feasible alternatives,constitute violations of the agreement and the analogous provision of article furthermore,tacoma recalcitrance in accepting much needed improvements in hatchery operations has severely damaged the fisheries resources of the cowlitz river besides the ecological harm,tacoma accumulated deficit in returning adult salmon has imposed substantial economic losses on complainants and the people of lewis county.
in november,nearly eighteen months after the filing of the complaint,the commission issued an order summarily dismissing the complaint without prejudice on the grounds that,among other things,the agreement was a private contract whose terms were never approved by the commission or incorporated into the license itself.the commission held that since alleged violations of the agreement did not amount to violations of the license,the complaint was meritless and did not require an evidentiary hearing or a formal investigation.
significantly,the commission did not base its ruling on its discretion to not enforce alleged license violations.rather,the commission affirmatively found that tacoma ha d complied with all of requirements of articles and of the license,ha d submitted all of the plans and design drawings required by those articles,ha d constructed and operated all of the fishery facilities specifically prescribed in the license,and wa s releasing new fish consistent with the requirements of the license.finally,the commission concluded that there was no basis for the allegation in the complaint that tacoma violated article of the license by failing to install and operate permanent functional downstream fish traps or to submit designs for such fish traps tacoma has been operating the downstream fish traps in compliance with article of the license there is no violation of the license.
in summarily disposing of the complaint,the commission also remarked that the relicensing proceeding was a preferable forum to resolve the issue of declining fish populations in the river.the commission likewise dismissed the complainants request for rehearing in january,after they had submitted more evidence intended to show that the agreement was in fact a part of the license.
according to the petitioners,there are presently no operating fish ladders at the dams,and the project currently blocks all upriver passage of anadromous fish upstream of the barrier dam.for its part,tacoma maintains that the levels specified in the agreement only represent goals,that these levels were based on unrealistic assumptions and imperfect knowledge about fish cycles at the time of the agreement,and that the recent sharp decline in numbers is not due to the city failure to abide by the terms of the agreement or the license,but is instead the result of factors beyond its control indeed,tacoma claims that it has expended considerable resources to comply with the agreement and license,and that it has met with substantial success in mitigating damage to fish populations.furthermore,tacoma contends that in requiring the city to cooperate with wdfw,article does not obligate it to acquiesce in all of wdfw requests,including the construction of additional salmon hatchery facilities.finally,tacoma argues as the commission reasoned in its summary disposition order that because the terms of the agreement were never formally incorporated into the license anyway,any failures to meet the terms of the agreement therefore do not constitute equivalent violations of the license.
significantly,tacoma license is due to expire in november,and consultations have already begun to establish relicensing terms.ferc at.both petitioner organizations,as well as wdfw,are participants in the relicensing negotiations.in this regard,however,the petitioners claim that tacoma is seeking to gain collateral advantage in the relicensing of the project by delaying and rejecting requests for compliance with its existing license.citing evidence from tacoma internal documents,the petitioners charge that tacoma strategy is consistently to reject demands for mitigation of existing violations,while committing to take a hard look at fisheries issues in the relicensing process.
in addition to other organizations and groups,wdfw,the fish and wildlife service usfws,and the national marine fisheries service nmfs successfully moved to intervene before the commission on the side of the petitioners tacoma has intervened on the side of the ferc.

did the commission err in summarily dismissing the complaint 
at the heart of the petitioners complaint lies the claim that tacoma has violated the agreement by failing to sustain the numbers of returning anadromous fish.for its part,the ferc,through its order dismissing the complaint,reasoned that the agreement was never incorporated into the license,and that therefore the facts alleged do not constitute a past or present violation of the license.
the ferc central legal premise is therefore predicated on the contention that the agreement only represented a private covenant between wdfw and tacoma,and that its terms had never been formally incorporated into the license itself.in this regard,the commission noted that even though it had commented on the agreement and accepted a copy for its files,it had never accepted the agreement as an amendment to the license.although the petitioners presented evidence of contemporaneous internal communications suggesting that tacoma itself viewed the agreement as effectuating the terms of articles and,the commission opined that even if it were true that tacoma and wdfw had intended the agreement to be incorporated into the license terms,the commission itself as party to the license had not acceded to the agreement.indeed,by its express language,the agreement is subject to the terms of the license.hence,any alleged violations of the terms of the especially the decline in anadromous fish not by themselves constitute violations of the license.
we find the commission conclusion with respect to the legal status of the agreement to be reasonable,and perhaps even deserving of deference.although the evidence in the record appears to indicate that the commission vetted and gave its blessing to the agreement,and that tacoma itself may have envisaged the agreement as specifying its obligations under the license,the parties themselves lacked the power and the ferc never formally agreed to incorporate its terms into the license.at most,the agreement bears on the parties interpretation of what the license requires.thus,the commission reasonably concluded that the agreement was never incorporated into the license.
such reasoning does not,however,mandate the further conclusion that no license violations may have occurred indeed,we hold that the commission interpreted article of the license unreasonably in light of the petitioners allegations.for even if the agreement was not formally incorporated into the license,it still constituted the only tangible manifestation of article requirement that tacoma cooperate with wdfw.as the petitioners have trenchantly argued,how else can one give meaning to the requirement that tacoma cooperate with wdfw,unless it is required to observe the agreement it reached with that agency the alleged violations of the agreement,in the form of failed fish quotas and lapsed commitments on tacoma part to build and operate facilities,thus constitute a colorable claim of failed cooperation with wdfw even without the formal incorporation of the agreement into the license.hence,to summarily dispose of the petitioners complaint was unjustified on that legal basis.
in addition,the petitioners complaint contained more than the bare allegation that tacoma had failed to meet the anadromous fish quotas enshrined in the agreement.other charges included tacoma alleged neglect in operating upstream adult and downstream juvenile passage facilities over both dams,in violation of article as well as tacoma alleged failure to install and operate or even submit for ferc approval permanent downstream fish traps,in violation of article 
the commission sidestepping of these factual allegations raises doubts about the legal correctness of its order under the ferc own summary disposition standard.summary dispositions are governed by ferc rule,the terms of which are analogous to the familiar legal standard for summary judgment general rule if the decisional authority determines that there is no genuine issue of fact material to the decision of a proceeding or part of a proceeding,the decisional authority may summarily dispose of all or part of the proceeding.b given that the allegations in the petitioners complaint raise material issues of fact that would,if proven true,amount to license violations,we hold that the ferc plainly erred in summarily disposing of the complaint.
put another way,the commission blanket conclusion that tacoma had not violated the terms of the license and that the petitioners specific charges with respect to fishtraps and downstream passage facilities were unfounded does not appear to be supported by substantial evidence.see b the finding of the commission as to the facts,if supported by substantial evidence,shall be conclusive.in conjunction with the agency refusal to conduct an investigation or an evidentiary hearing,discussed infra,the commission did not appear to take into consideration all of the relevant factors in reaching its ultimate determination.instead,the commission factual findings sound more like conclusory statements.accordingly,we believe that the commission decision summarily to dispose of the petitioners complaint was plainly erroneous as a matter of law 
finally,we find that the commission stated preference for addressing the problem of potential license violations and declining fish stocks through the relicensing process does not constitute a valid legal basis for disposing of the complaint.under fpa west supp,the commission enforcement powers and responsibilities are limited to violations of existing licenses a decision by the commission to defer consideration until relicensing,which operates only prospectively,has no basis in the terms of the statute.
our prior cases also support this conclusion.in confederated tribes,at,we held that the ferc could not satisfy its obligations under the relevant statutes by deferring consideration and implementation of fishery protection measures until after licensing.the petitioners in that case contested the relicensing of chelan county public utility to operate the rock island hydroelectric project on the columbia river,on the ground that fishery issues were not adequately addressed prior to the relicensing.the commission had elected to defer consideration of the problem of anadromous fish the lack of facilities for juvenile fish to migrate downstream past the its resolution in a parallel proceeding involving four other dams in the region.we granted the petition and set aside the license,stating that w hile we are sympathetic with ferc stated practical desire to resolve the fishery questions in a comprehensive proceeding covering all five of the dams,we hold that the statutes require ferc to examine fishery issues before issuance of a license.platte river whooping crane critical habitat maintenance trust ferc,finding that the commission had abused its discretion in failing to undertake any form of environmental assessment prior to issuing annual licenses to operators of a number of hydroelectric projects along the platte river,and rejecting as inadequate ferc promise to address the issue on relicensing.
as a practical matter,we agree with the petitioners that relying on this flawed legal basis summarily to dispose of the complaint could also unfairly impact the relicensing negotiations by not being held accountable for existing license violations,tacoma could leverage the need for mitigation of such alleged infractions to gain concessions in the relicensing process.in addition,relicensing often takes many years,during which time damage to fish stocks would go unabated.a failure to issue a remedial order could therefore bear on the project for an extended time period.in sum,although a deferral to the relicensing process might constitute a legitimate reason for the commission to decline to bring an enforcement action in this case it does not constitute a valid legal basis for summarily disposing of a complaint alleging violations of an existing license.
for all these reasons,we find that the commission erred in summarily dismissing the complaint 
did the commission abuse its discretion in failing to bring an enforcement action against tacoma for violating the license 
even though we find that the ferc summarily disposed of the petitioners complaint on an erroneous legal basis,we are mindful of the fact that as a general rule,the supreme court has held that an agency decision not to take enforcement action should be presumed immune from judicial review under apa a.chaney,at.indeed,inasmuch as the petitioners can not compel the ferc to enforce any license violations that may be occurring in the first place,we find this consideration to be dispositive for purposes of this case 
in contrast to affirmative agency actions which are subject to the application of meaningful standards of review,see,citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d,decisions not to enforce are typically committed to the agency absolute discretion,such that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency exercise of discretion.chaney,at.as such,the court likened such decisions to the choice of a prosecutor not to indict,and noted that they necessarily involve a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise,such as where to allocate agency resources and whether the agency is likely to succeed in its enforcement action.id.at.alaska fish and wildlife,at refusing to review the fish and wildlife service decision not to enforce the closed hunting season for migratory birds in alaska,on the ground that t he discretion granted to the fish and wildlife service precludes our review of the service failure to enforce the migr
