the united states department of the interior and various federal officials doi,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to plaintiffs elephant butte irrigation district of new mexico and el paso county water improvement district of texas the water districts on count i of the water districts complaint.the water districts the grant of summary judgment to doi on count vi of the complaint.for the reasons explained below,we affirm.
the operative facts of this case date back to the early twentieth century.the two projects involved in this litigation are the el paso and elephant butte irrigation districts,both of which are part of the rio grande valley irrigation project.that project was part of a national drive to irrigate arid western lands during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.much of the early irrigation work was originally undertaken by private entities.in,the federal government became involved when congress passed the reclamation act,which created a general reclamation fund for the federal financing of these irrigation projects under the auspices of the doi.see.at its inception,the reclamation fund was to be made up entirely of money received from the sale of public lands.the fund would then make loans to local water districts to finance the construction costs of irrigation projects.after construction was complete,the water districts were to reimburse the fund for the construction loans over a period of ten years.
the agricultural depression of the made congress original plan for the operation of the reclamation fund unworkable.many of the water districts were unable to make payments to the fund on their construction loans because of the depression,causing widespread default.moreover,the sale of public lands had slowed so much by the that it became impractical to make such sales the sole basis for the fund.congress first attempted to remedy the situation by extending the water districts term of repayment from ten to forty years.however,this worsened the problem by reducing even further the amount of cash going into the fund,and the fund became completely insolvent because it could not revolve quickly enough.
unsure what to do about the situation,congress commissioned a fact finders report to assess ways to address the circumstances facing the government,the water districts,and the reclamation fund.the report recommended that once the majority of construction costs had been repaid by the water districts,the districts should be required to take over from the government the operation and maintenance of the projects.in exchange,the water districts would be able to retain certain of the profits garnered by the irrigation projects rather than having to return all profits to the reclamation fund.the goal was to make both the water districts and the reclamation fund solvent.
based upon the recommendations contained in that report,congress amended the reclamation act in by adding,inter alia,a new provision,known as section,which stated as follows 
whenever the water users take over the care,operation,and maintenance of a project,or a division of a project,the total accumulated net profits,as determined by the secretary,derived from the operation of project power plants,leasing of project grazing and farm lands,and the sale or use of town sites shall be credited to the construction charge of the project,or a division thereof,and thereafter the net profits from such sources may be used by the water users to be credited annually,first,on account of project construction charge,second,on account of project operation and maintenance charge,and third,as the water users may direct.no distribution to individual water users shall be made out of any such profits before all obligations to the government shall have been fully paid.
section.section provided for what is called front end crediting,under which the water districts would first apply profits to their annual repayment obligations,then to their annual operation and maintenance charges,and finally as the water users decided.this method had the effect of reducing the districts next payment 
as the economic depression worsened,congress provided still more assistance to water districts in through a statute authorizing the secretary of the interior to grant the relief provided for in section to any of the projects mentioned in this act,without requiring such project to take over the care,operation,and maintenance of the project works.omnibus adjustment act of,ch,stat.the water districts would thus be absolved of their responsibilities under section and would be able to derive some profits from the project lands,which they could use to pay the reclamation fund.the act also removed the repayment obligations of the water districts with respect to any land in their project that had proved to be.
in,congress enacted a law authorizing the secretary of the interior to contract with the water districts for the purpose of terminating their leases of power privilege.see interior department appropriations act of,ch,stat.leases of power privilege had previously been granted by the secretary to the water districts pursuant to an earlier act of congress.in these leases,the federal government gave the water districts the right to build power facilities and to use the proceeds from those facilities to repay their construction obligations.however,the water districts never executed their rights to build power facilities on water project lands.the act was designed to return to the federal government the right to build power facilities while giving the water districts a distinct benefit relief from the obligation to repay their outstanding construction costs.both el paso and the elephant butte irrigation district entered into contracts with the secretary of the interior in accordance with the act.
despite these various attempts by congress to save the reclamation fund,it was still in dire financial straits in.consequently,congress enacted,known as the amendment to the interior department appropriations act of the amendment or.the amendment provided 
all moneys received by the united states in connection with any irrigation projects,including the incidental power features thereof,constructed by the secretary of the interior through the bureau of reclamation,and financed in whole or in part with moneys heretofore or hereafter appropriated or allocated therefor by the federal government,shall be covered into the reclamation fund,except in cases where provision has been made by law or contract for the use of such revenues for the benefit of users of water from such project provided,that after the net revenues derived from the sale of power developed in connection with any of said projects shall have repaid those construction costs of such project allocated to power to be repaid by power revenues therefrom and shall no longer be required to meet the contractual obligations of the united states,then said net revenues derived from the sale of power developed in connection with such project shall,after the close of each fiscal year,be transferred to and covered into the general treasury as miscellaneous receipts 
the amendment was designed to increase the reclamation fund by depositing into it any money made by federal power facilities.to that end,the amendment repealed the earlier right to profits from any power facilities granted to the water districts by section.however,the amendment contained a savings clause protecting the receipt by water districts of revenues provided for under preexisting contracts or other laws.
in and,the water districts took over the operation and maintenance of their irrigation facilities.in january,the complaint in this action was filed by the water districts against the federal government.in count i,the districts contended they were owed revenues granted to them by congress in section.they asserted that these revenues were owed them notwithstanding the subsequent enactment of,which they alleged did not repeal section.the government countered that did in fact repeal section in its entirety.the districts also asserted three other counts count ii,challenging the bureau of recl
