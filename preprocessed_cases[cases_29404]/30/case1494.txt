this is a petition for review of the environmental protection agency epa or agency response to this court remands in appalachian power epa,appalachian i,and appalachian power epa,appalachian ii.in those cases,we remanded the epa electric generating unit egu determinations,which are used to develop nitrogen oxide nox emission limits for regulated states and egus.states and several business and energy policy multiple challenges to the agency order on remand.several states intervene in support of the epa.
we hold that the epa satisfied its obligation on remand to engage in reasoned decisionmaking and explain its choice of methodology.the remaining claims are not properly before this court,as they were not raised at the time of the rulemaking or in the initial proceedings,and the epa did not reopen these issues on remand.for these reasons,we deny the petitions.
background 
regulatory background 
the clean air act,et caa,requires the epa to identify air pollutants that endanger the public health,and to formulate national ambient air quality standards naaqs that specify the maximum permissible concentrations of those pollutants in the ambient air.once the epa has established naaqs,each state must adopt a state implementation plan sip providing for the implementation,maintenance,and enforcement of the naaqs.michigan epa.pursuant to the statute,the epa has promulgated naaqs for ozone,which is linked to multiple adverse health effects.see pt.ozone,itself,is not emitted directly into the air rather,it is formed from chemical reactions between nox and volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight.nox is,therefore,a precursor of ozone.nox is emitted primarily from fossil fuel combustion sources,including motor vehicles and power plants.owing to the ability of nox to move through the atmosphere,emissions of nox in one area can result in ozone in a distant area.evidence in the record demonstrates that states in the eastern united states have difficulty attaining ozone standards because of ozone,or ozone precursor,emissions in upwind states.may.the two rules at issue in this petition deal with nox exhaust limitations on upwind states and egus within their borders.
the first rule was based on the work of the ozone transport assessment group otag.the otag was a national work group comprising states,along with representatives of epa,industry,and environmental groups,formed to study and devise solutions to the interstate ozone transport problem.michigan epa,at see also.at.based on otag findings,epa determined that nox emissions from jurisdictions were contribut ing significantly to in downwind states in violation of the caa.a d i i.accordingly,in october,the epa issued the nox state implementation plans call,which required states and the district of columbia to revise their sips to impose controls on nox emissions.fed reg,nox sip call.under the nox sip call,each upwind state must limit its summertime nox emissions to a statewide emissions budget.the budgets represent the amount of allowable nox emissions remaining after a covered state prohibits the nox amount contributing significantly to downwind.michigan epa.specifically,the nox state budgets represent the epa projection for nox emissions in for each state if highly controls were implemented.highly is defined as those controls capable of removing nox at a cost of or less per ton.see appalachian power epa.
the epa adopted the second rule in response to petitions from eight states requesting a finding,pursuant to caa section b,b,that stationary sources in upwind states were contributing to ozone in the petitioning states in violation of the caa.a d.each petitioning state further sought direct federal regulation of stationary sources in upwind states.because the section petitions raised many of the same issues as the nox sip call,the epa coordinated its response to the section petitions with the nox sip call rulemaking.based on the analysis underlying the nox sip call,the epa determined that sources in all or parts of states contributed to in the petitioning states therefore,the agency established emission limits for major nox sources in those states,section rule.as with the nox sip call,the epa considered both nox emissions and the cost of controlling them in determining which sources contributed significantly to downwind ozone.the epa also established a cap and trade program for the section rule,which allows sources with emissions that exceed their budget to purchase allowances from other facilities.
nox emissions budgets for both the section rule and the nox sip call are calculated for the year,although states and egus must begin meeting their budgets on may.see.april.additionally,both rules rely on the same underlying determinations.in setting the nox budgets,the epa divided each state nox emissions according to five source types or sectors egus,stationary sources such as industrial boilers,area sources smaller stationary sources,highway mobile sources,and nonroad mobile sources.the epa calculated budget allocations for each sector.see appalachian ii,at.at issue in this petition is the epa method for determining the egu budgets.
to calculate the egu budgets,the epa started with a baseline utilization measured as heat input,in million british thermal units mmbtu,from fossil fuels for each egu actual heat input from or,whichever was higher.to that baseline,the epa added a heat input growth factor.to determine the growth factor,the epa used the integrated planning model ipm.several assumptions went into the ipm,one of the most critical of which was projected electricity demand for the states.the epa utilized inputs derived from the model for.the epa then applied the projected heat input growth for the period to the or baseline to determine projected heat inputs for the year.under the nox sip call,each state can allocate its nox allowances to individual sources as it deems appropriate.under the section rule,epa distributed the allowances to specific egus based on historical heat input levels.
b.this court remands 
we have previously considered petitions for review of both the nox sip call and the section rule.in both cases we remanded the rules and instructed the epa to fulfill its obligation to engage in reasoned decisionmaking on how to set egu growth factors and explain why results that appear arbitrary on their face are,in fact,reasonable determinations.appalachian i,at appalachian ii,at.this decision was based,at least in part,on the fact that in two states actual utilization in already exceeded the epa projected level for.appalachian i,at.additionally,the epa implied prediction of negative growth in electricity generation over the course of a decade appear ed arbitrary,as it was left completely unexplained.id.while courts routinely defer to agency modeling of complex phenomena,model assumptions must have a rational relationship to the real world.id.citing chemical mfrs.ass epa.in sum,although we noted that epa choice may have been reasonable,its failure to explain why it made that choice was error,particularly in the face of contrary data.
epa response on remand 
epa published its response to this court remands in the federal register on may.remand response.there,the epa explained that it decided to retain the previously determined growth rates and provide a fuller explanation.the epa first pointed out that the modeled period utilized a consistent set of assumptions.while many commenters suggested using predicted annual growth rates in energy demand from or to,the agency was not aware of any projected heat input growth rates for that period for each state that were developed using a consistent set of assumptions.id.at.according to the epa,this court had already held that the epa decision to rely upon the ipm instead of inconsistent projections offered by individual states was not arbitrary and capricious.appalachian i,at.the epa also noted that the two time periods at issue overlap substantially and run a similar length of time.furthermore,the epa explained that the increased costs in and dollars associated with adding extra years to the model would require simplifying other assumptions within the model,thus decreasing its accuracy.id.at.in addition,by utilizing the years,the ipm results could be used in a variety of epa programs,including implementation of the recently revised naaqs for ozone.id.at.
the epa also addressed this court concerns regarding the difference between epa predictions and actual heat input levels at the time of the earlier appalachian cases.using data for the two years following those decisions,the epa points out that heat input in the two states cited as inconsistent with epa and west significantly dropped.id.at.the remand response explained that most of the regulated states actual heat input values are now consistent with epa predictions,and none are so far above epa predictions as to indicate that its assumptions are incorrect.the agency also conducted a historical analysis of heat input,which showed that it is quite variable and subject to both up and down swings.thus,heat input can decline over periods.id.at.
following epa publication of its remand response,two states and several business entities petitioned this court for review.they claim,inter alia,that the epa projections remain arbitrary,that epa use of the modeling years is unsupportable,and that epa predictions regarding future electricity demand were unreasonable.
ii.analysis 
this court sets aside epa final action under the caa if that action is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.d.the standard of review is the same for the nox sip call,which is not subject to d,but is subject to the administrative procedure act.a.under this familiar standard,a gency determinations based upon highly complex and technical matters are entitled to great deference.appalachian i,at quoting public citizen health research group brock.see also huls,browner,w e will give an extreme degree of deference to the agency when it is evaluating scientific data within its technical expertise.citation omitted.this is particularly true when we review the use of computer models because their scientific nature does not easily lend itself to judicial review.appalachian power epa.the epa has undoubted power to use predictive models as long as it explain s the assumptions and methodology used.small refiner lead task force epa.we will defer to the agency decision on how to balance the cost and complexity of a more elaborate model against the oversimplification of a simpler model.id.we will vacate if the agency conclusions drawn from this model are unreasonable.
we first address the standing of petitioner states.the epa contends that west virginia and illinois do not have standing to challenge the agency action,arguing that these states are suing as parens patriae on behalf of electric generators inside their respective borders.while it is true that a state does not have standing as parens patriae to bring an action against the federal government,that is not the case before us.maryland people counsel ferc,internal citations omitted.here,the states are suing as states.
the nox sip call directs each state to revise its sip in accordance with epa nox emissions budget for the state.the lower the emissions budget,the more difficult and onerous is the states task of devising an adequate sip.thus,lower growth factors leading to lower emissions budgets causes injury to the states as states.epa own brief belies its argument,as it states that u nder the nox sip call,states have the option of participating in a cap and trade program or obtaining the reductions through other mechanisms.this injury is sufficient to confer standing.city of olmsted falls faa,declining to decide whether a city may sue as parens patriae because injury to the city itself suffices for standing.
epa failure to provide an opportunity for comment 
petitioner states challenge epa failure to provide formal after adding data to the docket on remand.according to petitioner states,the caa requires epa to engage in formal procedures when promulgating or revising a sip under c or taking action under section.d b,n.during the remand proceedings,the epa published a notice of data availability noda that stated that the growth rates could be supported with a more robust explanation,based on the existing record.in addition,the epa stated it was considering new data that appear ed to confirm the reasonableness of the growth calculations.id.epa invited comment and gave thirty days to respond.
on march,epa released its second noda noda ii.after listing documents,the epa offered no invitation to comment.id.despite the lack of an invitation,illinois responded and asked for clarification of what had been added to the record and also requested the opportunity to have meaningful review and comment.illinois also reasserted the concerns it had raised in the first noda and reattached them for epa consideration.id.
the epa contends that no was required,because our earlier appalachian i ii cases merely remanded for a fuller explanation.as such,on remand no was required because epa was only providing a better explanation,not engaging in rulemaking.the epa also claims that even if were required it complied because,although it did not expressly request comment in noda ii,it did receive comments.
petitioner states have the better argument.the epa erred in not providing an opportunity to comment when it added new material to the record subsequent to its publication of the first noda.the caa specifically requires that epa shall specify a comment period for any action of the administrator under section.d n,d.
this court,however,will invalidate agency action because of procedural error only if the error is so serious and related to matters of such central relevance to the rule that there is a substantial likelihood that the rule would have been significantly changed if such error had not been made.national petrochemical refiners ass epa,quoting caa d,d.petitioner states argue that epa refusal to conduct full rulemaking fails under this standard.the only support petitioner states offer for this proposition,however,is their contention that had the states been given meaningful opportunity for comment,illinois would have been able to offer evidence about its nuclear power and electricity generation capacity that would have countered epa assumptions.this example is not convincing.
in its response to noda ii,illinois stated that it had already provided detailed support for illinois position that epa projected electrical generation was too low to epa and we have explained our analyses and supporting facts in detail.illinois pointed out that during the noda i comment period,it had commented on the data and on the broader underlying growth factor issues which illinois has repeatedly raised to epa.in illinois response to noda i,it specifically provided its opinion regarding its nuclear power generation and capacity.in sum,the only evidence petitioning states offer to show that the absence of formal procedures following noda ii caused epa to decide differently was,in fact,before the epa in responses to noda i.this is not sufficient under the applicable standard of review.while epa erred in failing to provide comment following noda ii,petitioners have offered no evidence that there is a substantial likelihood that the rule would have been significantly changed in the absence of the procedural error.
epa growth factor methodology 
this court previously found that the epa failed to explain its method for projecting egu growth rates.in appalachian i and appalachian ii,we remanded the rules at issue and instructed the epa to fulfill its obligation to engage in reasoned decisionmaking on how to set egu growth factors and explain why results that appear arbitrary on their face are,in fact,reasonable determinations.appalachian i,at appalachian ii,at.in particular,we were concerned about epa decision to apply projected heat input growth rates from to the period.appalachian i,at.fueling those concerns was our observation that growth rates were not in line with epa projections.id.petitioners contend that on remand the agency has failed to satisfy its obligation to resolve these concerns.
according to petitioners,the overlap
