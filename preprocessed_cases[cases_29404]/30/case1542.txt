state of michigan,et hereinafter petitioners,petition this court for review of the environmental protection agency epa revisions to the part federal operating permit program rule,codified at pt.petitioners argue that the epa has exceeded its authority under the clean air act caa or the act,et,in proposing to promulgate and administer a federal operating permits program for areas where epa believes the indian country status is in question,and in proposing to make jurisdictional determinations on a basis rather than through notice and comment rulemaking.because we agree with petitioners that epa has exceeded its authority,we grant the petition for review.
background 
a.the clean air act and indian tribes 
the clean air act establishes an intergovernmental partnership to regulate air quality in the united states.described as an experiment in federalism,virginia epa,quoting bethlehem steel gorsuch,cir,the act gives epa responsibility for establishing national ambient air quality standards naaqs.see also whitman american trucking ass ns,d.title v of the clean air act amendments gives states responsibility for implementing these standards.see.
as part of the clean air act amendments,congress also authorized epa to treat indian tribes as states,thus affording indian tribes the same opportunity as states to implement the naaqs within tribal jurisdictions under a title v program.d.title v requires that states submit and obtain epa approval of a state operating permit program sop that meets the minimum elements set forth under d and epa regulations promulgated pursuant to b.among the requirements is that the state demonstrate that it has adequate authority,including jurisdiction,to regulate the emission sources subject to the sop.id.at d.this same requirement applies to indian tribes seeking to enact their own implementation plan.id.at d.
congress recognized the unique legal status and circumstances of indian tribes by allowing tribes to be treated as states,but not requiring them to apply to epa to manage clean air act programs.see id.at d a.tribes may be treated as states if they have a governing body the functions they are to exercise pertain to the management and protection of air resources within the tribe jurisdiction and the tribe is capable of carrying out these functions.see d.no tribe to date has sought to create an implementation plan.in the tribal authority rule tar,epa exercised authority under d,by specifying those portions of the clean air act for which it deemed it appropriate to treat indian tribes as states,and the requirements necessary for tribes to establish jurisdiction to develop title v permitting programs.see indian tribes air quality planning and management,to be codified at pts,and.epa interpretation was upheld by this court in arizona pub.serv.epa,cert.denied,d.under the tar a tribe may only develop a title v permitting program for areas if the tribe can demonstrate jurisdiction under federal indian law.therefore the tar provides a procedure for resolving jurisdictional disputes.see e.
if a state fails to create an implementation plan,or in cases where an approved program is not being properly implemented,congress requires epa to promulgate,administer,and enforce a federal operating permit program.d,i.further,in the absence of an tribal implementation program,epa may adopt a federal implementation program.see d.however,the parties before us disagree as to the source of epa power to enact such a program for indian country.the epa claims its authority under the caa is based in part on the general purpose of the caa,which was only supplemented in the indian tribe context by d.at see also,proposed rule and notice today notice makes it clear that epa implementation of part programs in indian country is based on epa overarching authority to protect air quality within indian country,not solely on its authority to act in the stead of an indian tribe.in contrast,petitioners essentially contend epa is merely authorized to act in the shoes of the a federal implementation program for tribes as it would for a state that failed to develop an approved program.in any event,both sides agree that in the absence of a tribal implementation plan,epa may provide a federal operating plan for lands under the tribe jurisdiction.
federal indian law 
determining tribal jurisdiction is far from straightforward and involves delicate questions involving state and tribal sovereignty.indeed,relations have been a concern since the time of the founding.see the federalist madison what description of indians are to be deemed members of a state,is not yet settled,and has been a question of frequent perplexity and contention in the federal councils.under principles of federal indian law,indian country denotes the geographic scope where primary jurisdiction rests with the federal government and the indian tribe inhabiting it,and not with the states.alaska native village of venetie tribal gov t,d.indian country is defined by statute as all land within the limits of any indian reservation,all dependent indian communities,and all indian allotments.although this definition by its terms relates only to federal criminal jurisdiction,the supreme court has recognized that it also generally applies to questions of civil jurisdiction such as the one at issue here.venetie tribal gov t,at.citing decoteau district county court for tenth judicial,d.thus,unlike typical political boundaries,the jurisdictional boundaries of indian tribes are not always clearly delineated,and often are determined through adjudication or other administrative proceedings.see,id.at.tribal authority rule,pt.
t he test for determining whether land is indian country does not turn upon whether that land is denominated trust land or reservation.rather,we ask whether the area has been validly set apart for the use of the indians as such,under the superintendence of the government.oklahoma tax comm citizen band potawatomi indian tribe of oklahoma,d quoting united states john,d.difficult jurisdictional questions can arise over lands that do not meet the prima facie test for indian country.claims of superintendence can be controversial for lands that tribes claim to be dependent indian communities,where title is not held by the federal government or indians,venetie tribal gov t,at,or lands outside the exterior boundaries of reservations such as lands taken into trust for tribes pursuant to the indian reorganization act,for which no action was taken by treaty,executive order,or act of congress to set the lands aside for the use and benefit of a tribe.
it is against this background that epa adopted its new part rules providing for federal administration of an operating permits program in indian country.
c.the part rule 
in,epa finalized its proposal.march,establishing the part federal operating permits plan throughout indian country unless a tribal or state part program has been explicitly approved for the area.at,codified at b.the major area of contention between petitioners and epa,and thus the issue before this court is epa authority to promulgate part programs for indian country.section b provides 
the administrator will administer and enforce an operating permits program in indian country as defined in,when an operating permits program which meets the requirements of part of this chapter has not been explicitly granted full or interim approval by the administrator for indian country.for purposes of administering the part program,epa will treat areas for which epa believes the indian country status is in question as indian country.
b emphasis added.specifically,this court must evaluate whether epa decision to treat areas for which epa believes the indian country status is in question as indian country has exceeded the agency authority under the clean air act.
in its proposal for part,epa stated that the act authorizes epa to protect air quality on lands over which indian tribes have jurisdiction.at emphasis added.the purpose was to provide a mechanism by which epa could assume responsibility to issue permits in situations where the state,local,or tribal agency has not developed,administered,or enforced an acceptable permits program id.at.thus,under the proposal,epa would issue permits for tribal areas that epa determines to be within a tribe inherent authority.id.at emphasis added.as a prerequisite the proposal would have required tribes to establish their jurisdiction over certain areas of indian country before epa could implement a federal program for those areas.at emphasis added see.at.the rules adopted in part and the agency approach to determining jurisdiction differ sharply from the original proposal.unlike the present rule,a final jurisdictional determination would have been required regardless of whether the tribe sought its own program.moreover,epa proposed to follow the same approach to resolving jurisdictional issues taken in the tribal air rule.at.epa would notify appropriate governmental entities of the boundary of the tribal area for a part program at least days prior to the effective date of the program,and where a dispute arose provide notice in the federal register and seek comments.id.finally,the proposal anticipated that epa would implement a part program that covers all undisputed areas,while withholding action on the portion that addresses areas where a jurisdiction issue has not been satisfactorily resolved.id.emphasis added.in contrast,under the adopted rule,epa assumes jurisdiction if epa believes the status of the area is in question.b.at.
epa contends that under its new part rule it need only conclude there is a bona fide question before it will treat an area indian country status as in question.see.at.epa claimed its authority with respect to in question lands is based on the agency overarching authority to protect air quality within indian country,not solely on its authority to act in the stead of an indian tribe.at.further,rather than determine whether an area status is indian country or at least in question through notice and comment rulemaking,the agency proposes to use adjudications over individual emitting sources to determine an area status.see.at epa would not conduct rulemaking procedures to assess the boundaries of programs in indian country specific boundary questions relating to applicability of the program to particular sources would be addressed through a less formal consultation process and epa would make determinations on whether particular sources are in indian country.id.at.petitioners sought review in this court of the portion of epa part rule authorizing epa to treat as indian country lands for which epa has deemed indian country status to be in question and of epa determination to make jurisdictional inquiries through adjudications rather than notice and comment rulemakings.
ii.analysis 
epa authority 
it is elementary that our federal government is one of limited and enumerated powers.the powers of the legislature are defined and limited and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten,the constitution is written.marbury madison,cranch.marshall.this principle applies with equal force to the modern administrative state.epa is a federal agency a creature of statute.it has no constitutional or common law existence or authority,but only those authorities conferred upon it by congress.it is axiomatic that an administrative agency power to promulgate legislative regulations is limited to the authority delegated by congress.bowen georgetown,d.thus,if there is no statute conferring authority,a federal agency has none.we must reverse epa decision to administer a federal operating permit program in lands whose indian country status is considered to be in question if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the united states,epa,cert.denied,d.if epa lacks authority under the clean air act,then its action is plainly contrary to law and can not stand.see american petroleum inst.epa,api ethyl epa.to determine whether the agency action is contrary to law,we look first to determine whether congress has delegated to the agency the legal authority to take the action that is under dispute.united states mead,d we hold that administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law chevron natural resources defense council,d.mere ambiguity in a statute is not evidence of congressional delegation of authority.see,dep t of,chevron deference comes into play of course,only as a consequence of statutory ambiguity,and then only if the reviewing court finds an implicit delegation of authority to the agency.emphasis added city of kansas city,dep t of housing urban,implicit delegation of interpretive authority,as well as ambiguity,are required before deference is appropriate railway labor executives ass mediation,en banc.however,when congress has explicitly or impliedly left a gap for an agency to fill,there is a delegation of authority to the agency to give meaning to a specific provision of the statute by regulation,and any ensuing regulation is binding in the courts unless procedurally defective,arbitrary and capricious in substance,or manifestly contrary to the statute.mead.at.
agency authority may not be lightly presumed.were courts to presume a delegation of power absent an express withholding of such power,agencies would enjoy virtually limitless hegemony,a result plainly out of keeping with chevron and quite likely with the constitution as well.ethyl at thus,we will not presume a delegation of power based solely on the fact that there is not an express withholding of such power.api,at.
we conclude that the plain meaning of d and grants epa the authority to promulgate,administer and enforce a federal operating permit program for a state or tribe if,and only if,the state or tribe fails to submit an operating program or the operating program is disapproved by epa or epa determines the state or tribe is not adequately administering and enforcing a program.see d,i.since congress has not delegated authority to the agency to act beyond these statutory parameters,we will not defer to epa interpretation of the act as giving it the broader power to indefinitely run a federal operating permit program in the absence of the conditions set out by sections d,i,and d.see mead.at chevron deference not applicable where statutory circumstances indicate no intent to delegate general authority to make rules with force of law chevron,at.
epa treatment of in question lands 
petitioners and epa agree that under the regime congress has created in the clean air act,the states have primary responsibility for ensuring that ambient air meets standards.section of the act,addresses epa approval of state programs.epa must establish minimum elements of a permit program and each state must develop such a program.id.at b and d.section d specifies that i f a program meeting the requirements of this subchapter has not been approved in whole for any state,the administrator shall,years after the date required for submission of such a program promulgate,administer,and enforce a program under this subchapter for that state.d emphasis added.similarly,if epa determines that a state or tribe is not adequately administering and enforcing a program,or portion thereof then unless the state has corrected such deficiency within months after the date of such finding,the administrator shall,years after the date of such finding,promulgate,administer,and enforce a program under this subchapter for that state.i,emphasis added.
section,does not speak of underlying,residual,or even default epa jurisdiction,authority,or power.it only speaks of the epa running an implementation program for a state that fails to develop an approved program.epa has no authority or jurisdiction under section to operate a federal program unless or until the state fails to have a sop approved within a specified time frame.further,if epa does implement a program,the administrator is instructed only to administer and enforce federally issued permits under this subchapter until they are replaced by a permit issued by a permitting program,and epa must suspend the issuance of permits promptly upon publication of notice of approval of a permit program under this section e.thus,once a state program is approved,epa authority to operate a federal program under section d lapses.
nothing in caa section d,d,adds to epa jurisdiction to implement a federal program in place of the states.section d permits the epa to treat indian tribes as states if certain prerequisites are met,including that the functions to be exercised by the indian tribe pertain to the management and protection of air resources within the exterior boundaries of the reservation or other areas within the tribe jurisdiction.d b emphasis added.if the epa determines that treatment of indian tribes as identical to states is inappropriate or administratively infeasible,then the epa will directly administer such provisions so as to achieve the appropriate purpose.d.thus,under section,epa may treat qualifying tribes as states,and if the tribe fails to meet the requirements set out under section,then epa must implement a federal program.alternatively,if the tribe fails to qualify,then epa must likewise implement a federal program.again,there is no suggestion of inherent or underlying epa authority,but rather a role for the epa if the tribe,for whatever reason,does not promulgate a tribal implementation program.
it is significant that neither the epa nor the intervenor,navajo nation,can cite a single reference in the clean air act that suggests that the agency has some overarching jurisdiction to implement federal programs.if anything,the structure and history of the act,to which they appeal,suggest otherwise,for it is an experiment in cooperative federalism,as intervenor notes.certainly the act intended to create an overarching federal role in air pollution control policy,as intervenor argues,but that overarching role is in setting standards,not in implementation.epa role for implementation is limited to the conditions set out in d.
the intervenor brief is telling.to support its contention of default federal jurisdiction it cites vague statements that the act is national in scope,that it is to protect and enhance the quality of the nation air resources or that epa has the authority to issue regulations necessary to implement the act.but none of these implies that epa has some default authority to operate an implementation plan except as specified in sections d and of the clean air act,d.in its brief,epa claims that it always has nationwide enforcement authority under the act because congress charged epa not only with generally administering the act,but also with nationally overseeing and enforcing its requirements.similarly,in adopting the new part rules,epa claimed its authority under the caa is based in part on the general purpose of the caa.at.however,epa can not rely on its general authority to make rules necessary to carry out its functions when a specific statutory directive defines the relevant functions of epa in a particular area.api,at.rather,we have before had occasion to remind epa that its mission is not a roving commission to achieve pure air or any other laudable goal.see,api,at ethyl,at.commendable though these goals may be,they are not within epa portfolio unless the states and tribes fail to implement a program,and the conditions in d and are therefore met.
having determined that epa only authority to administer a federal operating permit program is found in d and,we must next determine whether epa is acting within that authority in the challenged procedure.the answer is plainly no.epa asserts that where a state has applied to operate a sop under,epa need not actually determine whether the state has jurisdiction.rather,epa claims it may administer a federal operating permit program for sources in indian country,including areas where epa believes a bona fide question of indian country status exists.much of epa brief is dedicated to arguing that it has authority to administer a federal operating permit program in indian country.however,these words are wasted as petitioners do not claim otherwise.at issue in this case is epa authority to administer a federal program where the indian country status is merely in question.the petitioner states do not contend,as epa and intervenor suggest,that the states should have jurisdiction over indian country lands.petitioners happily concede that tribes,and thus,potentially the for the jurisdiction over indian country.similarly,petitioners not only concede that epa may undertake initial jurisdictional,subject to judicial review,they insist,correctly,that epa must make jurisdictional determinations.that is,epa can not acquire jurisdiction for itself merely by determining that an area status is in question.were we to hold otherwise,epa would effectively have a blank check to expand its own jurisdiction by not deciding jurisdictional questions.the clean air act does not confer such authority.
epa argues that it is the state burden under d to make a showing of adequate authority and thus state jurisdiction to carry out a sop,and that unless a state can demonstrate authority to regulate an area,then epa must provide for effective implementation of title v programs.epa contends it need not determine whether the disputed area is within the jurisdiction of a state or a tribe,and that by operating a federal program over in question areas it avoids jurisdictional disputes.see.at.because congress has given epa discretion to determine how to preserve tribes options to seek to run a title v program for sources within indian country,epa argues that this court should defer to its decision under chevron step two,as a rule reasonably filling the gap left by congress.
what epa fails to appreciate is that its actions create a jurisdictional dispute.if a state has an approved implementation plan,then epa only grounds for jurisdiction under the act is the fact that an area is indian country,not that its status is in question.if the state does not have an approved plan,then epa is acting for the state.there are no intermediate grounds on which epa may indefinitely exercise is either acting in the shoes of a tribe or the shoes of the state.there is no residual authority granted by the caa for the epa to refuse to make a jurisdictional determination and operate a federal program under some general authority of its own.epa comes close to arguing that because congress has not expressly forbidden this assertion of federal jurisdiction,the agency may assert it.however,as we reminded the epa in ethyl and american petroleum institute,to suggest that chevron step two is implicated any time a statute does not expressly negate the existence of a claimed administrative power,is both flatly unfaithful to the principles of administrative law and refuted by precedent.at,at.
epa and intervenor navajo nation also argue that epa obligation to protect indian interests in land,including jurisdiction and other facets of,and the strong federal interest in preserving the sovereign rights of tribal governments to regulate activities and enforce laws on indian lands,support the part rule allowing epa to operate a federal program for lands in question.see exec.order,a,agencies shall respect indian tribal and sovereignty,honor tribal treaty and other rights,and strive to meet the responsibilities that arise from the unique legal relationship between the federal government and indian tribal governments.intervenor argues that to allow states to implement title v programs where the indian country status is in question would infringe on rights that belong to the tribes under both the caa and general principles of federal indian law.epa similarly asserts that by operating a federal program for in question areas,it protect s tribal sovereignty interests.epa essentially argues that its interpretation of the caa is correct because it favors indian interests.yet,the bedrock canon of statutory interpretation in american indian jurisprudence that statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the indians,with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit is simply not implicated here.cobell norton,quoting montana blackfeet tribe of ind
