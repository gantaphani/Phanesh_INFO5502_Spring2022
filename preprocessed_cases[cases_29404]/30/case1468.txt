the pokagon band of potawatomi indians pokagon band or tribe consists of approximately members.the tribe has resided primarily in its ancestral homeland in the joseph river valley in southwestern michigan and northern indiana since at least.see,at.after years of dealing with the united states in relations,the tribe was administratively terminated in,when its application for recognition was denied under the indian reorganization act of ira,stat.codified as amended at et.thereafter,the tribe made numerous attempts to reclaim its recognition,and finally achieved that goal in,with the enactment of the pokagon restoration act restoration act or act,et.the act restored federal services to the pokagon band,but it provided no funding,so the tribe has been forced to seek ways to achieve economic.
the tribe has determined that the most effective way to generate revenue is to build and operate a gaming resort.to that end,the tribe signed a gaming compact with the state of michigan in and then purchased rights to the land necessary for the project.upon application to the department of interior bureau of indian affairs bia or bureau,the secretary of the interior secretary agreed to take those lands into trust under,which permits the secretary to take land into trust for the purpose of becoming part of the tribe reservation.
the bureau decision to take this land into trust is now challenged by the taxpayers of michigan against casinos tomac,a group that includes residents who live adjacent to the proposed casino site.in three decisions,the district court issued judgments for the department of the interior interior on each of tomac claims.the district court held,inter alia,that bia reasonably concluded that it only had to prepare an environmental assessment ea and not an environmental impact statement eis under the national environmental policy act of nepa,tomac norton,no,wl,at,tomac iii the pokagon band fell within the restored lands exception of the indian gaming regulatory act igra,because it was restored to federal recognition under the restoration act,tomac norton,d,tomac i and congress delegation to the secretary to acquire real property in trust for the benefit of the band under the restoration act,was not an unlawful delegation of legislative power,tomac i,d at.
tomac now appeals from the district court successive grants of summary judgment to interior,challenging each of the aforementioned findings.we conclude that tomac claims have no merit and affirm the district court grants of summary judgment.
background 
a.the pokagon band of potawatomi indians 
the pokagon band has a long history of dealings with the united states government,including involvement in treaties with the federal government from.see.one such treaty,the treaty of chicago,stat,involved the ceding of acres by several tribes to the federal government in in exchange for a series of payments and a tract of equal size west of the mississippi river.hannahville indian cmty.united states.while this agreement pushed many of the potawatomi bands west,the pokagon band held steadfast and negotiated a supplement to the treaty,which gave them the right to remain in their michigan homeland.see id.at,at,at.
in,the pokagon band petitioned for reorganization under the newly minted ira,which terminated the federal government allotment policy and restored to indians the management of their assets.while tribal governments located in michigan upper peninsula were granted federal services under the ira,those in its lower peninsula,such as the pokagon band,were denied services and benefits due to an administrative decision predicated on the misguided assumption that residence on trust lands held in common for the band was required for reorganization and the fact that appropriations to purchase such lands had run out,at see also no,at.according to the senate committee report leading to the passage of the restoration act authored nearly years later,the pokagon band was unfairly terminated as a result of both faulty and inconsistent administrative decisions contrary to the intent of the congress,federal indian law and the trust responsibility of the united states,at.
to remedy this injustice,congress enacted the restoration act in.the act specific purpose is to reaffirm and clarify the federal relationship of the pokagon band of potawatomi indians of michigan as a distinct federally recognized indian tribe,to reaffirm the jurisdiction and other rights of the tribe,provide for the establishment of a trust land base for the tribe,and authorize the organization of the tribe and for other purposes.id.at.the tribe status as a federally recognized tribe was reestablished,thus bringing the tribe within the umbrella of federal services and benefits extended to other federally recognized tribes.in recognition of its ancestral homelands and the need for the tribe to establish a reservation land base,congress directed the secretary to acquire real property for the tribe,by taking land in trust to become part of its reservation.congress also delineated a the tribe current and ancestral it is eligible to receive the federal services that accompany recognition.see.
the restoration act,however,did not provide any funding,so the tribe had to consider economic development projects that would enable it both to restore its land base and to fund tribal governmental activities and services.the tribe concluded that the only economic development that would attract sufficient capital would be a gaming and recreational facility.consequently,in the tribe entered into a compact with the state of michigan in accordance with d to permit the tribe to conduct class iii gaming on eligible indian lands.see compact between the pokagon band of potawatomi indians and the state of michigan providing for the conduct of tribal class iii gaming by the pokagon band of potawatomi indians at,reprinted in pokagon band of potawatomi indians township of new buffalo trust consolidation site trust application,app.trust app,joint appendix.interior approved this agreement on february.indian gaming.
the tribe also entered into a memorandum of understanding memorandum with the secretary,which spelled out the amount of land to be taken into trust under the restoration act,the area in which that land was to be located,and the preference that,whenever possible,the land acquired would be contiguous.memorandum of understanding,reprinted in trust,supra,tab.in addition,the secretary confirmed that the pokagon band is a restored tribe within the meaning of b b of igra,making it eligible for class iii gaming without having to undertake the more burdensome route to approval under b a.see b a,b.
the tribe subsequently purchased in fee separate and contiguous parcels of land across acres within new buffalo township in berrien county,michigan,and then submitted an application to bia requesting that the united states take the land into trust for the tribe.a portion of that land would house the gaming facility,five or six restaurants,a variety of gift shops,a child care facility,a first class hotel,and a surface parking lot and parking garage.
before proceeding with the project,the bureau was required under nepa to assess the potential environmental impacts of the gaming resort.nepa obligates an agency to prepare a detailed,comprehensive eis if its proposal constitutes a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.to determine what actions meet the c threshold,the bureau has adopted as advisory guidelines the regulations of the council of environmental quality ceq,which was established by nepa to interpret the statute.see dot pub.citizen,d nepa handbook,bureau of indian affairs manual supplement,b.those regulations permit agencies to issue first an ea,which is a less detailed document which may be used to determine whether or not an eis is required.id.if,based on the ea,the agency finds that an eis is not necessary,the bureau may issue a finding of no significant impact fonsi,which fulfills the documentation requirements established by the ceq regulations.see e.
after working closely with the tribe,an environmental consultant,and other federal agencies including the united states fish and wildlife service and the environmental protection agency epa for several months,bia issued a draft ea of the casino project on november,and made it available for a comment period.in response to the comments received,bia prepared a revised and modified assessment in january.the ea analyzed a range of potential impacts of the proposed trust acquisition on geology and soils,prime and unique farmland,groundwater,floodplains,wetlands,wildlife habitat,vegetation,threatened and endangered species,air quality,noise,and cultural resources.see ea at.it also addressed potential impacts on socioeconomics and other issues related to growth induced by the proposed facility.id.at.
on january,bia issued a fonsi for the trust acquisition.the bureau explained that implementation of the proposed actions with corresponding mitigation measures,will have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment within the meaning of nepa.proposed pokagon band of potawatomi indians of michigan gaming facility,fonsi,bia.thus,an eis was not warranted.bia subsequently issued a notice of intent to take land into trust on january.
procedural history 
on february,tomac filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of columbia seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against interior on three grounds that are relevant to this appeal.tomac first alleged that the secretary trust acquisition decision violated nepa,because the gaming and recreation complex will significantly impact the area surrounding the site.second,tomac asserted that the secretary violated igra,because the restoration act did not restore the tribe within the meaning of igra such that the tribe qualified for the restored land exception to igra gaming ban on lands acquired after october.finally,tomac contended that congress unconstitutionally delegated to the secretary unlimited authority to acquire land for the tribe under the restoration act.
in response to tomac claims,bia challenged tomac article iii and prudential standing to bring its nepa and igra claims,and also moved to dismiss tomac igra and constitutional claims for failure to a state claim.in the alternative,bia moved for summary judgment.the city and township of new buffalo and the tribe moved and were permitted to intervene in the proceedings on behalf of the government.thereafter,the united states and tomac entered into a stipulation whereby the united states agreed not to take the land into trust during the pendency of the district court litigation which has been renewed for the purposes of this appeal.
on march,the district court rejected bia standing contentions,tomac i,d at,but granted summary judgment against tomac on its igra and nondelegation claims,id.at.in a separate decision,the district court considered tomac nepa challenges concerning wetlands,threatened species,endangered species,and impacts from growth and development.tomac norton,d,tomac ii.regarding the first three issues,the district court concluded that bia sought out and properly considered the available data,thereby fulfilling its responsibility under nepa.id.at.the district court did not find that bia engaged in the same level of analysis,however,with respect to the indirect effects related to growth induced by the gaming and recreation complex.the trial court noted that while this case was a much closer call than cases in which agencies simply failed to address growth inducing effects at all,bia failed both to address related effects on air and water and other natural systems,including ecosystems,and to explain clearly its conclusion that an increase of new jobs,new employees and their families,and related changes in physical development and natural resource use will not have a significant effect on a community of.id.at quotation marks and citation omitted.based on these flaws,the district court temporarily enjoined bia from taking the land into trust,and remanded the ea to the agency for such further evaluation and elaboration of its reasoning as bia desires to submit concerning secondary growth issues.id.at.
supplement to the ea 
on remand,bia prepared a supplement to its ea ea supplement to update and expand its earlier analysis and to focus on the district court secondary impact concerns.see ea supplement.in addition to identifying the specific geographic areas potentially impacted by the gaming resort,interior predicted the pattern and extent of residential and commercial growth by analyzing,among other things,zoning laws,permitting requirements,economic forecasts,demographics,available utilities,environmental regulations,and land use practices.these development predictions were used to analyze potential impacts on natural and cultural resources including the water supply,sewer system,air quality,transportation and traffic,and public safety.the bureau also evaluated potential cumulative impacts of the gaming resort in combination with other past,present,and potential future operations in the area,and provided detailed mitigation measures to address any potential significant impacts.
the bureau concluded that the only potentially significant impact from induced growth was an increased demand for water and sewage services which might tax the existing capacities of those systems.in both cases,the bureau found that the tribe agreement to cover significant portions of the costs to build a new water plant and distribution system,as well as to install oversized sewer lines,sufficiently mitigated any potential harm.
particularly germane to this appeal is bia analysis of the gaming resort direct and indirect impacts on local air quality.in tomac ii,the district court found the ea analysis of the project impact on air quality to be lacking,primarily because bia traffic study was insufficient.tomac ii,d at noting that the ea failed to estimate the impact of the traffic growth generated by the growth in residency expected as a result of the project.in preparing its ea supplement,the bureau commissioned soil and materials engineers,sme to prepare a revised air quality study.in the revised assessment,bia directed sme to broaden its focus to capture the impact on air quality of the indirect development activity as a result of the gaming resort.sme thus examined four potential air quality impacts vehicle emissions resulting from increased traffic associated with indirect development throughout the region,stationary source emissions from establishments that are anticipated to be built in the region,construction related emissions,and ambient air quality contaminants from facilities and activities in the vicinity of the project site.report of air quality impact assessment,soil materials engineers,at i july,reprinted in ea supplement,supra,at app.bb,sme supplementary report.
sme employed the same methodology in the revised analysis as it did in its original examination,using carbon monoxide as a predictive tool for meeting the national ambient air quality standards naaqs under the clean air act caa.since carbon monoxide is more likely than the other relevant contaminants,particulate matter,nitrogen oxide,and hydrocarbons to impact air quality,a finding of de minimis carbon monoxide impact would indicate that the other criteria air pollutants would likely be in compliance.based on sme updated study,bia confirmed that c arbon monoxide and other naaqs criteria air pollutants expected to be produce d by the indirect effects from the project indicates that those air pollutants will be in compliance with naaqs standards.ea supplement,supra,at.in addition,sme concluded that since ozone,hydrocarbons,and nitrogen oxide are regional in nature,meaningful evaluation of their effects on a basis is not practical.sme supplementary report,supra,at.
in both its ea and ea supplement,the bureau continued to evaluate air quality impact based in part on epa more lenient ozone standard.under that standard,berrien county was considered an area of attainment,in compliance with the caa.while epa had promulgated a more rigorous standard in that put berrien county attainment status in jeopardy,see national ambient air quality standards for ozone.july,codified at,litigation left its implementation in doubt at the time the ea was produced.see am.trucking ass ns epa,am.trucking i am.trucking ass ns epa,reh g granted in part and denied in part,rev in part sub nom.whitman am.trucking ass ns,d am.trucking ii.in addition,while epa standard was upheld in,am.trucking i,at,berrien county was not designated nonattainment until june.see air quality designations and classifications for the ozone national ambient air quality standards,to be codified at pt.standards,which was almost a year after sme second study was completed.
the bureau suggested,however,that in the event that berrien county became designated an area of nonattainment prior to project construction,a general conformity analysis would be required.ea,supra,at.a conformity analysis,which is required by the caa for federal actions within nonattainment and maintenance areas,must demonstrate how the actions conform to the existing state implementation plan to remedy the air pollution problem.see c.
on november,based upon the analysis in the ea and the ea supplement,bia issued a revised fonsi,in which it renewed its position that implementation of the proposed action would have no significant impact on the human environment and that an eis was not required.following this issuance,interior filed a renewed motion for summary judgment and relief from the temporary injunction imposed by the district court.on march,the district court issued an order finding that interior had fully complied with nepa,and granted its summary judgment motion and lifted the temporary injunction.tomac iii,wl,at.in granting summary judgment for interior,the district court rejected tomac claims that bia had failed to provide an adequate opportunity for public comment,id.at,and held that bia adequately addressed the impact of the project on air quality and local water and sewer systems,as well as the cumulative impacts of the gaming resort.id.at.
tomac now appeals the district court successive grants of summary judgment to interior.in turn,interior and intervenors renew their claims that tomac lacks standing.
ii.analysis 
we note at the outset that we agree with the district court finding that tomac has article iii and prudential standing to challenge bia actions under both nepa and igra.see credit union admin.first bank trust,d prudential standing.audubon soc y bentsen,en banc nepa humane soc y of the hodel,germaneness.there is no serious question about tomac standing that warrants further discussion by this court.
our review of the district court grants of summary judgment is de novo.george leavitt.
environmental assessments 
the court role in reviewing an agency decision not to issue an eis is a limited one,designed primarily to ensure that no arguably significant consequences have been ignored.pub.citizen highway traffic safety.the evaluation of the impact of those consequences on the quality of the human environment,is left to the judgment of the agency.id.quoting sierra club dot.this court will overturn an agency decision to issue a therefore not to prepare an if the decision was arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.sierra club peterson.when examining a fonsi,our job is to determine whether the agency has accurately identified the relevant environmental concern,has taken a hard look at the problem in preparing its ea,is able to make a convincing case for its finding of no significant impact,and has shown that even if there is an impact of true significance,an eis is unnecessary because changes or safeguards in the project sufficiently reduce the impact to a minimum.town of cave creek faa,quoting sierra club dot,at.
public comment 
before attacking the substance of the ea,tomac argues that bia decision not to afford an additional round of public comment following the district court remand precludes this court from finding the bureau ultimate action reasonable.tomac asserts that ceq regulations encourage public involvement when preparing an ea,and points to bia own nepa handbook which states that the public should have meaningful opportunities for participation in bia actions that significantly affect them.
as an initial matter,we note that the binding effect of ceq regulations is far from clear.see city of alexandria slater,stating that ceq has no express regulatory authority under nepa,as it was only empowered to issue binding regulations by presidential executive order.but see andrus sierra club,d noting that the ceq nepa interpretations are entitled to substantial deference.even so,nothing in the ceq regulations suggests that another comment round is necessary following an agency issuance of a supplemental ea.and two of our sister circuits have found that public input during the ea process is not required.see alliance to protect nantucket sound,dep t of the army,cir greater yellowstone coal.flowers,cir.in rejecting a party call for an eis,the tenth circuit noted that nepa public involvement requirements are not as well defined when an agency prepares only an ea and not an eis.greater yellowstone,at.the tenth circuit found significant the comparison between and,which require agencies preparing an eis to make an initial draft available for public comment,and b,which only obligates agencies to involve the public,to the extent practicable,in preparing eas,and e,which requires agencies to make a fonsi available for public review prior to their final decision only in specific circumstances that are not applicable here.id.at a minimum,this suggests that the agency has significant discretion in determining when public comment is required with respect to eas.
the record here indicates that bia sought comment on the original draft ea and provided detailed responses to comments it received.the ea supplement merely amplified the issues that had been addressed in bia original ea,so the agency reasonably concluded that further public comment was unnecessary.on this record,we find no merit in tomac claim that another round of public comment was required.bia acted appropriately given the prior public involvement,and no statute or regulation requires anything more.
size of the project and report 
in contending that an eis is in order,tomac first argues that the sheer magnitude of the proposed gaming resort,as well as the length and complexity of the resulting ea,indicates that an eis is necessary.in terms of the project size,tomac avers that the anticipated arrival of million visitors a year to a rural community of less than residents suggests that bia should produce an eis.similarly,tomac claims that because bia spent years and generated almost pages of data and analysis examining the potential environmental impacts of the proposed gaming resort,it is clear that an eis is needed.these claims miss their mark.
tomac offers no support for the proposition that an eis is required when a project reaches a certain size.the relevant benchmark is whether the federal action significantly affect s the quality of the human environment.c.large federal projects may,on the average,be more likely to meet this threshold.but there is no categorical rule that sizable federal undertakings always have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.
similarly,the significant time and effort bia has spent preparing its ea does not alone prove that an eis is obligatory.tomac relies on the ceq guidelines,which advise that an ea should be no more than pages in length.br.of at citing forty most asked questions concerning ceq national environmental policy act regulations.this guideline is not a binding regulation,however.see davis mineta,cir.the simple point here is that the length of an ea has no bearing on the necessity of an eis.see sierra club marsh,cir ea length,complexity,and controversy do not by themselves show that the eas conclusion no significant impact is correct,nor do they show it is incorrect.what ultimately determines whether an eis rather than an ea is required is the scope of the project itself,not the length of the agency report.heartwood,forest,cir.the opposite regime would create perverse incentives for agencies,as it would
