the arkansas game and fish commission the commission filed a physical takings claim against the united states in the court of federal claims claims court,alleging that the united states had taken its property without just compensation.the commission claimed that temporary deviations by the army corps of engineers the corps from an operating plan for dam during the years to caused increased flooding in the commission dave donaldson black river wildlife management area management area.this flooding,in turn,caused excessive timber mortality in the management area.the claims court concluded that the united states had taken a temporary flowage easement over the commission property and awarded a total of in damages.game fish comm united states.because we conclude that the corps deviations did not constitute a taking,we reverse.
background 
the commission owns the management area,which is located in northeast arkansas and consists of acres on both banks of the black river.the commission operates the management area as a wildlife and hunting preserve and harvests timber,thereafter reforesting the harvested areas.the corps completed construction of the clearwater dam in.the dam is located in southeast missouri approximately miles upstream of the commission management area.the reservoir created by the dam is called clearwater lake.the primary purpose of the dam was to provide flood protection.
whenever the corps constructs a dam,it adopts a water control plan reflected in a water control manual.these water control plans detail release rates,safety features,and other operating instructions.they are required by corps regulation.army corps of engineers,eng r reg,at,hereinafter em.the plans are developed by regional district commanders in concert with all basin interests which are or could be impacted by or have an influence on project regulation and then submitted to the corps for approval.id.at.
this case concerns release rates from the dam established by the plan for clearwater dam and deviations from the planned rates.the purpose of regulating release rates is to control the flow of the black river in order to reduce the adverse effects of flooding in downstream areas.the dam can not be operated in a manner that completely eliminates flooding because water must be released from the dam,and the released water will,to some extent,cause flooding.if the release rates are lower,the height of the flooding is decreased but the period of flooding is increased.if the release rates are higher,the height of the flooding is increased but the period of flooding is decreased.apparently,agricultural interests favored a lower release rate even though this would lead to longer periods of flooding,while the commission and those located near clearwater lake preferred a higher release rate to return the lake to its normal level more quickly.as will be seen,the claim here is that the commission property was damaged by the temporary adoption of a lower release rate during the growing season,prolonging the release period and damaging trees.
in order to understand the parties respective positions,it is necessary to describe the background of the plan and the deviations from that plan that are challenged here.the plan for clearwater dam was developed over a period of several years and was finally adopted as part of the clearwater lake water control manual in.after the corps completed construction of clearwater dam in,it experimented with release levels for five years.releases were measured by the maximum height of the water at the poplar bluff gauge in the black river,which is downstream of the dam but upstream of the management area.the first maximum levels at poplar bluff during this early period were feet during agricultural season and feet during season.the corps concluded that operating experience showed these high releases negatively affected too many downstream areas.therefore,in,the corps reduced the maximum release levels to feet during growing season and feet during season.after three years during which no consistent problems were encountered,the corps approved the first clearwater lake water control manual in.under the manual normal regulation,releases were regulated so that the water height at poplar bluff did not exceed feet during growing season and feet during season.the maximum release levels at poplar bluff allowed for the quick release of water during the growing season,so flooding occurred in waves rather than over extended periods.the manual normal regulation somewhat mimicked the natural flooding patterns in the region.during the period,the manual normal regulation releases were the same as under the original plan.
the clearwater lake manual allowed for deviations from the normal regulation releases for emergencies,unplanned minor deviations,such as for construction or maintenance,and planned deviations requested for agricultural,recreational,and other purposes.the deviations in question here fell into the latter category.according to the manual,the corps was occasionally requested to deviate from normal regulation.id.at.planned deviations had to be approved by the corps southwestern division,which was required to consider flood potential,lake and watershed conditions,possible alternative measures,benefits to be expected,and probable effects on other authorized and useful purposes.id.as described in the manual,these requests were for specific activities that required deviations only for limited periods of time,such as the harvesting of crops,canoe races,and fish spawning.therefore,the approved deviations were by their nature temporary.
the temporary deviations here began in,forty years after the adoption of the water control manual in,the corps approved a planned deviation from the water control manual approved releases for a three month period from september to december,lowering the maximum release level to six feet at the request of agricultural interests that desired slower releases to allow farmers more time to harvest their crops.no permanent change was made to the water control manual at that time.but in the same year,the corps fostered creation of the white river ad hoc work group white river group to recommend minor changes to the approved regulating plan s for dams across the white river basin,which included clearwater dam.id.at.in other words,the white river group was to propose permanent changes to approved plans,including the clearwater lake water control manual.
the corps regulations provided that water control plans will be revised as necessary to conform with changing requirements resulting from new developments.er at.the regulations also required that plans will be subject to continuing and progressive study by personnel in field offices of the corps.id.substantive revisions require d public involvement and public meetings,and the corps was required to provide a report to the public at least days before the meeting explain ing the recommended change explaining the basis for the recommendation and providing a description of its impacts.id.at.moreover,in making revisions,the corps was also required to comply with existing federal regulations,such as the national environmental policy act nepa.id.at,a.
the white river group included private recreational,agricultural,navigational,and hydropower interests,as well as state and federal agencies such as the commission.the commission objected to deviations from the approved water releases in the plan that would lower the release rates because such deviations would prolong the release period.the lower maximum release rates meant that water would evacuate from clearwater dam more slowly,causing consistent downstream flooding in the management area during the tree growing season.the tree growing season lasts,on average,from april to october each year,and the critical months are june,july,and august.higher maximum release rates,on the other hand,would result in waves of flooding that would quickly recede.the commission specifically complained that the lake was feet deep on april,and that,at the lower maximum rates,it took sixty days of constant releases for the lake to reach its targeted summertime level,flooding the management area for most of that period.
in,the white river group,unable to recommend permanent revisions to the release plan,proposed a year interim operating plan that called for temporary deviations during an eight month period.the corps approved the proposed interim operating plan as a deviation from april through april,allowing deviations from the normal release rates from april through november.id.at.the plan set the maximum target level at,instead of feet,for the first two weeks in april and then set the maximum level at feet for the next month and feet from through november.in february,when the white river group again proved unable to propose a final plan,the corps approved an extension of the interim operating plan to continue as a deviation for another months through april,allowing deviations from april to november.id.at.the corps noted that it would monitor the effectiveness of the interim operating plan during that period.id.
in february,the white river group formed a subcommittee of solely black river interests the black river group,including the commission,to recommend a plan for clearwater dam.the black river group also could not reach consensus on a proposed permanent deviation plan for clearwater dam.instead,the corps approved a new interim operating plan proposed by the black river group for clearwater dam for another months through april,with deviations occurring april through november.the corps said it would continue to monitor the effectiveness of both the white river and black river interim operating plans.id.at.the new black river group interim plan differed from the prior interim plan recommended by the white river group.it set the release rate at feet in june and at feet from july through november.this interim plan lapsed in april,and no new interim plan was immediately adopted,leaving the manual release rates in place.the corps did,however,approve a temporary planned deviation in accordance with the manual from june,to july,to prevent possible flooding and another temporary planned deviation from june,to november,in response to a request from agricultural interests.
the white river group disbanded in when it recommended a final plan for the rest of the white river basin,but the black river group continued to work on a plan for clearwater dam.the black river group finally recommended a proposed plan on september,and that plan was approved as a temporary deviation for months from december,to december,with deviations occurring during the entire month period.this proposed plan also differed from the interim plans approved in prior years,setting the maximum level at feet from through november but increasing the maximum level if the lake behind clearwater dam filled to a certain volume.
in,the corps began the process of adopting a revised permanent release plan for clearwater dam.in keeping with federal regulations,the corps prepared an environmental assessment ea.an ea is a brief report,without detailed descriptions or data,indicating possible environmental consequences that can help determine whether a more extensive environmental impact statement eis is necessary pursuant to nepa.an eis is necessary where there is a possibility of significant environmental impacts.in comments made on the draft ea,the commission objected to the proposed changes to the water control manual.the corps agreed that the proposed revision would require an eis under nepa.
meanwhile,the corps approved the continuation of the deviations for months through december,as a temporary water control plan.in may and march,the corps and commission together conducted tests to determine the environmental impact on the management area when certain levels of water were released from clearwater dam.in doing so,the corps confirmed that tree roots would be flooded under the proposed plan,which could potentially damage or destroy the trees.therefore,the corps declined to further pursue a permanent revision to the water control manual and returned to the releases set out in the original manual.
in sum,after approving a planned deviation in,the corps approved three different interim deviation plans with different release rates during the period from.during some portions of that period no interim plan was in place.when temporary plans were in place,for all but two years and,the release rates deviated from the plan during only part of the year,usually april through november.during this entire period,efforts were made to propose a permanent amendment to the plan,but no permanent revision to the plan was ever adopted.the effort was finally abandoned in,and the plan continued to govern.the chart below summarizes the details of these temporary deviation plans 
in,the commission brought suit against the united states under the tucker act,claiming that the temporary release rate deviations during the period constituted a taking of a flowage easement entitling the commission to compensation.the commission alleged that the deviations caused repeated increased flooding and damaged and destroyed timber in the management area.the united states denied that a taking had occurred.the united states argued that any increased flooding was only temporary and constituted,if anything,a tort rather than a taking.the united states also argued that the damage was not substantial enough to constitute a taking and that the effects in any event were not predictable,again defeating a takings claim.
a hearing was held before the claims court from december,to december,in which eighteen witnesses testified.in addition to addressing the nature of the deviations from the plan described above,the hearing addressed two other issues the substantiality of the flooding and the predictability of the alleged damage.
with respect to the substantiality of the flooding,the commission testimony showed that the management area flooded regularly during the period,including during the tree growing season.the presence of standing water or saturated soil during tree growing season can weaken the roots of the multiple species of oak trees located in the management area,which can also render the oaks more susceptible to drought conditions.
the flooding was not consistent from year to year.the parties experts disagreed as to the amount of increased flooding.two experts for the commission,heitmeyer and overton,testified about the extent of the increased flooding.both used the height of the corning water gauge along the black river downstream of the poplar bluff gauge as a proxy for when flooding occurred,observing that flooding occurred when the corning gauge reading was over feet.heitmeyer reported that the gauge exceeded feet the level at which flooding occurred during the tree growing season about more days per year from than from.overton compared the gauge readings from to the readings from.he explained that the corning gauge reached a level where substantial flooding occurred between and feet an average of more days per year during the tree growing season from than from.overton data also indicated that flooding occurred in the management area an average of more days per year from during the critical tree growing period of june to august.
during and,the region suffered a moderate drought.therefore,according to both the united states and the commission,the deviations during and did not have much practical effect because the water flow was low and did not cause flooding.however,the commission witnesses testified that drought conditions increased tree mortality in the management area.trees weakened by six years of additional flooding during the tree growing season could not survive the drought.
the final question addressed at the hearing was the predictability of the results following the government actions.the claims court found that the corps was unaware in that deviations would cause additional flooding in the management area.indeed,one corps official testified that the corps believed the downstream effect of the deviations would diminish before the water reached arkansas.however,the commission sent repeated letters to the corps claiming that the ongoing deviations were causing additional flooding in the management area and also raised its concerns in the white river group and black river group meetings.still,in its draft ea,the corps would have found no significant impact based on the proposed revisions to the plan.the corps only changed its mind about the effects of the deviations after conducting the may and march test releases with the commission which confirmed the possible adverse impacts on the management area and led the corps to return to the release rates in the original plan.
the parties also disputed the issue of causation and the amount of damage caused by the flooding.the commission expert testified that half of the damaged trees would die within five years and the living damaged trees were worth half of their original value.the united states argued that this testimony was inadmissible because cruise maps on which the testimony was based had been destroyed and that the expert evidence in any event used unreliable guesses and was inadmissible under the federal rules of evidence and daubert merrell dow,d.the commission also sought regeneration costs to restore areas suffering from invasions of new wetland vegetation to their condition.the united states contended that the commission failed to prove the united states actions resulted in the devaluation from invasive growth and,even if it did,the damages were only consequential.
the claims court concluded that the deviations from the water control manual were interim deviations that were approved at various times from to.at.the court also found that 
certainly no permanent flowage easement in the management area was taken by the flooding attributable to the corps deviations from the operating plan for clearwater dam a temporary flowage easement is a necessary foundation for the commission takings claim,as has always been evident from the commission pleadings and proofs.
id.at emphasis in original see also id.at finding appropriation was temporary rather than permanent.the court concluded that a takings claim could be based on such a temporary activity.id.at.
the claims court relied on the observations by heitmeyer and overton and determined that the deviations caused a substantial enough increase in flooding to constitute the taking of a flowage easement.it also held that the flooding was the predictable result of government action because with any reasonable investigation of the effects of the deviations it would have been able to predict that the deviations would cause flooding and damage timber in the management area.at.the claims court also concluded that the increased tree growing season flooding caused increased timber mortality in the management area,and therefore awarded damages based on the loss of timber and regeneration costs for some areas that had been inundated by new wetland vegetation.the claims court awarded million in damages for dead or declining timber,relying on the commission expert testimony about the value of the trees it also awarded in damages for regeneration costs,but it granted damages only for areas classified as having suffered severe rather than heavy or moderate effects.
the united states appealed,contending that no taking had occurred,and that if it had,the damages were overstated.the commission,contending that the claims court should have awarded additional damages for regeneration.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
determining whether a taking has occurred is a question of law based on factual underpinnings,and as such,we review the claims court legal analysis and conclusion de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see ridge line,united states.
in general,if particular government action would constitute a taking when permanently continued,temporary action of the same nature may lead to a temporary takings claim.see first english evangelical lutheran church of glendale cnty.of los angeles,d.however,cases involving flooding and easements are different.both supreme court precedent and our own precedent dictate that we must distinguish between a tort and a taking.an injury that is only in its nature indirect and consequential,a tort,can not be a taking.sanguinetti united states.the supreme court has long recognized that to be considered a taking overflows must constitute an actual,permanent invasion of the land,amounting to an appropriation of and not merely an injury to the property.id.at emphases added.the court has stated that an invasion is permanent when there is a permanent condition of continual overflow or a permanent liability to intermittent but inevitably recurring overflows.united states cress.see also united states kansas city life ins.quoting cress and finding a taking where the plaintiff land was permanently invaded by the percolation of waters.
in cress,the court found a taking where the erection of a lock and dam on the cumberland river subject ed the plaintiffs land to frequent overflows of water.cress,at.the court explained that these intermittent overflows showed that this was not a case of temporary flooding or consequential injury,where takings liability would be denied,but instead a permanent condition,resulting from the erection of the lock and dam.id.at emphasis added.it further stated that there was no difference of kind between a permanent condition of continual overflow which had previously been found to constitute a taking and a permanent liability to intermittent but inevitably recurring overflows.id.at emphasis added.
in united states dickinson,the court also found a taking based on a permanent condition.in dickinson,the united states constructed a dam,and the water above the dam was impounded to create a deeper channel,thereby permanently raising the river level,permanently flood ing some of the adjacent land,and subjecting more of it to intermittent overflows.id.at.even though dickinson later reclaimed most of his land which the government originally took by flooding,the court found that the reclamation did not change the fact that the land was taken in the first place and an obligation to pay for it then arose.id.at.the nature of the government action remained permanent,even though the reclamation had mitigated some of the effects.again,the court distinguished between invasions that were permanent or temporary in character.summarizing these cases,in loretto teleprompter manhattan catv,d,the supreme court noted that it has consistently distinguished between flooding cases involving a permanent physical occupation,on the one hand,and cases involving a more temporary invasion that causes consequential damages within,on the other.
numerous cases from our predecessor court have similarly held that inherently temporary conditions can not result in the taking of a flowage easement.see barnes united states,by products,united states,fromme united states.the plaintiff must establish that flooding will inevitably recur,in the phrasing of the cress case.national by products,at.g flooding not proved to be inevitably recurring occupies the category of mere consequential injury,or tort.barnes,at.
the commission argues that under our decision in ridge line a permanent invasion is not required and that appropriation of a temporary flowage easement is sufficient.commission br.this argument is without support.a panel decision of this court can not,of course,overturn supreme court precedent or our precedent.in any event,we did not purport to do so in ridge line.the case involved a permanent condition runoff caused by the construction of a postal facility as such,we had no reason to address whether an inherently temporary condition could be considered a taking.the holding in ridge line is fully consistent with the cress case emphasis on the inevitably recurring nature of intermittent flooding.
in ridge line we noted that the claims court had erred in confin ing its analysis of liability to whether the government actions constituted a permanent and exclusive occupation.at,internal quotation omitted.we concluded that permanent destruction or exclusive occupation by government runoff is not always required for a successful taking.id.at.in other words,we explained,the occupation need not be exclusive and the destruction need not be permanent.id.at.i ntermittent flooding of private land can constitute a taking of an easement.id.at.thus,we confirmed that intermittent but inevitably recurring flooding could constitute a taking and that continuous inundation was not required.id.at.but,citing barnes,we noted that flooding not proved to be inevitably recurring occupies the category of mere consequential injury,or tort.id.at quoting barnes,at.the condition leading to the intermittent,but inevitably recurring flooding,id.at,must be permanent.otherwise,it could not be inevitably recurring.
ridge line also clarified that,in distinguishing between a tort and a taking,courts must additionally consider whether the government actions were sufficiently substantial to justify a takings remedy and whether the harm suffered by the plaintiff was the predictable result of the government action.at.the ridge line court relied on,where the supreme court found no taking in that case because it was unclear whether any substantial additional flooding actually occurred and whether the overflow was the direct result of the canal and thus would be reasonably anticipated by the government.at.similarly,in john horstmann united states,the supreme court found no taking where flooding was caused by the movement of underground percolating waters which no human knowledge could even predict.
the parties in this case vigorously dispute whether the extent and frequency of flooding satisfied the substantiality requirement and whether it was predictable.however,we need not decide whether the flooding on the management area was sufficiently substantial to justify a takings remedy or the predictable result of the government action,ridge line,at,because the deviations were by their very nature temporary and,therefore,can not be inevitably recurring or constitute the taking of a flowage easement.for this reason,we also need not address the parties dispute as to the calculation of damages.
most flooding cases involve overflows caused by permanent structures or improvements,such as dams,canals,or levees.see,dickinson,at involving the construction of a dam and the resulting rise in the river level sanguinetti,at involving a canal insufficient to carry away flood waters cress,at involving erection of a lock and dam ridge line,at involving runoff caused by construction of post office facility by products,at involving a levee built on one side of a creek without a corresponding levee on the other side.permanent conditions often,but not always,yield inevitably recurring flooding.compare cress,at finding inevitably recurring flooding,with national by products,at finding no taking because plaintiffs did not prove floods caused by levees would inevitably recur.
as with structural cases,in determining whether a governmental decision to release water from a dam can result in a taking,we must distinguish between action which is by its nature temporary and that which is permanent.but in distinguishing between temporary and permanent action,we do not focus on a structure and its consequence.rather we must focus on whether the government flood control policy was a permanent or temporary policy.releases that are ad hoc or temporary can not,by their very nature,be inevitably recurring.
the commission entire theory is contrary to governing law.the commission does not contend that the deviations from the plan and the resulting flooding were inevitably recurring.rather,the commission contends that temporary deviations are sufficient.in its brief,it contended that the fact that the corps eventually stopped the deviations only render ed the taking temporary,commission br,and therefore claims the united states appropriated a temporary flowage easement for which it must pay,id.at,emphasis added.at oral argument,the commission similarly argued that it do es not think the law requires the deviations to be permanent or that the government intended to make them permanent.oral arg.at,available at.it argued again that the fact that the united states abandoned its easement only makes the taking temporary.id.at.
the commission concession that the government action was temporary in nature is fully consistent with the established facts.the undisputed facts are clear that the governmental action was designed to be temporary and that the corps never approved a permanent change in the flow rates.as discussed above,all of the deviations from to were approved only as temporary or interim deviations.the multiple interim plans differed.even where deviations were the same in consecutive years,such as in and,the corps had to approve an extension of the interim deviation plan for the second year.
the commission itself similarly referred to the deviations as temporary or interim.during oral argument,the commission noted that when deviations first began they were temporary and made in response to particular requests by specific interests and that the permanent revisions to the plan were never approved.moreover,in an internal memorandum summarizing the first meeting of the black river group in,a commission official described the deviations as a temporary interim plan.in a later memorandum,a second commission official acknowledged that d uring the years,and,the interim plan was tried.id.at.martin blaney,the commission statewide habitat coordinator,testified at trial that an interim plan had been used from.id.at.similarly,robert zachary,the wildlife supervisor for the commission,testified that the corps interim plan of operation caused tree growing season flooding in.id.at.
therefore,the numerous deviation plans were inherently temporary,and the corps,despite considering permanent revisions in,never approved any of the deviations as a permanent policy.in order to make any permanent change to the release rates,corps regulations required compliance with federal regulations.the corps did not even begin the ea or eis necessary to comply with nepa until,and it never completed the necessary steps to implement a permanent revision of the water control plan.as such,the plaintiffs have not met their burden to prove that the increased flooding would be inevitably recurring because the deviations were explicitly temporary.
binding decisions of the court of claims,our predecessor court,in barnes and fromme found no taking under similar circumstances.in barnes,the fort randall dam was constructed in,and the government began to release water to evacuate the excess water accumulation caused by rains and melting snows in.at.the releases caused intermittent flooding from and again beginning in.id.at.noting that the flooding was of a type which will be inevitably recurring,id.at,the court determined that a taking had occurred but held that it did not occur until the permanent character of intermittent flooding could fairly be perceived in,id.at.consequently,it did not allow the plaintiffs to recover for crop damage sustained from because it was not obvious that the releases and the flooding would be permanent until.id.
in fromme,the corps constructed a channel and levee near the plaintiff property.at.during construction of this project,from,the defendant maintained a temporary spoil bank,which caused the plaintiff land to flood for a substantially longer time than would have been the case if the spoil bank and partially completed levee had not been in existence.id.at.the court held that no taking occurred during the period because the spoil bank only represented a temporary situation,and the channel would not lead to the inevitably recurring floodings which the supreme court had stressed in cress.id.at.hence,both barnes and fromme indicate that flooding must be a permanent or inevitably recurring condition,rather than an inherently temporary situation,to constitute the taking of a flowage easement 
because the deviations from the plan were only temporary,they can not constitute a taking.the actions at most created tort liability.we recognize that in other contexts the distinction between a temporary and permanent release plan may be difficult to define.the government can not,of course,avoid takings liability by characterizing inevitably recurr
