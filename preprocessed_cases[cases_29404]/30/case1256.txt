congress enacted the esa to provide for the conservation,protection and propagation of wildlife facing extinction,at,reprinted in see also b.the esa authorizes fws to designate a dps of a species as endangered or threatened.see,a.when fws designates a dps of a species as endangered or threatened,sister agencies assume special obligations to protect that species.see wyoming farm bureau fed babbitt,cir.the principal obligation at issue in this case is encompassed within a of the esa.that section requires an acting agency allegedly the forest service to consult with fws to ensure the former action allegedly the lrmps is unlikely to jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered or threatened species

the district court dismissed forest guardians amended complaint in its entirety.relevant to our task,the court dismissed forest guardians esa claim against the forest service pursuant to.b according to the court,the dps listing for the canada lynx is limited to a fourteen state area that does not encompass the carson and santa fe national forests,both of which are located entirely within the state of new mexico.because fws has not listed the lynx as threatened in new mexico,the district court concluded the esa does not require the forest service to consult with fws 
our jurisdiction to review the district court dismissal of forest guardians esa claim arises under.our review is de novo.see moya schollenbarger,cir.we accept the factual allegations of the amended complaint as true but owe no such allegiance to its legal conclusions.see jordan alternative res,cir.because we conclude forest guardians has not adequately alleged the agency action necessary to trigger the forest service duty to consult with fws under a of the esa,we need not reach the question of whether the dps listing of canada lynx would otherwise require the forest service to consult with fws on the carson and santa fe national forest plans.see champagne metals metals,cir court of appeals may affirm on any ground supported by the record,provided the parties have had an opportunity to address such ground.
we begin with the relevant allegation of forest guardians amended complaint.paragraph states implementation of the carson and santa fe national forest lrmps are agency actions that may affect listed lynx and,as such,the must undergo formal consultation to insure that such actions are not jeopardizing the continued existence of lynx.according to the forest service,the carson and santa fe forest plans do not constitute ongoing agency action for purposes of a.to support its position,the forest service relies on the supreme court recent decision in norton southern utah wilderness alliance,d.in norton,the court concluded that while approval of a land use plan promulgated by the bureau of land management blm constituted major federal action under the national environmental policy act nepa,such action was complete once blm approved the plan.id.at.the court rejected the notion that the plan itself constituted ongoing major federal action.id.forest guardians points out,however,that this case arises under the esa,not nepa,and that action under of the esa is broadly defined.to support its allegation of agency action,forest guardians relies principally on the ninth circuit decision in pacific rivers council thomas,cir.in pacific rivers,the court held lrmps constitute continuing agency action requiring consultation under a of the esa.id.at.before turning to an analysis of these competing arguments,a brief overview of lrmps is appropriate to add focus to the narrow issue before us,that is,the sufficiency of forest guardians allegation that i mplementation of the carson and santa fe national forest lrmps are agency actions within the meaning of a.
the national forest management act nfma,directs the forest service to develop a lrmp for each unit of the national forest system.see id.a.regulations contained in subpart a of pt.set forth the process for developing,amending and revising lrmps.lrmps are embodied in appropriate written material.f.lrmps reflect,among other things proposed and possible actions.id consistent with the nfma,the applicable forest service regulation defines a plan as a document or set of documents that integrates and displays information relevant to management of a unit of the national forest system.lrmps developed pursuant to the nfma and subpart a of the regulations 
generally contain desired conditions,objectives,and guidance for project and activity decisionmaking in the plan area.plans do not grant,withhold,or modify any contract,permit or other legal instrument,subject anyone to civil or criminal liability,or create any legal rights.plans typically do not approve or execute projects and activities.decisions with effects that can be meaningfully evaluated typically are made when projects and activities are approved.
id.b internal citation omitted.in short,lrmps are a framework for making later project decisions rather than a collection of project decisions.review and comment and appeal procedures for national forest planning and project decisions requesting review of national forest plans and project decisions,april,plan review 
as we have oft explained,management of lrmps occurs at two levels.the first level is programmatic 
at the programmatic level,the forest service creates general,forest wide planning goals memorialized in a forest plan.because the forest service must account for a variety of different interests,each forest plan envisions the forest will be used for multiple purposes,including outdoor recreation,range,timber,watershed,wildlife and fish,and wilderness.e.at the same time,the forest plan provides for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area.id.g b.
utah envtl.cong.bosworth,cir emphasis added.the second level is project we have repeatedly stated that t he forest service is required to implement the forest plan by approving or disapproving specific projects.projects must be consistent with the governing forest plan and are subject to the procedural requirements of nepa.lamb thompson,cir accord silverton snowmobile club united states forest,cir colorado envtl.coalition dombeck,cir see also recognizing the implementation of lrmps through projects and activities.i mplementation of the lrmp occurs when individual projects are proposed and assessed,and not before.idaho conservation league mumma,cir.to assess a proposed project or action,the forest service must conduct an analysis and evaluation of such project or action to assure compliance not only with the lrmp but also with applicable laws and regulations.see b,e forest service manual available at.doc see generally pt.addressing notice,comment,and appeals procedures for forest service projects and activities.only then may an irreversible commitment of forest resources occur.see plan review.at.
much like the promulgation of a regulation,we have little doubt after norton that the act of approving,amending,or revising a lrmp constitutes action under a of the esa.see listing the promulgation of regulations as an example of action under.nothing in the foregoing overview,however,suggests that lrmps,once approved,amended,or revised,constitute ongoing,action under a.compare norton,at.to the contrary,the nfma,fws regulations,and tenth circuit case law suggest lrmps are implemented through the approval of proposed projects and activities that are consistent with the plan direction.once the lrmp is in place,agency action takes place at the project level.see national forest system land and resource management planning,proposed rule,april.rather than actions themselves,lrmps appear more akin to road maps on which the forest service relies to chart various courses of action.a lrmp is,in the truest sense,a document that creates a vision by integrating and displaying information relevant to the management of a national forest.see see also bosworth,at describing lrmps as envisioning forest uses compare norton,at.describing land use plans as guiding and controlling future management actions.
nonetheless,forest guardians insists the definition of action as used in a of the esa is broad enough to encompass the sizable entirety of the respective lrmps for the carson and santa fe national forests,each of which sets policy for a forest exceeding million acres in land mass that definition of action,complete with examples,encompasses 
all activities or programs of any kind authorized,funded,or carried out,in whole or in part,by federal agencies in the united states examples include,but are not limited to 
a actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat 
b the promulgation of regulations 
c the granting of licenses,contracts,leases,easements,permits,or or 
d actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land,water,or air.
see also b describing a program as a group of concerted actions to implement a specific policy or plan.
we do not doubt a lrmp might authorize an activity or program,and that such authorization could constitute action within the meaning of a.similarly,if the lrmp demanded the forest service fund or carry out an activity or program,this too could constitute action under a.such action,in turn,could give rise to a duty to consult on that particular action under a of the esa.see a.lrmps,however,typically do not approve or execute projects and activities,and do not authorize the irreversible commitment of forest resources.b emphasis added see also id.recognizing a lrmp may include a project decision compare norton,at.a land use plan is not ordinarily the medium for affirmative decisions that implement the agency projections.internal brackets omitted see also plan review.at discussing the nature of lrmps and project decisions 
yet whether a particular activity or program is part of a lrmp or subsequently authorized at the project level,the esa definition of action still requires forest guardians to direct its focus on an activity or program that allegedly threatens the lynx.this is because only in the presence of such activity or program,agency action,does a duty to consult ever arise under a.see california sportfishing prot.alliance federal energy regulatory comm n,cir the esa and the applicable regulations mandate consultation only before an agency takes some affirmative agency action,such as issuing a license.needless to say then,we are hard pressed to conclude,based on the allegations of the amended complaint,that the two lrmps on which forest guardians demands consultation constitute,in their entirety,an activity or program,an action,authorized,funded,or carried out by the forest service.a compare lujan national wildlife fed n,d nn,rejecting a generic challenge under the apa to the entirety of blm land withdrawal review program couched as unlawful agency action.
we have searched forest guardians amended complaint in vain for some concrete allegation of action beyond the mere implementation of the lrmps which might allow us to sustain it on the issue before us.see,turtle island restoration network national marine fisheries,cir agency issuance of fishing permits required a consultation natural res.def.council houston,cir agency renewal of water contracts required a consultation.as to lrmps generally,forest guardians alleges in paragraph of the amended complaint that lrmps include programs or practices that result in habitat conversion fragmentation or obstruction to lynx movement roads or winter recreation trails that facilitate access to historical lynx habitat by competitors and fire exclusion which changes the vegetation mosaic maintained by natural disturbance processes.yet nowhere in the amended complaint can we find any mention,specific to the respective lrmps for the carson and santa fe national forests,of an authorized program,practice,project,or activity that might amount to action threatening the continued existence of the lynx.see california sportfishing,at the triggering mechanism for consultation under a is an agency action,not the listing of a species.
similarly,paragraph of the amended complaint alleges in the abstract 
lrmps in the southern rockies may adversely impact lynx and lynx habitat by having a fire exclusion policy which changes the vegetative mosaic maintained by natural disturbances allowing grazing of domestic livestock,which reduces forage for lynx prey allowing roads and winter recreation trails that facilitate access to historical lynx habitat by competitors allowing levels of human access via forest roads that may present a risk of incidental trapping or illegal shooting of lynx having limited direction in the forest plan pertaining to tree thinning and foraging habitat and having weak direction for distributing lynx habitat components across the landscape.
we do not disagree with the proposition that policies,directions,and allowances contained in a lrmp may indirectly impact the lynx and its habitat adversely.after all,these are matters contained within a lrmp on which agency actions are based.but this does not make such policies,directions,and allowances action requiring consultation within the meaning of a.policies and directions only guide the forest service in determining whether an action may be properly undertaken consistent with the lrmp.moreover,the fact that a lrmp allows certain activities to occur on forest lands does not commit the forest service to anything.see plan review.at citing cases compare norton,at.holding a land use plan statement to the effect that blm will conduct use supervision and monitoring in designated other will do projections of agency action set forth in land use not a legally binding commitment.m any activities allowed by plans,such as timber harvest and road construction,are never carried out for a variety of reasons,such as funding limitations and environment,wildlife or policy considerations.final rule.at compare norton,at.what lrmps might allow is thus readily distinguishable from actual actions as a result of past or current implementation of the plans.final rule.at 
neither do provisions identifying specific areas as appropriate for certain uses that normally occur within a forest,recreation,grazing,timber cutting,and the like constitute action on the part of the forest service within the meaning of a.the fws regulation addressing suitable uses within a national forest specifically provides that identification of specific areas in a lrmp is guidance for project and activity decisionmaking,is not a permanent land designation,and is subject to change through plan amendment or plan revision.uses of specific areas are approved through project and activity decisionmaking.a.
a lrmp considered in isolation simply is not an ongoing,document.specific activities,programs,projects are necessary to implement the plan.see,bos
