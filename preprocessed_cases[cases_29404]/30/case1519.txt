petitioners alabama rivers alliance,american rivers,and lake watch of lake martin seek review of the decision of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission to amend an existing hydroelectric license issued to alabama power company alabama power.the amended license authorizes alabama power to replace three existing turbine generators at its martin dam project on the tallapoosa river with new,more efficient units.the petitioners contend that the commission erred in issuing the license amendment without first requiring alabama power to obtain water quality certification from the state of alabama.because we conclude that an increase in the volume of water passing through the dam replacement turbines may result in any discharge into the navigable waters within the meaning of section a of the clean water act cwa,a,we grant the petition for review and vacate the commission orders.
background 
a.the regulatory framework 
the federal power act fpa authorizes ferc to issue licenses for the purpose of constructing,operating,and maintaining dams,water conduits,reservoirs,power houses,transmission lines,or other project works necessary or convenient for the development,transmission,and utilization of power across,along,from,or in any of the streams or other bodies of water over which congress has jurisdiction under the commerce clause.e.these hydroelectric licenses contain certain conditions that ferc deems necessary to improve and utilize the nation waterways in general and development in particular.id.a.upon mutual agreement between the commission and a licensee,ferc may amend such licenses,which are issued for a period not exceeding fifty years.id.
although the fpa represents a congressional intention to establish a broad federal role in the development and licensing of hydroelectric power,the cwa has diminished the fpa preemptive reach by expressly requiring the commission to incorporate into its licenses water quality conditions.am.rivers,ferc,cir quoting california ferc,d.ferc hydroelectric licenses are thus subject to,among other conditions,the requirements of section of the cwa.see escondido mut.water la jolla indians,d w hile congress intended that the commission would have exclusive authority to issue all licenses,it wanted the individual secretaries,the secretaries of the interior,war and agriculture to continue to play the major role in determining what conditions would be included in the license in order to protect the resources under their respective jurisdictions.
section a of the cwa provides that a ny applicant for a federal license or permit to conduct any activity which may result in any discharge into the navigable waters,shall provide the licensing or permitting agency a certification from the state in which the discharge originates or will originate.a.the required certification must provide that such discharge will comply with the applicable water quality standards of the cwa,as well as with any other appropriate requirement of state law.id.d any limitations included in the state certification become a condition on the federal license.id.if the originating state denies an applicant section a certification,ferc may not issue that applicant a hydroelectric license.id.a 
b.the license amendment proceedings 
located on the tallapoosa river in central alabama,alabama power martin dam project has the capacity to generate megawatts mw of electric power.the dam project generates electricity by taking in water from the reservoir above the dam,funneling the water through four turbine generators and then releasing the water through four penstocks into the river below the dam.the first three turbine generators began commercial operation in.alabama power added a fourth,mw generator in.although ferc originally licensed the martin dam project in,it issued a new license to alabama power in.
on december,alabama power filed an application with the commission to amend its license to authorize the replacement of the three turbine generators.these units had exhibited serious leakage problems and efforts to repair them had been largely unsuccessful.according to alabama power estimates,the replacement turbines would increase the flow of water into the river below the dam project by approximately cubic feet per second cfs,an increase of,and would increase each generator capacity by to mw,an increase of roughly.
shortly after the commission provided public notice of alabama power license amendment application,the petitioners moved to intervene,arguing that section a of the cwa required alabama power to obtain state water quality certification before the commission could amend its existing license.on may,the commission issued an order approving alabama power proposed license amendment.power,project,order amending license,wl may,order amending license.in doing so,the commission rejected the petitioners argument that the license amendment required state water quality certification under section a,concluding that r eplacing and upgrading the existing units is not an activity which may result in a discharge within the meaning of s ection a.id.at.
while the commission recognized that replacement of the turbine generators would increase the dam project hydraulic capacity,with the result that water would be discharged more quickly into the river,it found that the nature of the discharge would not change,that water from the reservoir would continue to be released through the new turbine generators in essentially the same manner as it is now released through the existing turbine generators.id.reasoning that section a requires certification only for activities which may result in a discharge,not activities which may alter an already existing discharge,the commission held that section a did not apply to alabama power amended license.id.citing north carolina ferc,cert.denied,d emphasis in original 
the commission order amending license likewise rejected the petitioners argument that f iii required alabama power to obtain state water quality certification for its proposed license amendment.id.section f iii provides that any application to amend an existing license requires a new request for water quality certification if the amendment would have a material adverse impact on the water quality in the discharge from the project.f iii.citing its environmental assessment of the proposed license amendment,the commission concluded that the proposed modifications to the three turbine generators would not have a material adverse effect on the water quality of the dam project discharge.order amending license,at.accordingly,the commission held that section f iii did not require alabama power to obtain state water quality certification in applying to amend its existing hydroelectric license.id.
the petitioners moved for rehearing.on july,the commission denied the motion,again rejecting the argument that section a required alabama power to obtain state water quality certification for its proposed license amendment.power,project,order denying rehearing,wl july,order denying rehearing.relying on north carolina ferc,the commission explained that section a applies only to activities that may result in a discharge,not to those activities that simply alter an existing discharge,order denying rehearing,at.alabama power license amendment did not trigger the certification requirements of section a,the commission reasoned,because replacement of the existing turbine generators will at most alter an existing discharge by increasing the amount of water flowing through the units at any given time and,concurrently,reducing the amount of time that the units will operate each day.id.
noting that all construction would be completed within the existing structures of the dam project as well as in the dry,the commission dismissed the petitioners argument that replacement of the turbine generators would result in a discharge of dust,grease and oil id.at.the commission rejected the notion that removal of the old turbine generators could result in any such discharge and,in addition,concluded that the possible release of trace amounts of dust or grease during the initial installation of the new turbine generators was an insufficient basis to conclude that the replacement would result in a discharge requiring certification under section a id.at.we now review the commission orders.
ii.analysis 
on review,the petitioners maintain that the commission erred in issuing alabama power proposed license amendment without first requiring alabama power to obtain a water quality certification from the state of alabama specifically,the petitioners challenge the commission conclusion that the installation and operation of the three new turbine generators at the martin dam project is not an activity which may result in any discharge for purposes of section a.a.they insist that the installation and operation of the new turbine generators may result in at least two discharges into the tallapoosa river an increased flow of water,and particularly of low dissolved oxygen do water,see supra note,passing through the dam replacement turbines and the release of dust,grease and oil during the installation of the replacement turbines.we agree with the petitioners as to the first of the claimed discharges and,on that basis,grant the petition and vacate the commission orders 
standard of review 
we review a commission licensing decision under the fpa to determine whether it was arbitrary and capricious.north carolina,at bangor.ferc.in reviewing such a decision,we must treat the commission findings of fact as conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence.b.because the petitioners did not challenge the commission factual findings in their request for rehearing,however,they are precluded from doing so now.see id.we therefore consider the commission findings of fact to be conclusive.
as a result,we must simply resolve a question of statutory the installation and operation of the replacement turbines is an activity that may result in any discharge within the meaning of section a of the cwa.a.the commission interpretation of the cwa is not entitled to the usual judicial deference,however,because the environmental protection agency epa and not charged with administering the statute see d except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter,the administrator of the environmental protection agency shall administer this chapter.cal.trout,ferc,cir commission interpretation of cwa not entitled to deference am.rivers,at same see also city of olmsted falls faa,w hen we are faced with an agency interpretation of a statute not committed to its administration,we give no deference.emphasis in original.we therefore review the commission interpretation of section a a purely legal novo.see cal.trout,at commission interpretation of section a reviewed de novo am.rivers,at same see also chevron,at.at the judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent.ass of civilian technicians flra,flra interpretation of travel expenses it does not de novo 
b.the increased water flow 
the petitioners argument is a straightforward one.as previously discussed,section a requires state water quality certification for any activity which may result in any discharge into the navigable waters.a.emphasizing that water must flow through the turbine generators and be discharged in order for the dam project to produce electricity,the petitioners argue that the licensed,the installation and operation of the replacement necessarily result in any discharge into the tallapoosa river.specifically,the petitioners maintain that the operation of the new turbine generators will result in an increased flow of water significantly different in volume,timing,and intensity,as well as in the amount of do,from the flow of water passing through the old turbines.br.for pet r at.the petitioners thus reason that,under the plain language of section a,alabama power license amendment required state water quality certification.
the commission contends,however,that the petitioners misinterpret the plain language of section a and thereby misunderstand what must be shown in order to establish that an activity may result in any discharge.a.more specifically,the commission asserts that the petitioners argument runs afoul of our reasoning in north carolina,a case in which we considered whether ferc violated section a by issuing an amended hydroelectric license authorizing a licensee to decrease the flow of water passing through a dam turbine generators without first receiving state water quality certification.north carolina,at.rejecting the argument that section a requires state water quality certification simply because an activity will result in an altered discharge,we reasoned as follows 
t he existence of certification rights under s ection a does not depend on whether a discharge is altered.section a certification rights vests only if an activity may result in a discharge.this distinction is of no small moment.the word alter means to change something from its previous state,webster new int l dictionary ed to cause to become different,implying that the thing changed was already in existence.by contrast,the word result implies causation.see id.at arise as a consequence.obviously,a subsequent event can not be the cause of something that is already in existence.given the disparity between petitioners proposed test and the words of the cwa,we elect to remain faithful to the language chosen by congress and require that an activity result in a discharge in order to trigger the certification requirements of s ection a.
citing the lack of equivalence between an activity that may increase water flows and an activity that may result in such flows,br.for resp t at emphasis in original,the commission contends that our reasoning in north carolina applies with equal force here.replacement of the turbine generators can not,in the commission view,possibly result in water flows that and will continue,in some form,regardless of whether that replacement is approved.id.at.at most,the commission argues,replacement of the turbine generators will alter an existing discharge by increasing the amount of water flowing through the units at any given time and,concurrently,reducing the amount of time that the units will operate each day.id.at quoting order denying rehearing,at.
yet the commission argument ignores the critical feature of the licensing activity at issue in north carolina operation of the pipeline,the activity authorized by the license in the withdrawal of water from the lake gaston reservoir.north carolina,at.in our view,the distinction between an increased discharge and a decreased discharge is of no small moment.id.at.but this should hardly come as a surprise,for we recognized as much in north carolina itself.relying on the definition of discharge of a pollutant and discharge of pollutants,we observed that the word discharge contemplates the addition,not the withdrawal,of a substance or substances.id.at emphasis added.because the operation of the pipeline project would not result in the addition of anything to lake gaston,we held that a decrease in the volume of water passing through the dam turbines can not be considered a discharge as the term is defined in the cwa.id.at obviously,the withdrawal of water from lake gaston will add nothing nor will the withdrawal of water from lake gaston increase the volume of water flowing through the turbines of the project dams.
the plain language of section a and our construction of that language in north carolina thus compel us to conclude that alabama power installation and operation of the new turbine generators at its martin dam project is an activity which may result in any discharge within the meaning of section a.a.as discussed above,the word discharge contemplates the addition of a substance or substances into the navigable waters.north carolina,at.here,the commission concluded that the replacement turbines would increase the flow of water into the river by approximately cfs.thus,at the very least,the replacement turbines will release low do water into the river at an increased rate of cfs.the installation and operation of the replacement turbines is therefore a
