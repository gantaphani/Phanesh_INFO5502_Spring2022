factual and procedural background 
under health and safety code section,the dhs is responsible for ensuring that all public water systems are operated in compliance with the california safe drinking water act.as permitted by health and safety code section,the dhs delegated its primary responsibility for administration and enforcement of the act to county as the local primacy agency.thus,at all times relevant,county was responsible for ensuring that the jensen camp system was operated in compliance with the law.among the applicable laws were the regulations issued by the dhs that set maximum contaminant levels mcls for many substances found in drinking water.see.water system operators were required to monitor their water and report the results to county.whenever a test revealed contaminants in excess of the specified mcl,monitoring and reporting requirements were intensified,subd.g.at all pertinent times,the mcl for fluoride was never more than.former,table,table.according to plaintiffs,water containing fluoride in excess of the established mcl poses a risk of injury to persons drinking it.
plaintiffs third amended complaint alleges that pinch was not a knowledgeable water system operator.he depended upon county for direction and advice concerning operation of the jensen camp water system.pinch submitted a report to county in november showing the level of fluoride in the jensen camp water to be.pinch submitted another report in showing the fluoride level to be.in or about,pinch submitted one or more consumer confidence reports to county,which reflected the fluoride levels detected in and finally,in,pinch reported a fluoride level of.
although the reports pinch submitted between and showed that the jensen camp water contained levels of fluoride that exceeded the mcls specified by the regulations,prior to county employees did not review those reports and did not direct pinch to do any monitoring other than at routine intervals.further,county did not ensure that pinch delivered the consumer confidence reports to his customers,did not otherwise direct pinch to notify his customers that their drinking water was unsafe,and did not report his violations to the dhs.it was not until april that county imposed a compliance order under which pinch acknowledged the contamination and agreed to make repairs to the water system.plaintiffs did not learn of the contamination until after plaintiffs javier guzman and tosha purchased jensen camp from pinch in or about august.
in plaintiffs third amended complaint,the third and fourth causes of action were directed against county.the action against pinch is not at issue here.the third cause of action was for negligence under government code section.the fourth cause of action alleged negligence under a theory.plaintiffs alleged that,due to county negligence,they unknowingly consumed contaminated drinking water from at least november,resulting in pain and suffering and in injuries to their bodies and nervous systems,skeletal structures and other injuries not yet identified.the trial court sustained county demurrer to both causes of action,without leave to amend.plaintiffs have challenged only the ruling on the government code claim.
ii.legal framework 
on appeal from a dismissal entered after an order sustaining a demurrer,we review the order de novo,exercising our independent judgment about whether the petition states a cause of action as a matter of law.city of morgan hill bay area air quality management dist.th,d.we deem to be true all material facts that were properly pled.citation.we must also accept as true those facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.citation.we may also consider matters that may be judicially noticed,but do not accept contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.id.at,d.we independently construe statutory law,as its interpretation is a question of law on which we are not bound by the trial court analysis.id.at,d.
it is settled that public entities such as county are not liable in tort except as provided by statute,et guzman,supra,cal th at,d.one such statute is government code section,which provides where a public entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury,the public entity is liable for an injury of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the duty unless the public entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the duty.guzman,supra,cal th at pages,d,describes the requirements of this section in detail.briefly,there are three elements to a cause of action under government code section.first,the enactment at issue must be obligatory,not merely discretionary or permissive in its directions to the public entity.guzman,supra,at,d.typically,an enactment imposing a mandatory duty also includes specific rules and guidelines for implementation.second,the duty imposed must be designed to protect against the particular kind of injury the plaintiff suffered.we examine the language,function and apparent purpose of each cited enactment to determine if any or each creates a mandatory duty designed to protect against the injury allegedly suffered by the plaintiff.the requirement is not satisfied if the enactment merely confers some incidental benefit upon the class to which the plaintiff belongs.the third and final requirement is that the breach of the duty must have been a proximate cause of the plaintiff injury.ibid.
