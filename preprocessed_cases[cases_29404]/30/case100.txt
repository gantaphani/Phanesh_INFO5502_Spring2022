amended opinion 
this appeal raises recurring questions in litigation with agencies of the united states arising out of the tension between the substantive provisions of the freedom of information act foia or the act,and the application of the and privileges.in january,the state of maine maine submitted a series of foia requests to the united states fish and wildlife service,a component of the department of interior doi,and the national maritime fisheries,a component of the department of commerce doc collectively the services for documents relating to the efforts of the services to list atlantic salmon in eight rivers within maine under the protection of the endangered species act esa.
the doi provided maine with approximately documents but withheld documents,claiming or privileges.maine filed an action in the united states district court for the district of maine to enjoin the services from improperly withholding those documents.on for summary judgments,the district court allowed the doi to withhold a number of documents but ordered that documents be disclosed immediately to maine.it found them unprotected by the or privileges.the doi timely appealed.following our issuance of an opinion in this case,the doi filed a petition for rehearing and maine responded.we withdrew our original opinion and vacated the judgment.we now affirm,reverse,and vacate in part.
background 
to provide a better understanding of the issues raised on appeal and the litigious climate in which maine made its requests,we set forth the background history of this litigation.
the genesis of these proceedings is that in,the united states fish and wildlife service designated atlantic salmon in five rivers within maine as candidate species under the endangered species act in,the services received petitions to list all atlantic salmon throughout the united states under the esa.in,the services decided that nationwide listing was unwarranted.however,they determined that atlantic salmon in seven rivers within maine were a distinct population segment,eligible for protection under the esa and in danger of extinction.the services,therefore,proposed to list the salmon in these seven rivers as threatened under the esa.
opposed to such a listing,maine proposed the atlantic salmon conservation plan for seven maine rivers.in december,the services,satisfied with the conservation plan,withdrew the listing proposal.the compromise obligated maine to issue annual reports which were to be made available for public comment.with the withdrawal of the proposed listing,the services advised maine that they would maintain oversight of the species.they also outlined circumstances under which the process for listing atlantic salmon in maine rivers would be reinstated.in january,maine circulated its draft annual report,which it issued in april as a final report after comments from the services and the public.
in the meantime,in january,the defenders of wildlife filed an action in the united states district court for the district of columbia challenging the withdrawal of the services listing as violative of the esa and the apa.in march,maine moved to intervene as defendant the defenders sought,among other relief,to have the services list the atlantic salmon under the emergency listing provision of the esa.in august,trout unlimited filed a suit raising substantially the same issues in the same court as the defenders.in the midst of the defenders and trout lawsuits and maine threat of future legal action,the services in november conducted another status review and decided to list the atlantic salmon as being in danger of extinction in eight rivers within maine 
in resisting the proposed listing,maine made a series of foia requests to the departments and their components seeking documents pertaining to the decision to list the atlantic salmon in eight maine rivers as endangered.the doi satisfied maine first request made in december.maine made a second request,which is the subject of this appeal,on january,to both departments,doi and doc,seeking all documents,data,studies,and correspondence pertaining to the services consideration of whether to list atlantic salmon in eight maine rivers in response,the doi released approximately documents.it withheld documents as protected from disclosure under the and privileges subsumed by the foia exemption b the doi asserts that all withheld documents were generated between january and january,a period in which the defenders and trout lawsuits were pending.
unsuccessful in administrative appeals,maine filed an action in june,in the united states district court for the district of maine alleging that the doi improperly withheld documents.on for summary judgment,the district court issued its decision and order on december,as amended on january.maine doi,d.it ordered the doi immediately to disclose documents to maine,finding them not exempt under either the or privileges although the district court stayed the immediate disclosure order pending appeal,the doi released documents and challenged disclosure of the remaining documents 
on appeal,the doi raises two primary issues.first,as to the attorney privilege,the doi claims that the court erred in requiring a withholding agency to demonstrate that a document was prepared primarily for litigation purposes to protect it from disclosure under the foia,b.second,the doi argues that the district court erred in rejecting the agency assertion of privilege for documents containing legal advice and analysis from agency attorneys and draft materials written by agency officials on the ground that the documents do not reveal confidential communications from clients.
the foia requires government agencies to make promptly available to any person,upon request,whatever records the agency possessed unless those records fall within one of the statute exemption.a,b.even if some information within a document is exempt,the withholding agency must still disclose reasonably segregable information.id.b.several years ago,this court had the occasion to review the policy,purpose and sweep of foia in church of scientology international united states department of justice,cir.writing for the court,judge coffin noted that the statute basic purpose is to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny.id.at.the policy underlying the statute,he wrote,is thus one of broad disclosure,and the government must supply any information requested by an individual unless it determines that a specific exemption,narrowly construed,applies.id.
when an aggrieved party files an action under the act because documents are withheld,the burden under the statute is on the agency to demonstrate the applicability of a claimed exemption.a b.the district court must make a de novo determination whether the agency has met its burden.id.
to facilitate a broad disclosure and assist the requester and,if necessary,a reviewing court,in determining whether the claim of exemption is justified,a practice has developed for the withholding agency to supply the requester with a vaughn index.the index takes its name from vaughn rosen,and requires a correlation of the information that an agency decides to withhold with the particular foia exemption and the agency justification for withholding.maynard cia,cir.the index includes a general description of each document sought by the foia requester and explains the agency justification for nondisclosure of each individual document or portion of a document.church of scientology int l,at.thus,the index compels the agency to scrutinize any material withheld in justification of its claimed exemption,assists the court in performing its duties,and gives the requester as much information as is legally permissible.id.
here,the doi claims that b,which exempts from disclosure or memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency,shields from disclosure the documents at issue.the supreme court has interpreted that exemption to protect from disclosure those documents that normally are privileged from civil discovery.nlrb sears,roebuck,d see also church of scientology int l,at.thus,the and privileges are included within the scope of the fifth exemption of foia.sears,roebuck,at.
although enacted to inform the public about government agencies actions,foia was not designed to supplement the rules of civil discovery,and a requester right to obtain information is neither enhanced nor diminished because of its needs as a litigant.deering milliken,irving,cir citing sears,roebuck,at.with these principles in mind,we address the issues before us and turn to the exemptions claimed by the doi under the and privileges.
attorney privilege 
the attorney privilege first established in hickman taylor,codified in.rule b for civil discovery,protects from disclosure materials prepared by attorneys in anticipation of litigation.since hickman,courts have reaffirmed the strong public policy on which the privilege is grounded,united states adlman,cir.the privilege protects work done by an attorney in anticipation of,or during,litigation from disclosure to the opposing party.
the specific problem posed by the parties here is the interpretation of the in anticipation of litigation requirement in a foia context.the doi submits that the district court erred in holding that the documents doi claims are privileged as attorney must not only identify the litigation for which each document was prepared but also establish that counsel prepared the document primarily for litigation purposes.
relying on the supreme court admonition to interpret foia exemptions narrowly,the district court held that the determinative question here is whether the prospect of litigation served as the primary motivating factor for the preparation of the documents.maine,d at citing scott paper ceilcote,emphasis added.the court reasoned that without such demonstration,documents created for a dual purpose,as is common with controversial rule proposals,would eviscerate the purposes of the foia by potentially allowing an agency to withhold any document created during a decision to promulgate a controversial rule.id.to do so would do nothing to advance the core purpose of the attorney privilege which is to protect the adversary trial process itself.id.thus,the court held that to sustain its burden of establishing the attorney privilege,the doi vaughn index must identify the litigation for which each document was prepared and establish that the document was prepared primarily for litigation purposes.id.at.
the doi argues that the district court reliance on scott paper company ceilcote company,a district court opinion,to require that counsel show that the document was prepared in anticipation of litigation and that litigation was the primary factor contradicts the purpose of.rule and court of appeals cases.the doi asserts that numerous courts of appeals have rejected the district court approach here and adopted a because of standard.the because of standard is one that determines whether a document is prepared because of existing or expected litigation.united states adlman,cir 
in doi petition for rehearing,it augments and clarifies its views as to the application of ftc grolier,d to the issue before us and emphasizes that the district court interpreted the relevant foia exemption too narrowly.the district court erred,the doi argues,in holding that the documents are protected by the attorney privilege only if the primary motivating factor for their creation was to assist in litigation.doi strenuously argues that the applicable law,even in the foia context,is rule of the federal rules of civil procedure and case law governing the privilege,particularly ftc grolier,and united states adlman.
in grolier,the question was the extent,if any,to which the component of exemption applies when the litigation for which the requested documents were generated had been terminated.although the issue was not identical to the question before us,the supreme court concluded that whatever problems are engendered in construing rule b in the civil discovery area,the rule provides a satisfactory resolution to the question of whether documents are exempt under the foia.at.without any need to rely exclusively upon any particular construction of rule b,the court held that the test under exemption is whether the documents would be routinely or normally disclosed upon a showing of relevance.id.at.this was hardly a bolt from the blue.several years before,the court explained in nlrb sears,roebuck,d,that exemption exempt s those documents,and only those documents,normally privileged in the civil discovery context.
adlman provides the most exhaustive discussion,albeit in a context,of the standard adopted by the district court here,as well as the one the doi advances to this court.the court of appeals described the issue and the competing standards as follows 
it is universally agreed that a document whose purpose is to assist in preparation for litigation is within the scope of the rule and thus eligible to receive protection if the other conditions of protection prescribed by the rule are met.the issue is less clear,however,as to documents which,although prepared because of expected litigation,are intended to inform a business decision influenced by the prospects of the litigation.the formulation applied by some courts in determining whether documents are protected by privilege is whether they are prepared primarily or exclusively to assist in litigation a formulation that would potentially exclude documents containing analysis of expected litigation,if their primary,ultimate,or exclusive purpose is to assist in making the business decision.others ask whether the documents were prepared because of existing or expected formulation that would include such documents,despite the fact that their purpose is not to assist in litigation.
at emphasis added.
the adlman court reasoned that the primary standard is at odds with the text and the policies of rule because nothing in it suggests that documents prepared for dual purposes of litigation and business or agency decisions do not fall within its scope.id.at.thus,that court rejected the primary purpose standard as at odds with the literal terms and purpose of the rule.id.instead,the court adopted the formulation of the rule enunciated by wright,miller marcus,fed.practice procedure,at,and adopted by a number of circuits,that documents should be deemed prepared for litigation and within the scope of the rule if,in light of the nature of the document and the factual situation in the particular case,the document can be fairly said to have been prepared or obtained because of the prospect of litigation.id.at.
maine does not dispute the reasoning or pertinence of these cases in its answer to the petition for rehearing.rather,it submits,as it has before,that the precise scope of the privilege is essentially irrelevant.this is so because defendants failed to demonstrate that the documents at issue fall within even the broad scope of the privilege set forth in the cases upon which defendants rely.there is nothing to suggest that the documents were created for any reason other than to assist the defendants in taking a routine administrative a listing under the endangered species act.see answer of maine at.
in light of the decisions of the supreme court,we therefore agree with the formulation of the rule adopted in adlman and by five other courts of appeals.see supra.thus,we must conclude that in the instant case it was error to require the doi to demonstrate that the withheld documents were created primarily for litigation purposes in order to claim the privilege under b.
this conclusion does not end our inquiry.maine argues that the defendants produced so little information regarding the withheld documents that there is simply no way of determining why a particular document was prepared,what the document discusses,or whether it should be protected from disclosure.see answer of maine at.the doi,on the other hand,argues that the district court also erred in finding that the doi failed sufficiently to identify the litigation for which the alleged documents were prepared.this court previously has held 
a t a minimum,an agency seeking to withhold a document must identify the litigation for which the document was created either by name or through factual description and explain why the privilege applies to all portions of the document.
church of scientology int l,at.although the identification and explanation requirements are not to be given a hypertechnical construction,they can neither be brushed aside nor satisfied by vague generalities.
the doi relies on the two declarations of edward keable,the,office of the solicitor,united states department of the interior,that the doi submitted in support of its summary judgment motion.in the first declaration,keable asserts that the withheld documents are privileged and refers to his written legal opinion that was sent to maine during the administrative appeal.however,the declaration is conclusory and not of much help here.in the second declaration,keable identifies the following lawsuits related to the listing process defenders of wildlife babbitt trout unlimited babbitt maine department of interior maine threat to challenge the final rule and maine aquaculture association threat of suit if pen permits are modified to protect wild salmon.the declaration is peremptory it offers no information that the documents requested were prepared for any of these lawsuits.in both the legal opinion and in the corresponding transmittal letter,the doi explicitly acknowledged it has not identified the litigation to which the withheld documents relate.rather,it reasoned that because there already have been three law suits directly related to the listing,it is reasonable for the attorneys advising the department to anticipate more litigation at various stages in the process.
an examination of the vaughn index also is not helpful.although the index identifies the documents and describes the general subject matter of each,it fails to demonstrate that any particular document was prepared for litigation and fails to correlate the documents to the lawsuits referred to in the keable declarations.the mere relation of documents to litigation does not automatically endow those documents with privileged status.the burden was on the doi to make the correlation between each withheld document and the litigation for which the document was created,and the district court found that the doi did not make it.we see no compliance with this court minimum requirements laid out in church of scientology international and perceive no error by the district court in this regard.
the problem that now confronts us is that the district court did not identify the documents that it considered because of the doi failure to satisfy the district court primary standard or its failure to identify the litigation for which the documents were created,or both.our examination of the vaughn index and the lengthy footnote of the district court,d at,leads us to the conclusion,however,that the majority of the documents at issue here were found by the district court because the doi failed to identify the litigation for which the documents were created.as explained,the vaughn index and the keable declarations are of little help in identifying the litigation responsible for their creation the doi admitted as much in its legal opinion and in the corresponding transmittal letter.
as to documents,and,the doi reference to the emergency listing proposal could arguably be deemed to identify the litigation,mainly,the defenders and trout lawsuits.the district court stated that the descriptions of the emergency listing proposal,however,were ambiguous explanations of the contents of the documents and their possible relevance to litigation.we see no reason to disagree.the adlman court emphasized that the because of standard does not protect from disclosure documents that are prepared in the ordinary course of business or that would have been created in essentially similar form irrespective of the litigation.adlman,at citing.b,advisory committee note national union fire ins.murray sheet metal,cir.this is true even if the documents aid in the preparation of litigation.id.
on further review of the vaughn index,we conclude that the references to the emergency listing process are insufficient descriptions to determine whether the documents were created because of the defenders and trout lawsuits,or were prepared in the ordinary course of business or would have been created in essentially similar form irrespective of the litigation.thus,although we conclude that the district court erred in holding that the primary standard is the applicable test,under the circumstances,its resolution of the documents to be released remains unaffected.
finally,the doi argues that the district court erred in concluding that foia does not exempt from disclosure factual material in an otherwise privileged attorney.maine,d at.maine moots the issue by withdrawing its request for those nineteen documents still on appeal that the district court ordered disclosed based on this legal holding.at oral argument,counsel for maine also advised the court that it will make a similar withdrawal with respect to the documents subject to in camera review.therefore,we will vacate that portion of the district court order that held that foia exemption does not encompass factual components of a privileged attorney.medical prof l mut.ins.breon,cir if a judgment is rendered moot during an appeal,either through happenstance or unilateral action by the prevailing party,normally the court dismisses the appeal and orders the judgment vacated.citing united states bancorp mortgage bonner mall,d.
we now consider the privilege.the doi contends that the court either misunderstood the scope of the privilege or applied it very narrowly in finding of the still remaining documents on appeal unprotected by the privilege.this privilege protects confidential communications made by a client to his attorney.in re grand jury subpoena,cir.the privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications recognized by law.weinstein federal evidence,ed.the modern rationale for the privilege is more practical and expansive,promoting full disclosure by clients to their attorneys it enables attorneys to act more effectively,justly,and expeditiously.id.the privilege also protects from disclosure documents provided by an attorney if the party asserting the privilege shows 
that he was or sought to be a client of the attorney 
that the attorney in connection with the document acted as a lawyer that the document relates to facts communicated for the purpose of securing a legal opinion,legal services or assistance in legal proceedings and that the privilege has not been waived.
united states bay state ambulance and hosp.rental,cir quoting united states wilson,cir.
the doi here asserts that the court held certain documents unprotected by the privilege because they did not reveal a confidential communication.this,it submits,is contrary to town of norfolk united states army corps of engineers,cir,which holds that an attorney advice to a client is protected if it relates to a confidential communication.the doi,however,mischaracterizes the district court ruling.the district court held that the doi failed to demonstrate a confidential factual communication and also failed to explain how the withheld legal analysis would reveal any such fact if it existed.maine,d at.
further,relying on town of norfolk,the doi argues that the court erroneous view of the scope of the privilege led the court to reject the privilege for documents at the heart of the exchange of information and advice between the attorney and his client.it points to the attorney advice,the agency proposed actions,comment on and analysis of the lawyers draft pleading,the opposing party pleadings,and discussions of strategy between the lawyer and the client.
the doi arguments are misplaced.in town of norfolk,the court made a finding,absent here,that by the content of the letters,it is clear that they relate to facts communicated for the purpose of securing a legal opinion,legal services or assistance in a legal proceeding.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.here,the doi has failed to explain,or even attempt to explain except in conclusory statements,how t
