in this case,mountain states legal foundation mslf challenges the legality of the creation of the grand national monument in southern utah.because we conclude that mslf lacked standing to bring this claim,we dismiss the appeal.
background 
a.the monument 
on september,in the midst of his campaign,president clinton issued a presidential proclamation establishing the grand national monument the monument,a of approximately million acres of federal land in southern utah.see proclamation.the proclamation described the monument area as a geologic treasure and an outstanding biological resource that includes world class paleontological sites and is rich in human history.id.at.among the items to be protected in the monument are arches and natural bridges remarkable specimens of petrified wood numerous types of e xtremely significant fossils ancient native american rock art and occupation sites trails,inscriptions,and ghost towns from mormon pioneers f ragile cryptobiotic crusts and o ver species of birds,including bald eagles and peregrine falcons.id.at.
the proclamation claimed the authority to establish the monument based on the antiquities act of antiquities act,which provides 
the president of the united states is authorized,in his discretion,to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks,historic and prehistoric structures,and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the government of the united states to be national monuments,and may reserve as a part thereof parcels of land,the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.
antiquities act of,see proclamation.at the president declaration that the monument is set aside by the authority vested in me by section of the antiquities act.
establishment of the monument generated intense criticism,including in some congressional circles.notably,the majority staff of the house committee on resources produced two reports critical of president clinton decision.see behind closed doors the abuse of trust and discretion in the establishment of the grand national monument.comm.print monumental abuse the clinton administration campaign of misinformation in the establishment of the grand national monument.comm.print 
despite these and other criticisms of the monument,since congress has passed several pieces of legislation that relate to the monument.for example,in the automobile national heritage area act,stat,congress modified the boundaries of the monument to exclude certain utah towns and to take in the east clark bench area.id.congress has also appropriated funds both for acquiring mineral rights within the monument,see consolidated appropriations act,app.c,stat,and for construction and the development of programs at the monument.see,at,at,at.
procedural background 
in june,about nine months after the monument was established,the utah association of counties uac and the utah schools and institutional trust lands administration sitla each filed a complaint in utah federal district court asserting that the creation of the monument was illegal.see utah ass of counties bush,d.the appellant in this case,mslf,filed a similar complaint in november id.the complaints named as defendants the president,the united states,and several federal officials and agencies collectively,defendants.the plaintiffs challenged the creation of the monument on numerous grounds,claiming that the antiquities act is unconstitutional because it violates the delegation doctrine in designating the monument,president clinton acted ultra vires and in violation of the property and spending clauses of the united states constitution president clinton violated the antiquities act by failing to designate objects of historic or scientific interest and failing to confine the monument to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected president clinton violated the wilderness act by creating de facto wilderness,a power reserved to congress president clinton violated executive order,which requires that land be withdrawn by the secretary of the interior,not the president and the defendants violated the national environmental policy act,the federal land policy and management act,the federal advisory committee act,and the act in the creation of the monument.see id.at.given the relatedness of the complaints,the actions by uac,sitla,and mslf were soon consolidated however,sitla eventually reached a settlement with defendants and was dismissed as a plaintiff.see id.at the utah schools and land exchange act of,stat.congress ratification of the settlement.in a prior related appeal,we allowed several environmental groups and businesses located near the monument to intervene as defendants in the consolidated action.see utah ass of counties clinton,cir.
in july,defendants filed a motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment,alleging,inter alia,that the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.utah ass of counties,d at.specifically,defendants claimed that the case was not ripe,that the court had no judicial authority to review the president action,and that mslf lacked standing to challenge the monument.id.both remaining plaintiffs uac and mslf opposed defendants motion and filed their own motions for summary judgment.id.
in an april,order,the district court granted summary judgment for defendants and denied the plaintiffs summary judgment motions.id.at.as for defendants claim that mslf lacked standing,the court stated 
the united states concedes that uac has standing,but insists mslf does not given th e relatively light burden to show standing at the present stage of the instant case and recognizing that many of the claims of uac and mslf are identical or similar,and in the interest of judicial economy the court will not further address the standing question in this opinion.while not expressly finding that mslf has standing to sue,the court will address all of the parties claims,including those advanced solely by mslf.
id.at.proceeding to the merits,the district court rejected all of uac and mslf challenges to the creation of the monument.id.at.
mslf timely filed a notice of appeal however,only other remaining not appeal the district court decision.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,mslf asserts both that it had standing to bring its challenge and that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants on the merits of its claims we conclude that mslf lacked standing to bring its action therefore,we need not address its arguments on the merits 
necessity of a standing analysis 
because the defendants conceded below that uac had standing,the district court declined in the interest of judicial economy to address the question of mslf standing.id.at.nevertheless,mslf standing is a critical issue in this appeal because only mslf has appealed the district court decision.
the requirement that a plaintiff have standing is grounded in article iii of the constitution,which restricts federal court adjudication to actual cases or controversies.utah babbitt,cir see also san juan county united states,cir article iii of the constitution limits the power of federal courts to deciding cases and controversies.standing to sue is an aspect of the requirement.quotations,citations omitted.we have noted that s tanding to invoke the power of the federal courts is not a mere technical hoop through which every plaintiff must pass,but rather is a part of the basic charter promulgated by the framers of the constitution.babbitt,at quoting valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d.where,as here,a plaintiff challenges an action of the president,proper evaluation of standing is particularly important.see id.because plaintiffs have invoked article iii jurisdiction to challenge the conduct of the executive branch of government,the necessity of a case or controversy is of particular import.we therefore must address whether mslf had standing to bring its claims against defendants.
