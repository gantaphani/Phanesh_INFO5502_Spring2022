the national association of home builders home builders appeals the district court summary judgment order dismissing its suit against the united states department of the interior interior and its fish and wildlife service fws ass of home builders norton,d nahb.the lawsuit revolves around the fws promulgation of a survey protocol,first in and again in revised form in together,protocols,that provides a methodology for the detection of an endangered subspecies of butterfly in certain areas of southern california.before the district court,home builders asserted violations of the administrative procedure act apa,et,and the endangered species act esa,et,arguing that the fws failed to comply with those statutes notice and comment provisions.the district court dismissed the claims for lack of jurisdiction.nahb,d at.we now affirm.
the esa provides a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved.b.under section four of the esa,the secretary of the interior secretary must promulgate regulations that list species deemed endangered or threatened due to,inter alia,the present or threatened destruction,modification,or curtailment of its habitat or range.id.a a,see also bennett spear,d the secretary is further charged with developing and implementing a recovery plan for the conservation and survival of endangered species and threatened species.id.f.
once a species is designated endangered or threatened,the esa provides a variety of protections,including a prohibition on take of the species.id.a.take is a term uniquely defined by the esa to mean to harass,harm,pursue,hunt,shoot,wound,kill,trap,capture,or collect the listed species.id.following the statutory labyrinth one step deeper,regulations passed pursuant to the esa define harm as used in the definition of take to include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns,including breeding,feeding or sheltering.see also,generally,endangered and threatened wildlife and plants final redefinition of harm.thus,a landowner can effect a take of an endangered species,subjecting himself to liability under the esa,if he alters the habitat of an endangered species in a manner that causes death or injury to a member of the species.the esa establishes civil and criminal penalties for any person who unlawfully takes an endangered species.in addition to more traditional enforcement mechanisms using federal and state personnel,id.e,the esa contains a citizen suit provision that permits a private party to seek injunctive relief against any landowner alleged to be in violation of the esa,id.g a.
section of the esa does permit landowners and other entities to obtain a permit to take a listed species if such taking is incidental to,and not the purpose of,the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity.id.a b.to obtain such a permit,the landowner must demonstrate to the secretary through a documented conservation plan that the owner will,inter alia,minimize the impact of the taking and that the likelihood of the survival and recovery of the species will not be diminished by the taking.id.a b iv.in addition,the esa authorizes the grant of a recovery permit,which enables a researcher to engage in actions for scientific purposes that could result in a taking.id.a a.

home builders,a advocacy group that represents individuals and companies in the residential construction industry,filed suit in federal district court,alleging,inter alia,that the and protocols constituted a rule subject to the notice and comment provisions of the apa.thus,according to home builders,in promulgating the protocols the fws exceeded its authority under the esa by failing to comply with section of the apa and section b of the esa,b incorporating apa notice and comment requirements with respect to any regulation promulgated to carry out the purposes of the esa.com pl.in nahb,the district court dismissed the suit at the summary judgment stage,holding that the protocols did not constitute final agency action and thus the court lacked jurisdiction under sections and of the apa.d at.specifically,the court found that the protocols did not satisfy the finality test established by the united states supreme court in bennett spear,d,because the protocols do not determine rights or obligations of landowners and legal consequences do not flow from them.nahb,d at home builders timely filed this appeal.

home builders asserts three arguments to support its view that the protocols impose legal obligations.it first claims that the protocols are binding on their face.this argument fails to pass muster.the protocols are consistently referred to in agency documents as recommended,rather than mandatory.see,notice of availability.at referring to protocol as recommended in both title and text notice of availability.at same protocol at i,reprinted in at protocol recommended protocol at,reprinted in at protocol surveys recommended.moreover,in a letter from the fws director to several members of the congress,the agency stated that the survey protocol does not contain any prohibitions or restrictions on land development,nor should the protocol be interpreted as such.letter from clark to calvert at.an agency past characterization of its own action,while not decisive,is entitled to respect in a finality analysis.see skidmore swift.agency opinion constitutes body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance see also christensen harris county,d opinion letters entitled to respect under skidmore to the extent those interpretations have the power to persuade internal quotation marks omitted.but appalachian power envt l prot.agency,disregarding boilerplate action language in guidance document.despite some mandatory language in the protocols regarding how the survey should be conducted in order to maximize accuracy and minimize incidental take of the species butterfly surveys may only be conducted by a biologist possessing a current recovery permit,protocol at,reprinted in at,neither the nor the protocol contains any language compelling a landowner to conduct a survey at all.protocol surveys,according to the fws,merely are recommended for all sites partially or completely within survey areas.protocol at,reprinted in at emphasis added.
given the voluntary nature of the language contained in the protocols,it is futile for home builders to argue that the protocols are binding on their face.home builders goes on to argue,however,that the protocols constitute final agency action because in practice they have a coercive effect on both landowners and local governments,in effect compelling compliance with the protocols in order to avoid prosecution for unlawful take of the species.appellant br.at.finality resulting from the practical effect of an ostensibly agency proclamation is a concept we have recognized in the past.see envt l prot.agency,if the language of the document is such that private parties can rely on it as a norm or safe harbor by which to shape their actions,it can be binding as a practical matter mclouth steel prods.thomas,agency action,though facially,created a norm with present day binding effect internal quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,if the practical effect of the agency action is not a certain change in the legal obligations of a party,the action is for the purpose of judicial review.see drg funding sec y of housing and urban,agency order that does not itself adversely affect complainant but only affects his rights adversely on the contingency of future administrative action internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we have held that p ractical consequences,such as the threat of having to defend itself in an administrative hearing should the agency actually decide to pursue enforcement,are insufficient to bring an agency conduct under our purview.indep.equip.dealers ass envt l prot.agency,internal quotation marks omitted.
there is nothing in the record to support home builders claim that the protocols could affect the outcome of an enforcement proceeding.just as compliance with the protocols does not provide a safe harbor from prosecution,at,failure to comply does not change the legal burden placed on the government or on a private party in a citizen suit in a suit for injunctive relief the enforcing party must convince the court that the alleged activity has actually harmed the species or will actually,as opposed to potentially,cause harm to the species.am.bald eagle bhatti,cir.the results of the survey,the decision to conduct a site assessment but not a survey,the failure to perform either,or any other course of action by the landowner would constitute just one piece of the evidence necessary to obtain an injunction.at the time of any enforcement proceeding,the landowner can challenge the soundness of the protocols methodology,pac.gas fed.power comm n,methodology subject to complete attack,and to demonstrate that no take is likely to result from his actions.at t equal employment opportunity comm n,agency guidance has force only to the extent the agency can persuade a court to the same conclusion.moreover,the esa has not brought any enforcement action against a landowner for failing to comply with the protocols.thus,in the absence of any record evidence to the contrary,it appears that the scope of a landowner liability under section nine of the esa remains exactly as it was before the protocols publication a complete prohibition on take of any endangered speci
