we have before us a case that is unusual in several respects.in the first place,defendant was prosecuted,convicted and sentenced under the wild bird conservation act of wild bird act or act,et,a federal statute that includes civil and criminal penalties.there have been very few,if any,previous prosecutions for violations of the act criminal penalties.second,the defendant thomas cullen defendant or appellant,an enigmatic and colorful figure,whose home is in goshen,new york,is an internationally known professional falconer.he was hired at one time by the city of new york to bring bald eagles back to inwood hill park in manhattan.yet,defendant also has a history of questionable activity involving exotic birds.third,defendant was charged with illegally importing black sparrowhawks.judicial opinions often characterize an odd provision of the law or an ingenious argument of counsel as a rare bird rara avis.but in this case we have before us as the subject matter literally a rara avis in terris or a rare bird on the earth.
the rare bird which is the subject of this litigation is the black sparrowhawk.the black sparrowhawk is an african bird that for the most part lives in the southeastern corner of the african continent.its length ranges from to inches it has a black head and black upperparts,white underparts,yellow legs,and a tail.the black sparrowhawk eats mainly other birds mostly doves,although it has been known to devour on occasion small mammals and snakes.it is usually silent and unobtrusive except when it is breeding.for the most part,this bird stays inside the cover of trees,only soaring sometimes in the sky.see gordon lindsay maclean,roberts birds of southern africa ed.
thomas cullen appeals from a judgment of conviction entered february,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york mcmahon,following a jury trial.defendant was convicted of knowingly importing exotic birds into the united states in violation of the wild bird act and of making false statements relating to such importation with the united states fish and wildlife service wildlife service in violation of and.cullen challenges his conviction on the grounds that the wild bird act does not apply to birds the act is unconstitutionally vague because it does not define the term personal pet and the jury instruction given by the trial court was incorrect.because those challenges are all without merit,we affirm.
background 
statutory and regulatory background 
a total of nations including the united states in signed the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora,cites or convention.the convention purpose is to regulate the trade of endangered plants and animals.it contains three appendices that list the species subject to its regulations.over the years the appendices have grown steadily and more than species of animals,including nearly species of birds,are currently listed in one or another of the appendices.see discover cites,last visited july.among the species of birds listed are accipiter melanoleucus,the black sparrowhawk,and falco cherrug,the saker falcon.see checklist of cites species.the black sparrowhawk has been listed since and the saker falcon has been listed since.
to promote the conservation of exotic birds congress passed the wild bird act,which prohibits the importation into the united states of any exotic bird of a species listed in any of cites three appendices.see c.thus,it ordinarily violates the wild bird act to import black sparrowhawks or saker falcons into the united states.violations may carry civil or criminal penalties.the act provides,however,that the secretary of the interior may authorize importation of a species listed in a cites appendix if such importation is not detrimental to the survival of the species,and the bird is being imported exclusively for any of four enumerated purposes.these four purposes are scientific research personally owned pets of a person returning to the united states after being out of the country for at least one year zoological breeding or display programs and certain cooperative breeding programs.id.pursuant to these provisions,the secretary of the interior has promulgated detailed regulations that require a party seeking to import an exotic bird pursuant to one of the exceptions to submit an application to the wildlife service demonstrating compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements.once obtained a permit is neither transferable nor assignable.
defendant cullen actions 
cullen is new york acknowledged expert on birds of prey and an internationally known and respected falconer.david kocieniewski,city eagle expert has past littered with illegal exotic birds,times,at.he claimed he once owned the largest private collection of birds of prey anywhere in this country and,at the time of his trial for violation of the wild bird act,cullen owned birds of prey that he maintained at his home in goshen,new york.
in there was only one living black sparrowhawk in captivity anywhere in north america.it was not owned by defendant.it seems cullen wanted to add black sparrowhawks to his collection of exotic birds,but he could not fit himself within any of the specified exceptions to the act ban on their importation into the united states.that is,he had not been away from the united states for more than a year,so he could not come within the personally owned pet exception he was conducting no scientific research,nor was he involved in zoological breeding or display programs and he was not engaging in cooperative breeding programs under the auspices of an avicultural,conservation,or zoological organization.see.in other words,there was no legal avenue for cullen to follow to add black sparrowhawks from outside the united states to his collection of exotic birds.
joseph and kristen kulak were americans living abroad in england in.they had each been abroad for more than a year.were the kulaks suddenly to decide to buy exotic birds as their personally owned pets,they would each qualify for the wild bird act personal pet exception.it turned out that joseph kulak worked for cullen wife in a large american insurance business with a branch in london.the kulaks had no interest in black sparrowhawks and no background training or experience in handling them.nonetheless,on october,cullen mailed to the wildlife service applications signed by joseph and kristen kulak indicating the kulaks desire to import into the united states three black sparrowhawks as their personally owned pets.defendant also submitted to the wildlife service a receipt of purchase indicating the three sparrowhawks had been sold to the kulaks.according to the applications,two of the birds were joseph kulak pets,while the third was kristen kulak pet.in november the importation permits were granted.
joseph kulak two pet sparrowhawks the third bird,ostensibly kristen kulak pet,died in transit arrived in the united states on january,from the united kingdom.cullen paid the purchase price for the birds that amounted to english pounds sterling apiece.on june,when the birds were sold in england,english pounds sterling was the equivalent of.see exchange rate of pound on june.defendant made and paid for all the travel arrangements for the birds from england to the united states.
upon the birds arrival in this country,cullen went to the airport to pick them up.ann marie holmes,the wildlife service inspector at jfk airport,doubted defendant story that he was just picking up kulak birds on kulak behalf since kulak was,after all,still living in england.as a result of her doubts she refused to turn the birds over to cullen.she quarantined them in a facility run by the department of agriculture where,unfortunately,another one of the birds died.subsequently,the one living sparrowhawk was turned over to the wildlife service pending an investigation into whether or not the bird had been legally imported into the united states.
meanwhile,joseph kulak had submitted an affidavit to the wildlife service reaffirming that the sparrowhawk was his personal pet.thus,in august the sparrowhawk was released to cullen with instructions t
