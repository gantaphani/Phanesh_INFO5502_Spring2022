for forty years,most of the trinity river water has been diverted to the sacramento river basin.congress mandated that some of that water be returned to the trinity river in order to revive its chinook salmon,coho salmon,and steelhead trout populations,which have been decimated by the decades of reduced water flows.california municipal water agencies and power districts plaintiffs challenged the plan to redirect trinity river water,arguing that the procedural requirements of the national environmental policy act,et.nepa,and the endangered species act,et esa,were not met.
ruling on for summary judgment,the district court enjoined parts of the restoration program devised by federal agencies and the hoopa valley tribe hoopa valley,mandated that restoration measures be implemented,and ordered the federal agencies to supplement their environmental impact statement eis to cover issues neglected or inadequately addressed in previous studies.
we affirm in part and reverse in part.we reverse the conclusion that the scope of the eis and the range of alternatives considered therein was unreasonable.we reverse the district court injunctive orders to supplement the eis to address the issues raised on appeal.we affirm the district court ruling that two of the mitigation measures insisted upon by the fish and wildlife service fws and the national marine fisheries service nmfs in their biological opinions exceeded the statutory authority for such opinions.lastly,we reject the three claims raised by plaintiffs on and affirm the remainder of the judgment.
background 
the trinity river originates in northwest california.it runs southward to trinity dam,forming trinity reservoir.south of the dam,it flows miles westward and its waters join those of the klamath river at a confluence miles upstream of the pacific ocean.the trinity river was long known for its abundant fishery resources,which include anadromous species of chinook salmon,coho salmon,and steelhead trout.plentiful runs of these fish sustained hoopa valley and the yurok tribe yurok collectively the tribes from before settlement,as well as numerous canneries in the early twentieth century.
the trinity river division trd is a part of the central valley project cvp,an extensive system of dams,tunnels,canals,and reservoirs that stores and regulates water for california central valley.the cvp supplies two hundred water districts,providing water for about thirty million people,irrigating california most productive agricultural region and generating electricity at nine powerplants.the trd impounds the trinity river initially at trinity dam,behind which water accumulates to form the approximately af trinity reservoir.a second dam at lewiston regulates water releases to the original trinity river.water can also be diverted via the clear creek tunnel to the sacramento river basin.the hydroelectric generators at trinity dam,clear creek dam,and clear creek tunnel supply power to cvp contractors.just south of lewiston dam,the trinity river fish hatchery operates to mitigate the fishery damage caused by the trd.
in,congress authorized the construction of the trd as part of the cvp.studies of the trinity river led congress to the conclusion that surplus water could be diverted to the central valley without harming the fishery of the trinity and klamath rivers.record of decision rod at citing,sess,sess.section of the law ordered the secretary of the interior secretary to take necessary measures to protect the fishery and wildlife resources of the trinity river basin.westlands water dist.dep t of the interior,d,hereinafter order 
construction of the trd was completed in and full operation began in.from to,an average of,about of the river flow,was diverted to the central valley.during the first years of operation,however,diversions were much the first ten years an average of of the river flow,or about was diverted.by the early,the salmonid populations had noticeably declined,and several government bodies were formed specifically to study and address the fishery damage caused by the trd.see trfes at.
the anadromous salmon and steelhead require a varied river environment to support survival and growth in different life stages.salmon and steelhead lay their eggs in the gravel riverbeds of freshwater rivers and tributaries.the eggs incubate in the protected spaces between the riverbed rocks,and fish spend weeks in the gravel interstices before emerging as small,fish.young fish require shallow,water found near gently sloping banks or in backwater areas.later in their juvenile growth,the fish come to prefer the higher velocity water found in the runs and the deeper,cooler pools forming the main parts of a river.depending on the species,juvenile fish may spend months or even years in freshwater before migrating to the ocean.fish wintering in the rivers require habitats with unsedimented gravel and low water velocities.changes in water temperatures,lengths of daylight periods,and flow signal the appropriate times for fish to begin smoltification,the physiological process necessary for surviving in saltwater.full water flows facilitate downmigration to the ocean.the fish grow to full adulthood in the ocean before making their way upriver,sometimes traveling a hundred miles or more to spawn.
before the trd was completed,large water flows from the yearly spring meltoff naturally removed riverside vegetation and maintained a dynamic river channel a meandering,shallow channel free to move and change its course within a generally unvegetated floodplain.the straight parts of the river flowed quickly and kept sediment from settling in the interstices of riverbed gravel riverbends slowed water velocities and created protected pools of still,cool waters.in its natural state,the trinity river provided the varied water temperatures and velocities,the unclogged riverbed gravel,the seasonal flows to assist upriver and downriver migration,and the protection from predators that the salmon and other anadromous fish require.
the trd radically altered the trinity river environment,destroying or degrading river habitats that supported fish populations.the trd dams blocked miles of upstream habitat previously used by salmon and steelhead for spawning and rearing.low water flows imposed what was essentially extreme drought conditions for more than thirty years.without the large spring meltoff flows,heavy vegetation grew on the banks,narrowing the river channels,making the banks steeper,and preventing the river channel from changing shape.water velocities under these conditions became faster and more uniform,with fewer shallow areas adjoining the banks and pools.decreased flows also meant that fine sediment trapped in the spaces between the riverbed rocks was not flushed away,spoiling spawning grounds by decreasing oxygen flows to eggs and trapping young fish.releases from the dams affected water was too hot during the winter months,owing to the lack of flow,and too cold during the summer because water is released from lower,cooler parts of trinity reservoir.unseasonable temperatures signaled the fish to migrate to the ocean at the wrong times,or failed to trigger smoltification.
a fws study determined that an annual flow regime of would be necessary to rehabilitate and support a healthy habitat for natural fishery production in the trinity river.trfes at.in,the fws estimated that the trinity river fish population suffered a reduction of to,and fishery habitat loss of to.rod at.the secretary subsequently directed fws to complete a flow evaluation study assessing habitat restoration efforts and making recommendations for further measures.id.
in response to the steadily deteriorating condition of the trinity river,congress passed a series of laws to speed its restoration the trinity river basin fish and wildlife management act the act directed the secretary to implement a fish and wildlife management program in order to achieve the goal of restoring fish and wildlife populations in the trinity river basin to a level approximating that which existed immediately before the start of the construction of the trinity river division,stat.
the central valley project improvement act cvpia,stat,confirmed congress commitment to restoring and protecting the fish and wildlife habitats of the central valley and trinity river basins.the cvpia ordered that the trfes,initiated by the secretary in,be completed by september.cvpia b a.implementation of the trfes flow recommendations would begin once the secretary and hoopa valley concurred in the recommendations.id.at b b.congress set a minimum flow release from trinity dam at pending completion and implementation of the trfes flow recommendations.id.at b.
the fws and hoopa valley collaborated in writing the trfes.the completed study,released in june,recommended a comprehensive strategy to rehabilitate the trinity river and recreate an environment resembling the natural habitat.this required increased flows of varying volumes to maintain a river environment that would support different salmon and steelhead trout life stages and encourage natural fish with the proper riverbed shape,vegetation growth,water velocities,water temperatures,and gravel unclogged by sand and fine sediment.the trfes recommended a permanent increase of flows depending on the class,ranging from in critically dry years to in extremely wet years trfes at.under the trfes flow regime,water would be released at different rates during the course of the year to replicate the large water flows caused by the spring melt and naturally low flows during the summer and winter months.trfes at.the trfes also recommended the use of measures,such as the mechanical removal of vegetation on the banks,the reshaping of the riverbed and banks,and the placement of appropriately sized gravel,to promote and sustain natural salmonid production.id.at.
nepa requires that federal agencies analyze the environmental effects of proposed actions,publish the results of their study in the form of a draft eis,and receive and respond to public comments.compliance with california environmental laws also requires an environmental review the department of the interior interior initiated an environmental impact report eir concurrently with the eis to comply with the california environmental quality act,cal.pub.et.
in october,a team of federal,state,and tribal officials released a draft deis the deis considered alternatives for restoring the trinity river fishery and evaluated their environmental consequences,ultimately recommending that the trfes plan be carried out.in october,the nmfs and fws issued formal biological opinions bioops recognizing the potential effects on area fisheries and discussing reasonable and prudent measures rpms to minimize or avoid harmful effects.the agencies issued a final feis in november.
hoopa valley concurred in the trfes recommendations and the department of the interior issued a record of decision rod on december,ordering the implementation of the alternative recommended in the feis.
procedural history 
this suit commenced in december,when westlands water district westlands filed suit against interior,other federal agencies,and various federal officials alleging violations of the esa and nepa.after bruce babbitt,secretary of the interior,and hoopa valley signed the rod,westlands,this time joined by the san luis and water authority and the san benito county water district collectively,the water agencies,filed an amended complaint.yurok intervened as a defendant,and the northern california power agency ncpa and the sacramento municipal utility district smud intervened as plaintiffs.
in march,the district court issued a preliminary injunction limiting flow releases to but otherwise allowing for the implementation of the rod restoration plan.in march,the district court granted the tribes motion to modify the preliminary injunction to allow for increased releases,authorizing the release of af for the water year.the court also vacated the stay and moved the case forward for disposition on the merits.
subsequently,all parties filed for summary judgment.the district court order held that nepa applied to the implementation of the trfes flow recommendations,and that the eis team improperly narrowed the statement of purpose and need and failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives in its study.the district court ordered interior and hoopa valley to submit a supplemental eis seis to address further alternatives and to discuss certain mitigation measures suggested in the nmfs and fws bioops.additionally,the district court set aside one provision in each of the bioops.all measures of the rod were ordered implemented.order,d at.this appeal followed.
on april,the district court filed a second memorandum decision and order,granting the government motion to extend the deadline for completing the seis to july.see generally order ii.the court also granted hoopa valley motion to modify the injunction to allow for additional releases of up to af for the water year.order ii at.in april of this year,this court granted hoopa valley motion to stay the injunction,permitting the release of af for the year,the flow level appropriate for a normal water year.

nepa does not mandate particular results,but simply describes the necessary process that an agency must follow in issuing an eis.robertson methow valley citizens council,d.a court must avoid passing judgment on the substance of an agency decision.its focus must be on ensuring that agencies took a hard look at the environmental consequences of their decisions.id.at.in other words,a reviewing court must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.this inquiry must be searching and careful,but the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one.morongo,at quoting marsh or.natural res.council,d.
ii.reasonable range of alternatives 
the regulations implementing nepa require that an eis must consider and assess the environmental consequences of the proposed action and reasonable alternatives to the action.consideration of alternatives is the heart of the environmental impact statement.id.an agency preparing an eis must specify the underlying purpose and need for the proposed action.city of dep t of,cir,provides courts with a framework for analyzing the range of alternatives discussed by an eis.the stated goal of a project necessarily dictates the range of reasonable alternatives and an agency can not define its objectives in unreasonably narrow terms.id.at citing citizens against burlington,busey.project alternatives derive from an eis purpose and need section.id.thus,a court begins by determining whether or not the purpose and need statement was reasonable.see also friends of southeast future morrison,cir.
eis statement of purpose and need 
in its decision and order on the parties for summary judgment,the district court found that the eis preparers improperly narrowed the geographic scope of the eis statement of purpose and need the only issue the federal agencies raise on appeal is this characterization of the statement of purpose and need as improperly narrow in its geographic scope.
legal standard 
courts have afforded agencies considerable discretion to define the purpose and need of a project.id.at citing city of angoon hodel,cir.preparing an eis necessarily calls for judgment,and that judgment is the agency.lathan brinegar,cir.however,this discretion is not unlimited.id.courts evaluate a statement of purpose and need under a reasonableness standard.friends of southeast,at.where an action is taken pursuant to a specific statute,the statutory objectives of the project serve as a guide by which to determine the reasonableness of objectives outlined in an eis.city of new york united states dep t of,cir.
whether the statement of purpose and need was unreasonably narrow in geographically limiting the scope of the eis 
the statement of purpose and need reads,in full 
the purpose of the proposed action is to restore and maintain the natural production of anadromous fish on the trinity river mainstem downstream of lewiston dam.
the need for this action results from congress mandate that diversions of water from the trinity river to the cvp not be detrimental to trinity river fish and wildlife resources finding that construction and operation of the trd has contributed to detrimental effects to habitat and has resulted in drastic reductions in anadromous fish populations finding that restoration of depleted stocks of naturally produced anadromous fish is critical to the dependent tribal,commercial,and sport fisheries and confirmation of the federal trust responsibility to protect tribal fishery resources affected by the trd.
the legislation directing the restoration of trinity river fishery is not limited to the mainstem.the act directs federal agencies to restore the anadromous fish populations of the entire trinity river basin,including the tributaries of such river below lewiston dam and the south fork of such river.a b.the cvpia explicitly incorporates these directives,contemplating that enactment of its terms would benefit all parts of the trinity river below lewiston dam.cvpia b directing an instream release of water to meet the fishery restoration goals of the act of october,public law.
in specifically limiting its goals to the trinity river mainstem,the statement of purpose and need does not follow the letter of the statutes.however,this does not make the statement of purpose and need arbitrary or capricious so as to invalidate it under nepa.carmel,at.restoring the fishery in the mainstem is a central,primary part of restoring the fishery in the basin as a whole.second declaration of robert franklin re water year while use of tributary habitat has been documented,the vast majority of production occurs in the mainstem.the federal agencies were within their discretion in focusing the eis on mainstem rehabilitation as a part of promoting fishery.
whether the statement of purpose and need was unreasonably narrow so as to limit consideration of measures 
the district court holding about the geographic scope of the statement of purpose and need misses plaintiffs more relevant objection.in their response letters to the deis and their appellate briefs,plaintiffs indicate that their objection to the eis statement of purpose and need is that it is biased with the sole objective to increase flows to the exclusion of measures,as well as that it ignored other federal obligations.feis response to letter from ncpa at feis response to letter from smud at.
the proper inquiry is framed earlier in the district court order the ultimate nepa issue centers on whether the intentional narrowing of the eis purpose to concentrate on increased water flows and channel rehabilitation prevented the and the court from assessing the utility of a variable flow alternative that uses measures order,d at.because the statement of purpose and need does not improperly foreclose consideration of any possible restoration measures,we reverse any part of the district court order disapproving of the statement.
first,nothing about the language of the statement of purpose and need limits consideration of measures.second,the focus on habitat as the best way to restore naturally producing salmon and steelhead was well within the discretion of the eis team and was not arbitrary or capricious.carmel,at.the cvpia give s first priority to measures which protect and restore natural channel and riparian habitat values.b a.the amendments to the act state that the trinity river hatchery should be managed to best serve its purpose of mitigation of fish habitat loss above lewiston dam,while not impairing efforts to restore and maintain naturally reproducing anadromous fish stocks within the basin.c,stat.
the water agencies point to correspondence in the record to support their argument that the agencies improperly avoided consideration of the restoration measures by unduly narrowing the scope of the statement of purpose and need.the lead agencies properly determined that the discretion given to eis authors allowed for a purpose that focused on the instream habitat as the best way to help natural fishery production,with less attention given to o ther factors such as hatcheries,harvest,predation and upland sediment control.
third,as discussed below,measures were considered.the alternatives considered all have measure components.the trfes,eis,and rod included thorough discussions of measures that,complementing flow minimums,would improve the river habitat.the fact that flow was a major part of the eis alternatives was a reflection of congress mandate that interior set permanent instream fishery flow requirements.cvpia b a.
the statement of purpose and need reasonably defined the objectives of the project the preparers did not arbitrarily or capriciously narrow the scope of the statement.
eis range of alternatives 
legal standard 
an agency issuing an eis must r igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives,i nclude reasonable alternatives not within the jurisdiction of the lead agency,and i dentify the agency preferred alternative.a,c,e.the existence of a viable but unexamined alternative renders an environmental impact statement inadequate.morongo,at internal quotations and citations omitted.
we review an eis range of alternatives under the rule of reason.carmel,at.under the rule of reason,the eis need not consider an infinite range of alternatives,only reasonable or feasible ones.id.citing a c.nor is an agency required to undertake a separate analysis of alternatives which are not significantly distinguishable from alternatives actually considered,or which have substantially similar consequences.headwaters,bureau of land,cir citing plains res.council lujan,cir.
the choice of alternatives is bounded by some notion of feasibility and an agency is not required to consider remote and speculative alternatives.yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,d.the range of alternatives that must be considered in the eis need not extend beyond those reasonably related to the purposes of the project.laguna greenbelt,dep t of,cir citing city of angoon,at see also headwaters,at an agency is not required to consider alternatives which are infeasible,ineffective,or inconsistent with the basic policy objectives for the management of the area.the touchstone for our inquiry is whether an eis selection and discussion of alternatives fosters informed and informed public participation.block,cir.
alternatives considered 
the eis fully analyzed six proposed alternatives the maximum flow alternative,the flow evaluation alternative,the percent inflow alternative,the mechanical restoration alternative,the no action alternative,and the state permit alternative.the first four were determined reasonably to meet the purposes and needs of the project.
the main difference between the six reasonable alternatives is the volume of yearly instream flow to the trinity river.in addition,all of the alternatives incorporate habitat rehabilitation and fishery management measures to aid the recovery of the trinity river fishery.the district court ordered that all measures be implemented.d at.
the no action alternative maintains the status quo,leaving instream flow to the trinity river at the level prescribed by cvpia b.water operations,or diversions to the sacramento river via the clear creek tunnel and whiskeytown reservoir,would continue to operate under existing water quality standards,biological opinions,and policies governing exports to the sacramento river.current watershed protection programs,including land management,road decommissioning and rehabilitation and erosion control measures,as well as the acquisition of key parcels of land in the trinity river basin,would continue.habitat management,including channel rehabilitation projects the mechanical placement of spawning gravel,and the dredging of sediment control ponds would also continue.deis.fish population management,consisting of harvesting limitations and hatchery production levels,would rely on current policies 
the state permit alternative reduces flows to af year,the flow level set by congress in as the minimum release to the trinity river.under this alternative,more water would be diverted to the sacramento river,and no habitat management would occur except for gravel placement.current watershed protection and fish population management policies would continue.
the mechanical restoration alternative,like the no action alternative,maintains instream flow levels at af year,but would incorporate significant additional watershed protection measures to limit sediment inputs into the mainstem trinity river.the mechanical restoration alternative would focus on and accelerate the road decommissioning,road maintenance,and road rehabilitation measures proposed under the no action alternative.in addition to the habitat rehabilitation sites currently in existence,the mechanical restoration alternative contemplates removing riverbank vegetation and mechanically maintaining natural floodplain features at locations.
the percent inflow alternative bases weekly releases on the previous week inflow into trinity percent of the inflow would be released to the mainstem.yearly releases would range between in critically dry years to in extremely wet years.like the mechanical restoration alternative,new habitat rehabilitation sites would be constructed,but these and existing rehabilitation projects would not be mechanically maintained.instead,the sites would depend on water flow alone to sustain the riverbed habitat.fish population management would be the same as in the no action alternative.
the flow evaluation alternative is based on recommendations made by the fws and hoopa valley in the trfes.yearly flows would range between in critically dry years to in extremely wet years.all other efforts would be the same as in the percent inflow alternative.the flow evaluation alternative also includes an adaptive management program,a systematic program of continually monitoring the river habitat,reviewing the effectiveness of restoration measures,and updating management actions.
the maximum flow alternative would release all of the trinity reservoir inflows into trinity river.flows would range from in critically dry years to in extremely wet years.because the amount of flow would,on its own,rehabilitate and maintain the river environment,current habitat rehabilitation projects would not be mechanically maintained and no new projects would be constructed.fish population measures currently in place would continue.
in addition to these fully considered alternatives,the eis briefly considered and rejected eight alternatives the removal of trinity and lewiston dams fishery rehabilitation solely through harvest management construction of fish ladders,or fish passages around the dams trucking fish around the dams predator control increased hatchery production increasing the flexibility of trinity dam operation by pumping water from the sacramento river to trinity reservoir and increasing flows to trinity river below douglas city by redirecting water from a trinity river fork upstream of the reservoir.
whether the range of alternatives considered was reasonable 
the plaintiff water agencies argue that the alternatives considered were inadequate because they failed to consider flow options along with other measures,such as watershed protection measures and an adaptive management program.this contention is unsupported by the record.measures,including watershed protection,habitat rehabilitation,and population management via harvest limitations and hatchery operations,are a part of each alternative considered.
the water agencies further argue that the eis failed to consider ways of integrating alternatives that would allow for reduced flow volumes.this argument also fails.the mechanical restoration alternative contemplates exactly what the water agencies argue was missing in the eis aggressive measures that would rehabilitate and maintain a healthy river habitat while relying on the minimum flow level set by congress in the cvpia.the percent inflow alternative and the flow evaluation alternative both incorporate existing and new measures into an analysis which allow for flows that vary from year to year but are far below trinity river inflows to the reservoir.
the record shows that the eis team considered and directly responded to suggestions that measures be augmented to allow corresponding decreases in instream flow.feis thematic response alternatives recommended by commentators additional mechanical restoration and alternative flow schedules at.the feis includes a direct response to smud suggested integrated management alternative.id.at.although the water agencies argue that the eis fails to consider integrating hatchery management and predator control as a part of restoration,the eis clearly considers increased hatchery production.deis.the eis team also responded to commentators who urged predator control as a measure.feis thematic response role of the trinity river hatchery at feis thematic response predator control as a means for increasing population at.the eis dismisses these means,concluding that they would not help with natural salmonid production,a valid and central focus of the restoration plan.see cvpia a directing interior to develop a plan to ensure the natural production of anadromous fish in central valley rivers.
the district court erred in holding that the range of alternatives was unreasonable under nepa.the district court held that although interior could reject certain measures as solutions to restoration,the eis still failed to satisfy nepa by not considering certain measures as integrated parts of a restoration plan.this holding fails to give interior the discretion due agencies under nepa.deference to an agency technical expertise and experience is particularly warranted with respect to questions involving scientific matters.united states alpine land and reservoir,cir.here,the eis team determined that certain measures,such as increased hatchery production,would be ineffective or even detrimental to the goal of restoring a naturally producing salmonid population.deis.it found that lower flow alternatives that relied more heavily on measures could not sustain a river habitat.feis at.achieving a sustainable natural river habitat was an appropriate goal and the first priority of the trfes.cvpia b a.i t would turn nepa on its head to interpret the statute to require that an agency conduct analyses of alternatives that are inconsistent with the agency policy objectives.kootenai tribe veneman,cir.
the district court also found fault in the eis failure to consider more alternatives with reduced flow.order,d at.the district court determined that although the eis purported to have fully analyzed six alternatives,in actuality,it only considered three the maximum flow alternative all inflows released the flow evaluation alternative alternative and the mechanical restoration alternative minimum flow release.id.the court concluded that the range of alternatives included only two extreme endpoints and one alternative,which the selection.id.
the fact that the mechanical restoration alternative used the minimum flow dictated by the cvpia did not make it an unrealistic alternative.the no action alternative was also realistic,although the eis team ultimately determined it was lacking.the flow evaluation and percent inflow alternatives presented two alternatives.the fact that the eis did not consider other alternatives,such as the integrated management plan,proposed by the water agencies,does not make the range of alternatives unreasonable.the feis responded to the integrated management plan and the eis is not deficient because the eis team did not fully analyze the smud proposed plan with its specific combination of flow and measures.
the eis was not required to consider more alternatives to comply with nepa.nepa does not require the eis to have considered every conceivable permutation of flow and measures.see.yankee,at.common sense also teaches us that the detailed statement of alternatives can not be found wanting simply because the agency failed to include every alternative device thought and conceivable by the mind of man.headwaters,at stating that an agency need not undertake a separate analysis of alternatives which are not significantly distinguishable from alternatives actually considered,or which have substantially similar consequences citing plains,at.
the touchstone for courts reviewing challenges to an eis under nepa is whether an eis selection and discussion of alternatives fosters informed and informed public participation.block,at citing save lake frank,cir.here,there was a thorough public debate about many different flow and combinations.commentators posited alternatives that incorporated more measures so as to lower instream flows,and the eis team responded.
we reverse the district court holding that the range of alternatives considered in the eis is unreasonable.the construction of the statement of purpose and need was reasonable in light of the governing statutes.the range of alternatives considered achieved the goals intended by nepa open,thorough public discussion promoting informed.the eis considered several realistic,reasonable options before settling on the preferred alternative.its review of alternatives satisfies the rule of reason.
iii.supplemental eis 
the district court ordered the eis team to issue an seis on the grounds that measures suggested to mitigate the environmental impact of the preferred alternative did not receive the public vetting demanded by nepa.hoopa valley challenges this order specifically in regard to certain rpms in the nmfs and fws bioops and the preferred alternative impact on california power system reliability.hoopa valley argues that the issues in question were sufficiently explored in the deis and that no significantly new circumstances or information emerged after deis publication to compel the issuance of an seis.
we reverse the district court holding as to the nmfs bioop concerning the use of auxiliary bypass outlets to mitigate the preferred alternative impact on sacramento river temperatures,as well as the holding demanding further discussion of the california energy crisis for the reasons stated below.because we affirm the district court holding setting aside the fws bioop rpm,see infra at section,there is no need to discuss this rpm inclusion in an seis.as a result,no seis is required for any of these issues.
legal standard 
nepa requirements are intended to serve two broad goals.first,congress intended that an agency,in reaching its decision,will have available,and will carefully consider,detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts.robertson,at.second,the publication of the eis informs the public of potential environmental impacts and provides a springboard for public comment.id.
to meet these goals,an eis must include a detailed discussion of possible mitigation measures.id.at.f,h.an agency must discuss mitigation measures in sufficient detail to ensure that environmental consequences have been fairly evaluated a mere listing is insufficient.neighbors of cuddy mountain united states forest,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.doing so helps to ensure that the agency has taken a hard look at the environmental consequences of its proposed action.robertson,at.however,an agency is not required to formulate and adopt a complete mitigation plan.id.
when new information emerges after the circulation and public comment period of the deis,it may be validly included in the feis without recirculation.an agency need not supplement an eis every time new information comes to light after the eis is finalized.marsh,at.supplemental eiss are required when t here are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.c ii.an seis is required if a new proposal will have a significant impact on the environment in a manner not previously evaluated and considered.trenton residents against fed.highway,cir.an agency decision not to issue a seis is reviewed under an arbitrary and capricious standard.friends of the clearwater dombeck,cir.
nmfs bioop rpm 
we reverse the district court holding as to the nmfs bioop rpm concerning the use of auxiliary bypass outlets to mitigate the preferred alternative impact on sacramento river temperatures.
the esa was enacted to prevent the extinction of fish,wildlife,and plant species.turtle island,at.the responsibility for administering and enforcing the esa falls to the nmfs for marine life and the fws for terrestrial life.id.at.the esa provides that a federal agency must consult with the fws or nmfs to ensure that any proposed action is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species.a.
after consultation,the fws or nmfs issues a bioop,and if it concludes that the proposed action is not likely to jeopardize an endangered species but will possibly result in the incidental taking of individuals of that species,the bioop must include an analysis of the impact of such incidental taking and reasonable and prudent measures that the secretary considers necessary or appropriate to minimize any impact the action may have.b c i,ii.
here,the fws and nmfs issued bioops with rpms.interior determined that the rpms did not present significant new information or circumstances requiring an seis and recirculation.feis thematic response requests for recirculation at.however,the ncpa points to evidence in the record that interior was aware that the bioops proposed significant changes that would require recirculation of the eis.the tribes do not contest this evidence in their briefs.
nmfs bioop rpm 
the nmfs rpm requires the bureau of reclamation and fws to work with the upper sacramento river temperature task group to develop temperature control plans that provide for compliance with temperature objectives in both the trinity and sacramento rivers.the rpm states that interior must be prepared to use the auxiliary bypass outlets on trinity dam to reduce sacramento river temperatures as needed.the district court held that the deis failed to analyze the impact of the rpm on power generation,and that the feis provided insufficient analysis of the new,significant changes demanded by the rpm.order,d at.plaintiffs argue that this holding must be affirmed.
the rpm does not present a significant new circumstance that required recirculation of the eis.the use of the auxiliary bypass outlets has always been an option for dealing with temperature fluxes in the rivers.the feis notes that reclamation has used the auxiliary bypasses in the past when needed to protect trinity river and sacramento river fisheries from adverse water temperatures.feis thematic response powerplant bypass at.
even if the rpm did present a new circumstance,the eis considered both the temperature and power generation impacts of using the auxiliary bypass outlets.the deis discusses the effect of the alternatives on sacramento river temperature and the possibility of using the trinity dam auxiliary bypass outlets.it suggests the specific mitigation measure suggested by the rpm using the auxiliary bypass outlets as an intervention tool to keep sacramento river temperatures at an appropriate level.deis.the impact of the preferred alternative on the sacramento river temperatures and fishery is discussed in deis sections and.deis deis.the feis concludes that auxiliary bypass use will not have a significant effect on sacramento river temperatures or chinook salmon mortality.
