introduction 
in these consolidated california environmental quality act ceqa actions,several plaintiffs,including plaintiffs and appellants highland springs conference and training center highland springs and banning bench community of interest association banning bench successfully challenged the certification by defendant and respondent,city of banning the city,of an environmental impact report eir for a acre real estate development project known as the black bench project.pub.resources code,et in their writ petitions,filed in november,highland springs and banning bench named bench,llc,dba suncal companies,as the only real party in interest.pub.resources code.
appealed the april judgments entered in favor of plaintiffs on their writ petitions,but its appeal was dismissed in september after it failed to deposit the costs of preparing the record on appeal.cal.rules of court,rule.by that time,was in default on two purchase money loans for the black bench property,and by the end of lost the property in foreclosure.
in august,highland springs and banning bench,along with two other plaintiffs,jointly moved to recover their attorney fees and costs incurred in the ceqa litigation from.in october,the trial court awarded the moving plaintiffs over million in attorney fees and costs.code civ.did not oppose the motion.in october,the four plaintiffs,including highland springs and banning bench,jointly moved to amend the judgments to add scc acquisitions,scca as an additional judgment debtor,and make scca liable for paying the attorney fees and costs awards.the plaintiffs claimed that scca was the alter ego of,it would be unjust not to hold scca liable for paying the attorney fees and costs awards,and plaintiffs did not discover until that had been dissolved in.
following initial and supplemental briefing,three hearings,and several rounds of evidentiary submissions,the trial court,relying on alexander abbey of the chimes d,alexander,denied the motion to amend the judgments on the sole basis that plaintiffs failed to act with due diligence in bringing the motion.the court reasoned plaintiffs knew,or reasonably should have known,of scca alleged alter ego relationship to long before plaintiffs moved to amend the judgments in october.still,the court indicated the equities favored granting the motion and the court likely would have granted it had it been filed earlier.
in this appeal,highland springs and banning bench claim the motion to amend their judgments was erroneously denied.they claim scca failed to demonstrate that it was prejudiced by plaintiffs over delay in filing the motion they presented ample evidence that scca controlled the ceqa litigation against scca was the alter ego of,and it would be unjust not to hold scca liable for paying their attorney fees and costs awards against.
we agree the motion to amend was erroneously denied based solely on plaintiffs delay in filing the motion,because scca made an insufficient evidentiary showing that it was prejudiced by the delay.scca did not meet its burden of proving the motion was barred by laches.miller eisenhower medical center cal d,miller.we therefore reverse the order denying the motion and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.on remand,the trial court must determine whether the judgments in favor of highland springs and banning bench should be amended to add scca as an additional judgment debtor.
ii.background 
a.the ceqa litigation and the attorney fees and costs awards 
in,the city certified an eir,approved a general plan amendment and a specific plan,and took other actions in approving the development of an approximate acre property known as the black bench ranch,located in the city and just south of the san bernardino national forest.in november,highland springs,banning bench,and three other plaintiffs filed four separate ceqa actions challenging the city certification of the eir and other project approvals.the actions were later consolidated,apparently for all purposes.
in april,the trial court issued judgments and peremptory writs of mandate,setting aside and vacating the city certification of the eir and related project approvals.as noted,appealed,but its appeal was dismissed in september after it failed to deposit the costs of preparing the record on appeal.cal.rules of court,rule.the remittitur in appeal was issued in november.
meanwhile,in august,highland springs,banning bench,and two of the three other plaintiffs,namely the two cherry valley entities filed motions to recover,solely from,their attorney fees and costs incurred in challenging the eir and related project approvals.did not oppose the motion,and the city joined the motion.
by september,it was apparent to all of the parties to the ceqa litigation that was having financial difficulties.in a notice of nonopposition to the attorney fees motions,filed in september,the city represented that,while the city was engaged in discussions with to resolve the matter of contractual obligation to reimburse the city for the city attorney fees and costs incurred in the ceqa litigation,i t became readily apparent that the real party was in financial distress.real party defaulted on both its loans for the property where the proposed project was to be built,and on its agreement to defend and indemnify the city in this litigation.italics added.the city explained it was supporting plaintiffs motion for attorney fees and costs because a settlement agreement between the city and plaintiffs allowed the city to be reimbursed by banning bench for certain attorney fees and costs the city paid to banning bench,providing that banning bench was able to recover those amounts from.
in october,the trial court awarded in attorney fees to the four moving plaintiffs and against highland springs was awarded banning bench was awarded and the two cherry valley entities were awarded.
b.the motion to amend the judgments 
in october,highland springs,banning bench,and the two cherry valley entities moved to add scca to the judgments as an additional judgment debtor and render scca liable for paying their attorney fees and costs awards.by october,no part of the awards had been paid.the trial court denied the motion and later denied plaintiffs motion for a new trial.only highland springs and banning bench appealed,subd.a.
in their motion to amend,plaintiffs claimed scca was the alter ego of and it would be unjust not to hold scca liable for paying plaintiffs attorney fees and costs awards.plaintiffs presented evidence that both scca and conducted business under the names suncal and the suncal companies,in connection with procuring the black bench property,obtaining the project approvals,and in the ceqa litigation.plaintiffs adduced a fictitious business name statement,recorded in orange county on june,showing that scc acquisitions,or scca,conducted business as suncal companies,and claimed that r eview of documents regarding the history of the project showed that suncal was the entity that applied to the city to develop the property suncal was identified as the property owner in the city notice of scoping meeting preceding the city preparation of the eir and reports prepared for the eir were prepared for suncal,not.
plaintiffs also adduced letters and correspondence indicating that suncal or scca was involved in negotiating the project approvals with the city and in attempting to settle the matter of plaintiffs attorney fees claims and awards.for example,in september,edward casey,counsel for scca and the attorney of record in the ceqa litigation for,wrote a letter to the city,on behalf of the suncal companies suncal,whom casey identified as the project applicant for the black bench specific plan,urging the city council to approve the project.plaintiffs presented additional evidence that and scca had the same chief executive officer,agent for service of process,and principal executive office.over other business entities,many with scc in their names,also had the same office address and agent for service of process as scca and.
plaintiffs argued that common representatives of scca and,including casey,misled them concerning which of the two entities was the project applicant and real party in interest in the ceqa litigation.pub.resources code,subd.a.plaintiffs claimed they intended to name scca as a real party in interest in their november writ petitions,along with,but did not do so because counsel for scca and,casey,confirmed in a november,to counsel for highland springs,jan chatten brown,that suncal which plaintiffs understood to mean scca held no interest in the black bench property.plaintiffs claimed casey representation was false,in part because scca,not,was the party with whom the city and plaintiffs believed they were dealing in connection with the black bench project approvals.plaintiffs submitted that,had they known when they filed their writ petitions in november,that scca owned to percent of a fact not disclosed by scca until one of the hearings on the motion to amend the judgments they would have named scca as a real party in interest in their petitions.
scca opposition 
in opposing the motion,scca denied it was the alter ego of and claimed was formed and kept as a separate entity,with its own assets,its own bank accounts,and its own accounting.all corporate formalities were followed,and was not undercapitalized.scca did not dispute that its representatives used the names suncal and suncal companies interchangeably,and to refer to scca,and other suncal entities.scca was one of the parent companies of many suncal entities,and for this reason conducted business under the fictitious business name suncal companies.suncal was not a legal entity,but,like coca cola and mcdonald,was a brand name for a business that operate d through multiple legal entities,and a lmost all,if not all,real estate developers and home builders operate d in the same manner.
scca explained that single purpose entit ies,like,were commonly used in the real estate development industry.suncal practice had been to hold and own property in a variety of wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries and joint ventures with equity and debt capital provided by institutional investors,including at one time lehman brothers lehman scca would enter into purchase contracts with property sellers,or take an assignment of a purchase contract already in place,then assign its purchase rights to a newly formed single purpose entity in which scca typically had an indirect ownership interest,at times no more than.the property would then be purchased by the newly formed single purpose entity,and the development is then owned,operated and pursued by such entity.the reasons for such practices and structure included limiting liability with respect to a real estate development to that specific development,as is common in the real estate industry,and satisfying the requirements of capital partners and lending sources that will not invest in or lend to projects unless the ownership of the project is held by what is termed as a single purpose entity,as such financing sources demand that any such entity have no liability with respect to any other projects.
the black bench property was acquired in four separate transactions with four property owners,and scca either entered into contracts with the property owners or acquired the rights to purchase the property from unrelated third parties.after forming,scca assigned its rights to purchase the black bench property to,which then took title to the entire property.the acquisition of the property was financed through seller financing and equity contributions from immediate member not scca,which member was formed as a vehicle through which various projects,including the black bench project,were financed.during one of the hearings on the motion to amend the judgments,counsel for scca revealed that scca owned to percent of.
after acquired the black bench property,the development work was performed under a contract between and suncal management,llc.as its name suggested,suncal management,llc was affiliated with the suncal organization,and had the necessary personnel and business infrastructure to perform such development.this was routine and customary in the real estate development industry,having no employees,could not have performed such development services by itself.
still,a ll contracts for entitlement and development services for the black bench property were entered into by,not scca or suncal management,llc.paid all amounts owing under such contracts from its own bank accounts,using its own funds.also paid its attorneys to defend the ceqa litigation from its own funds,using its own bank accounts.
spent over million of its own funds to entitle and develop the black bench property,all of such funds being equity contributions from its member.this member changed over the life of the p roject due to changes in financing arrangements.the member received loan proceeds,either directly or indirectly,from lenders to finance various projects,which proceeds were then contributed as capital to the single purpose entities that owned those projects,one of which was bench.
scca also pointed out that the ceqa litigation was filed in november,and during the next two years,the housing market in the united states generally,and in banning in particular,completely collapsed.was left with a partially entitled p roject that was worth substantially less than what it had paid to acquire and entitle the p roject.despite the millions of dollars that bench had invested in the p roperty,due to the collapse of the real estate market,the seller financing went into default and the p roject was foreclosed on in.as a result,bench lost its entire investment in the p roject.
scca argued it would be inequitable and would violate its due process rights to impose alter ego liability on it and hold it responsible for plaintiffs attorney fees and costs awards against.perhaps more importantly,scca claimed,it was not given the opportunity to defend the alter ego claim during the ceqa litigation.scca maintained that,a t the very least,if scca were named as a defendant in the original action six years ago,documents would have been more readily available and memories would have been fresh in the minds of witnesses.scca did not indicate that any documents,witness testimony,or other evidence had been lost or was no longer available.
additional briefing and evidence 
the motion to amend came was heard on december,but the hearing was continued to march,then to november.the second continuance was granted in order to allow the parties to pursue discovery and present additional and rebuttal evidence.before the continued hearings,plaintiffs and scca each filed supplemental briefs and submitted additional evidence.
e.the court ruling on the motion to amend 
in a ruling issued on january,the court,relying on alexander,denied the motion to amend based solely on plaintiffs delay or lack of due diligence in bringing the motion.the court explained the motion was filed more than four years after issuance of the orders imposing attorney fees,and almost six years after the commencement of the action.alexander,supra,d.while plaintiffs may have been misled at the start of the litigation,there is in sufficient evidence to justify such a long delay.they should have discovered the relevant facts long ago.the court also noted that,though scca did not expressly argue lack of due diligence or prejudice in its opposition brief,it discussed the same issue in two paragraphs of its original opposition brief under the heading due process.
the court next observed that absent the delay this court would likely have granted the motion.edward casey of november,indeed appears to be misleading,though the court can not tell whether he intended to mislead anyone.further,although million is a substantial sum,it appears to represent undercapitalization for a project of this size.one can easily infer from the administrative record that the overall value of the completed project would have been in the range of million.most of the other points made by plaintiffs have merit as well,and of course it was elucidating to learn at the hearing that the interest of scca in bench was,not the that was implied by the opposition brief.the opposition paperwork talks about the business habits of major developers,and the many entities covered by the brand name,suncal,but the fact that other developers may also use underfunded subsidiaries to limit their liability,and generic brand names that create confusion,provides no particular basis to have absolved scca.when one then considers that bench had no employees,but had a large overlap of officers with scca,and further considers the role of scca in the underlying litigation,it seems likely that the motion would have been appropriately granted,had it been filed earlier.
plaintiffs motion for a new trial 
following the denial of the motion to amend,plaintiffs filed a motion for a new trial along with additional evidence.that motion was denied following a march,hearing.
g.the trial court evidentiary rulings 
scca made numerous evidentiary objections to plaintiffs evidence,principally on foundational and hearsay grounds.the court sustained some of the objections,and plaintiffs challenge those rulings on this appeal.for the most part,plaintiffs claim that what would otherwise have constituted hearsay was admissible for the nonhearsay purpose of showing why plaintiffs representatives did what they did at various points in time,and ultimately waited until october to file the motion to amend their judgments.
we find it unnecessary to address the court many evidentiary rulings.all of the excluded evidence concerned the reasons plaintiffs waited until october to file the motion to amend and whether their delay in filing the motion was unreasonable.as will appear,the question of whether plaintiffs unreasonably delayed in filing the motion to amend is irrelevant to the merits of plaintiffs alter ego claim against scca.it is only relevant to whether plaintiffs alter ego claim was barred by the equitable,affirmative defense of laches.as we explain,the claim is not barred by laches because scca failed to present sufficient evidence that it was prejudiced by plaintiffs delay in filing the motion,even if the delay was unreasonable.
iii.discussion 
applicable law and standard of review

to prevail on the motion,the judgment creditor must show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the parties to be added as judgment debtors had control of the underlying litigation and were virtually represented in that proceeding there is such a unity of interest and ownership that the separate personalities of the entity and the owners no longer exist and an inequitable result will follow if the acts are treated as those of the entity alone.relentless air racing,llc airborne turbine.partnership th.the decision to grant or deny the motion lies within the sound discretion of the trial court id.at and will not be disturbed on appeal if there is a legal basis for the decision and substantial evidence supports it.see people ex rel.harris sarpas th.
in determining whether there is a sufficient unity of interest and ownership,the court considers many factors,including the commingling of funds and assets of the two entities,identical equitable ownership in the two entities,use of the same offices and employees,disregard of corporate formalities,identical directors and officers,and use of one as a mere shell or conduit for the affairs of the other.citation.troyk farmers group,th.inadequate capitalization of the original judgment debtor is another factor.zoran chen th,reciting long list of inexhaustive factors.no single factor governs courts must consider all of the circumstances of the case in determining whether it would be equitable to impose alter ego liability.troyk farmers group,supra,at.

in kohn kohn d,a marriage dissolution case discussed in greenspan,the court emphasized the nature of determining whether to impose alter ego liability the issue is not so much whether,for all purposes,the corporation is the alter ego of its stockholders or officers,nor whether the very purpose of the organization of the corporation was to defraud the individual who is now in court complaining,as it is an issue of whether in the particular case presented and for the purposes of such case justice and equity can best be accomplished and fraud and unfairness defeated by a disregard of the distinct entity of the corporate form.in the instant case there may well have been various business reasons sufficient to justify and support the formation or continuation of the corporation on the part of defendant.for such purposes the corporation still stands.however,to the extent the purpose of the corporation was to fraudulently deprive the wife of a fair property settlement,the corporate entity would be disregarded the law of this state is that the separate corporate entity will not be honored where to do so would be to defeat the rights and equities of third persons.greenspan,supra,th at.
b.the order denying the motion to amend the judgments must be reversed 
plaintiffs claim the court erroneously denied their motion to amend the judgments to add scca as a judgment debtor based solely on plaintiffs lack of due diligence,or unreasonable four to six year delay,in filing the motion.we agree.
the motion to amend was not barred by laches 
laches is an equitable,affirmative defense which requires a showing of both an unreasonable delay by the plaintiff in bringing suit,plus either acquiescence in the act about which plaintiff complains or prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay.citation.miller,supra,cal d at san antonio community college dist.public employment relations bd.d.if,in light of the lapse of time and other relevant circumstances,a court concludes that a party failure to assert a right has caused prejudice to an adverse party,the court may apply the equitable defense of laches to bar further assertion of the right.in re marriage of fellows cal th.
the party asserting laches bears the burden of production and proof on each element of the defense.miller,supra,cal d at.it is important to remember that,in determining whether laches applies,p rejudice is never presumed rather it must be affirmatively demonstrated by the defendant in order to sustain his burdens of proof and the production of evidence on the issue.citation.generally speaking,the existence of laches is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court in light of all of the applicable circumstances citations.ibid.
the trial court here denied plaintiffs motion to amend based solely on plaintiffs failure to exercise due diligence,or unreasonable delay,in filing the motion.the court observed the motion was filed on october,slightly more than four years after october,the date the most recent postjudgment attorney fee award order was issued,and nearly six years after plaintiffs writ petitions were filed in november.as noted,the court found in sufficient evidence to justify plaintiffs long delay in filing the motion,and observed that plaintiffs should have discovered the relevant facts long ago.
the court also found that scca was prejudiced by the delay,but insufficient evidence supports this finding.the court reasoned that scca had presumably planned its affairs since to without reference to any risk that it would be held liable for plaintiffs attorney fees awards.italics added.but prejudice can never be presumed it must be affirmatively shown miller,supra,cal d at,and here,scca presented insufficient evidence that it was prejudiced by plaintiffs delay in moving to amend the judgments to add scca as an additional judgment debtor.though it may seem fair and reasonable to presume prejudice based solely on a party unreasonable delay in asserting a right,particularly when,as here,the relevant facts were known to or should have been discovered by the party asserting the right,prejudice simply may not be presumed based solely on an unreasonable delay in asserting the right.
in concluding scca was prejudiced,the court pointed to two paragraphs on page of scca original opposition brief as discussing p rejudice from the delay.there,scca argued that if had it been named,along with,as an original defendant or real party in interest in the ceqa litigation in november,then scca could have expended its own resources to defend the litigation,including any claim of alter ego,which resources would have been substantial in to when the litigation was ongoing.but now,due to the collapse of the real estate housing market,circumstances are much different.adding scca now,six years after the litigation was filed and over four years after the judgment s for attorneys fees was litigated and entered,and with scca circumstances having materially changed in the interim,would violate scca right to due process.
this was insufficient to show prejudice.it was not enough for scca to simply assert,without specifics or supporting evidence,that it no longer had the same resources it had before the real estate market collapsed in and that other unspecified circumstances had materially changed.scca did not show that any evidence relevant to its defense to the motion had been lost or destroyed or that any witnesses were no longer available.pratali gates th,pratali death of key witness may constitute prejudice.to the contrary,it appears that little to no relevant evidence concerning scca relationship to,and the equities of imposing alter ego liability on scca,had been lost or destroyed since.
indeed,scca did not even argue it was prejudiced by plaintiffs delay in filing the motion to amend,or plaintiffs near delay in attempting to bring scca in as a party to the consolidated ceqa actions.rather,scca claimed its due process rights would be violated if it were forced to defend the motion so long after plaintiffs could have asserted their alter ego claim against scca in the ceqa actions.but whether scca due process rights would be violated by imposing alter ego liability upon it that is,whether scca controlled the underlying ceqa litigation and was virtually represented in the consolidated ceqa actions is a different question than whether scca was prejudiced by plaintiffs delay in filing the motion to amend.because insufficient evidence shows that scca was prejudiced by plaintiffs delay in filing their motion to amend,the motion is not barred by laches.
alexander is inconsistent with settled case law on laches 
in denying the motion to amend,the court relied on alexander.plaintiffs claim alexander is an outlier an anomalous departure from settled case law and in relying on it the court created an impermissible ad hoc statute of limitation s to bar their motion to amend the judgment.we agree that alexander is a departure from settled case law.the plaintiffs in alexander obtained two judgments against a corporation,abbey of the chimes abbey,one on a promissory note signed by abbey and another on assignment of commissions owed by abbey.alexander,supra,d at.abbey incurred the obligations before mccormac,an individual,became its sole shareholder in.id.at.in,the plaintiffs sued abbey on the note and on the assignment,without naming mccormac as a defendant,and judgments in favor of the plaintiffs were entered in february.id.at.meanwhile,in,mccormac sold abbey assets in a bulk sale transfer to another corporation,skylawn,and the sales agreement required skylawn to assume abbey liability for paying the judgments.id.at.the plaintiffs never attempted to satisfy their judgments against abbey or skylawn.ibid.
in,nearly seven years after the judgments were entered,the plaintiffs moved to amend the judgments to add mccormac as a judgment debtor,claiming he was abbey alter ego.alexander,supra,d at.the trial court granted the motion.id.at.on appeal,mccormac claimed his due process rights had been violated because he was not present at the underlying trial.id.at.the alexander court rejected this claim,finding there was sufficient evidence that mccormac controlled the underlying litigation.id.at.the court also found sufficient evidence to support a finding that mccormac was abbey alter ego,and it would be unjust not to hold mccormac liable for the judgments,given that he caused abbey to sell all of its assets,leaving abbey it a hollow shell without means to satisfy its existing and potential creditors.id.at.nonetheless,the court reversed the order amending the judgments on the sole ground that the motion was untimely,while emphasizing that the alter ego doctrine was an equitable one and that the court task in applying it was to ensure a just and equitable result.id.at.the court reasoned it was inequitable to hold mccormac liable as an alter ego of abbey,given the plaintiffs delay in filing the motion to amend,when there was no explanation for the delay,the plaintiffs never attempted to satisfy their judgments against abbey or skylawn,and the plaintiffs knew that mccormac was abbey sole shareholder and alleged alter ego when they filed their complaints against abbey.id.at.
the alexander court did not use the term laches in reversing the order amending the plaintiffs judgments.alexander,supra,d at.specifically,the court did not require mccormac to show he was prejudiced by the plaintiffs unexplained,delay in filing the motion to amend.miller,supra,cal d at.alexander is thus inconsistent with settled case law that an action is barred by laches only if the defendant shows the plaintiff unreasonably delayed in bringing suit,and the defendant was either prejudiced by the delay or the plaintiff acquiesced in the actions it complains of.miller,supra,cal d at conti board of civil service commissioners cal d,fn.
nor can alexander be understood as a proper refusal by the court to apply the alter ego doctrine based on the overall equities of the case.to be sure,whether a court should apply the alter ego doctrine in a particular case is based on a number of factors there is no litmus test for determining when the alter ego doctrine should be applied and t he essence of the alter ego doctrine is that justice be done.mesler bragg management,supra,cal d at greenspan,supra,th at.still,the equities of applying the alter ego doctrine should not be conflated with the separate question of whether the defendant has demonstrated prejudice resulting from the plaintiff delay in asserting the alter ego claim.
in our view,a court errs if it refuses to apply the alter ego doctrine based solely on a plaintiff unreasonable delay,or lack of due diligence,in asserting the alter ego claim,as occurred in alexander.barring an alter ego claim based solely on the plaintiff unreasonable delay in asserting the claim allows the alleged alter ego defendant to avail itself of the defense of laches without showing it was prejudiced by the delay.this is contrary to the settled requirements of laches miller,supra,cal d at and would,in effect,revive the discredited doctrine of stale claims which our state high court long ago repudiated conti board of civil service commissioners,supra,cal d at maguire hibernia soc.cal d,maquire.in maquir
