we review in this appeal the trial court denial of appellants california sportfishing protection alliance and deltakeeper chapter of baykeeper petition for writ of mandate,which challenged respondents state water resources control board state board and regional water quality control regional board adoption and approval of the deer creek temperature amendment to the existing water quality control plan for the sacramento and san joaquin river basins the basin plan or plan.appellants claim that the amendment violates the provisions of the quality control act,et act and the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et.in approving the temperature amendment to the basin plan,appellants argue respondents made findings on the beneficial uses of deer creek that are not supported by the evidence in the administrative record,and failed to comply with environmental review requirements that are the functional equivalent of ceqa.we conclude that the findings challenged by appellants are supported by the evidence,and respondents did not violate administrative regulations governing the environmental review of a basin plan by a certified regulatory program.we therefore affirm the order.
statement of facts and procedural history 
deer creek,the subject of this litigation,is a small tributary stream in a watershed in the lower woodlands of the sierra nevada foothills in el dorado and sacramento counties.it flows through residential neighborhoods and parks into a small reservoir at cameron park lake,over a low flashboard dam,past a wastewater treatment plant,then across predominantly undeveloped agricultural land to its confluence with the cosumnes river near the town of elk grove.it is a typical sierra nevada foothill stream.from seasonal rains rather than supplies deer creek in the rainy season,but beginning in may or june the flow subsides or ceases above cameron park lake.below the lake an intermittent or subterranean flow in summer and fall is derived from reservoir overflow,springs,effluent,and urban.like the cosumnes river,during many years deer creek primarily runs dry for much of the summer season.
in,the el dorado irrigation district the district constructed the deer creek wastewater treatment plant in the watershed of deer creek,not far below cameron park lake.absent the discharge from the wastewater treatment plant,deer creek is an ephemeral stream during the dry season,so the effluent discharge helps to provide flow for aquatic habitat.effluent from the wastewater treatment plant constitutes the vast majority of the flow of deer percent or the point of discharge during the summer and fall months,and for most of the year appreciably exceeds the natural water temperature in the creek.during the precipitation period of the year,effluent discharges constitute a much smaller but erratic fraction of the downstream flows,and natural conditions often provide adequate background flow to maintain hydraulic continuity with the cosumnes river.the relative magnitude of temperature increase in deer creek due to the effluent discharges is highly variable from month to month and year to year,depending upon precipitation,variation in creek flow rates,ambient air temperatures,and other factors.
in accordance with the mandates of the act,in respondents adopted a water quality control plan for the sacramento and san joaquin river basins,which,as amended in,and,established water quality objectives for deer creek in general,the basin plan stated that the primary goal of water quality planning is the protection and enhancement of existing and potential designated beneficial uses,achieved by setting quality and quantity objectives for surface and ground waters.under the tributary rule,the beneficial uses designated in the basin plan for the cosumnes river,and hence for deer creek as a cold freshwater aquatic habitat,included municipal and domestic supply,irrigation and stock watering,recreation,preservation of warm and cold freshwater habitats as necessary to support aquatic vegetation or wildlife,and the migration,spawning and reproduction of aquatic organisms.
to maintain and protect cold freshwater beneficial uses,the basin plan,prior to the amendment challenged in the current proceeding,provided that a t no time or place shall the temperature of cold or warm intrastate waters be increased more than above natural receiving water temperature.this prohibition against a discharge that raised the water temperature more than degrees to as the delta requirement or the increase limitation was generic to all water bodies in the basin,and did not specifically protect deer creek.the basin plan also stated that the natural receiving water temperature of intrastate waters shall not be altered unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the regional water board that such alteration in temperature does not adversely affect beneficial uses.
effluent discharges from the deer creek wastewater treatment plant,while of high quality,regularly exceeded the specified water objectives for ph,turbidity and temperature in late spring,summer and fall.the effluent is minimally diluted by the natural receiving water of the stream in the summer and fall,with the result that the basin plan temperature objective could not be consistently achieved downstream of the point of effluent discharge under the existing delta degrees fahrenheit requirement.although the plant was significantly upgraded over the years in response to violations of the existing basin plan,during low flow conditions deer creek still did not achieve compliance with the delta degrees fahrenheit requirement.in,the district proposed a change in the designated beneficial uses of deer creek,particularly the cold freshwater habitat designation.the proposal was rejected by the regional board staff in july of,out of concern for potential presence of steelhead trout and the rare occurrence of individual rainbow trout in deer creek.
the district then pursued a basin plan amendment for deer creek in lieu of further physical improvements to the plant,to achieve compliance with the basin plan objectives for ph,turbidity and temperature.in january of,the regional board issued a staff report that also proposed a amendment to the water quality control plan for deer creek temperature.the proposal noted that the delta degrees fahrenheit requirement is neither supported by current science regarding the effects of temperature on aquatic life nor consistent with current approach to regulating temperature in ambient waters.
in accordance with the district request,the regional board staff report considered three alternatives,but recommended,numeric temperature objectives for deer creek to replace the generic delta degrees fahrenheit requirement the change suggested by the regional board staff was the elimination of the maximum allowed change from natural temperatures,and use of seasonal,quantitative acute daily maximum and chronic monthly average temperature objectives developed specifically to maintain and protect the aquatic ecology and other beneficial uses of deer creek.the stated objective for the proposed amendment of the basin plan was to produce a set of seasonal,numeric objectives that will protect and maintain deer creek existing and potential aquatic life uses.the recommended substitution of temperature objectives for the delta degrees fahrenheit requirement was predicated upon available scientific literature and the epa current approach to regulation of temperatures in ambient waters,which recognizes it is primarily the absolute temperatures that occur in the creek,not the increase in natural receiving water temperature,that affects the health of aquatic life.
a approach was followed by the regional board staff to derive the appropriate seasonal temperature objectives for deer creek first,compilation of scientific literature pertaining to all fish and aquatic insect species documented to occur in the creek second,accumulation of existing biological data to characterize the diversity,structure and condition of the fish and aquatic insect populations in deer creek,both upstream and downstream of the wastewater treatment plant.the data was then integrated with available current scientific literature on the temperature requirements and thermal tolerance of aquatic life in deer creek.
the report concluded that compliance with specified seasonal temperature objectives would maintain temperatures in deer creek at levels ecologically equivalent with those that have historically occurred.to replace the current standard of degrees fahrenheit maximum allowable temperature change in the natural receiving water,the amendment to the basin plan proposed for deer creek,source to the cosumnes river,temperature changes due to discharges shall not cause creek temperatures to exceed the objectives stipulated in an attached table.the enumerated temperature objectives in the table have both daily high and monthly average components the daily maximum allowable temperatures and monthly average allowable temperatures in deer creek were set forth for each month of the year even the highest acute objective proposed for deer creek of degrees fahrenheit during the summer months is consistent with and below the epa temperature criteria for fish documented to exist in deer creek.
based upon analysis of temperature monitoring data,the specified temperature objectives are less restrictive than the existing delta degrees fahrenheit requirement for the months of september through december.during the remaining eight months of the year,january through august or september,the specified temperature objectives are similarly restrictive or more restrictive than the delta degrees fahrenheit requirement,but still may not adequately protect populations of cold water rainbow trout and anadromous fish such as steelhead trout and chinook salmon during the months of may through october the report suggested that the less restrictive objectives during the fall period are still protective of the aquatic organisms residing in the creek at that time,and on an overall annual basis the objectives would provide an equivalent to somewhat greater degree of thermal protection to deer creek aquatic life.
the report further stated that the data obtained in numerous surveys of aquatic wildlife conducted between august of and october of revealed a lack of current populations of cold water fish or insects in deer creek.only one survey in produced sightings of three adult rainbow trout of unknown origin,but not the presence of multiple age classes of fish indicative of a viable trout population.the eight fish surveys conducted both upstream and downstream of the wastewater treatment plant found no evidence of a thriving natal,cold water fishery.a review of ambient temperature data by the california department of fish and game the department also indicated that daily maximum temperatures upstream of the wastewater treatment plant during the late spring,summer and fall routinely exceeded degrees fahrenheit and spiked as high as degrees fahrenheit,well above the thermal tolerances for rainbow trout.thus,the department asserted i t is highly likely that deer creek did not have a rainbow trout population even before installation of the wastewater treatment plant.the presence of anadromous salmonids was not documented in any form in the studies.instead,according to the report,the populations of fish and aquatic insects using deer creek are comprised of warmwater species.
the biological assessment data further shows deer creek existing fish and aquatic insect communities are healthy,diverse and the creek downstream of the wastewater treatment plant supports a more diverse native fish community than the upstream water the effluent from the plant does not have a substantial adverse impact on the downstream condition of the creek or its existing aquatic communities.differences between the aquatic communities above and below the wastewater treatment plant were recognized,but not considered indicative of degraded water quality or temperature regimes created by the plant.the conclusion was reached in the report that the proposed objectives are protective of all current and probable future beneficial uses of deer creek.
the regional board staff and fishery biologists acknowledged the potential for infrequent opportunistic use of deer creek by chinook salmon and steelhead trout from the cosumnes river in some years when hydrologic and temperature conditions are is,heavy rain in the fall and winter that promotes hydraulic continuity with the cosumnes river.according to the report,the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant has not reduced,and more likely has increased,the possibility of anadromous fish emigration into deer creek,due to the increased flow generated by the discharge.the more stringent proposed limitations on temperature levels in the winter,spring and summer were designed to provide greater protection for sensitive aquatic life stages and further the potential for chinook salmon and steelhead trout in the winter and spring.in the event opportunistic use of deer creek by chinook salmon and steelhead trout actually occurs in the future due to cosumnes river anadromous fish restoration efforts,measures may then be implemented to assure that effluent from the wastewater treatment plant does not compromise this potential beneficial use.
based upon input from the department,the nature conservancy,and the national marine fisheries service,among other sources,the report found that the proposed objectives would maintain water quality in deer creek,protect existing and probable aquatic life uses,and not cause degradation of water quality in any downstream water bodies.the regional board staff concluded that the proposed amendment to the basin plan is protective of the creek existing and probable future beneficial uses.
conflicting evidence was presented,some of it in comments to the proposed amendments to the basin plan by deltakeeper.anecdotal evidence of occasional,historical sightings of rainbow trout in deep pools by local fishermen and property owners was mentioned.deltakeeper also voiced criticism that the fish surveys failed to seek out areas of pools,springs and upwellings where rainbow trout may inhabit deer creek during the summer.
following public comment on the report,revisions,and a hearing on january,the regional board found that proposed water quality objectives for temperature would be protective of deer creek aquatic resources,and would not have a significant impact on the environment.the staff recommendations as revised were adopted by the regional board.the state board approved the amendment of the deer creek temperature objectives in the basin a modification of the in conformance with the requirements of the federal clean water act.et the united states environmental protection agency also approved the amendment,after which the regional board issued a notice of decision of the approval.
appellants filed a petition for writ of mandate that sought to set aside the approval of the amendment to the basin plan and require respondents to adopt a temperature amendment for deer creek that protects all designated beneficial uses and complies with the requirements of the clean water act,the act,and ceqa.after a hearing the trial court decided that the temperature objectives implemented in the amendment of the basin plan protect the beneficial uses of deer creek and were approved in compliance with ceqa.this appeal followed the denial of the petition.
discussion 
compliance with the act and the clean water act.
appellants claim that adoption and approval of the amendment to the temperature objectives of the basin plan by respondents violate the act and the clean water act by failing to protect deer creek native cold water fish.two findings in the report are specifically challenged by appellants as lacking a rational basis in the record first,that deer creek does not have a population of rainbow trout and second,that hydraulic conditions prevent salmonids from using deer creek in the fall.appellants argue that both of these beneficial uses are not protected by the amended temperature objectives,which therefore violate the clean water act and.

a.the finding that deer creek has no population of rainbow trout.
the trial court sustained respondents determination that deer creek has no population of rainbow trout.appellants claim that the supporting evidence of the lack of rainbow trout populations in the creek is inadequate.they also maintain that the conflicting undisputed and overwhelming evidence indicates rainbow trout have historically inhabited deer creek.
we first examine the evidence offered by the regional board to support the finding that suggests a viable population of rainbow trout does not inhabit deer creek.the data collected through a series of fish surveys conducted from to by different parties constitutes credible evidence that a population of rainbow trout is not present in deer creek.a few isolated adult trout were observed in a single survey in,but otherwise the data yielded from the comparatively thorough survey efforts in subsequent years failed to discern any rainbow trout.stafford lehr,an associate fisheries biologist with the department,testified that his fish survey resulted in capture of just three adult trout dispersed in the system,not multiple age classes of fish that would suggest a viable rainbow trout population.upon examination of what lehr called the most robust data set through time,lehr asserted that if a,viable rainbow trout population was present in deer creek the sampling data set would have picked that up,but it did not.he added that only three individuals of a cold water order of bugs were found in the surveys,and the system is dominated by warm water species.the fish survey data is further corroborated by evidence from a department survey of temperatures in deer creek,even those upstream of the wastewater treatment plant,which were found to exceed the thermal tolerances for rainbow trout for much of the year.
appellants point to deficiencies in the survey data to claim that the record does not provide a reasonable or rational basis for the regional board findings.they maintain that the surveys were confined to shallow,upstream water and failed to target deep pools where trout may exist in the summer.appellants also suggest that the fish surveys were conducted long after the discharge of warm water effluent from the wastewater treatment plant began in,and thus do not indicate the historical beneficial use of deer creek by rainbow trout before sewage discharges altered radically the aquatic ecosystem.however,lehr reviewed the survey data evidence and indicated that a population of rainbow trout would have been detected if it existed.the temperature survey data further demonstrated that summer water temperatures found throughout deer creek are incompatible with viable rainbow trout populations.evidence was also presented that the difference in current water temperatures and the conditions extant prior to is negligible,and does not affect or limit aquatic life.according to lehr,the species that exist today in deer creek,both upstream and downstream of the wastewater treatment
