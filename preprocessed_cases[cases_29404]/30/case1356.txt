appellants united defense lp,meadwestvaco corporation,and huron valley steel corporation challenge the district court decision to remand this case to the alabama state court.appellants argue that this case belongs in federal court under the class action fairness act cafa,stat.codified in scattered sections of,and because the plaintiffs fraudulently joined defendants in order to evade federal jurisdiction.we hold that the federal district court has jurisdiction over this case under cafa.we need not reach the issue of fraudulent misjoinder.
background 
on april,plaintiffs filed this case in the circuit court of calhoun county,alabama,on behalf of a class of people who were allegedly injured by the actions of named defendants and a number of fictitious defendants.the plaintiffs allege that the defendants operated manufacturing facilities in the anniston,alabama,area.plaintiffs allege both property damage and personal injury that they attribute to defendants release of various waste substances over an approximately period.four of the defendants removed this case to federal court under cafa,which expanded federal jurisdiction for class actions.defendants notice of removal also contained a footnote that stated that defendants believed that plaintiffs may have improperly joined defendants.
plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case to state court.plaintiffs sole argument for remand was that the case fell within cafa local controversy exception to federal jurisdiction.plaintiffs argued that their case was a local controversy because more than of the plaintiff class were alabama citizens and at least one alabama defendant,pipe,was a significant defendant within the meaning of cafa.plaintiffs proffered the affidavits of two of their attorneys to support their claim.the district court agreed that this case fell within cafa local controversy exception,and remanded the case to state court the four removing defendants appeal the district court ruling.
ii.standard of review 
the district court decision to remand is reviewed de novo.brown snow,cir we review questions of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.
iii.analysis 
a.the rule 
the relevant provisions of cafa provide 
c review of remand orders.
in shall apply to any removal of a case under this section,except that notwithstanding section d,a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the state court from which it was removed if application is made to the court of appeals not less than days after entry of the order.
time period for the court of appeals accepts an appeal under paragraph,the court shall complete all action on such appeal,including rendering judgment,not later than days after the date on which such appeal was filed,unless an extension is granted under paragraph.
extension of time court of appeals may grant an extension of the period described in paragraph if 
a all parties to the proceeding agree to such extension,for any period of time or 
b such extension is for good cause shown and in the interests of justice,for a period not to exceed days.
denial of a final judgment on the appeal under paragraph is not issued before the end of the period described in paragraph,including any extension under paragraph,the appeal shall be denied.
c.as a preliminary matter,we must determine whether the period begins to run from when the appellants filed their application for appeal,or from the date on which this court accepted the appeal.we hold that the period begins to run from the date when the court of appeals granted the appellants application to appeal and thus filed the appeal.
under cafa,when a district court grants or denies remand to state court,a party may make an application for appeal to the court of appeals.c.we believe that congress choice of language is significant.section c provides for an application to the court of appeals,not a notice of appeal,within days of the district court remand order.section c provides that the court of appeals shall complete all action days after the date on which the appeal was filed,not days from the date on which the application was filed.
we also find it significant that review by the appeals court is clearly discretionary.see c a court of appeals may accept an appeal emphasis added.thus,it is plausible to conclude that congress contemplated the application of fed,which governs discretionary appeals.we conclude that a request for appeal under cafa is subject to fed,entitled appeal by permission.rule d provides a notice of appeal need not be filed.the date when the order granting permission to appeal is entered serves as the date of the notice of appeal for calculating time under these rules.thus,there is no notice of appeal,and no appeal,until the court of appeals accepts the application,whence the appeal is deemed filed.
accordingly,we hold that the date on which such appeal was filed is the date that the court of appeals accepts the appeal,and thus files the appeal.we agree with the resolution of every other court of appeals which has ruled on this issue.in this regard,we agree with the reasoning of patterson dean morris,llp,cir,and amalgamated transit union laidlaw transit services,cir.see also pritchett office depot,cir.
in this case,the appellants filed their application for appeal on march,and this court granted their application on march.therefore,this court ruling is due within days of march.
cafa and the local controversy exception 
legal background 
congress enacted cafa on february.under cafa,federal courts now have original jurisdiction over class actions in which the amount in controversy exceeds and there is minimal diversity at least one plaintiff and one defendant are from different states.d.cafa,however,does have an exception to federal jurisdiction for cases that are truly local in nature.d a.
in this case,the parties do not dispute that the controversy exceeds and that there is minimal diversity.the issue before us is whether this case falls within cafa local controversy exception to federal jurisdiction.cafa local controversy exception provides 
a district court shall decline to exercise jurisdiction under paragraph 
a i over a class action in which 
i greater than of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate are citizens of the state in which the action was originally filed 
ii at least defendant is a defendant 
aa from whom significant relief is sought by members of the plaintiff class 
bb whose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted by the proposed plaintiff class and 
cc who is a citizen of the state in which the action was originally filed and 
iii principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct or any related conduct of each defendant were incurred in the state in which the action was originally filed and 
ii during the period preceding the filing of that class action,no other class action has been filed asserting the same or similar factual allegations against any of the defendants on behalf of the same or other persons 
d cafa language favors federal jurisdiction over class actions and cafa legislative history suggests that congress intended the local controversy exception to be a narrow one,with all doubts resolved in favor of exercising jurisdiction over the case.at,cong.admin.news.the senate report on cafa further states that the local controversy exception 
is a narrow exception that was carefully drafted to ensure that it does not become a jurisdictional loophole.thus,the committee wishes to stress that in assessing whether each of these criteria is satisfied by a particular case,a federal court should bear in mind that the purpose of each of these criteria is to identify a truly local controversy that uniquely affects a particular locality to the exclusion of all others.
at,cong.admin.news at.the language and structure of cafa itself indicates that congress contemplated broad federal court jurisdiction,see,b,stat.providing for federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance under diversity jurisdiction,with only narrow exceptions.these notions are fully conf
