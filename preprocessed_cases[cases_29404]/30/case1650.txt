the orange county water district the district brought this action to recover costs associated with the north basin groundwater protection project nbgpp,a proposed million effort intended to address groundwater contamination in northern orange county,california caused by volatile organic compounds voc and other chemicals.since at least the,the district and other regulatory agencies such as the regional water quality control board rwqcb have been aware of voc groundwater contamination in the north basin area.the district and various private parties under the direction of the rwqcb investigated the sources of contamination.based on these investigations,the district and others concluded that the groundwater contamination was caused by voc releases at a number of industrial sites in the north basin area.under the supervision of the rwqcb and other regulatory agencies,several of these industrial sites have undergone remediation to remove voc contamination from the shallow soil and groundwater.other industrial sites received no further action letters from the rwqcb based on their investigations.
concerned that voc contamination remained in groundwater notwithstanding these remediation efforts,the district began to develop an overarching solution to groundwater contamination in the north basin.beginning in,the district developed and then refined a series of proposals for the nbgpp.the nbgpp is intended to treat voc contamination in the shallow aquifer,with the goal of preventing contamination of the deeper principal aquifer.the principal aquifer is a source of drinking water for several orange county municipalities.
an aquifer,at its most basic level,consists of soil or permeable rock saturated with water.in the north basin area,the shallow aquifer begins approximately feet below ground level and extends to approximately feet ground level.below the shallow aquifer,separated by a relatively less permeable layer of soil,is the principal aquifer.the principal aquifer begins just below the shallow aquifer and extends to approximately to feet below ground level in the north basin area.when used without qualification in this appeal,the term groundwater typically refers to water in the shallow aquifer but sometimes the principal aquifer as well 
in the course of its investigation,the district identified various current and former owners and operators of industrial sites in the north basin area that it believed were responsible in some way for voc contamination.the primary voc identified included tetrachloroethylene also known as perchloroethylene or pce,trichloroethylene tce,and.the last chemical,breaks down into and acetic acid.the detection of in soil or groundwater can be evidence of past contamination.
the district filed suit against a number of these owners and operators,including defendants at issue in this appeal alcoa global fasteners,alcoa,arnold engineering arnold,cbs broadcasting,cbs,crucible materials crucible,and northrop grumman systems northrop.the district sued several other parties,who settled or were otherwise dismissed from the litigation prior to this appeal.in some cases,as we will explain,the district sued parties who had remediated or were remediating their sites under the auspices of the rwqcb,on the theory that such remediation did not affect voc contamination that had migrated to the shallow aquifer in the past.the district obtained approximately million in settlements during the underlying litigation.
the district asserted statutory claims for damages under the hazardous substances account act hsaa health saf.code,et and the orange county water district act ocwd act west ann.wat.code app.ed.ch.and for declaratory relief code civ.the district also asserted common law claims for negligence,nuisance,and trespass.
by the time of trial,the design of the nbgpp had not been finalized and the vast bulk of the project had not been constructed.the district claimed it had spent approximately million in development and construction costs,out of the estimated million total.the district sought to recover its past costs and obtain a declaration holding defendants liable for future costs associated with the nbgpp.
following an initial bench trial on the district statutory claims,the trial court determined that the district should take nothing.the court found,among other things,that the nbgpp was neither a reasonable nor a necessary response to the identified groundwater contamination and that defendants did not cause the district to undertake the nbgpp.the court concluded that defendants were entitled to a declaration that they were not responsible for past or future costs related to the nbgpp.
in light of the court findings,defendants argued that a trial on the district remaining common law claims for negligence,nuisance,and trespass was unnecessary because those findings would apply in any jury trial on the remaining claims.the court agreed and entered judgment in favor of defendants.
the district appeals.it challenges the judgment on numerous grounds,including the trial court misinterpreted the legal requirements of the district claims under the hsaa and the ocwd act the court erred under code of civil procedure,section,subdivision b by scheduling a bench trial on the district statutory equitable claims before a jury trial on the district common law legal claims,thereby depriving the district of its right to trial by jury the court erred by applying its factual findings on the district equitable claims to defeat the district common law claims the court misapplied evidence code section and made other erroneous evidentiary rulings and the court erred by granting declaratory relief in favor of defendants.in response,among other arguments,defendants contend the district can not assert a claim under the hsaa because it is not seeking contribution or indemnity as those terms are used in the statute.
we conclude the district may assert a claim under the hsaa.on the merits,however,as we shall explain,we find the trial court misinterpreted some elements of this claim,including its causation standard.based on our review of the evidence and the court factual findings,we conclude the court causation error did not prejudice the district,except as to northrop.however,because the district hsaa has other essential elements,one of which was not satisfied as to any defendant,the district hsaa claim against all defendants including northrop fails.even though the latter issue is dispositive of the district hsaa claim,we address the former issues because they present important and novel legal questions and because they affect our consideration of the district declaratory relief claim.
we further conclude the trial court misinterpreted elements of the district claim under the ocwd act,which are similar but not identical to the elements of an hsaa claim.we conclude these errors prejudiced the district as to northrop but not the other defendants.we will therefore reverse the judgment on the district ocwd act claim as to northrop and otherwise affirm.
based on these conclusions,we will reverse the court declaration of no liability in favor of northrop but affirm court declaration of no liability in favor of the remaining defendants.we find no merit in the district assignments of error concerning trial sequencing and its common law claims,and although the court misapplied evidence code section,it was not prejudicial.the remainder of the judgment will therefore be affirmed as well.
factual and procedural background 
the district and its allegations 
the district is a public entity established by the california legislature and empowered to manage,replenish,regulate,and protect groundwater supplies within its boundaries.ocwd act.the district has the power to t ransport,reclaim,purify,treat,inject,extract,or otherwise manage and control water for the beneficial use of persons or property within the district and protect the quality of groundwater supplies within the district,subd.j.in furtherance of these goals,the district may commence,maintain,intervene in,defend,and compromise any and all actions and proceedings to prevent diminution of the quantity or pollution or contamination of the water supply of the district,subd.
in,the district filed this lawsuit against a number of defendants,including defendants at issue in this appeal,to address current and threatened groundwater contamination in the north basin.in its operative first amended complaint fac,the district alleged each defendant owned or operated one or more industrial sites in northern orange county where hazardous wastes,voc had been released into the environment.the release of hazardous wastes had caused or threatened to cause contamination in groundwater within the district geographic area.the district alleged injury in the form of investigation and remediation costs to address this contamination and threatened contamination,as well as the ongoing threat to public health,natural resources,and the environment posted by the hazardous waste releases.to recover its costs and address this threat,the district alleged causes of action against all defendants under the ocwd act and the hsaa and under common law theories of negligence,nuisance,and trespass.the district also alleged a cause of action for declaratory relief,which claimed a n actual controversy exists concerning who is responsible for abating actual or threatened pollution or contamination of groundwater resources within the district by voc and sought adjudication of the respective rights and obligations of the parties.the district sought compensatory and punitive damages,attorney fees,costs,an order finding defendants liable for the full cost of remediation,an order declaring the contamination a nuisance and compelling defendants to abate it,and any other proper relief.defendants against the district for,among other things,a declaration of no liability.
pretrial and trial proceedings 
during a status conference,the court announced its intention to bifurcate trial on the district claims,with an initial bench trial on the district equitable claims under the ocwd act and the hsaa and for declaratory relief and a subsequent jury trial on the district legal claims for negligence,nuisance,and trespass.the district urged the court to try its legal claims first in front of a jury.it expressed concern that holding a bench trial first would impair its right to a jury trial on its legal claims.the court acknowledged the district right to a jury trial but confirmed its inclination to hold a bench trial first.later,the court granted several defendants motions for summary adjudication of the district negligence claim on statute of limitations grounds.
the bench trial on the district equitable claims began in february and lasted over seven months.the district and defendants presented extensive lay and expert testimony,as well as documentary evidence,covering the history of the nbgpp,the district investigation and analysis of the north basin area,activities at defendants industrial sites that may have led to hazardous waste disposal and releases,activities at other sites in the north basin area that may have led to hazardous waste releases,previous soil and groundwater remediation efforts by defendants and others,the involvement of regulatory agencies other than the district in such remediation efforts,the potential impact of hazardous waste releases on groundwater in the north basin area,and the nbgpp effect on such groundwater 
history of the nbgpp 
the evidence at trial showed that the district became aware of groundwater contamination in the north basin area in the.data from monitoring wells and other sources identified a plume of voc contamination in groundwater,oriented east to west,approximately miles long and up to one mile wide.this contamination primarily affected groundwater in the shallow aquifer.but by the late,voc contamination had reached the principal aquifer in certain areas,leading to the decommissioning of several drinking water wells.
in,the district issued a request for proposal for a focused feasibility study to assess various options concerning groundwater contamination in the north basin area.the district request for proposal stated that the presumed remedy for groundwater contamination was hydraulic containment of the voc plume,the construction of wells to extract contaminated groundwater from the shallow aquifer,remove voc contaminants,and discharge the treated water back into the environment.this remedy was intended to minimize the further spread of contaminants in groundwater.it would later be known as the nbgpp.
the next year,a consultant to the district prepared a draft focused feasibility study.the study analyzed the extent of voc groundwater contamination in the north basin area and evaluated the effects of four potential alternative responses.these responses were the following no action in this alternative,it is assumed that no remedial measures of any type would be implemented by the district or any other party and that ongoing remedial efforts by private parties would be terminated.monitored natural attenuation in this alternative,it is assumed that no remedial measures would be implemented by the district,although ongoing planned remedial measures by other parties would continue.also,the district and others would continue to monitor water quality via existing and recommended new wells.mitigation control at leading edge this alternative contains all of the elements of monitored natural attenuation but also includes the extraction of gpm of ground water from each of three wells for a total of gpm located at or near the leading edge of the voc plume.migration control at leading edge with enhanced removal this alternative contains the same elements as migration control at leading edge but includes three additional extraction wells located within the voc plume.the two treatment responses,the third and the fourth alternatives,relied on a modular system,individual extraction wells with onsite treatment facilities.the treated water would then be returned to the principal aquifer through injection wells or discharged onto surface spreading grounds to naturally recharge the shallow aquifer.the primary contaminants targeted for remediation were pce,tce,and dichloroethylene.
the draft focused feasibility study was intended to be consistent with standards established by the united states environmental protection agency for environmental remediation programs.these standards,entitled the national oil and hazardous substances pollution contingency plan ncp,are codified in federal regulations.et under the ncp,the primary objective of a feasibility study is to ensure that appropriate remedial alternatives are developed and evaluated such that relevant information concerning the remedial action options can be presented to a and an appropriate remedy selected.e.
the draft focused feasibility study prepared for the district discussed in detail the four alternatives and assessed them across nine criteria overall protection of human health and the environment compliance with arar effectiveness and permanence reduction of mobility,toxicity,and volume through treatment effectiveness implementability cost,state acceptance and community acceptance.see e iii.the net present value cost ranges for each alternative including capital,operation,and maintenance costs were no cost for the no action alternative,approximately million for the monitored natural attenuation alternative,approximately million to million for the mitigation control at leading edge alternative,and approximately million to million for the mitigation control at leading edge with enhanced removal alternative.
five years after the draft focused feasibility study was prepared,a different consultant for the district prepared a supplemental focused feasibility study.this supplemental study,issued in january,assessed two variations of the mitigation control at leading edge alternative discussed in the draft focused feasibility study.the supplemental study explained that two changed circumstances required redesign of that alternative monitoring data noted the presence of additional contaminants that should be remediated,including and and property acquisition for the placement of modular extraction wells and treatment systems had proven difficult.the alternatives under consideration in the supplemental focused feasibility study involved extraction wells placed along the leading edge of the plume,similar to the draft study,but the water would be pumped to a centralized treatment system.in the first alternative,the district would construct and operate a single centralized treatment system.in the second,the district would construct and operate two centralized treatment systems.in both alternatives,the district would release treated water into the shallow aquifer through discharge into flood basins adjacent to the treatment systems.
the supplemental focused feasibility study did not consider nontreatment alternatives,such as the no action and monitored natural attenuation alternatives identified in the draft study.the supplemental study explained that it focuses primarily on treatment technologies in the context of the presumptive remedy,hydraulic control.the supplemental feasibility study also limited its assessment to two of the nine criteria implementability and cost.the supplemental study estimated the net present value costs for both alternatives at approximately million.
the district circulated a notice of intent to adopt a mitigated negative declaration for the nbgpp under the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et.it made available for inspection the draft mitigated negative declaration and supporting initial study.following an approximately public review period,the district reported that it did not receive any comments that supported the need for an environmental impact report eir or any significant modification to the project.the district board of directors adopted the mitigated negative declaration for the project 
later in,district staff prepared a report assessing the hydrogeological and engineering aspects of the nbgpp.the report discussed additional modifications to the project following the supplemental focused feasibility study.the rwqcb had notified the district that additional studies were needed to determine whether the project would exacerbate perchlorate contamination in the shallow and principal aquifers.because of the expense of such studies,and the likelihood that perchlorate contamination would in fact be exacerbated,the district determined that perchlorate treatment should be part of the project.similarly,the district identified nitrate contamination in groundwater and determined that nitrate treatment should be part of the project as well.for these reasons,among others,the district settled on a single centralized treatment system that would treat extracted groundwater for the voc as well as perchlorate and nitrate.the report estimated the capital costs of the project,including contingencies,to be approximately million with estimated annual operation and maintenance costs of million.the report calculated that the project would treat of groundwater per year,leading to a total treatment cost including amortized capital costs and operation and maintenance costs of per of water the district board of directors approved the nbgpp as described in the staff report.
in light of the changes to the nbgpp project,the district commissioned a draft subsequent environmental impact report draft seir.the draft seir reviewed the environmental impacts associated with the changes in the project after the mitigated negative declaration was approved.the changes identified in the draft seir included,among other things,a new proposed extraction well,additions to the centralized treatment system to accommodate the remediation of additional contaminants,perchlorate and nitrate,and a new recharge system involving injection wells.the draft seir included discussions of four alternatives,but each alternative involved constructing at least the version of the nbgpp described in the supplemental focused feasibility study and mitigated negative declaration.
prior to preparing the draft seir,the district circulated notices to public agencies and interested parties.it received eight comment letters from various public agencies and northrop.the district also met with the south coast air quality management district and northrop to discuss the changes to the project.the district circulated the draft seir to the public and received a number of comments.
by the time of trial,the district had constructed five extraction wells.but plans for the centralized treatment system were not complete,and no treatment had yet occurred.the district estimated that it had spent approximately million on the project to date.the district cost estimate for the entire project,however,had increased to over million.
the nbgpp environmental effects 
the effect of the proposed nbgpp project on the voc plume,and on the shallow and principal aquifers more generally,was hotly contested at trial.the objectives of the project,as summarized in the district staff report,were to p revent exposure of the public to groundwater containing contaminants exceeding drinking water standards,i nhibit the lateral and vertical migration of contamination to protect the aquifer and existing drinking water production wells from further impacts,and r emove contaminant mass from the aquifer.
it was undisputed at trial that voc contaminants in the north basin area would naturally degrade to some extent over time,even setting aside the effects of the nbgpp,based on natural chemical processes.this process is called natural attenuation.it was also undisputed that other public agencies and private parties had undertaken efforts to remediate sites in the north basin area.for example,the district recognized in its draft focused feasibility study that at least private parties had been required by the rwqcb to investigate subsurface contaminants at their sites,and at least seven sites had been actively remediated.at least two other sites were remediated by or at the direction of the california department of toxic substances control dtsc.this process,called source removal,would likely lead to a decrease in the downward migration of voc contaminants into groundwater,including the shallow aquifer,and foster the reduction of contaminant levels through natural attenuation.
at trial,district expert graham fogg opined,based on computer models of the north basin area,that the nbgpp would remove approximately half of the voc contaminant mass in the shallow aquifer over years of operation.fogg was impeached,however,by deposition testimony in which he admitted that removing a third of the voc contaminant mass would be an optimistic estimate.fogg did not model the effect of the nbgpp on existing drinking water production well fields 
a defense expert,steven larson,agreed that the nbgpp would change conditions in some areas of the shallow aquifer.larson,however,also specifically modeled the effect of the nbgpp on the principal aquifer.he found no material charge in the level of contaminants there,especially in the areas surrounding existing drinking water production wells.larson concluded that the nbgpp would provide no benefit to the principal aquifer.based on the data larson reviewed,which was confirmed in a district report,contaminant levels in the principal aquifer were already relatively stable or declining.larson expected that trend to continue regardless of whether the nbgpp was constructed.larson concluded that the cost of the ngbpp was not justified in light of the similarity between the conditions in the principal aquifer,especially around drinking water production wells,if the ngbpp were constructed and if it were not.he believed the ngbpp was neither reasonable nor necessary to reduce voc contamination in the principal aquifer to an acceptable level 
larson criticized the district for not examining the effect of treatment or lack thereof on the level of contaminants in the principal aquifer during development of the ngbpp.in larson view,this failure was exacerbated when the plan for treated water under the ngbpp changed from injection directly into the principal aquifer to discharge into the shallow aquifer.while injecting treated water into the principal aquifer would tend to inhibit migration of contaminants downward from the shallow aquifer,releasing treated water into the shallow aquifer would likely have the reverse effect contaminants in the shallow aquifer would be pushed downward into the principal aquifer.
defendants sites 
the testimony and evidence at trial also focused on the industrial activities,environmental conditions,and past remediation efforts at defendants sites in the north basin area.richard waddell,a district expert witness,testified that voc had been released into the environment at each site.he concluded that these releases had caused contamination of groundwater,including the shallow aquifer.
each defendant,through expert and percipient testimony,disputed waddell conclusions.aside from northrop,defendants primary arguments were voc had not been released at their sites,they were not responsible for any voc releases that had occurred,or any releases at their sites had not caused voc contamination in groundwater.northrop acknowledged that its sites had potentially contributed to groundwater contamination in the past.it argued,however,that its remediation activities at those sites had removed any potential source of future contamination.the evidence regarding each defendant site or sites will be discussed in turn below.
alcoa leased the site at south state college boulevard in fullerton,california from through,and it has owned the site since then.for decades prior to alcoa tenancy,industrial activities at the site included the use of a large vapor degreaser.the solvents used in this degreaser included tce and pce.alcoa continued to use the degreaser in and after it occupied the site.soil samples taken near the location of the degreaser revealed high concentrations of pce at shallow depths and high concentrations of tce at slightly greater depths.in consultation with the rwqcb,alcoa constructed a soil vapor extraction system to remediate the soil at the site to a depth of feet.the system removed approximately pounds of voc from the soil.
in waddell view,the soil samples showed that releases of pce and tce had occurred at the alcoa site in the area of the former degreaser.because pce and tce were also detected in groundwater beneath the site,and based on the site characteristics and historical sampling data,waddell believed that releases at the alcoa site had contributed to pce and tce contamination of groundwater.on,however,waddell limited his testimony to the opinion that such contamination was possible,there was a physical mechanism by which contamination could have occurred.his opinion was not that voc releases at the alcoa site had actually made their way to groundwater.waddell acknowledged that a nearby upgradient site operated by aerojet,a nonparty,contributed to groundwater pce contamination as well.because the aerojet site was such a large contributor to pce contamination,waddell admitted that the impact of the alcoa site on pce levels in groundwater would be too small to be discernable.
alcoa expert witness,richard weiss,reviewed the available data and determined there was no evidence that voc releases at the alcoa site reached groundwater.he testified that sampling data revealed an approximately gap between the deepest soil voc detection and groundwater below the alcoa site.weiss explained that if voc had migrated to groundwater,they would have been detected in the soil in a reasonably continuous manner.as a further basis for his opinion,weiss cited the composition of the soil under the alcoa site,which impeded downward migration of voc,and the chemical signature of the voc detected in groundwater,which differed from the chemical signature of the voc released at the alcoa site.instead,the chemical signature of voc in groundwater matched the chemical signature of voc released from the aerojet site.
arnold owned and operated the site at east orangethorpe avenue in fullerton from through.during that time,arnold operated one or more vapor degreasers,clarifiers,and dip tanks or strippers at the site.the identity of the voc used in the degreasers and dip tanks was the subject of conflicting testimony at trial.clarifiers do not themselves make use of voc solvents,but they can be a source of voc discharge into the environment because they may process wastewater generated by other activities.
a former arnold maintenance manager testified that he was aware of only one chemical,used in one arnold degreaser.another former arnold employee,daniel hopen,testified to seeing barrels of chemicals with labels showing both trichloroethylene tce and used in degreasers.on,hopen appeared to waver,stating confidently only that the barrels were labeled.the only relevant chemical in this litigation with the designation is.hopen also recalled other barrels labeled perchloroethylene pce used in arnold dip tanks.permits issued from through identified only as the solvent used in degreasers and stored in a storage tank at the arnold site.other permits did not identify a specific solvent.use of tce was restricted after.in waddell opinion,based on research into arnold activities at the site as well as those of subsequent occupants,arnold used,tce,and pce.
soil samples taken in,approximately a decade after arnold left the site,revealed voc contamination in the shallow soil.for example,high concentrations of pce were found in depths up to feet near a clarifier on the southern side of the arnold site.waddell testified that these sampling results indicated a pce release had occurred at the site.waddell also reviewed evidence of arnold activities at the site including employee testimony,photographs,and brochures and concluded that the arnold handling of voc solvents was likely to cause releases of those voc into the environment.
the property owner at the time attempted to remediate the voc contamination and operated a soil vapor extraction system for several months.additional sampling after this remediation revealed voc contamination extending to greater depths,including feet for pce and feet for tce.in waddell view,these results showed that the remediation was not successful.
further sampling of the shallow soil down to feet below the surface took place in.the sampling revealed pce,tce,and contamination in multiple locations at the arnold site.as noted above,is a degradation product of.the next year,the property owner began remediation with a soil vapor extraction system again.by the time of trial,the system had extracted pounds of voc,the vast majority of which was pce.a small amount of tce was also extracted.the system remained in operation.
the groundwater directly under the arnold site was not tested for voc contaminants.monitoring wells at an adjacent property,the nonparty johnson controls site,revealed voc contamination in groundwater.waddell believed that this contamination was the result of voc releases at the arnold site rather than the johnson controls site.in,the district retrieved grab samples from the shallow aquifer both upgradient and downgradient of the arnold site.concentrations of tce were higher in grab samples downgradient of the arnold site.based on this and other data,waddell concluded that the arnold site contributed tce and to contamination in groundwater.concentrations of pce were relatively stable,and waddell was limited at trial to the opinion that the arnold site did not contribute to pce contamination in groundwater 
arnold expert witness,jonathan rohrer,reviewed the evidence and concluded that arnold had used only in its operations.rohrer further concluded that arnold operations at the site had not caused any discharge of voc into soil or groundwater.rohrer based his conclusion on the arnold use of only,the soil and groundwater data surrounding the site,the lack of documented chemical releases into soil during arnold operations,and the presence of several properties upgradient of the arnold site.he identified subsequent occupants of the arnold site as possible contributors to voc contamination based on their activities and the recovery of numerous barrels of hazardous waste from the site.rohrer admitted that voc contamination in the shallow soil at the arnold site indicated that pce and tce had been released there by someone,but he did not agree arnold was responsible.
rohrer criticized waddell reliance on grab samples and disagreed that the data showed the arnold site contributed tce to groundwater.rohrer testified that the locations of the grab samples were inadequate to distinguish the contribution of the arnold site to voc contamination from the contributions of the upgradient sites.waddell,for his part,agreed that sampling at the site was inadequate to fully characterize the voc contamination there.
separately,rohrer modeled the potential contribution of contaminants from the arnold site.this model was based on the district interpretation of the grab samples and its estimates of the amounts of contaminants that would be remediated by its extraction wells.rohrer cautioned that his model was based on the assumption that the upgradient and downgradient differentials in the district grab samples were attributable to the arnold site,an assumption rohrer had criticized as unfounded.rohrer concluded,based on his model,that the arnold site contributed approximately grams of voc contamination pce,tce,and to the daily amount that would be remediated by the nbgpp.
cbs owned and operated the site at south raymond avenue in fullerton from to.the site housed the fender electric instrument company,which cbs purchased in.a cbs subsidiary purchased the adjacent site at east valencia in,and cbs expanded its holdings at that address the next year.cbs sold the property in a portion of the east valencia site,used by cbs partially as a parking lot,has since been subdivided and now bears the address sally place.
cbs operations at south raymond included the use of a degreaser and an storage tank for voc solvent.the solvent cbs used was pce.samples collected from the shallow soil near the degreaser and the storage tank revealed voc contamination.additional samples,taken up to a depth of feet below the surface,showed pce contamination down to feet.pce was also detected in groundwater beneath the site.
at east valencia,cbs operated a dip tank using solvents.although a former cbs employee denied that cbs used pce at the site,shallow soil and groundwater samples revealed pce contamination.waddell admitted that some contamination was the result of an adjacent site nonparty american electronics,but he believed that monitoring well data showed that the east valencia site contributed pce to groundwater as well.waddell observed that concentrations of tce had decreased over time while pce concentrations had increased.in his view,if the american electronics site were the only site contributing pce and tce to groundwater,changes in their concentrations should mirror each other 
at the site now known as sally place,soil samples revealed pce contamination near a former storage area.again,however,a former cbs employee denied that cbs used pce there,and waddell admitted that there was no evidence cbs used or stored pce at that site.
based on the site data and his analyses,waddell opined that cbs had released pce into the environment at the south raymond and east valencia sites.he concluded that those releases had likely resulted in contamination of groundwater at the sites.
cbs expert witness,daniel stephens,disagreed.he concluded that contamination at the sites associated with cbs had not impacted groundwater.stephens based his conclusion on historical data as well as his own investigation of the sites in.stephens agreed the shallow soil around the degreaser and storage tank at the south raymond site was contaminated with pce.but stephens believed that deeper soils were impacted by contamination at another site,most likely chicago musical.he relied primarily on a gap in the detections of pce between the shallow soil and groundwater and differences in the chemistry,the voc profile of the shallow soil when compared to groundwater.stephens criticized waddell for misstating and minimizing the concentrations of voc found at the chicago musical site.
regarding the east valencia site,stephens pointed out that the shallow soil was extensively sampled in,but only one sample detected pce,near the former dip tank at the edge of the property.later,more extensive testing revealed pce contamination to a depth of around feet below the surface at that location.but no contamination was found for approximately feet below that level,until the testing hit groundwater.based on this fact,and his own interpretation of monitoring well data,stephens concluded there was no nexus between the pce contamination found in the shallow soil at the east valencia site and contamination in groundwater.
stephens conclusion was supported by two prior investigations of the east valencia site.in a letter,the rwqcb reviewed the existing data regarding the site and recommended that no further action be taken based on the low concentrations and small amount of mass of voc that are present in the soil and groundwater,the limited volume of groundwater that is impacted at this site,the limited lateral and vertical extent of voc in groundwater,and the existence of an source,this site does not appear to pose a current,significant threat to the beneficial uses of groundwater.similarly,a report commissioned by the of the east valencia site concluded,based on the limited extent of shallow soil pce contamination in the area of the former dip tank,that the data collected during this investigation indicates that groundwater has not likely been impacted by this past release.
for sally place,as with cbs other sites,stephens opined that any voc contamination there did not impact groundwater.stephens based his opinion on soil samples which showed a gap in pce detections before reaching groundwater,the differing chemical profiles of the contamination in shallow soil and in groundwater,and the presence of upgradient sources of contamination.in,the rwqcb issued a no further action letter for the sally place site.the rwqcb confirmed the gap in pce detections,but it determined that pce contamination at the site had impacted groundwater it appears that volatile organic compounds are not present in the soil at concentrations that would require remediation or that would pose a significant threat to groundwater quality.however,the presence of pce in a groundwater sample from the low spot area indicates that pce from the site has impacted groundwater quality.stephens analyzed the historical uses of sally place by cbs and determined that the low spot identified by the rwqcb was created after cbs sold the property.stephens therefore opined that any such contamination was caused by subsequent occupants.
crucible owned and operated the site at east orangethorpe avenue in fullerton from the late until.crucible admitted using the solvents tce and in an immersion degreaser at the site.the solvents were stored at a separate location on the site.shallow soil sampling conducted in showed the presence of pce,tce,and.the next year,a limited amount of soil was excavated in an effort to partially remediate a portion of the site.additional sampling occurred in and,specifically in the areas surrounding the degreaser and chemical storage area.the sampling revealed contamination with pce,tce,and in both areas.no contamination was found at feet below the surface,however,and the sampling did not proceed to depths below that level.
based on this data,waddell concluded that crucible had released not only tce and,but also pce,into the soil at the degreaser and the chemical storage area.as noted above,is a degradation product of.although the chemical storage area was adjacent to a site occupied by nonparty vista paint,which was also contaminated,waddell determined that the soil contamination came from the crucible site based on its chemical profile 
a groundwater monitoring well on the site of nonparty ac products,located approximately feet from the crucible site,detected voc contamination in groundwater.the district conducted further sampling at locations surrounding the crucible site.the sampling detected pce,tce,and in perched groundwater,to feet below the surface,and pce,tce,and in the shallow aquifer as well,to feet below the surface.waddell observed that the chemical profile of the voc found in soil sampling at the site was similar to the chemical profiles of the perched groundwater and aside from,which had degraded into the shallow aquifer.based on this data,as well as data from the ac products monitoring well,waddell opined that voc releases at the crucible site had caused contamination of both the perched groundwater and the shallow aquifer.waddell further opined that soil contamination at the crucible site was a continuing source of groundwater contamination.
on,waddell admitted that many of the recent samplings had revealed relatively low levels of contamination.he acknowledged that the crucible site was not a major impact site.waddell was unable to quantify the amount of voc groundwater contamination caused by the crucible site and did not calculate the amount of voc contamination from that site that the nbgpp would remediate.
crucible expert,andrew kopania,acknowledged that crucible had used pce,tce,and at the site.he also admitted that those voc had been released into the soil at the crucible site.but he concluded there was no evidence that voc releases at the crucible site had impacted groundwater or migrated to downgradient monitoring wells.kopania determined that the soil sampling conducted in,and showed only modest shallow soil contamination rather than the type of significant release that would migrate down to the shallow aquifer.he also observed that there were no consistent detections of contamination from the shallow soil down to groundwater.
the environmental consulting firm that conducted the sampling reached the same conclusion.in its report,the firm wrote,the firm recommends that no further action be required for this site.it has been clearly demonstrated that the low concentrations of voc,where present beneath the site,do not present a threat to human health or groundwater beneath the site.the dtsc accepted the firm conclusion and agreed no further investigation was necessary.
kopania criticized waddell reliance on the district sampling because they were grab samples.kopania testified that grab samples are not accepted by regulatory agencies as adequate to characterize contamination at a site.
kopania believed that voc contamination in the shallow aquifer at the crucible site was caused by the adjacent vista paint site.kopania analysis of chemical signatures,particularly the concentration of the voc stabilizer,showed consistency between the contamination in groundwater and the contamination at the vista paint site.kopania also believed,based on the voc composition of the contamination,that other sites upgradient of the crucible site,including the ac products site,also caused contamination.
northrop owned and operated three sites in the project area east orangethorpe avenue referred to as emd,north orangethorpe park kester solder,and east orangethorpe avenue,all in anaheim,california.northrop owned the emd site from until and occupied the site for the vast bulk of that time.northrop acquired the corporate owner of the kester solder site,litton industries litton,in or.litton had owned and occupied the site since.northrop occupied the site from until.it owned the site from until.
northrop operated several degreasers at the emd site and admitted using tce,and there.at the time operations at the emd site ceased in,soil sampling revealed extensive voc contamination.northrop undertook remediation of the emd site under the supervision of the rwqcb.all existing buildings at the site were demolished.northrop installed and operated a soil vapor extraction system in the area of greatest contamination.after completing that extraction process,northrop excavated soil in the area down a depth of approximately feet below the surface,including a clay layer feet in thickness.the resulting excavation was filled with soil from offsite.after remediation,the rwqcb reviewed soil and groundwater data from the site to determine whether the remaining contamination posed a threat to groundwater.the rwqcb concluded it did not.in a letter,the rwqcb wrote,the data from the soil investigation and remediation activities that have taken place indicate that the voc that remain in the soil at the site do not appear to be present in concentrations that would result in a significant impact on water quality.while the rwqcb concluded that shallow groundwater at the site had been affected by onsite voc contamination,the rwqcb believed that contamination in deeper groundwater may have originated from offsite sources because the concentration of contaminants in the deeper groundwater was higher than the concentration in shallow groundwater.following further groundwater monitoring,the rwqcb repeated its conclusion in several years of site monitoring have indicated that contaminants in the groundwater beneath the site probably originate from an source.
the district performed additional soil and groundwater sampling in at locations selected by its expert witness waddell.the soil samples showed voc contamination at or below northrop remediation goal of one part per million.the groundwater samples showed relatively low levels of contamination.
based on these investigations,waddell opined that northrop had released tce and at the emd site.waddell also opined that these releases remained a source of groundwater contamination with tce,and.waddell opinion relied upon his analysis of the degradation time of into,the continued presence of contaminated groundwater under the site,and other factors.
waddell believed that groundwater contamination from the emd site would be captured by at least one,and possibly three,extraction wells as part of the nbgpp.on,however,waddell admitted that it would take approximately one to two years for groundwater under the emd site to migrate to the district extraction wells.groundwater flowing under the emd site prior to that time would therefore not be captured by the extraction wells.
northrop expert witness on site conditions,glenn tofani,testified that any contamination at the emd site would not impact the shallow aquifer.tofani based his opinion on a comparison of the concentrations of voc contaminants at monitoring wells upgradient and downgradient of the site,groundwater voc concentrations at the site,and the results of the district groundwater sampling.among other observations,tofani determined that voc concentrations in groundwater downgradient of the emd site were similar to upgradient concentrations,both historically and in.waddell admitted that the groundwater samples showed voc concentrations consistent with upgradient sources.tofani also refuted waddell conclusion that the degradation time of into showed that the emd site was a source of groundwater contamination.based on tofani analysis,the contamination originated from a source several thousand feet upgradient of the site 
at the kester solder site,litton the prior owner stored and repackaged pce.testing revealed pce contamination in the shallow soil,perched groundwater,and shallow aquifer.it was undisputed at trial that pce had been released at the site.
with the approval of the rwqcb,northrop installed and operated a soil vapor extraction system to remediate voc contamination at the kester solder site.the system operated between and.during that time,it removed almost pounds of voc.the rwqcb issued a no further action letter at the kester solder site in.voc contamination in perched groundwater remains,however,and northrop is currently working with the rwqcb to formulate a remediation plan for that contamination as well.
based on northrop initial testing,waddell concluded that pce from the kester solder site had reached the shallow aquifer.waddell testified that contamination at the kester solder site had created a plume of pce contamination that had reached one of the district extraction wells and would be remediated by that well if the ngbpp were constructed.based on comparisons between the pce contamination in upgradient and downgradient monitoring wells,waddell believed the kester solder site particularly contamination in perched groundwater continued to contribute to pce contamination in the shallow aquifer.
tofani agreed that the kester solder site had contributed to pce contamination in the shallow aquifer in the past.but he concluded that northrop soil remediation had removed the site as a source for further pce contamination.his conclusion was supported by his own analysis of the concentrations of pce contamination in upgradient and downgradient monitoring wells.his analysis found there was no increase in pce concentrations as groundwater flowed beneath the kester solder site.moreover,even if the kester solder site were still contributing to voc contamination in the shallow aquifer,tofani believed any such contamination would be remediated by a recirculation well northrop had installed at its site,downgradient of the kester solder site.
at its site,northrop operations included a quench tank that was cleaned with solvents and a degreaser.northrop admitted that tce and were among the solvents it used.it was undisputed at trial that tce,and at least a small amount of pce had been released at the site.
after an initial investigation that did not disclose significant contamination,monitoring activities in the early revealed more serious soil and groundwater voc contamination at the site.northrop commissioned a series of tests,including a soil vapor survey and dozens of groundwater monitoring wells,to characterize the nature and extent of voc contamination.northrop developed a remedial action plan consisting of a dual phase soil vapor extraction system.the rwqcb approved the plan in,and northrop began remediation.by the time of trial,the system had removed approximately pounds of voc,with the majority extracted in the first year of the system operation.also with the approval of the rwqcb,northrop installed a treatment and recirculation well at the downgradient edge of the site.the well captured and remediated groundwater in the shallow aquifer.although northrop encountered design hurdles at the beginning of the well operation,the treated water currently released by the well meets drinking water standards.northrop remediation efforts have been reflected in decreasing voc contamination in most downgradient monitoring wells.
waddell reviewed the sampling data and concluded that substantial pce releases had occurred at multiple locations at the site.for one large area of pce contamination,waddell believed the concentration of pce was higher at the site when compared to the adjacent site,occupied by nonparty aero scientific,showing that the release occurred at the site.on,however,waddell admitted that he had interpreted the data incorrectly the concentrations at the aero scientific site were higher than the concentrations at the site,indicating that the release did not occur at northrop site.nonetheless,waddell believed that pce,tce,and and its breakdown products from the site had contaminated groundwater in the shallow aquifer.although northrop recirculation well would capture some onsite contamination,waddell testified it would have no effect on contamination that had already migrated beyond the well.the district nbgpp extraction wells would capture this contamination as well as contamination that continues to flow from the site.
tofani acknowledged that voc contamination remained at the site,notwithstanding northrop remediation efforts.tofani estimated that approximately to pounds or to percent of the total remained to be extracted by northrop soil vapor extraction system.the remaining voc would be extracted by.at that point,in tofani view,the site would no longer be contributing significantly to groundwater contamination and the recirculation well could be decommissioned.
at the time of trial,though,the recirculation well remained in operation,and tofani admitted that it does not capture all of the contamination emanating from the site.because the well captured contamination from upgradient offsite sources,however,tofani testified that northrop efforts achieved a net balance,the recirculation well remediated at least the same amount of offsite contamination as the amount of onsite contamination that escaped remediation.
tofani believed adjacent sites,including aero scientific,had contributed significant amounts of pce and contamination to groundwater under the site.tofani analyzed sampling results at the aero scientific site and determined that a pce release at that site had not only contaminated groundwater but migrated laterally into the shallow soil at the site.while a separate,smaller release of pce had occurred on another portion of the site,tofani concluded that the pce release had not impacted groundwater because it extended only to a depth of to feet below ground surface.
statement of decision 
following trial,the court issued a tentative decision finding in favor of defendants on the statutory causes of action and soliciting responses from the parties regarding potential additional bases for its decision.after several rounds of briefing,the court issued a statement of decision.the statement of decision recounted the history of the litigation,the district allegations,the development of the ngbpp,and the court view of the evidence presented at trial.it also assessed each of the district statutory claims and explained why the district did not prevail.the statement of decision concluded,among other things,that defendants had not caused the district to develop the nbgpp,that the defendants had not caused contamination in the shallow aquifer at all,that the nbgpp was not necessary to address groundwater contamination in the north basin area,that the district had not complied with the ncp during development of the nbgpp,that the district costs were merely investigatory and thus not recoverable under the ocwd act,and that the district was not entitled to a declaration that defendants were liable for future nbgpp costs.
the court spent the bulk of its statement of decision discussing causation under the hsaa.although the court did not explicitly apply its discussion to the district claim under the ocwd act,it appears the court intended its discussion to apply to that statute as well.
the court prefaced its causation analysis with a section entitled weaker evidence and witness credibility.in that section,the court provided an overview of its reasons for distrusting and failing to credit the district evidence,including in particular its expert witness waddell.the court faulted the district for offering weaker evidence where it could have introduced stronger evidence.see evid.code.for example,the court noted that the district did not undertake a mass transport analysis of voc contamination,it did not create an updated map of the voc contamination plumes,it did not calculate natural attenuation rates,and it did not conduct an adequate analysis of the costs and benefits of the nbgpp.the court criticized the district for relying on grab samples to determine the nature and extent of voc contamination at defendants sites and the court questioned waddell credibility in light of the district failure to provide relevant information to him,his creation of a misleading labeling system to characterize the effect of contamination at defendants sites on groundwater,and his use of a misleading demonstrative chart that minimized the amount of contamination at a nonparty site.
the court applied the traditional substantial factor causation standard to the district claims.see,viner sweet cal th,viner.in doing so,the court focused on the nbgpp as a whole.the court found that there was no evidence that the conduct of any one trial defendant,or even the conduct of the trial defendants considered together,was sufficient to necessitate the nbgpp.the court further found,substantial trial evidence demonstrated that the district would have approved the nbgpp even if any one of the trial defendants or even if all trial defendants had not been operating in the nbgpp area.for example,none of the trial defendants caused the nitrate or perchlorate contamination,and that problem was a major factor in the decision to approve the more costly,centralized treatment plan.in sum,the trial defendants activities were not a but for cause of,or a substantial factor in,the district decision to approve a centralized water treatment plan for the nbgpp.
the court made additional factual findings regarding conditions at defendants sites.in general,the court wrote,the weight of the credible trial evidence failed to establish a causal connection between any trial defendant localized releases of hazardous substances into the soil and costs the district has already incurred and might incur in the future.for example,there is no direct evidence of any release of voc to the shallow aquifer in the nbgpp area by any trial defendant except northrop.although the court found northrop historical activities at kester solder and resulted in shallow aquifer contamination,the c ourt finds that northrop,under the rwqcb supervision,has remediated,or is currently remediating,those contaminant releases to levels exceeding those contemplated by the nbgpp,without the district reasonably incurring any remediation or removal expenses.
as to the alcoa site,the court concluded that any voc releases there did not impact the shallow aquifer no voc of any kind were detected at the alcoa site in the main soil borings between the water table and a point approximately feet above the water table.alcoa expert,richard weiss,testified without contradiction that if voc passed through the soil column underneath the alcoa site and into the shallow aquifer,there would have been detectable amounts of voc in the lower soil.in addition,the soil composition at the site made migration down to the shallow aquifer unlikely thick layers of clay underlying the alcoa site discouraged migration of voc from the soil to the shallow aquifer.given waddell credibility issues,and alcoa successful effort to remediate the soil at the site,the court found the district had not proved causation.
as to arnold,the court weighed the conflicting testimony regarding its tce use and concluded that the district had not shown arnold used that solvent at its site.although arnold acknowledged using,the court determined there is insufficient evidence that arnold caused a release of or into soil.on that basis,the court rejected waddell opinion that arnold operations contaminated groundwater or threaten today to contaminate groundwater.
the court found that the district allegations against cbs were limited to potential pce contamination.for two of cbs three sites,east valencia and sally place,the court concluded that cbs did not use pce at all.and,in any event,pce contamination detected at east valencia did not go all the way from just below the surface to groundwater,indicating that groundwater was unaffected by any contamination there.for the third site,south raymond,the court did not believe that any pce releases at that site impacted groundwater or posed a threat to groundwater.the court credited the testimony of cbs expert witness,daniel stephens,whose investigation showed that pce contamination has dissipated to levels before the water table is reached.the court concluded that voc groundwater contamination at the south raymond site was caused by offsite sources.
as to crucible,the court found that voc contamination at the site did not reach groundwater.the court found the shallow soil sampling,which did not detect voc contamination at feet below the surface,more persuasive than the district grab samples showing deeper contamination.the court determined that voc contamination in deeper soil at the crucible site was likely caused by migration from offsite sources.
the court found that northrop used and released and tce,but not pce,at its emd site.the court reviewed the history of remediation at the site and concluded that the weight of credible evidence supports a finding that the emd site,following remediation in,did not then and does not now present a significant threat to groundwater quality.data collected by the district in demonstrates there is no perceptible contribution from the emd site to groundwater contamination as groundwater passes below emd.the court concluded,the district evidence concerning shallow aquifer contamination or the threat thereof attributable to northrop emd site was not persuasive.
at the kester solder site,the court found,pce was stored,mixed,and repackaged.pce was released on the edge of the site and contaminated shallow soil,perched groundwater,and the shallow aquifer.following northrop remediation efforts,however,the court concluded that the kester solder site was no longer a source of potential groundwater contamination and is not contributing to pce contamination in the shallow aquifer.while the court acknowledged that perched groundwater at the site remains contaminated and northrop is attempting further remediation,the court rejected waddell opinion that the site remains a source of groundwater contamination.instead,the court was persuaded by northrop expert witness,glenn tofani.even if the kester solder site were still causing groundwater contamination,the court believed northrop recirculation well at its site would capture any such contamination.
regarding the site,the court found,without dispute,tce was released that has impacted groundwater.pce,however was not used by northrop at.while pce was found in shallow soil at the site,the court concluded based on testing data that is not a source of pce groundwater contamination.the court found that northrop remediation efforts had been largely successful,with percent of voc contamination having been removed from the soil and a recirculation well treating the shallow aquifer to drinking water standards.the court concluded,at the time of trial it was estimated that remediation of the perched zone would be completed by,at which point the circulation well will no longer be necessary because the site will no longer be a source of elevated voc.
the court statement of decision also considered whether any nbgpp costs should be allocated to defendants.the court found that certain contaminants,such as nitrate and perchlorate,were introduced by the district groundwater recharge activities,which involved among other things discharging contaminated colorado river water into the north basin area.regarding voc contamination,the court wrote,the evidence is overwhelming that many entities other than the trial defendants contributed to voc releases into the soil and groundwater in the nbgpp area.in addition,the district recharge activities contributed not only to voc contamination in the shallow aquifer,but also contributed to the commingling of voc contaminants,making it more difficult,if not impossible,to determine the potentially responsible party.the court further finds that the conduct of the district and entities other than the trial defendants are a substantial factor in the district decision to develop the nbgpp.there is no factual basis for allocation of responsibility for past or future expenditures among the trial defendants or as between one or more trial defendant and the district.
with respect to the district claim under the hsaa specifically,the court determined that it was required to show that the nbgpp was consistent with the ncp,the federal regulations governing remedial environmental actions,in order to recover.et the court found that the nbgpp was not consistent with the ncp because the district did not involve the public in selection of the remedy for voc contamination in the north basin the district did not adequately undertake required investigations,including a remedial investigation,a feasibility study,and a conceptual site model and the district did not show the nbgpp was a response to contamination in the north basin.
the court articulated four bases for its rejection of the district claim under the ocwd act.first,the court found that the district had not satisfied the preconditions for cost recovery under the statute.the court interpreted the ocwd act to allow cost recovery under two situations either the contamination must be cleaned up or contained or the effects thereof abated or necessary action must have been taken to address threatened contamination.ocwd act,subd.c.as to the first situation,the court found that the nbgpp had not yet been implemented,so the district had not yet cleaned up,contained,or abated any contamination.as to the second situation,the court found that the consequences of the contamination were not urgent enough to qualify as a threat.second,the court found that funds already expended by the district were merely investigatory and thus not recoverable under the ocwd act.ocwd act,subds.a c.third,the court found that the nbgpp was not a reasonable response to contamination in the north basin area.fourth,the court found that the nbgpp was not a necessary response to contamination in the north basin area,the district did not show each trial defendant conduct was a substantial factor in the decision to develop the nbgpp.
the court rejected the district request for a declaration holding defendants liable for future nbgpp costs because it found the district did not adequately investigate the need for the ngbpp including its failure to create updated maps of voc contamination,analyze the threat to the deep aquifer,and calculate natural attenuation rates the district did not adequately assess the costs and benefits of the nbgpp,particularly after the cost increased to over million the nbgpp was not necessary to protect the deep aquifer or remediate voc contamination the shallow aquifer and the district did not adequately consider the effects of source removal on voc contamination levels in the north basin area.the source removal referenced by the court included defendants remedial actions and the efforts of nonparties to remediate other sites in consultation with various regulatory bodies.
after summarizing its conclusions,the court found in favor of defendants,and against the district,on its claims under the ocwd act and the hsaa and for declaratory relief.the court further found that each defendant was entitled to a judicial declaration that it has no liability to the district for damages,response costs,or other costs claimed by the district,or any future costs associated with the nbgpp.
the district legal claims 
three months after the court statement of decision,defendants filed a motion for judgment on the district remaining claims for negligence,nuisance,and trespass.defendants argued that the court causation findings in its statement of decision would apply in any jury trial on the district claims.in defendants view,these findings precluded recovery on the district claims for negligence,nuisance,and trespass because those claims each required a showing of causation 
the district opposed.analogizing to principles of collateral estoppel,the district argued that the court causation findings were not essential to its decision because it found alternative bases to rule in favor of defendants and they were not identical to the findings required on its remaining claims because they do not require the same showing of causation.the district also argued that new facts had arisen after the bench trial,including additional evidence of continuing groundwater contamination by the crucible site and northrop site.the district contended these new facts prevented the court from applying its prior findings on causation to the district remaining claims.as to northrop,the district additionally contended that a jury could award damages for past voc contamination,investigatory costs notwithstanding the court causation findings.
the court granted the motion for judgment.it agreed that the district claims for negligence,nuisance,and trespass required the district to establish causation as to each defendant.given the court causation findings in its statement of decision,it found that the district could not prevail on its remaining claims.the court did not believe the district was entitled to offer new evidence in support of its claims.
following further briefing,the court entered judgment in favor of defendants,and against the district,on each of the district causes of action.the judgment included a declaration that defendants have no liability to the district for damages,response costs,or other costs claimed by the district,or any future costs.the district appeals.
discussion 
hsaaa.overview 
the district challenges the court judgment on its hsaa claim.it primarily contends the court prejudicially erred by misinterpreting the elements of the claim,including causation,necessity of response costs,and ncp consistency.the hsaa is california counterpart to the federal comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla et,national union fire ins.cal th,fn.among other things,it implements california responsibilities under cercla superfund program and establishes a hazardous substance account to fund environmental remediation actions and related efforts.city of lodi randtron th,city of lodi bkhn,department of health services th,fn.
the hsaa also includes a private right of action.it provides,in relevant part,that a person who has incurred response or corrective action costs in accordance with this chapter,chapter commencing with section,or the federal act may seek contribution or indemnity from any person who is liable pursuant to this chapter.health saf.code,subd.d.the scope of this private right of action is at issue in the appeal.
the hsaa adopts cercla standards for determining liability responsible party or liable person,for the purposes of this chapter,means those persons described in section a of the federal act a.health saf.code,subd.a see gregory village partners,chevron.d,a claim under the hsaa has the same elements as a claim under cercla.
as relevant here,cercla imposes liability on the owner or operator of a vessel or a facility,or any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of,from which there is a release,or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs,of a hazardous substance a.a liable person is responsible for,among other things,all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the united states government or a state or an indian tribe not inconsistent with the national contingency plan any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan and damages for injury to,destruction of,or loss of natural resources,including the reasonable costs of assessing such injury,destruction,or loss resulting from such a release.a a c.
under cercla and the hsaa,t o prevail in a private cost recovery action,a plaintiff must establish that the site on which the hazardous substances are contained is a facility under cercla definition of the term,section,a release or threatened release of any hazardous substance from the facility has occurred,a such release or threatened release has caused the plaintiff to incur response costs that were necessary and consistent with the national contingency plan,a and a b and the defendant is within one of four classes of persons subject to the liability provisions of section a a.carson harbor village,unocal cir,carson harbor i en banc.
once these elements are proven,an hsaa defendant is strictly liable for recoverable costs health saf.code,subd.c unless the defendant establishes an applicable defense,subd.b or the circumstances justify apportionment,subds.a b.a similar scheme exists under cercla potentially responsible parties under cercla are strictly liable for cleanup costs,citation,subject only to the statute narrow defenses for damages caused solely by acts of god,war,or third parties.westfarm associates washington suburban sanitary com.cir,see b.as noted,the hsaa largely incorporates cercla defenses.health saf.code,subd.b.
b.the district ability to bring suit under the hsaa 
before we reach the district challenge,we will consider a threshold issue raised by defendants,which appears to be one of first impression can the district bring a suit for cost recovery under the hsaa at all although defendants did not raise this argument in the trial court,we will exercise our discretion to consider it because it raises a pure question of law,the facts surrounding which are undisputed and could not be altered by the presentation of additional evidence.see in re marriage of priem th.
to put the parties arguments in context,we will briefly review the purposes and scope of the hsaa.the hsaa objectives are the following a establish a program to provide for response authority for releases of hazardous substances,including spills and hazardous waste disposal sites that pose a threat to the public health or the environment.b compensate persons,under certain circumstances,for medical expenses and lost wages or business income resulting from injuries proximately caused by exposure to releases of hazardous substances.c make available adequate funds in order to permit the state of california to assure payment of its share of the costs mandated pursuant to section c of the federal act c.health saf.code.
to implement these purposes,hsaa provides a comprehensive and detailed scheme to ensure the timely and cleanup of hazardous substance release sites.it establishes authority,procedures,and standards to carry out the investigation,removal and remediation of contaminated sites health saf.code,subds.a and c,issue and enforce a removal or remedial action order to any responsible party,subds.a and f,impose administrative or civil penalties for noncompliance of an order,recover costs and expenses incurred by the dtsc in carrying out hsaa,subd.a,determine by binding arbitration the apportionment of liability of a responsible party id,seek contribution from other responsible parties,and apply for compensation of loss caused by the release of a hazardous substance,to.city of lodi,supra,th at.
the focus of the statutory scheme is the dtsc,which has the sole authority to administer the statewide program for the remediation of hazardous waste contamination at sites identified for remediation under the hsaa.city of lodi,supra,th at.once dtsc has confirmed that contamination at a particular site poses a significant threat to human health or safety or to the environment and lists the site in its published list of hazardous substance release sites,the problem is designated as one of statewide concern,requiring application of uniform standards,procedures,and remedies subject to the jurisdiction of dtsc.ibid.in appropriate cases,the relevant rwqcb may also have authority over a specific site.health saf.code,subd.h,subds.a,b,c.
in addition to defining the dtsc and rwqcb role,the hsaa provides for a private right of action,as noted above.the relevant provision reads in full as follows a person who has incurred response or corrective action costs in accordance with this chapter,chapter commencing with section,or the federal act may seek contribution or indemnity from any person who is liable pursuant to this chapter.an action to enforce a claim may be brought as a by any defendant in an action brought pursuant to section or this section,or in a separate action after the person seeking contribution or indemnity has paid response or corrective action costs in accordance with this chapter,chapter commencing with section,or the federal act.a plaintiff or seeking contribution or indemnity shall give written notice to the director upon filing an action or under this section.in resolving claims for contribution or indemnity,the court may allocate costs among liable parties using appropriate equitable factors.health saf.code,subd.d.
the parties dispute revolves around the word indemnity as it is used in this statute.defendants contend the word indemnity limits plaintiffs who sue under the statute to an action for traditional equitable indemnity,only plaintiffs who are liable for response or corrective action costs under the hsaa enjoy the right to sue.entities with no potential liability volunteers do not.see,union pacific wengert th,describing traditional equitable indemnity.the district contends the word indemnity simply means reimbursement,and any plaintiff who incurs costs to clean up a hazardous substance release may recover those costs from a party who is liable under the hsaa.
this issue is one of statutory interpretation.our fundamental task in interpreting a statute is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.we first examine the statutory language,giving it a plain and commonsense meaning.we do not examine that language in isolation,but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment.if the language is clear,courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the legislature did not intend.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th.
as an initial matter,we note that the language of the statute would appear to accommodate either interpretation of indemnity offered by the parties.the only limitation on plaintiffs who may sue under the statute is that a plaintiff must have incurred response or corrective action costs under the hsaa or cercla.health saf.code,subd.d.the phrase any person who is liable refers to prospective defendants,not plaintiffs.ibid.the remainder of the statutory language concerns procedure,and it could apply equally to actions for traditional equitable indemnity or simple cost recovery actions.although the final sentence of the statute contemplates equitable apportionment among liable parties,the language does not imply that such equitable apportionment must occur in all cases or that a suit may not be brought unless such equitable apportionment is possible.
we must therefore focus on the word indemnity.the plain meaning of the term supports the district interpretation.black law dictionary defines indemnity broadly as a duty to make good any loss,damage,or liability incurred by another,t he right of an injured party to claim reimbursement for its loss,damage,or liability from a person who has such a duty,and r eimbursement or compensation for loss,damage,or liability in tort black law dict.ed.the dictionary provides several different examples of indemnity,including contractual indemnity,equitable indemnity,implied indemnity,and statutory indemnity.ibid.the plain meaning of the term is not limited to defendants narrow interpretation.
the hsaa private right of action appears to be an instance of statutory indemnity,which black law dictionary defines as i ndemnity conferred by legislation and cites as an example the common statutory obligation of corporations to indemnity their personnel.black law,supra.in california,for example,an employer has a general statutory obligation to indemnify its employees under many circumstances an employer shall indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties,or of his or her obedience to the directions of the employer,even though unlawful lab.code,subd.a,italics added.similarly,a depositor must indemnify the depositary for expenses and damages caused by the thing deposited civ.code,italics added,and the detriment caused by wrongful conversion of personal property may be an amount sufficient to indemnify the party injured,italics added.in none of these causes must a plaintiff establish the elements of traditional equitable indemnity to recover the indemnification described in the statutes.see stowe fritzie hotels,cal d,applying civil code section machinists auto.trades dist.lodge util.trailers sales d,applying labor code section myers stephens d,applying civil code section.
defendants rely on our supreme court statement that there are only two basic types of indemnity express indemnity and equitable indemnity.prince pacific gas electric cal th.in this context,the supreme court explained,e xpress indemnity refers to an obligation that arises by virtue of express contractual language establishing a duty in one party to save another harmless upon the occurrence of specified circumstances.id.at.defendants implication appears to be that statutory indemnity,as embodied in the disputed provision of the hsaa,does not exist in california.
defendants misinterpret the supreme court discussion.the supreme court considered the parties potential indemnification obligations independent of any statutory enactment.it did not foreclose the possibility that an indemnification obligation may arise by statute.indeed,cases interpreting the statutes cited above,and similar statutes,refer to the obligations imposed thereunder as statutory indemnity.see,crouse brobeck,phleger harrison th,janken gm hughes electronics th,fn.other statutes that impose a reimbursement obligation without using the words indemnify or indemnification are similarly described as statutory indemnity statutes.see,gattuso shoppers,cal th,daza los angeles community college district th,kantor housing authority of fresno county th.it is clear that the concept of statutory indemnity exists in california law.defendants contention that the reference to indemnity in the hsaa can only refer to traditional equitable indemnification is therefore unpersuasive 
the statute use of the term indemnity to mean reimbursement is consistent with the meaning of that term in cercla jurisprudence.under cercla,it is well established that a nonliable or volunteer plaintiff may bring a private cause of action for cost recovery.a united states atlantic research,atlantic research kaufman bay unisys.such a private right of action by a nonliable party has been described as an indemnity the language of cercla suggests congress planned that an innocent party be able to sue for full recovery of its costs,indemnity under a,while a party that is itself liable may recover only those costs exceeding its pro rata share of the entire cleanup expenditure,contribution under f.bedford affiliates sills cir,bedford affiliates,italics added.
our review of the legislative history of this provision reveals no reason to depart from this analysis and limit the private right of action under health and safety code section,subdivision d to plaintiffs seeking traditional equitable indemnity.to the extent the legislative history sheds any light on the legislature intent,it shows that the indemnification described in this section extends to nonliable parties like the district.for example,the statute as originally enacted limited the private right of action to any person found liable under this chapter.stats,ch.the next year,however,the legislature removed this liability limitation,allowing a ny person who has incurred removal or remedial action costs in accordance with this chapter to seek contribution or indemnification.stats,ch.although the statute underwent several additional revisions,the legislature did not reinsert language limiting the private right of action to only liable parties.
defendants point to language in a treatise that purports to identify the limits of the hsaa private right of action unlike cercla,there is no express statutory authorization for private actions for enforcement under the hsaa.miller starr,cal.real estate ed,fn.omitted.but private actions for enforcement analogous to cercla private enforcement action,are different from actions for indemnity,as the treatise goes on to explain however,such actions are possible to recover indemnity or contribution once the costs are paid,even though the private owner could not sue for loss of use or lost profits damages.miller starr,fn.omitted.
of more direct relevance,the treatise states under the heading contribution or indemnity the following anyone found liable for cleanup costs who has entered into an agreement with the dtsc,or who is in compliance with an order issued by the department,and who establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she was only liable for a portion of the costs,may seek contribution and indemnity from any other person liable under the statute.miller starr,cal.real estate,supra,fn.omitted.while the treatise cites the statute at issue in this appeal,the treatise appears to conflate the various subdivisions of the section,each of which addresses different circumstances.for example,subdivision a provides that a party found liable for costs recoverable under this chapter who establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that only a portion of those costs are attributable to that party actions shall be required to pay only for that portion.health saf.code,subd.a,italics added.although subdivision a does not mention actions for contribution or indemnity,the treatise imports this language of liability into its discussion of such actions.to the extent the treatise purports to define the complete set of plaintiffs who may bring a private cause of action for indemnity under subdivision d,we disagree that the ability to bring such an action is limited to liable persons.we reject defendants contention that the district may not bring an action for cost recovery under the hsaa 
c.the merits of the district hsaa claim 
we next consider the merits of the district hsaa claim and its contention that the court misinterpreted the elements of that claim.the district contention presents a pure question of law,primarily statutory interpretation,which we review de novo.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,shamrock foods central valley general hospital smith th,central valley under the general rules applicable to a trial court statement of decision,an appellate court independently reviews questions of law and applies the substantial evidence standard to findings of fact.
as we have discussed,the hsaa provides that a plaintiff may seek contribution or indemnity from any person who is liable pursuant to this chapter.health saf.code,subd.d.the elements of a private hsaa claim are the following the site on which the hazardous substances are contained is a facility under cercla definition of the term,section,a release or threatened release of any hazardous substance from the facility has occurred,a such release or threatened release has caused the plaintiff to incur response costs that were necessary and consistent with the national contingency plan,a and a b and the defendant is within one of four classes of persons subject to the liability provisions of section a a.carson harbor i,supra,at.
the district contends the trial court misinterpreted the third element causation.the district makes two interrelated arguments,which we will consider separately.
the district first argues that the court erroneously required the district to prove that each defendant released or threatened to release hazardous waste that caused the district to incur response costs.as we will explain,the district is correct that it was not required to prove a causal connection between a release by each defendant and its response costs.instead,the district must establish a causal connection between a release or threatened release at a site regardless of its source and the district response costs.whether a given defendant is liable for releases or threatened releases at that site is determined by the fourth element,which identifies classes of potentially responsible parties based on their relationship to the site.
the district next argues that the court erroneously required the district to show that each defendant was a substantial factor in the district decision to develop the entire nbgpp.again,we agree.the district was required to show only that a release or threatened release at a defendant site was a substantial factor in the district decision to incur some response costs.
although we agree the trial court erred in interpreting the element of causation,we conclude there is no reasonable probability the court would have found the district had proved this element as to alcoa,arnold,cbs,and crucible.as to northrop,however,we conclude there is a reasonable probability the court would have made such a finding.we will explain the bases for these conclusions in the following parts 
versus causation 
we agree with the district first argument that the court erroneously required it to show that each defendant caused the district response costs.instead,it is only required to show a release or threatened release from a site and a causal connection between that release or threatened release and its response costs.v irtually every court that has considered this question has held that a cercla plaintiff need not establish a direct causal connection between the defendant hazardous substances and the release or the plaintiff incurrence of response costs.united states alcan aluminum cir,alcan aluminum see state of new york shore realty cir,shore realty.it is clear from the text,structure,and legislative history of that the provision does not require a plaintiff to show that a particular defendant caused either the release or the incurrence of response costs in order to prove liability.kalamazoo river study group menasha cir,kalamazoo river.
the causation requirement under cercla and hsaa is therefore independent of a given defendant.kalamazoo river,supra,at.it focuses on whether there was a release or threatened release at the site or facility at issue,not whether the defendant caused the release or threatened release.for purposes of the third element,a plaintiff need prove only that a release or threatened release occurred at the site that caused the plaintiff to incur necessary response costs.carson harbor i,supra,at.
whether a given defendant is liable is governed by the fourth element.this element identifies several categories of potentially liable defendants or,in cercla terminology,potentially responsible parties.these categories include persons who might otherwise not be considered liable under traditional tort theories,current owners and operators of a contaminated site.see a.these categories are based on the defendant relationship to the site,not the defendant relationship to the release or threatened release that caused the incurrence of response costs.see alcan aluminum,supra,at t he version of cercla ultimately passed by congress imposed liability upon a class of responsible persons without regard to whether the person specifically caused or contributed to the release and the resultant response costs.asarco llc nl industries.d,asarco once the connection between the defendant and a hazardous waste site has been established because the defendant fits into one of the four categories of responsible parties,it is enough that response costs resulted from a release or threatened release not necessarily the defendant release or threatened release.
the lack of a causal connection between a defendant actions and the release or threatened release that caused the incurrence of response costs is instead an affirmative defense that the defendant must prove.cercla provides,there shall be no liability under subsection a of this section for a person otherwise liable who can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance and the damages resulting therefrom were caused solely by an act or omission of a third party under specified circumstances.b.this defense has been incorporated into the hsaa.health saf.code,subd.b see,subd.a.requiring a plaintiff to prove that a release or threatened release by the defendant caused the incurrence of response costs would render this affirmative defense superfluous.kalamazoo river,supra,at alcan aluminum,supra,at shore realty,supra,at.
although the district acknowledges it must show that a release or threatened release occurred at defendants sites that caused it to incur necessary response costs,as discussed in the foregoing authorities,it contends the standard for causation in this context is relaxed.it argues that plaintiff need show only that it incurred response costs in cleaning up pollution at the site which is of a similar kind to the pollution generated by the defendant.the district is incorrect.it confuses the showing under third element causation with the fourth element potentially liable parties.the primary authority cited by the district,united states monsanto cir.monsanto,considered scope of the fourth element,specifically the potential liability of generator defendants under section a of title of the united states code.monsanto,supra,at.a generator defendant is liable if a plaintiff proves it is a person who by contract,agreement,or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment,or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment,of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person,by any other party or entity,at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances.a.in that context,monsanto explained that cercla imposes liability on defendants who generated hazardous substances at one site and arranged for disposal of the hazardous substances at another site,so long as the defendant hazardous substances were chemically similar to those released or threatened to be released at the disposal site.monsanto,supra,at fn.cercla plaintiffs must present evidence that a generator defendant waste was shipped to a site and that hazardous substances similar to those contained in the defendant waste remained present at the time of release.regardless of monsanto interpretation of the fourth element for generator defendants,the third element must still be satisfied.united states wade,also cited by the district,involved generator defendants,like monsanto,and it is unpersuasive for the same reasons.
asarco,on which the district also relies,does not support the district relaxed causation standard either.asarco rejected the requirement that a cercla plaintiff prove that a particular defendant release caused a plaintiff response costs.asarco,supra,d at rejecting trac ing or fingerprint ing a particular defendant hazardous waste.as we have discussed,cercla does not require such a showing.but,asarco confirms that a cercla plaintiff must still prove that an actual or threatened release caused its response costs under cercla third element.asarco,supra,d at response costs must be caused by an actual or threatened release.
the district claims artesian water government of new castle county.artesian water supports its position.again,however,this case confirms that cercla requires a showing of causation as part of its third element cercla strict liability scheme does not diminish the necessity of demonstrating a causal connection between a release or threatened release and the incurrence of costs by a plaintiff.citations.plaintiff must therefore show that it incurred costs as a result of the release or threatened release of hazardous substances from the site.id.at.artesian water expressly confirmed that traditional tort principles of causation,including causation where multiple sources may have contributed to contamination,govern cercla causation requirement.id.at see thomas fag bearings,granting summary judgment because plaintiff could not show the release at issue caused groundwater contamination.cercla departure from traditional tort principles can be found in the omission of the defendant from its causation requirement,which as we have discussed focuses on whether a release caused plaintiff response costs,rather than whether a defendant caused plaintiff response costs 
the trial court statement of decision is ambiguous with respect to the element of causation.in its initial treatment of the elements of the district hsaa claim,the court correctly quoted the four cercla elements from a federal district court case.castaic lake water agency whittaker.d,castaic lake.the court correctly noted that it must determine whether a release occurred at the sites in question not whether each individual defendant caused a release and whether such a release caused the district to incur response costs.after this initial statement,however,the trial court shifted its focus.the court repeatedly and incorrectly characterized the district burden as follows the district had the burden to provide causation as to each trial defendant,a causal connection between each trial defendant conduct and the district response costs.in finding against the district,the court concluded,the weight of credible trial evidence failed to establish a causal connection between any trial defendant localized releases of hazardous substances into the soil and costs the district has already incurred and might incur in the future.by focusing on the conduct of each defendant,rather than the releases at each defendant site,the court in these latter passages held the district to an incorrect causation standard.we will discuss the consequences of this error,and additional findings by the trial court,with respect to each defendant in parts,post 
some versus all response costs 
as noted,the district also contends the trial court erred by requiring it to show that each defendant conduct was a substantial factor in the district decision to develop the entire nbgpp.we agree.cercla and the hsaa require only that the district show that a release or threatened release caused some necessary response costs,not that the release caused all costs incurred by the district in responding to a multitude of releases.see carson harbor i,supra,at santa clara valley water district olin.d,cases within the ninth circuit support the conclusion that a cercla prima facie case requires a plaintiff to show that a release caused the incurrence of some response costs but it does not require that the release cause all of the recoverable response costs.once the district has shown a release or threatened release caused it to incur some necessary response costs,the causation standard is satisfied.each defendant is responsible for those costs caused by the release or threatened release for which it is liable 
the trial court statement of decision does not conform to these legal principles.the court described the district burden as follows t he district had the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that each trial defendant caused or threatened to cause groundwater contamination and that but for each defendant conduct,the nbgpp would not have been necessary.stated another way,the district had the burden to prove that each trial defendant conduct was a substantial factor in the decision to develop the nbgpp.as discussed in the previous part,the trial court incorrectly focuses on each defendant conduct,rather than the releases or threatened releases for which each defendant is liable.and,in addition to that error,the court required the district to show that each defendant,standing alone,caused the entire nbgpp even those portions of the project intended to address contamination completely unrelated to a given defendant and the releases or threatened releases for which it was liable.this was error.the correct standard requires the district to show only that it incurred some necessary response costs as a consequence of a release or threatened release for which a defendant is liable.
similarly,at the outset of its causation discussion,the court concluded,based on the evidence presented,the court finds that no trial defendant conduct was a but for cause of,or a substantial factor in,the district decision to approve the nbgpp.while the trial court did not err by using the substantial factor test for causation see,artesian water,supra.at,it did err in selecting the objects of the causation inquiry by requiring a showing that each trial defendant conduct caused the district to approve the nbgpp.instead,the trial court should have considered whether each release or threatened release caused the district to incur necessary response costs.we will discuss the consequences of this error,and additional findings by the trial court,with respect to each defendant in the next parts,post.
sufficiency of the statement of decision 
based on these legal errors,the district argues the trial court statement of decision is deficient because it omits material factual findings.it contends the judgment must be reversed on that basis alone to allow the trial court to make findings under the proper causation standard.see weisz trucking emil wohl construction d.for reasons we will explain,we disagree.
ordinarily,when the court statement of decision is ambiguous or omits material factual findings,a reviewing court is required to infer any factual findings necessary to support the judgment.citations.this rule is a natural and logical corollary to three fundamental principles of appellate review a judgment is presumed correct all intendments and presumptions are indulged in favor of correctness and the appellant bears the burden of providing an adequate record affirmatively proving error.ermoian desert hospital th,ermoian.
in order to avoid the application of this doctrine of implied findings,an appellant must take two steps.first,the appellant must request a statement of decision pursuant to code of civil procedure section second,if the trial court issues a statement of decision,a party claiming omissions or ambiguities in the factual findings must bring the omissions or ambiguities to the trial court attention pursuant to code of civil procedure section.ermoian,supra,th at see in re marriage of arceneaux cal d.
to bring defects in a statement of decision to the trial court attention within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,objections to a statement of decision must be specific.citation.the alleged omission or ambiguity must be identified with sufficient particularity to allow the trial court to correct the defect.citation.by filing specific objections to the court statement of decision a party pinpoints alleged deficiencies in the statement and allows the court to focus on the facts or issues the party contends were not resolved or whose resolution is ambiguous.ermoian,supra,th at.
these requirements apply to omissions or ambiguities in a court factual findings only.since the doctrine of implied findings does not apply to the court legal conclusions which are reviewed de novo on appeal,this procedure does not apply to potential errors of law.fladboe american isuzu motors,th,fladboe see duarte nursery,california grape rootstock improvement com.th,the statute applies only when there is an omission or ambiguity in the trial court decision,not when the party attacks the legal premises or claims the trial court findings are irrelevant or unsupported by evidence.
the district points to two filings in the trial court that it contends preserved its objections to the trial court statement of decision and vitiates application of the implied findings doctrine.neither filing was sufficient.the first,entitled plaintiff objections and counter proposals to defendants proposed addition to defendants statement of decision proposed re causation evidence,was filed after the court issued its statement of decision.but,as its title implies,it was directed to an earlier filing by defendants,not the statement of decision itself.even assuming it could be read as an objection to the statement of decision,the document explicitly does not request any further factual findings by the court these objections do not reargue the district disagreements with this court factual determinations.rather,the district objects to legal errors in defendants proposed addition that have now been incorporated into the statement of decision.the district argued that the court factual findings were sufficient to compel judgment in the district favor under the hsaa true liability standard,the factual findings in this court statement of decision establish that defendants are jointly and severally liable for the district removal and remedial action costs.the district did not identify any allegedly omitted or ambiguous factual findings it simply requested that the court use its existing factual findings to hold defendants liable under the hsaa.this filing was therefore insufficient to prevent application of the doctrine of implied findings.
the district second filing,entitled plaintiff objections to defendants statement of decision proposed,was submitted prior to the court statement of decision.as such,it could not have identified omissions or ambiguities in the statement of decision.for this reason alone,it is insufficient.see fladboe,supra,th at.even setting that insufficiency aside,the district second filing also did not identify material factual omissions or ambiguities the court must resolve.instead,it reargued the evidence presented at trial in an effort to persuade the court contrary to its tentative decision to find the defendants liable under the hsaa.simply arguing the district own view of the evidence is insufficient the district must identify material omissions or ambiguities in the ultimate factual findings necessary to resolve the issues contested at trial.
because the district failed to properly object to omissions or ambiguities in the statement of decision,the doctrine of implied findings applies.we will therefore imply any factual findings necessary to support the judgment,and the trial court alleged failure to include a material factual finding in its statement of decision is not reversible error.
review and prejudice 
the court statement of decision is not insulated from review,however.we may still review the court factual findings,including any implied findings,for substantial evidence.fladboe,supra,th at the appellate court then reviews the implied factual findings under the substantial evidence standard.see ermoian,supra,th at.and,of course,we still review the court interpretation of the law under a de novo standard of review.central valley,supra,th at.
here,with limited exceptions,the district does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the court factual findings.instead,as we have explained,the district challenges the court interpretation of the legal element of causation under the hsaa we have determined the trial court misapplied the standard.in order to obtain reversal,the district must show the error was prejudicial,there is a reasonable probability the district would have obtained a more favorable result if the court had applied the correct standard.see,perez vas th.
we have reviewed the evidence presented at trial,the trial court detailed statement of decision,and the parties arguments on appeal.in the following parts,we will consider in detail the question of prejudice as to each defendant.in summary,however,our conclusions are as follows as to alcoa and cbs,the court explicitly found that voc releases at those defendants sites regardless of their source did not affect the shallow aquifer.these factual findings were based on the trial court credibility determinations at trial,and there is no reasonable probability the trial court would have changed its evaluation of this evidence had it not misapplied the causation standard under the hsaa.as to arnold and crucible,such findings may be implied,and our review of the court express findings and the evidence reveal no reasonable probability the court would have found the district carried its burden to show that voc releases at the arnold and crucible sites affected the shallow aquifer.because the district response costs rely primarily on shallow aquifer contamination with some exceptions we will explain below,the trial court finding of no contamination precludes causation under the correct hsaa standard for alcoa,arnold,cbs,and crucible.the trial court error did not prejudice the district as to those defendants,and the court judgment on the district hsaa claim will be affirmed as to them.
however,as to northrop sites,the trial court expressly found that voc contamination had affected the shallow aquifer.for reasons we will explain,therefore,the trial court error was prejudicial to some extent as to northrop on the element of causation.as noted,however,we must review the alternate grounds supporting the trial court judgment in favor of northrop to determine whether the court causation error as to northrop ultimately requires reversal of the judgment.
at the alcoa site,as with all of defendants sites,the trial court found there had been one or more releases of hazardous substances,voc.the court determined,however,that any voc releases at the alcoa site did not reach the shallow aquifer.no voc of any kind were detected at the alcoa site in the main soil borings between the water table and a point approximately feet above the water table.alcoa expert,richard weiss,testified without contradiction that if voc passed through the soil column underneath the alcoa site and into the shallow aquifer,there would have been detectable amounts of voc in the lower soil.the court found that thick layers of clay under the alcoa site discouraged migration of voc from the soil to the shallow aquifer.while the groundwater under the alcoa site was contaminated with voc,the court concluded based on the evidence that voc contamination both pce and tce in the shallow aquifer under the alcoa site came from one or more upgradient facilities.
these factual findings do not focus on releases by alcoa itself or alcoa potential responsibility for the entire nbgpp.instead,they focus on whether releases of hazardous substances at the alcoa site caused shallow aquifer contamination and therefore the district response costs.as such,the court factual findings mirror the correct standard of causation under cercla and the hsaa.the past response costs claimed by the district are the district construction of two extraction wells to capture contaminated water from the shallow aquifer for treatment.because the alcoa site did not contribute to shallow aquifer contamination,according to the findings of the trial court,it could not have caused these response costs 
relying on monsanto,supra,at page,the district criticizes the court factual findings.the district reliance on monsanto is unpersuasive for reasons we have already discussed.the district also argues it was required only to show a plausible migration pathway to the shallow aquifer,not actual migration,to establish causation.although the district could potentially establish its prima facie case or satisf y its burden,as the district argues by showing a plausible migration pathway,rather than actual migration see,castaic lake,supra,d at,the issue in this appeal is not whether the district can establish a prima facie case.nor is the issue what conclusions this court would have reached if we had considered the evidence in the first instance as the trier of fact.instead,the issue is whether the court factual finding,after it weighed the district evidence against contrary evidence,was affected by the court use of an incorrect causation standard.based on our review of the evidence and the trial court findings,we conclude there is no reasonable probability this factual finding would have been altered if the trial court had used the correct standard.the district has not shown prejudice.
as to the arnold site,the trial court recognized that and had been found in the shallow soil.with respect to these contaminants,the court focused on whether arnold was responsible for these voc releases,which is the incorrect causation standard under cercla and the hsaa t here is insufficient evidence to find that the or found in shallow soil vapor on the arnold site originated from arnold.without a foundation for the opinion that arnold released into the soil which would have eventually broken down to some extent to,there is no basis for waddell opinion that arnold operations contaminated groundwater or threaten today to contaminate groundwater.
the court statement of decision did not make any express findings regarding the dispositive causation issue,whether any voc releases at the arnold site from arnold or another source had caused shallow aquifer contamination and therefore the district response costs.while we will imply such a finding to support the judgment,we must nonetheless consider whether it would have been affected by the trial court use of an incorrect causation standard 
the evidence bearing on causation was disputed at trial.waddell analyzed monitoring well data and grab samples from the shallow aquifer and concluded that the arnold site contributed tce and contamination to the shallow aquifer.arnold expert disagreed.he testified that the available data was insufficient to prove that the arnold site contributed tce to groundwater.although was found in the shallow soil at the arnold site,its presence in deeper samples was limited.waddell himself admitted that the available data was inadequate to fully characterize the voc contamination at the arnold site because most sampling occurred at shallow depths and the sampling at deeper levels was sparse.and,while groundwater data was available at adjacent sites,there was no groundwater data for the arnold site itself.
the district claimed response costs consisted solely of an extraction well designed to remediate groundwater contamination flowing from the arnold site among others.a finding of causation therefore requires proof that the arnold site caused groundwater contamination.based on our review of the evidence,and cognizant of the trial court findings regarding waddell lack of credibility,we conclude there is no reasonable probability the court would have found the district carried its burden to establish the essential fact of groundwater contamination had it understood the correct causation standard under cercla and hsaa.as to arnold,therefore,the district has not shown prejudice.
as to cbs,the trial court recognized there had been voc contamination in the shallow soil at south raymond and east valencia,the latter of which was partially subdivided into sally place.the court found,however,voc releases at those sites had not resulted in actual or threatened contamination of the shallow aquifer.these factual findings avoid the legal errors we have identified and therefore provide strong evidence the district was not prejudiced by the errors.
for south raymond,the court concluded,to the extent that shallow soil releases of pce at south raymond are attributable to cbs,such releases have not impacted groundwater and do not pose a present or future threat to groundwater.although couched as an unnecessary caveat,the trial court attribution of any releases at the site to cbs actually conforms its finding to the correct causation standard.by concluding that any pce releases at the south raymond site did not impact groundwater or threaten to do so,the court applied the correct causation standard and made a dispositive factual finding on that issue.
likewise,for the east valencia site,the trial court credited the evidence that any voc releases at the site did not impact groundwater or threaten to do so.prominent among this evidence was waddell admission,supported by testing data,that a gap existed in pce detections between the shallow soil and the shallow aquifer.this gap showed that contamination in the shallow soil had not reached the shallow aquifer and therefore could not have contaminated it.again,these findings bear directly on the correct causation standard.
the district contends the trial court factual findings reflect the fingerprinting or tracing requirement.see asarco,supra,d at.not so.the cited conclusions of the trial court properly focused on whether contamination at the sites in question had caused the district response costs.the district claimed response costs were limited to the installation of extraction wells to treat contamination in the shallow aquifer,so it was appropriate for the trial court to consider whether there was any causal connection between contamination at the cbs sites and such costs.again,while the district may have established a prima facie case by showing shallow aquifer contamination and a plausible migration pathway from the shallow soil to the shallow aquifer,the trial court was entitled to credit cbs contrary evidence.and,in any event,the trial court made clear it did not believe the district evidence for reasons entirely unrelated to the causation standard at issue in this appeal accordingly,since much of waddell testimony did not comport with the facts presented at trial,lacked foundation,in some cases contained material mis statements,and was otherwise founded on speculation,particularly,as it related to causation,the court does not credit his opinions regarding cbs s alleged liability.based on our review of the evidence and the court findings,there is no reasonable probability the court would have found for the district on the issue of causation even if the court had used the correct causation standard.the district has not shown prejudice.
as to crucible,the trial court acknowledged that soil vapor sampling in showed voc contamination in the shallow soil at the crucible site.the deepest samples,however,were at feet below the surface,and these samples did not detect any voc.the court credited the conclusion of the consultant who conducted the sampling that the low concentrations of voc,where present beneath the site,do not present a threat to human health or groundwater beneath the site.the court found waddell opinions,and the district causation evidence,unpersuasive.
although the trial court did not make an explicit causation finding for the crucible site that corresponds to the correct causation standard,we nonetheless conclude the trial court use of an incorrect causation standard was harmless.the court factual findings regarding the nature and extent of voc contamination of the site,its rejection of the district evidence,and the state of the evidence generally show that it is not reasonably probable that the court would not have found in the district favor on causation even if it had used the correct causation standard.as with arnold and cbs,the district claimed response costs were limited to extraction wells designed to treat the shallow aquifer.the court findings make clear it did not believe the contamination at the crucible site contaminated or threatened to contaminate that aquifer.the district focus on contrary evidence,which the court did not credit,is unpersuasive.even if the district evidence did establish a prima facie case by showing a plausible migration pathway or otherwise,that is not the issue in this appeal.the district has not shown prejudice.
for northrop,unlike the other defendants,the trial court found that releases at its sites had contaminated the shallow aquifer.for two of northrop sites,emd and kester solder,the court conclusion that those sites had not caused the district response costs rested on the court factual findings that those sites no longer contributed to shallow aquifer contamination.for the third site,the court conclusion rested on northrop ongoing remediation of the site.for reasons we will explain,we conclude there is a reasonable probability the trial court would have found that the district had proved causation as to northrop kester solder and sites had it used the correct causation standards.
the trial court found that tce and were released at northrop emd site.the court described northrop remediation activities,including soil vapor extraction and soil excavation to a depth feet below the surface.the court cited the rwqcb assessment,following northrop remediation,that voc present in the soil have apparently not significantly impacted water quality.the court also cited the rwqcb assessment,which concluded that contaminants in groundwater beneath the site probably originate from an source.later testing in by the district,the court concluded,showed there is no perceptible contribution from the emd site to groundwater contamination as groundwater passes below emd.the testing refute d the notion that past releases at emd have caused the district to engage in any remedial action.the court noted waddell admission that contamination caused by emd in the past will not be captured by the district extraction wells.instead,the wells will capture only water that is either currently passing through emd or will soon be passing through emd.the court concluded that t he district evidence concerning shallow aquifer contamination or the threat thereof attributable to northrop emd site was not persuasive.
at the kester solder site,the trial court found that pce had been released.initial testing revealed pce contamination in the shallow soil,perched groundwater,and shallow aquifer.the court noted that,beginning in,northrop engaged in an remediation plan,including a soil vapor extraction process that yielded pounds of voc.the court concluded that northrop remediation remove d the source of potential groundwater contamination.while the court acknowledged that contamination remained in the perched groundwater at the site,northrop was continuing its remediation efforts under the auspices of the rwqcb.reviewing the expert testimony,the court rejected waddell opinion that the site remained a source of contamination.instead,the court credited the testimony of northrop expert witness glenn tofani,who compared upgradient and downgradient monitoring well data to determine that the site did not contribute to shallow aquifer contamination.and,in the court view,even if the site contributed to such contamination,it would be remediated by the downgradient treatment well at northrop site.weighing the evidence,the court concluded,kester solder is no longer a source of further pce contamination and as a result of soil remediation,is not contributing to pce contamination in the shallow aquifer.the rwqcb is properly exercising its jurisdiction over northrop remediation efforts at this site.the court therefore finds that kester solder does not pose a threat to groundwater and has not caused the need for the nbgpp.
at the site,the trial court found that tce had been released and impacted groundwater.pce was also found at the site,but the trial court determined that it was not a source of groundwater contamination.as with the emd and kester solder sites,northrop undertook an remediation effort.the trial court found that the effort had removed approximately percent of voc at the site approximately pounds.the trial court credited testimony predicting that remediation of the soil and perched groundwater would be completed by two years after trial,at which point the site would no longer be a source of groundwater contamination.the trial court noted that northrop had also installed a treatment well at,which was remediating groundwater to drinking water standards.given this evidence,the court concluded as follows the evidence establishes that the nbgpp is not necessary to address contamination because the source of the contamination at is in the process of remediation under a responsible agency.accordingly,the court concludes that is being adequately remediated and that contamination at the site has not caused,and will not cause,the district to incur remedial action costs.
the court statement of decision does not make a distinction between potential contamination at northrop sites the correct causation standard and potential contamination by northrop itself the incorrect causation standard.it simply focuses on the sites themselves.to that extent,the trial court use of an incorrect standard does not appear to have been prejudicial.the district assertions regarding its ability to show a plausible migration pathway or establish a prima face case are unpersuasive for reasons we have already stated.
but given the undisputed fact that northrop sites caused some voc contamination in the shallow aquifer,we conclude the district has shown prejudice stemming from the court erroneous belief that the district was required to show hazardous substance releases at defendants sites were a substantial factor in causing the district to develop the entire nbgpp,rather than simply a substantial factor in causing the district to incur some response costs.
for the northrop sites,the district claimed response costs include the construction of two extraction wells to treat contamination in the shallow aquifer and several monitoring wells to evaluate contamination flowing from northrop sites.based on the trial court findings that the emd site no longer contributes to shallow aquifer contamination,and that any past contamination has already flowed beyond the district extraction well,it is not reasonably probable the court would have found that releases at the emd site caused the construction of the extraction wells if it had not misapplied the causation standard.for the kester solder and sites,however,it is reasonably probable the trial court would have changed its conclusion.although the trial court found the kester solder site no longer contributed to contamination in the shallow aquifer,it made no findings regarding the ability of the district extraction wells to remediate past contamination.northrop does not appear to have introduced evidence that past contamination from kester solder had already flowed beyond the district extraction wells,as it did with the emd site.and the site continued to contribute to contamination the shallow aquifer at the time of trial.northrop expert tofani admitted that its recirculation well did not capture all of the contamination flowing from the site.like the kester solder site,the trial court made no findings regarding the ability of the district extraction wells to remediate past or present contamination flowing from the site.while not certain,it appears reasonably probable that the court would have found that contamination from caused the district to construct an extraction well to treat that contamination.it therefore may have found in the district favor on the issue of causation if it had understood the district needed merely to prove that releases at the kester solder or sites caused some response costs,rather than believing that releases at the sites had to cause the entire nbgpp project.the district has shown prejudice as to these extraction well costs and the kester solder and sites 
the fact that northrop offered contradictory expert testimony from tofani and lambie regarding whether contamination from its sites would be part of the nbgpp treatment area see fn,ante further supports our finding of prejudice as to the kester solder and sites.contrary to the district contention,however,such testimony does not establish prejudice as to the emd site.the trial court weighed the conflicting expert testimony and credited tofani opinion that the emd site no longer contributed to shallow aquifer contamination and waddell admission that past contamination had already flowed past the district extraction wells.the district appears to challenge the former testimony,arguing it can not constitute substantial evidence because tofani allegedly did not consider all of the factors lambie considered.see pacific gas electric zuckerman d,when a trial court has accepted an expert ultimate conclusion without critical consideration of his reasoning,and it appears the conclusion was based upon improper or unwarranted matters,then the judgment must be reversed for lack of substantial evidence.the fact that two experts disagreed on the factors used in their analysis under the circumstances here,however,does not mean one expert conclusion was based on improper or unwarranted matters,such that his conclusion was not substantial evidence.at most,the district has shown only disagreement between experts,which the trial court was entitled to resolve against the district.see,people poe th.substantial evidence therefore supported the trial court finding,and we may not reweigh this factual finding on appeal.it also does not appear reasonably probable the trial court would have come to a different conclusion if it had not misperceived the causation standard under the hsaa.the court legal errors have no bearing on this factual issue.
the district also claimed investigatory costs consisting of monitoring wells in the vicinity of the emd and kester solder sites.with one exception,the district does not explain how hazardous substance releases at those sites caused the district to construct those monitoring wells.instead,the evidence cited by the district shows only that it used data from those monitoring wells to analyze releases at those sites.that evidence does not bear on the issue of causation.as to one well,however,the district cites evidence that it constructed the well specifically to evaluate shallow aquifer contamination at the kester solder site.given that evidence,it is reasonably probable the trial court would have found that releases at the kester solder site caused these investigatory costs if it had not believed that such releases were required to cause the entire nbgpp.the district has therefore shown prejudice as to these costs related to the kester solder site as well.
response costs whether the district is a state 
we will next consider the additional grounds supporting the judgment against the district on its hsaa claim.the trial court found,in the alternative,that the district could not recover on its hsaa claim because it had not shown its response costs were necessary and consistent with the ncp.see carson harbor i,supra,at see a b.the district contends the trial court erred by imposing these requirements because it is a state under cercla and a different cercla provision applies.as we will explain,we disagree that the district is a state for purposes of cercla cost recovery provisions.the court therefore did not err by imposing these requirements.
under cercla,states as well as indian tribes and the federal government can recover all costs of removal or remedial action not inconsistent with the ncp.a a.states,indian tribes,and the federal government therefore enjoy a presumption that their costs are,which is not extended to other cost recovery plaintiffs.washington state department of transportation washington natural gas cir,wsdot.hsaa incorporates the ncp standard by reference.fireman fund insurance city of lodi cir,fireman fund.the district contention presents a question of statutory interpretation,which we review de novo.shamrock foods,supra,cal th at central valley,supra,th at.
under cercla,t he terms united states and state include the several states of the united states,the district of columbia,the commonwealth of puerto rico,guam,american samoa,the united states virgin islands,the commonwealth of the northern marianas,and any other territory or possession over which the united states has jurisdiction.this definition does not explain what constitutes each of the several states of the united states.a more detailed statutory definition was unnecessary because the plain meaning of state is the organized government acting on behalf of the citizens of the state.wsdot,supra,at.the organized government of a state includes state administrative departments and agencies.a state agency is a department,commission,board,committee,or body of any form operating as an instrumentality of the state government.ibid.for example,as a state agency,the dtsc falls within cercla definition of a state.fireman fund,supra,at.
cercla definitions distinguish states from other,subsidiary political units.in its definition of a person,in addition to various private parties,cercla includes united states government,state,municipality,commission,political subdivision of a state,or any interstate body.under canons of statutory interpretation,these subsidiary political units municipalities and political subdivisions of a state are not states under cercla because they are listed separately.to equate them with states would render their separate listing superfluous.see,fair employment housing commission cal d,a construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.see also civ.code.a municipality,a local government with authority over a limited area,is a different type of government unit than a agency that is part of the organized government of the state itself.wsdot,supra,at,fn.see united states ex rel.norton sound health bering strait school dist.cir,in short,a local government unit,though established under state law,funded by the state,and ultimately under state control,with jurisdiction over only a limited area,is not a state.
reviewing federal court decisions distinguishing states from subsidiary political units,one court summarized,the courts explain that cercla definition of state does not include political subdivisions such as municipalities and the entities included under the definition differ substantially from political subdivisions in terms of their authority and power.all are sovereigns and,unlike municipalities,do not depend on states for their authority to govern.the courts further note that municipalities and other political subdivision s are included within the statutory definition of person.town of new windsor tesa truck.
numerous other federal district courts agree that municipalities and other political subdivisions are not states for purposes of cercla cost recovery actions.see,county united states.d,by the clear language of cercla,the county,as a political subdivision of a state,is not entitled to the presumption that response actions taken were necessary and consistent with the ncp,to which states and the federal government are entitled.city of new york chemical waste disposal,by its terms,cercla definition of state does not include political subdivisions such as municipalities.city of hamtramck,sherwin williams city of heath ashland oil,town of bedford raytheon,city of philadelphia stepan chemical,see also borough of rockaway klockner klocker.
the district was established by an act of the california legislature.ocwd act,subd.a.it has powers over a limited sphere,groundwater,and within a limited geographic area,roughly corresponding to orange county,subd.a.it has no statewide authority in subject matter or geography.it is therefore a political subdivision of the state,not a state itself.it is akin to a municipality,but with more specialized powers.
it appears only one court has considered whether a california water district is a state under cercla.see santa clara valley water district olin,no.wl scvwd.that federal district court held,in an unpublished opinion,that the district in question was not a state because it did not have statewide authority.id.at.we agree with the district court reasoning and conclusion 
the district points out that its claim is under the hsaa,not cercla,and therefore we should consider policy reasons specific to california why the district should enjoy the presumption afforded to states under cercla.the district argues that the cost recovery provisions of the ocwd act,which reflect a presumption that the district costs are reasonable and necessary ocwd act,subd.c,show that the district should enjoy a similar presumption under cercla and the hsaa.we note first that,absent absurd or unintended results,such policy considerations can not override the plain meaning of the statute.see california school employees governing board cal th,california school employees.and,to the extent we can discern a policy thread connecting these various concepts,it does not favor the district position.
the hsaa itself places ncp compliance at the heart of environmental remediation actions in california.health saf.code,subd.d.it also entrusts the state of california overall environmental investigation and remediation efforts to two state agencies,the dtsc and the rwqcb.see,subd.b.the district is not included.the district own governing act does not contemplate environmental investigation and remediation efforts on the scale of the dtsc and the rwqcb under the hsaa.instead,it includes specific provisions relating to the district only.ocwd act.as we will discuss in part ii,post,the ocwd act standards differ materially from the hsaa.given the district exclusion from the hsaa,and the specific standards and provisions governing the district environmental cleanup activities in the ocwd act,we conclude that the applicable california policies support our conclusion that the district should not be considered a state under the cost recovery provisions of cercla and should not enjoy the presumption of ncp compliance.
the policies underlying cercla cost recovery provisions likewise counsel against extending the ncp presumption to the district.as one court explained,with respect to the presumption enjoyed by states that their costs will be ncp compliant,this standard of proof was designed in deference to the highly technical nature of environmental cleanup efforts,and the realization that the expertise of agencies charged with environmental protection should not be by the courts.commonwealth of massachusetts blackstone valley electric.although cercla does not explicitly limit the presumption to agencies with special environmental experience wsdot,supra,at,interpreting the term to include only statewide agencies that are part of a state government ensures at least the opportunity for institutional specialization and coordination that would not exist if the term were extended to all municipalities and political subdivisions.
response costs necessity 
because it is not a state under cercla,the district must prove its response costs were necessary.see a b allowing recovery of necessary costs of response.the district argues the evidence does not support the trial court finding that its response costs were not necessary,as that term is used in cercla.we agree.
it is generally agreed that the necessity standard requires that an actual and real threat to human health or the environment exist before initiating a response action.carson harbor i,supra,at see city of colton american promotional events,cir,city of colton regional airport authority of louisville lfg,llc cir,louisville.in determining whether response costs are necessary,we focus not on whether a party has a business or other motive in cleaning up the property,but on whether there is a threat to human health or the environment and whether the response action is addressed to that threat.carson harbor i,supra,at.investigatory costs incurred in order to assist with and help plan the eventual remediation and cleanup efforts are necessary under cercla walnut creek manor,llc mayhew center,llc.d,and are recoverable even absent any subsequent recoverable response costs yankee gas services ugi utilities,d,yankee gas.
in its statement of decision,the trial court determined that the nbgpp is unnecessary and unreasonable,thus precluding the district recovery under the hsaa.the court determination rested on its finding that natural attenuation of voc contaminants in the shallow aquifer was sufficient to protect drinking water supplies in the principal aquifer the court further finds,based on the weight of the evidence,that the nbgpp is not necessary either to protect the principal aquifer the drinking water aquifer or to remediate voc contamination in the shallow water aquifer to a goal of times the maximum contaminant level for the various voc in order to provide future protection for the drinking water principal aquifer.and,with respect to northrop site specifically,the court found that t he evidence establishes that the nbgpp is not necessary to address contamination because the source of contamination at is in the process of remediation under a responsible agency.
as with all factual determinations,we review the trial court determination that the district response costs were not necessary for substantial evidence.see central valley,supra,th at.viewing the record in the light most favorable to defendants,and in light of the standards articulated above,we conclude that the evidence did not support a finding that the district response costs were not necessary.it was undisputed that groundwater in the north basin area,including around defendants sites,had been impacted by voc contamination.the presence of voc contamination at significant levels was a threat to human health and the environment.see,united alloys,baker.d,finding that voc contamination in soil pose s an actual and real threat to public health and the environment and remediation costs are therefore necessary under cercla.no reasonable trier of fact could find otherwise.it was also undisputed that the district costs were addressed to the threat posed by voc contamination.the district did not investigate voc contamination or construct its extraction wells for some other reason.
the trial court focused on drinking water supplies,to the exclusion of other hazards to human health and the environment,such as voc contamination in the shallow aquifer.the court also applied the term necessary in its strictest sense,the nbgpp was not necessary because other means existed to protect the deep aquifer.the court misinterpreted the standard of necessity under cercla and the hsaa and therefore erred.
defendants offer a fusillade of criticism against the nbgpp generally,claiming it is not necessary to remediate voc contamination in the north basin because,for example,natural attenuation would be an acceptable alternative.but they do not tie their arguments to the applicable standard of necessity under cercla and the hsaa.indeed,they do not reference the standard at all.the standard,properly understood,does not speak to the quality of the district response action.it simply asks whether the response action is addressed to an actual threat to human health or the environment.shortcomings in the development and overall design of the nbgpp do not,in and of themselves,bear strongly on this standard.defendants criticisms are more relevant to the district compliance with the ncp,and we will consider that issue in the next section 
response costs ncp consistency 
because the district is not a state under cercla,it must also prove its response costs are consistent with the ncp,including its requirements for meaningful public participation,and adequate planning for any remedial action.a b see carson harbor village county of los angeles cir,carson harbor ii.for reasons we will explain,we conclude the district has not shown its claimed response costs were consistent with the ncp.
the ncp specifies procedures for preparing and responding to contaminations and was promulgated by the environmental protection agency epa pursuant to cercla.citations.it is designed to make the party seeking response costs choose a course of action to protect public health and the environment.city of colton,supra,at.a response action will be considered consistent with the ncp if the action,when evaluated as a whole,is in substantial compliance with the applicable requirements,and results in a cleanup.c i.mere immaterial or insubstantial deviations from applicable requirements are not sufficient to show that an action is not consistent with the ncp,c see louisville,supra,at.
in general,a cleanup is a response action that protects human health and the environment,utilizes permanent solutions and alternative treatment technologies or resource recovery technologies to the maximum extent practicable,is,satisfies applicable and relevant or appropriate requirements arars for the site,and provides opportunity for meaningful public participation.franklin county convention facilities authority american premier underwriters cir,franklin county.the specific regulatory requirements identified by the ncp include protection of worker health and safety adequate documentation of hazardous substance releases,responsible parties,response actions,and costs incurred,identification of arars applicable to the hazardous substance release and response action,g an adequate remedial site evaluation,an remedial investigation,feasibility study,and selection of remedy,and subsequent remedial design and remedial action.see,c.
the regulations emphasize the role of public participation throughout the investigation,study,and remedial phases of an response action private parties undertaking response actions should provide an opportunity for public comment concerning the selection of the response action based on ncp requirements,or based on substantially equivalent state and local requirements.c.the ncp requirements for public participation are intended to promote active communication between communities affected by discharges or releases and the party instituting the response action,c.the specific ncp requirements for public participation will be discussed in further detail below.
the district contends,as an initial matter,that the requirement of ncp consistency should not apply to investigatory costs.a number of federal authorities support the district contention.see village of milford holding cir,t his court has held that consistency with the ncp is not required for recovery of monitoring and investigation costs.italics added cnh america,llc champion environmental services.d,m any courts have held that initial investigation,and monitoring costs are recoverable under a irrespective of compliance with ncp requirements.other authorities disagree.see board of county commissioners brown group retail.d,aviall services,cooper industries,llc.d,aviall services.
we agree with the latter line of authority and conclude the district must prove its investigatory costs are consistent with the ncp to recover.the plain language of the federal statute compels this result.it is that costs of investigation,assessment,or monitoring of potential environmental harm qualify as costs of response under cercla.citations.and cercla plainly allows private parties to recover only those costs of response incurred consistent with the ncp.a b.it would thus contravene the plain language of the statute to hold that investigatory costs are exempt from ncp compliance.aviall services,supra,d at.
based on the nature of these costs,however,not all ncp requirements may be applicable when litigation commences.because a plaintiff may seek cost recovery before a remediation action has been completed wickland oil terminals asarco,cir,consistency with the ncp in this context may not mean that all ncp requirements have been met.the ncp requirements applicable to a given remedy will depend on where in the development process the remedy is at the time of the plaintiff cost recovery action.
one federal district court explained that investigatory costs will be considered consistent with the ncp where they are incurred consistently with the purpose of the ncp.aviall services,supra,d at.the key criterion,sometimes ignored in the federal authorities we have reviewed,is that costs must be consistent with the ncp.the plaintiff need not have complied with the ncp in its entirety to recover.see yankee gas,supra,d at.the trial court here did not err by requiring the district to show ncp consistency for its investigatory costs.
the district contends the court erred by finding its response costs were not consistent with the ncp.the federal courts view this issue as a mixed question of law and fact.whether a party has substantially complied with the ncp is a mixed question of law and fact.citation.this means that,once the factual details regarding the district cleanup efforts have been established,the court decides as a matter of law whether those efforts substantially comply with the ncp.aviall services,supra,d at.we agree and will therefore review the trial court factual findings for substantial evidence and review de novo the ultimate conclusion that the district costs were not consistent with the ncp,that the district did not substantially comply with applicable ncp requirements.see asarco cir,see also board of administration wilson th,discussing mixed questions of law and fact under california law.
at trial,the district claimed a total of approximately million in incurred response costs.this total included approximately in investigatory costs,monitoring wells,million in extraction well construction costs,and million in design and development costs,environmental impact analysis.on appeal,the district does not focus on the relationship between its specific incurred costs and the ncp.instead,the district argues it substantially complied with the ncp in the course of its overall response to voc contamination in the north basin area.for reasons we will explain,we disagree 
a primary goal of the ncp is to ensure meaningful public participation in the selection of a response action.see waste management of alameda county,east bay regional park district.d,waste management m eaningful public participation is integral to ensuring the proper completion of a cleanup.see also franklin county,supra,at.the public participation requirement has two main components.first,in developing a remedial action plan,prior to actual field work beginning,the party conducting the cleanup shall to the extent practicable interview local officials,community residents,or other interested or affected parties to learn their concerns.c i.additionally,a formal community relations plan must be prepared to ensure an opportunity for public involvement,and at least one local information repository must be established to make information available to the public about the site remediation.c ii.second,after a remediation plan has been chosen,the party conducting the cleanup shall publish notice of the plan in a local newspaper,provide an opportunity for submission of comments on the proposed plan,provide an opportunity for a public meeting,make a transcript of the meeting available to the public,and prepare a written summary of significant comments and responses to those comments.f.carson harbor ii,supra,at.
the proposed plan must p rovide a brief summary of the remedial alternatives evaluated and i dentify and provide a discussion of the rationale that supports the preferred alternative.f i ii.the evaluation must consider nine criteria overall protection of human health and the environment compliance with arars effectiveness and permanence reduction of toxicity,mobility,or volume through treatment effectiveness implementability cost state acceptance and community acceptance,e iii.as part of the public comment process,the party conducting the cleanup must m ake the proposed plan and supporting analysis and information available,f i b and allow a comment period on the proposed plan of at least days,f i c.
the district did not follow these requirements during its development of the nbgpp.the district has not pointed to any evidence of community outreach when voc contamination was first discovered,nor is there any evidence the district put together a community relations plan or a public information repository when it chose the nbgpp and its precursors as the treatment for voc contamination in the north basin area.the district instead discussed,considered,and approved various aspects of the nbgpp and its precursors during its regular board meetings over a period of more than years.this circumstance resulted in a number of material deviations from the ncp requirements.the district provided only hours notice that the nbgpp or its precursors would be on the agenda of a district board meeting.the public therefore only had hours rather than days to review the proposed action,analyze any supporting material,and provide any comments.the district also materially changed the nbgpp and its precursors numerous times over the period of its development,and its projected cost increased from a maximum of approximately million to over million.the public was presented,in effect,with a moving target.its ability to meaningfully participate in the district selection of a remedy was severely hampered.see waste management,supra,d at public participation requirement not met through piecemeal public hearings no one public meeting presented the proposal as a whole or presented an opportunity for meaningful public input into the responding party consideration of remedial alternatives.
the district efforts to comply with ceqa likewise do not substantially comply with the public participation requirements of the ncp.ceqa is a comprehensive scheme designed to provide protection to the environment.mountain lion foundation fish game commission cal th.the key requirement of ceqa is the preparation of an eir for any project that a public agency proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment.ballona wetlands land trust city of los angeles th,ballona wetlands.an eir is an informational document which,when its preparation is required,shall be considered by every public agency prior to its approval or disapproval of a project.the purpose of an eir is to provide public agencies and the public in general with detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment to list ways in which the significant effects of such a project might be minimized and to indicate alternatives to such a project.pub.resources code.a public agency should not approve a proposed project under ceqa if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such projects.
the formal disclosure requirements of ceqa and the ncp overlap,but they are not coextensive.we need not decide whether ceqa compliance could ever satisfy the ncp because it is apparent,based on the record before us here,that the district disclosures under ceqa do not substantially comply with the ncp.the district draft mitigated negative declaration contains only cursory information about that iteration of the nbgpp,without any meaningful discussion of the ncp evaluation criteria or project alternatives.the draft mitigated negative declaration mentions a supporting initial study,but that study does not appear to be part of the record.the district draft seir provides further detail on the nbgpp as eventually approved and significant disclosure of its environmental effects.the draft seir,however,falls short of the ncp disclosure requirements.it assumed construction of the precursor to the nbgpp described in the district late staff report that was the no project alternative.the proposed alternatives in the draft seir were that precursor and several variations,including the project as described in the district mitigated negative declaration and the final nbgpp.the draft seir did not consider an alternative where the district took no action,nor did it consider alternatives that did not build on the proposals.for this reason alone,the draft seir did not substantially comply with the ncp.
moreover,the draft seir did not contain a meaningful summary of the district evaluation of the nbgpp and its alternatives under the criteria specified by the ncp.for example,the draft seir mentioned cost only in passing,by reference to the district million capital budget approved six years earlier.the draft seir did not disclose the nbgpp estimated cost,and it did not hint that the cost would soon expand to million.the draft seir also made no effort to put those costs in context or weigh the financial costs and benefits of the nbgpp or any alternative.without a discussion of cost,or the cost of alternatives,the district disclosures pursuant to ceqa can not substantially satisfy the ncp proposed plan requirements because they do not allow the public to meaningfully assess the district proposed response action and its alternatives.in this appeal,the district makes no real effort to compare its ceqa disclosures to those required under the ncp.its contention that the ceqa process satisfied the ncp public participation requirements is therefore unpersuasive.
based on the deficiencies we have identified,we conclude the district has not met its burden to show compliance with the ncp public participation requirements.these deficiencies are neither technical nor de minimus departures from the ncp requirements they significantly impacted the public ability to meaningfully participate in the selection of a remedy for voc contamination in the north basin.see waste management,supra,d at.
courts have consistently held that failure by a party to provide for the required opportunity for public comment renders a remedial action inconsistent with the ncp and bars recovery of costs,supra.at.we likewise conclude the district failure to satisfy the ncp public participation requirement bars recovery of its costs under the hsaa 
a second primary goal of the ncp is to encourage response actions.see franklin county,supra,at.the ncp requires cost to be considered in determining potential remedial actions,and excessive cost may be a ground to exclude a potential remedial action from further consideration.e iii.the ncp also expressly requires that a proposed remedial action be,provided that it adequately protects human health and the environment,f ii d see state of new york adamowicz d,among other factors,to be consistent with the ncp,remedial actions must be.
is determined by evaluating the following three of the five balancing criteria noted in f i b to determine overall effectiveness effectiveness and permanence,reduction of toxicity,mobility,or volume through treatment,and effectiveness.overall effectiveness is then compared to cost to ensure that the remedy is.a remedy shall be if its costs are proportional to its overall effectiveness.f ii d see franklin county,supra,at.a remedial action need not be the least expensive alternative to be.basic management united states d.
the trial court found that the nbgpp,as envisioned at the time of trial,was not.in late,district staff performed a analysis of the million precursor to the nbgpp.the report calculated that the project would treat of groundwater per year,leading to a total treatment cost including amortized capital costs and operation and maintenance costs of per of water.although certain district witnesses asserted that a further analysis had been conducted on the million nbgpp,no such analysis was offered at trial.based on the dramatic increase in the cost of the project,the trial court calculated that the cost of treating water in the shallow aquifer with the nbgpp would be more than three times the cost of importing an equivalent amount of clean water.while the district criticizes the trial court calculations as speculative,there does not appear to be any direct evidence of the cost per of water treated by the nbgpp,any comparison of that cost against the cost of other sources of water,or any comparison of that cost against other remedial actions.without this evidence,it is difficult for the district to meet its burden to show 
in addition to increased cost,the trial court found the nbgpp would have limited effect on voc contamination in the north basin area.the court credited impeachment evidence that the district expert graham fogg had admitted removing of the voc contaminant mass over years would be an optimistic estimate of the effect of the nbgpp on the shallow aquifer.at trial,fogg estimate was.and defense expert steven larson testified that the nbgpp would not materially change the level of contaminants in the principal aquifer,especially in the areas surrounding existing drinking water production wells.the trial court findings on effectiveness further undermine the district own analyses,which were premised at least in part on the perceived benefit to the principal aquifer and drinking water production wells from the operation of the ngbpp.without that benefit,the likely of the nbgpp based solely on its limited effect on the shallow aquifer decreases markedly 
the district offers a number of criticisms of the trial court reasoning.we are unpersuaded by these criticisms given our standard of review and the evidence at trial.and the district does not offer affirmative evidence that would show the of the nbgpp in light of the findings by the trial court.it merely asserts the nbgpp would be effective in treating some voc contamination,which does not address cost and is therefore insufficient.on the record before us,we can not say the court erred in concluding that the district had not proven the nbgpp was.the nbgpp is therefore not consistent with the ncp for this reason as well.
in addition to the goals of public participation and,the ncp mandates a number of procedural steps designed to ensure a cleanup.these steps include an remedial investigation,feasibility study,and remedial documentation in a record of decision.d f see carson harbor ii,supra,at.the purpose of the remedial investigation ri is to collect data necessary to adequately characterize the site for the purpose of developing and evaluating effective remedial alternatives.to characterize the site,the lead agency or party shall,as appropriate,conduct field investigations,including treatability studies,and conduct a baseline risk assessment.the ri provides information to assess the risks to human health and the environment and to support the development,evaluation,and selection of appropriate response alternatives.d.the primary objective of the feasibility study fs is to ensure that appropriate remedial alternatives are developed and evaluated such that relevant information concerning the remedial action options can be presented to a and an appropriate remedy selected.the development and evaluation of alternatives shall reflect the scope and complexity of the remedial action under consideration and the site problems being addressed,e.the feasibility study must establish remedial action objectives,develop alternative remedial actions,and provide a detailed analysis of the alternatives including a no action alternative where some removal or remediation has already occurred across the nine criteria for evaluation we have already discussed,e,e,e.after a remedy is selected,the ncp requires the party conducting the remedial action to document its selection in detail in a record of decision to support the selection of a remedial action,all facts,analyses of facts,and policy determinations considered in the course of carrying out activities in this section shall be documented,as appropriate,in a record of decision,in a level of detail appropriate to the site situation,for inclusion in the administrative record documentation shall explain how the evaluation criteria in paragraph e iii of section were used to select the remedy,f i.
the trial court found that the district failed to comply with these requirements.the court determined that the district did not conduct a baseline risk assessment in its remedial investigation.the court noted that the district focused feasibility study was based on the presumptive remedy of treatment.crediting the testimony of defense expert larson,the court found that the focused feasibility study had inadequately assessed the no action and monitored natural attenuation alternatives.in the court view,the district supplemental focused feasibility study compounded these errors by materially changing the project by treating additional contaminants,at one or two central locations without reconsidering the no action or monitored natural attenuation alternatives in light of the changes.the supplemental focused feasibility study also did not adequately explain the costs and benefits of the alternatives considered or their effect on the principal aquifer rather than the shallow aquifer.the court did not believe the district late staff report,which outlined the final iteration of the nbgpp,remedied these deficiencies.
based on our review of the record,we conclude the district efforts were not consistent with the ncp.the district failure to conduct a baseline assessment of the risk to human health and the environment prevented the district and the public from adequately assessing the and necessity of the district proposed remedial actions.see united states burlington northern cir.although the district assessed the nature and extent of voc contamination in the north basin area,its failure to assess the risks resulting from that contamination inhibited consideration of an important factor in choosing the district response action moreover,whatever the merits of the district focused feasibility study,the changes over the ensuing decade to the design and cost of the nbgpp,the scope of contamination it sought to address,and the characteristics of the north basin itself,extensive source removal and remediation at defendants sites,among others overtook the district initial analysis.these changes rendered moot large sections of the focused feasibility study and blunted its value under the ncp.the district subsequent analytic efforts,in its supplemental focused feasibility study and its late staff report,did not remedy these deficiencies.instead,these subsequent efforts took the analysis of the focused feasibility study as given and analyzed the district proposed changes to the project.importantly,the district never reconsidered whether,in light of the changes to the project and the north basin area,the no action or monitored natural attenuation alternatives merited further consideration.the district efforts resulted in inadequate consideration of alternative remedial actions,including the nbgpp as eventually approved,and were therefore inconsistent with the ncp.the district contrary arguments are unpersuasive 
because the district has not shown its response costs were consistent with the ncp,it is not entitled to monetary recovery on its hsaa claim against any defendant,including northrop.the court errors identified above were therefore not ultimately prejudicial,and we will therefore affirm the court judgment against the district on this claim.we next consider the separate question of the district request for a declaration finding defendants liable for its future costs under the hsaa.
declaratory relief and equitable apportionment 
the district sought a declaration that defendants would be jointly and severally liable under the hsaa for future costs of the nbgpp.the trial court rejected the district claim for declaratory relief,and instead it issued a declaration that defendants have no liability to the district for damages,response costs,or other costs claimed by the district,or any future costs.we will consider the district broader challenge to this declaration in part v,post.but several arguments regarding causation,ncp consistency,and equitable allocation implicate the hsaa specifically,so we will consider them here.
as we have explained,as to alcoa,arnold,cbs,and crucible,we will affirm the judgment in their favor on the district hsaa claim based,in part,on the trial court causation findings.the district makes no argument for reversal of the trial court declaration for these defendants where,as here,the trial court causation findings stand.as to northrop,we rely solely on the district failure to prove ncp consistency in affirming the judgment in its favor on the district hsaa claim.the district argues that ncp inconsistency can not provide a basis for a declaration of no liability as to future costs because the district could remedy that inconsistency in the future.see calmat san gabriel valley gun club.d.we agree.the trial court declaration of no liability as to future costs as to northrop can not be affirmed based on ncp noncompliance alone.absent a valid ground for affirmance,the declaration as to future costs must be reversed as to northrop.
on this point,defendants contend the declaration of no future liability reflects an equitable apportionment of zero percent responsibility to defendants and may therefore be affirmed on that basis.the hsaa allows such equitable apportionment in resolving claims for contribution or indemnity,the court may allocate costs among liable parties using appropriate equitable factors.health saf.code,subd.d.the hsaa differs in this regard from cercla,which does not allow equitable apportionment in actions for cost recovery under title united states code section a see pcs nitrogen ashley ii of charleston llc cir.the district reliance on federal authorities regarding apportionment in cercla cost recovery actions is therefore unpersuasive.the district claim under the hsaa is for indemnity see part,ante,and the hsaa expressly allows equitable apportionment for such claims.health saf.code,subd.d.
although the trial court had the discretion to order equitable apportionment,based on our review of the court statement of decision it did not do so.the court referenced only allocation,not equitable allocation or equitable apportionment.it did not reference the text of the statute allowing equitable apportionment,and it did not consider any equitable factors in determining that defendants should be allocated no liability.instead,the court allocation rested on its causation findings,including that t he district did not persuade the trier of fact by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a causal connection between the trial defendants activities and the need to incur response costs and that the conduct of the district and entities other than the trial defendants are a substantial factor in the district decision to develop the nbgpp.the court concluded,there is no factual basis for allocation of responsibility for past or future expenditures among the trial defendants or as between one or more trial defendant and the district.
the trial court statement of decision shows that its zero allocation was not equitable in nature.it was based on the court causation findings,not equitable factors.as such,for reasons we have already discussed,it can not provide the basis for a future declaration of no liability under the hsaa for northrop.
ii.ocwd act 
the district contends the trial court erred by rejecting its claim under section of the ocwd act.that section empowers the district to conduct any investigations of the quality of the surface and groundwaters within the d istrict to determine whether those waters are contaminated or polluted ocwd act,subd.a,to perform any cleanup,abatement,or remedial work needed to prevent,abate,or contain any threatened or existing contamination of,or pollution to,the surface or groundwaters of the d istrict,subd.b,and to seek recovery of its reasonable costs from the person causing or threatening to cause that contamination or pollution in a civil action,subd.c.subdivision c therefore creates a private right of action for cost recovery specific to the district if,pursuant to subdivision b,the contamination or pollution is cleaned up or contained,the effects thereof abated,or in the case of threatened contamination or pollution,other necessary remedial action is taken,the person causing or threatening to cause that contamination or pollution shall be liable to the d istrict to the extent of the reasonable costs actually incurred in cleaning up or containing the contamination or pollution,abating the effects of the contamination or pollution,or taking other remedial action.the amount of those costs,together with court costs and reasonable attorneys fees,shall be recoverable in a civil action by,and paid to,the d istrict,subd.c.
the trial court rejected the district claim under the ocwd act on four grounds the district had not established causation the district costs were not reasonable or necessary the district costs were merely investigatory and the district had not shown it had cleaned up,contained,or abated contamination or pollution,or taken other necessary remedial action in response to threatened contamination or pollution.the district claims error as to each ground.for reasons we will explain,we conclude the trial court erred in interpreting the ocwd act on each ground,but the errors were prejudicial only as to northrop.
the district contends the court erred by finding that defendants had not caused the nbgpp and therefore were not liable under the ocwd act.the meaning of the ocwd act is a legal question subject to our independent review the court factual findings will be upheld if the evidence supports them.see central valley,supra,th at.the ocwd act provides,in relevant part,as follows t he person causing or threatening to cause that contamination or pollution shall be liable to the district to the extent of the reasonable costs actually incurred in cleaning up or containing the contamination or pollution,abating the effects of the contamination or pollution,or taking other remedial action.ocwd act,subd.c,italics added.the causation standard under the ocwd act differs from standard under the hsaa and cercla.whereas the hsaa and cercla have a causation requirement with liable defendants identified on the basis on their relationship to a contaminated site,the ocwd act requires proof that a defendant itself caused or threatened to cause contamination or pollution for which the district has incurred remediation costs.
the ocwd act does not purport to depart from traditional tort principles of causation,so they apply here.see centeno roseville community hospital d.as noted above,california has adopted the substantial factor test for causation in tort actions.viner,supra,cal th at.t he substantial factor test subsumes the traditional but for test of causation.id.at.thus,subject to an important exception,the test governs a defendant conduct is not a substantial factor in bringing about harm here,actual or threatened contamination or pollution if the harm would have been sustained even if the defendant had not acted.ibid.the exception applies where there are concurrent independent causes,the defendant conduct is sufficient by itself to bring about the harm,but one or more other forces are operating independently that would also be sufficient by themselves to bring about the harm.ibid.when this exception applies,the defendant conduct satisfies the substantial factor test even though the defendant conduct is not a cause of the harm.
the district contends the trial court erred by requiring the district to show that each defendant caused the nbgpp as a whole.for reasons analogous to those we have already discussed under the hsaa and cercla see part,ante,we agree.the issue is not whether a defendant was a substantial factor in bringing about the entire nbgpp.under the ocwd act,the district was required to prove that a defendant was a substantial factor in bringing about actual or threatened contamination or pollution of surface or groundwater in the district.ocwd act,subds.b,c.
although the district has shown error,we must nonetheless affirm unless the error was prejudicial,it is reasonably probable the district would have obtained a more favorable result absent the error.here,aside from northrop,the trial court made factual findings that mirrored the correct standard under the ocwd act.among the court findings were the following there is no direct evidence of any release of voc to the shallow aquifer in the nbgpp area by any trial defendant except northrop.the preponderance of the evidence is that voc releases to the shallow aquifer in the nbgpp area were not caused by any trial defendant except northrop.the weight of the evidence establishes that alcoa,arnold,cbs,and crucible did not release chemicals of concern into the shallow aquifer,groundwater,nor do their past activities threaten future groundwater contamination.given these findings,and as more fully explained in part.ante,the district has not shown a reasonable probability that it would have obtained a more favorable result on this issue as to alcoa,arnold,cbs,and crucible.as to northrop,the trial court found that it had caused voc contamination in the shallow aquifer.causation under the ocwd act requires the district to prove that a defendant caus ed or threaten ed to cause contamination or pollution in surface or groundwater.ocwd act,subd.c.the trial court finding shows that this element was satisfied.as to northrop,therefore,it is reasonably probable the trial court would have found the district carried its burden on causation if it had used the correct causation standard.
based on analogies to cercla and california negligence law,the district contends it was prejudiced as to all defendants.it argues that causation should be presumed where a defendant has generated a particular type of contamination or pollution and the district has incurred costs to respond to a similar type of contamination or pollution at the defendant site.the district argument ignores the text of the ocwd,which ties the district recovery to remedial actions taken in response to actual or threatened contamination or pollution caused by a specific defendant.the district analogy to cercla relies on monsanto,supra,asarco,supra,d,and castaic lake,supra,d,and is unpersuasive for the reasons we have already discussed in part,ante.the district analogy to california negligence law relies on the principle that causation will be presumed where the defendant wrongful conduct has made it impossible for the plaintiff to prove causation.see,haft lone palm hotel cal d.we are unpersuaded that this principle applies here.defendants mere acts of contamination in this case did not make it impossible for the district to prove causation.to the contrary,the actions of defendants were revealed by contamination in the soil at their sites.any difficulty in proving causation stemmed from the complexities of hydrogeology,not the actions of defendants,and would be present in any groundwater contamination case.the district has not shown prejudice as to any defendant other than northrop.and,because causation is an essential element of the district ocwd act claim,the district failure to show prejudice requires that we affirm the judgment against the district as to all defendants except northrop on this claim.as to northrop,however,we must consider the alternative grounds supporting the trial court judgment to determine whether any properly support the judgment notwithstanding the court error regarding causation.
necessary remedial actions and reasonable costs 
the second alternative ground for the trial court judgment was its finding that the nbgpp was neither necessary nor reasonable.the ocwd act requires that any cleanup,containment,abatement,or remedial work be necessary and any incurred costs be reasonable in order for the district to recover.ocwd act,subd.c.the necessity of the district actions,and the reasonableness of its costs,is presumed defendants have the burden of proving otherwise.ibid.the trial court concluded,whether the statutory presumptions of necessity and reasonableness applied or not,the trial defendants demonstrated the nbgpp was neither necessary nor reasonable in terms of cost insofar as the voc,nitrate and perchlorate contamination they were being sued to pay for.in any event,the district had the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that each trial defendant caused or threatened to cause groundwater contamination and that but for each defendant conduct,the nbgpp would not have been necessary.stated another way,the district had the burden to prove that each trial defendant conduct was a substantial factor in the decision to develop the nbgpp.the district did not carry its burden.
the ocwd act does not definite the term necessary.in interpreting the term,we focus first on the word itself,giving it its ordinary meaning.california school employees,supra,cal th at.here,based on our review of the language and purposes of the statute,the ordinary meaning of necessary as needed or required applies here.american heritage dictionary of the english language ed.in this sense,the ocwd act uses the word necessary in the same way as cercla and therefore the hsaa.for this reason,federal authorities interpreting the term in the cercla context instructive.in order to satisfy the ocwd act necessity requirement,the district must show an actual and real threat to human health or the environment and a response action that is addressed to that threat.see carson harbor i,supra,at.
because we conclude the requirement of necessity is the same under both and the ocwd act,our discussion of the court erroneous interpretation of that requirement in part.ante applies equally here.to briefly reiterate,the trial court erred by assessing whether the entire nbgpp was necessary,rather than simply whether the district actions for which it had incurred response costs were necessary.and,although it referenced the statutory presumption of necessity,it appears to have nonetheless placed the burden on the district to show some form of necessity.for that reason as well,the court erred.under the proper standard of necessity,there is no substantial evidence for the court conclusion that the district response costs were not necessary 
similarly,the court erred by assessing whether the costs of the entire planned nbgpp were reasonable,rather than simply the district incurred costs for which it sought recovery.the ocwd act allows recovery to the extent of reasonable costs actually incurred.ocwd act,subd.c.it is possible,for example,that some costs incurred in connection with a remedial action will be reasonable and other costs will be unreasonable.only the district reasonable costs are recoverable.
the trial court error prejudiced the district as to northrop and kester solder sites.the trial court did not make any findings regarding the reasonableness of the district past incurred costs related to those sites,separate and apart from the nbgpp as a whole.based on our review of the evidence,it is reasonably probable the court would have found at least some of the district past costs reasonable if it had undertaken such an analysis under the correct standard.
it is unnecessary to consider prejudice as to the remaining defendants because the element of causation,which we discussed in the previous part,is an essential to the district ocwd act claim.our conclusion that it is not reasonably probable that the trial court would have found in favor of the district on causation if it had used the correct standard fatally undermines the claim.
recovery of investigatory costs 
the third alternative ground for the trial court judgment was its finding that the district past costs for installing monitoring and extraction wells were merely investigatory and therefore not recoverable under the ocwd act.the court reasoned that such costs fell within the district power to conduct investigations under the ocwd act,section,subdivision a.because the ocwd act allows recovery of costs incurred pursuant to the district power to perform cleanup,abatement,or remedial work under the ocwd act,section,subdivision b not investigations under subdivision a the court found that the monitoring and extraction well costs were not recoverable.
on de novo review,we conclude the trial court incorrectly restricted the scope of recoverable costs under the ocwd act.the issue is not whether the claimed costs fall under the district power under section,subdivision a and are therefore excluded.it is whether the claimed costs fall under section,subdivisions b and c and are therefore included.a given action,for example,might fall under both grants of power.it was error for the trial court to conclude the two subdivisions are mutually exclusive.
the ocwd act,section,subdivision c allows recovery of the reasonable costs actually incurred in cleaning up or containing the contamination or pollution,abating the effects of the contamination or pollution,or taking other remedial action.a cost is recoverable if it is incurred as part of these remedial actions.as our discussion of the ncp shows,a remedial action involves much more than simply the physical cleanup or containment process itself.it involves investigation,planning,design,development,and documentation.because these activities are part of remedial action,the costs of such activities are recoverable 
resisting this conclusion,defendants rely on the maxim of statutory interpretation that different words or phrases in a statute must have different meanings.see,roy superior court th,roy ordinarily,where the legislature uses a different word or phrase in one part of a statute than it does in other sections or in a similar statute concerning a related subject,it must be presumed that the legislature intended a different meaning.but words or phrases can have different meanings without being mutually exclusive.in other words,different words and phrases may have overlapping,but not coextensive,meanings.for example,in regents of the university of california superior court th,the court compared the meanings of disclose and release as used in different sections of the confidentiality of medical information act civ.code,et.the court recognized the terms were not synonymous and therefore had different common or ordinary meanings.regents of the university of california,at nonetheless,the court implicitly recognized their meanings overlapped,describing the definition of release as broader than the definition of disclose.see roy,supra,th at recognizing that the term sexual relations was broader than,but overlapped with,the term sexual contact as used in physician disciplinary statutes.
the different meanings of the ocwd act provisions at issue are readily apparent.section,subdivision a,gives the district broad power to conduct investigations of surface and groundwater quality,unconstrained by any known contamination or prospective remedial action.section,subdivision b,gives the district power to conduct cleanup,abatement,and remedial work.these subdivisions plainly have different meanings,even though they overlap.the relevant question for purposes of a cost recovery action is simply whether the costs in question fall within the latter subdivision.the fact that some costs may also fall within the former subdivision is of no moment.
defendants rely on a federal district court opinion interpreting the cost recovery provisions of the ocwd act.in re methyl tertiary butyl ether products liability litigation d mtbe litigation.in that case,the court considered whether costs associated with the following activities were recoverable t he district has conducted testing for mtbe at drinking water production wells associated with stations where mtbe was released and retained consultants to investigate and characterize the groundwater impacts from mtbe released at gasoline stations within the district service area at a cost of at least thousand dollars.id.at,footnotes omitted.the court concluded these costs were not recoverable testing and constitute investigatory work,not remedial action.the district conducts testing as part of its regular course of business.as for the consultant reports,creating summaries of the activities of others at the sites at issue in this motion has nothing to do with remedying threatened contamination.nor is there any evidence that the district consultants file review has led or will lead to remedial action at these sites,or.in fact,there is no evidence that the district has done anything with these consultant reports outside of this litigation.id.at,footnotes omitted.
although the mtbe litigation court adhered to a strict and unwarranted distinction between investigatory costs and remedial action,its discussion reflects some of the factors that a court should use to determine whether an activity that could be characterized as investigatory is nonetheless also part of a remedial action.for example,if a plaintiff conducts testing as part of its regular course of business,and not in response to contamination or threatened contamination,that could indicate that such testing is not remedial action.see mtbe litigation,supra,d at.similarly,if a plaintiff drafts reports that have nothing to do with remedying threatened contamination,that could indicate that the reports are not part of a remedial action.see ibid.because we do not have the relevant record before us,we can not comment on the mtbe litigation court conclusion regarding the specific costs at issue in that litigation.but we are not persuaded that its conclusion should affect our interpretation of the ocwd act discussed above 
for the foregoing reasons,the trial court here erred by interpreting the ocwd act to preclude recovery for all investigatory activities,no matter how closely tied to remedial action.the court error was prejudicial to the district,at least viewing this issue in isolation,because it categorically excluded the district from obtaining costs.however,the prejudice stemming from this error effectively applies only to northrop because we have found that the district was not prejudiced by the trial court findings on causation as to the defendants,the failure to satisfy that element is fatal to the district ocwd act claim,and the trial court findings relative to that element would not have been affected by this error regarding investigatory costs.
preconditions to cost recovery 
the fourth alternative ground for the trial court judgment was its finding that the district had not shown that the contamination or pollution was cleaned up or contained,the effects thereof abated,or in the case of threatened contamination or pollution,other necessary remedial action was taken,as required for cost recovery under section,subdivision c of the ocwd act.because the district does not allege legal error,we review the court finding for substantial evidence.
the evidence at trial showed past voc contamination of varying degrees in the shallow soil at each defendant site,as well as a large plume of voc contamination in the shallow aquifer in the north basin area.it was undisputed that the district had not cleaned up any voc contamination by the time of trial.it was also undisputed,however,that voc contamination had attenuated to some extent due to natural processes.
the ordinary meaning of abate is t o reduce in amount,degree,or intensity or lessen.american heritage dict.ed.given this meaning,and the undisputed evidence,we conclude the trial court could not reasonably find that the effects of voc contamination in the north basin area had not abated.it was undisputed they had.the trial court focused on the district activities,finding that the district had not yet cleaned up,contained,or abated any contamination.but this portion of the ocwd act focuses on the result,not the mechanism of action.as defendants point out in their criticism of the nbgpp,monitored natural attenuation is a valid response action to groundwater contamination.the district should not be disincentivized from pursuing this response action,where warranted,based on a reading of the ocwd act that would preclude cost recovery for such an action.
we also conclude the court could not reasonably find that there was no threatened contamination in the north basin area.the ordinary meaning of the word threat in this context is a n indication of an approaching menace the suggestion of impending detriment and a person or thing that might well cause harm.black law dict.ed.industrial landowners and operators,including some defendants,had released large amounts of voc into the shallow soil.in some cases,this voc contamination migrated through about feet of soil to the shallow aquifer and was carried offsite with the flow of groundwater,resulting in plumes of contamination above minimum acceptable levels.these surface voc releases,and their resulting plumes,were an approaching menace that might well cause harm to groundwater.
in reaching its conclusion that voc releases in the north basin area did not threaten contamination,the court referenced the definition of threaten in an analogous section of the water code threaten,for purposes of this section,means a condition creating a substantial probability of harm,when the probability and potential extent of harm make it reasonably necessary to take immediate action to prevent,reduce,or mitigate damages to persons,property,or natural resources.water code,subd.e.the court focused on the phrase immediate action and reasoned that the district had not shown sufficient urgency in its actions to qualify under this statute.the court analysis puts the proverbial cart before the horse.even accepting this definition of threaten,the focus of the analysis is the contamination itself,not whether the district response was adequate.here,it would be unreasonable to conclude the extensive voc releases in the north basin area did not justify immediate action.whether the district appropriately pursued such action is another matter.
the trial court also stated,a vague or possible or potential threat of groundwater contamination in the future based on century voc releases onto the surface soil is too speculative to trigger the conditional clause in the ocwd act for future remediation which may or may not occur.the import of the trial court statement is unclear.voc groundwater contamination in the north basin area was not vague or possible or potential it was a fact,documented by numerous environmental consultants and government agencies.and the ocwd act cost recovery provisions are not conditional.they allow recovery of reasonable costs actually incurred in cleaning up or containing the contamination or pollution,abating the effects of the contamination or pollution,or taking other remedial action.ocwd act,subd.c,italics added.
we conclude the court erred by finding that the district had not shown that the effects of voc contamination had abated or that other remedial action had been taken in response to threatened voc contamination.as with the issue of investigatory costs considered in the previous part,this error viewed in isolation was prejudicial to the district as to all of defendants because it precluded any recovery on the district claim.however,the prejudice stemming from this error effectively applies only to northrop for the same reasons we discussed in the previous part.we will therefore affirm the court judgment on the district ocwd act claim as to alcoa,arnold,cbs,and crucible.as to northrop,because we have found the trial court erred as to each of the four alternative grounds supporting the judgment,and those errors were prejudicial,we will reverse the judgment 
iii.common law claims 
the district next contends the trial court erred by bifurcating trial and scheduling a bench trial on the district equitable claims before a jury trial on the district legal common law claims and treating its factual findings following the bench trial as binding on the district legal claims.the district argues that the court deprived it of its right to trial by jury on its legal claims and thereby violated code of civil procedure section,subdivision b that the factual findings on the district equitable claims involved different issues than its legal claims or were unnecessary and therefore do not apply and that new evidence arising after the bench trial required the court to allow a jury trial on the district legal claims.
in advance of a pretrial status conference,the district submitted a statement proposing that its legal claims be tried first before a jury and its equitable claims be determined by the court afterwards.defendants proposed the opposite schedule.they explained that any factual findings made as a result of the bench trial would be binding in the jury trial,thereby shortening the jury trial or eliminating it entirely.
at the status conference,the court said it was inclined to try the equitable issues first.the district expressed its concern that it would not be able to present its legal claims to a jury if the court resolved its equitable claims adversely and the problem is that if you rule on any issue,the defendants will argue that that precludes us from going to a jury on our tort claims,that that been resolved for all time.the court responded,well,that can be handled before we start the trial with exactly some understanding,either an understanding among counsel or an order from the court,as to exactly what the court rulings mean,does it the district agreed,that one potential solution,but it was concerned about duplicative presentations of evidence.the court discussed what would happen if the district did not prevail on its equitable claims let take the flip side.you do the court trial and plaintiffs do prevail on the statutory causes of action.as long as we clear going in kind of what the parameters are,plaintiff would still have a choice whether plaintiff wanted to having had a verdict or a judgment or a decision in a court trial on statutory causes of action,whether it makes sense to go forward with a jury.the court later remarked,but i think we all agree that while you have an absolute right an absolute right and i would never try and talk anybody out of a jury trial on the causes of action where you have the right to a jury trial sometimes that not the economically or physically,that not the best way to go.after a lengthy discussion of joint and several liability,the court stated,but look,unless someone comes up with a real show stopper,i inclined to try the court issues first.i think on balance it is just a better way to go.
as we have discussed,the court held a bench trial on the district claims under the ocwd act and the hsaa and for declaratory relief.the court found in favor of defendants on each claim.following trial,defendants filed a motion for judgment on the district remaining claims for negligence,nuisance,and trespass.defendants argued that the court causation findings in its statement of decision would apply in any jury trial on the district claims.in defendants view,these findings precluded recovery on the district claims because those claims each required a showing of causation.the district opposed.following argument,the court granted the motion for judgment.
trial sequencing and the right to trial by jury 
as noted,the district argues that the sequencing of trial,and the subsequent application of the court equitable findings to the district legal claims,violated its right to trial by jury and thereby ran afoul of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b that statute provides,in relevant part,as follows the court,in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice,or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy,may order a separate trial of any cause of action,including a cause of action asserted in a,or of any separate issue or of any number of causes of action or issues,preserving the right of trial by jury required by the constitution or a statute of this state or of the united states.code civ,subd.b.

the plain language of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b requires a court to preserve a party right to a jury trial when ordering separate trials,but it does not itself define a party jury trial right or what preserving it requires.we will therefore consider extrinsic aids,including case authority regarding california jury trial right and the legislative history of this statute,to interpret its language.
a jury trial,a s a general proposition,is a matter of right in a civil action at law,but not in equity.citations.citation.an action at law is one for which a jury trial was permitted at common law as it existed at the time our constitution was first adopted in.nwosu uba th,nwosu.the parties here agree that the district common law claims for negligence,nuisance,and trespass are actions at law and therefore the district has a right to trial by jury on those claims 
by joining its equitable and legal claims in one action,the district did not lose this jury trial right.it is settled in this state that where legal and equitable issues are joined in the same action the parties are entitled to a jury trial on the legal issues.robinson puls cal d,see swasey adair cal,swasey selby constructors,mccarthy d.in light of reforms that allowed a plaintiff to assert both legal and equitable claims in the same forum,the supreme court explained it does not seem desirable to force a party to give up his right to a jury trial as an alternative to utilizing the advantages of modern code procedure designed to permit settlement of various issues in a single action.connell bowes cal d,connell.
the recognition that a plaintiff did not give up his or her jury trial right by combining equitable and legal causes of action,however,was accompanied by an important caveat a trial court handling such a combined action could,and in many cases should,hold a bench trial on any equitable issues first.connell,supra,cal d at.i f any legal issues remain after the bench trial,a jury may be called,italics added see swasey,supra,cal.at.thus,while a plaintiff retained his jury trial right,the extent of the issues actually tried by jury could be impacted by the trial court findings in equity.where a mixed bag of legal and equitable claims is presented in a case,a court trial of the equitable claims first may obviate the necessity of a jury trial on the legal claims,but otherwise the plaintiff can not be denied the right to a jury trial on the legal causes of action.citations.if there are equitable and legal remedies sought in the same action,the parties are entitled to have a jury determine the legal issues unless the trial court initial determination of the equitable issues is also dispositive of the legal issues,leaving nothing to be tried by a jury.dipirro bondo th,dipirro,italics added.
numerous opinions from california courts,including our supreme court,confirm this rule it is well established that,in a case involving both legal and equitable issues,the trial court may proceed to try the equitable issues first,without a jury,and that if the court determination of those issues is also dispositive of the legal issues,nothing further remains to be tried by a jury.raedeke gibraltar savings loan cal d,raedeke see,darbun enterprises,san fernando community hospital th,darbun hoopes,supra,th at nwosu,supra,th at golden west baseball city of anaheim th,jaffe albertson d,moss bluemm d,richard degen brody,d.
indeed,reviewing courts have emphasized that the better practice for trial courts is to decide equitable issues first for the explicit reason that a jury trial on any legal issues may be avoided.generally,in mixed actions,the equitable issues should be tried first by the court,either with or without an advisory jury.citations.trial courts are encouraged to apply this equity first rule because it promotes judicial economy by potentially obviating the need for a jury trial.darbun,supra,th at see,hoopes,supra,th at nwosu,supra,th at.under these authorities,the trial court decision to bifurcate trial and decide the district equitable claims first was proper.
the district argues that these authorities fail to give effect to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,which requires courts to preserv e the right of trial by jury required by the constitution or a statute of this state or of the united states when ordering separate trials.the district points out that this language was part of a broader revision intended to conform the statute to its federal counterpart,rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district contends that rule prohibits the equity first procedure followed in california and that the legislature adoption of revised code of civil procedure section indicates its intent to adopt rule prohibition for california courts as well.
the district premise is flawed.the federal prohibition of the equity first procedure stems not from rule but from federal constitutional law.in beacon theatres,westover beacon theatres,the united states supreme court recognized that existing federal rules gave trial courts the discretion to try equitable issues first.id.at.beacon theatres held that this discretion was limited in federal cases by the seventh amendment since the right to a jury trial is a constitutional one,however,while no similar requirement protects trials by the court,that discretion is very narrowly limited and must,wherever possible,be exercised to preserve jury trial,fn.omitted.

although the district has submitted legislative history for,which effected this amendment,nothing in this history shows that the legislature intended to adopt the reasoning of beacon theatres.instead,the comments of the senate committee on the judiciary state,in relevant part,the revision makes clear not only that the court may sever causes of action for trial but also that the court may sever issues for trial.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.sen reg.sess.the sequence of the severed trial was not discussed.
the district points to the rule that w hen the legislature adopts the substance of a statute,the legislature is presumed to have acted with knowledge and in light of decisions interpreting the adopted statute.hodge kirkpatrick development,th.but,as we have discussed,the federal rule against equity first sequencing is not an interpretation of rule.it is a requirement of the seventh amendment,as beacon theatres and its progeny explain.beacon theatres,supra,at see ross bernhard,dairy queen,wood.
the district attempts to limit california equity first rule only to certain situations that do not apply here,such as where the plaintiff seeks mutually exclusive legal and equitable remedies or where the defendant asserts an equitable defense.while certain cases have highlighted these grounds as historic reasons for preferring the equity first procedure see,hoopes,supra,th at,the rule announced in numerous appellate cases and by our supreme court is not so limited.raedeke,supra,cal d at darbun,supra,th at hoopes,supra,th at dipirro,supra,th at nwosu,supra,th at golden west baseball city of anaheim,supra,th at jaffe albertson,supra,d at moss bluemm,supra,d at richard degen brody,supra,d at.leading commentators agree.see,witkin,cal.procedure ed.trial,weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group.
the district relies on walton walton th walton as explicitly articulating a contrary rule.walton approved of an equity first procedure on the grounds the plaintiff sought mutually exclusive equitable and legal remedies.id.at.walton further commented,in dicta,that when a plaintiff seeks cumulative legal and equitable remedies,all claims legal and equitable must be tried,and the right to jury trial can not be defeated by severance of the equitable claim.ibid.
this comment is not supported by the authorities cited by walton.see walton,supra,th at,citing connell,supra,cal d pacific western oil bern oil cal d pacific western hutchason marks d hutchason.those authorities stand for the settled proposition that a plaintiff does not lose his or her right to a jury trial on its legal claims by combining those claims with equitable claims.connell,at pacific western,at hutchason,at.and,as we have noted,connell approved of the equity first rule.connell,supra,cal d at.we find walton dicta unpersuasive and will adhere to the and equity first rule articulated in the cases cited above.the trial court did not abuse its discretion by following the rule here.
on reply,the district contends that even if the equity first rule were valid,the trial court erred under the specific circumstances here by giving preclusive effect to its factual findings in connection with the district equitable claims.the district points to the court comments during a status conference that the district had an absolute right to a jury trial and that the court would never try and talk anybody out of jury trial on the causes of action where you have the right to a jury trial.
the district relies on the recent case of darbun,supra,th.darbun considered whether a trial court properly gave preclusive effect to its factual findings in a bench trial under the equity first rule.id.at.darbun found error based on the trial court inconsistent and misleading statements regarding,among other things,which issues would be decided during the first phase bench trial.id.at.the parties proceeded through the first phase of trial,then to jury trial,under the court assurances that the jury would decide the issue of breach.id.at.the trial court subsequently decided the issue of breach,which darbun held deprived the plaintiff of its jury trial right.had the trial court properly informed the parties of an intention to decide the issue of breach,the plaintiff would have had the opportunity to preserve its right to a jury trial by abandoning its request for equitable relief and seeking only damages.ibid.
here,unlike darbun,the trial court did not limit the issues it would consider in connection with the bench trial on the district equitable claims.during the status conference,the court mentioned the possibility the parties might come to an agreement regarding such a limitation,but no agreement appears in the record.the court references to the district right to a jury trial were consistent with longstanding case law holding that the district did not lose its right to a jury trial on its legal claims when it combined those claims with equitable claims in a single action.see connell,supra,cal d at.as we have explained,however,this jury trial right is not inconsistent with the further principle that any factual findings made following a bench trial on the district equitable claims may be binding on its legal claims,and the right is not infringed by its application.see dipirro,supra,th at nwosu,supra,th at here,the fact that the trial of the equitable issues first resulted in factual findings that implicated the legal claims does not mean that plaintiff was improperly denied the right to a jury trial.the district has not shown any error.
necessary findings 
the district alternatively argues that,even if the sequencing of trial were proper,the court causation findings were not necessary because other findings also foreclosed the district claims and therefore could not be applied to the district legal claims.the district is incorrect.all of the trial court equitable findings were binding on the district legal claims,regardless of whether they were necessary for the judgment.issues adjudicated in earlier phases of a bifurcated trial are binding in later phases of that trial and need not be relitigated.citations.no other rule is possible,or bifurcation of trial issues would create duplication,thus subverting the procedure goal of efficiency.citation.d uplication of effort is the very opposite of the purpose of bifurcated trials.arntz contracting,supra,th at see nwosu,supra,th at.
the district relies on authorities interpreting the doctrine of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion.see,newport beach country club,founding members of newport beach country club th.although courts have compared the binding effect of factual findings in a prior phase of trial to collateral estoppel see,nwosu,supra,th at,the district has not shown the requirements of collateral estoppel apply here.the district cites only hoopes,supra,th,which quoted a federal appellate opinion as requiring an issue be necessarily decided in the earlier phase of trial to have binding effect.id.at,citing troy bay state computer group,cir.whatever the rule in federal courts,california courts have not so narrowly interpreted the binding effect of earlier findings.see arntz contracting,supra,th at.
the district also argues that the court causation findings have no bearing on the merit of its legal claims because those claims do not require an analogous showing of causation and because they may give rise to different damages.the particulars of the district argument are difficult to discern.the district does not identify the elements of its legal claims for trespass,nuisance,and negligence.it does not discuss the trial court factual findings in any detail or compare those findings to the elements of its claims.its legal argument on this issue is wholly lacking.
under these circumstances,we may treat the district arguments as waived.appellate briefs must provide argument and legal authority for the positions taken.when an appellant fails to raise a point,or asserts it but fails to support it with reasoned argument and citations to authority,we treat the point as waived.citation.we are not bound to develop appellants arguments for them.citation.the absence of cogent legal argument or citation to authority allows this court to treat the contention as waived.cahill san diego gas electric th.
even considering the analysis offered by the district,it is unpersuasive.the district asserts that a landowner or possessor has a duty to prevent harm from dangerous artificial conditions on his or her property,regardless of their origin.see sprecher adamson cal d,coates chinn cal d.whatever the merits of the district assertion,it has no bearing on the issue of causation.the district has not shown that causation is not an element of its legal claims.similarly,the district claims it would be entitled to damages in the form of diminution in value of the groundwater in the north basin area.see raven cove townhomes,knuppe development d.but,again,the district does not explain how this difference in the type of recoverable damages even if correct removes the need to prove causation or why its claims should survive notwithstanding the court extensive factual findings.as the appellant,it was the district burden to show error.it has not done so.
new evidence 
the district contends that new evidence,arising after the court bench trial,required the court to hold a jury trial on its legal claims.the new evidence identified by the district includes new data from northrop site,the alcoa site,and the crucible site that the district believes undermine the court conclusions regarding those sites.the district also identifies new data from the principle aquifer allegedly showing an increase in pce contamination in the two years following the court bench trial.
it is well settled that,in the second phase of a bifurcated trial,the parties may present evidence that was not presented during the first phase.see,sturges charles harney,d,the record of the equitable proceedings indicated that the court patiently heard a great deal of additional testimony.but this principle does not compel the trial court to hold an second phase trial merely because a party contends it can present additional evidence.
the district analogizes the instant situation to collateral estoppel issue preclusion,which may not be applied in certain situations where new facts have arisen in the time between the first and second actions.res judicata or collateral estoppel was never intended to operate so as to prevent a of the same question between the same parties where,in the interval between the first and second actions,the facts have materially changed or new facts have occurred which may have altered the legal rights or relations of the litigants.evans celotex d,evans.even assuming that this principle would apply here,the district has not shown a change in circumstances sufficient to justify discarding the factual determinations in the first phase of trial.this exception to collateral estoppel may apply where the legal relationship of the parties has changed or where new events or conditions which altered the respective rights of the parties or caused a different legal doctrine to be applied occur.ibid.a related exception may apply where a party was deprived of a full and fair opportunity to litigate an issue in the prior proceeding.smith exxonmobil oil th.
the exception will not apply,however,where the new evidence or changed circumstances merely go to the weight of the evidence bearing on the issue an exception to collateral estoppel can not be grounded on the alleged discovery of more persuasive evidence.otherwise,there would be no end to litigation.evans,supra,d at.based on our review of the new evidence identified by the district,we conclude it does not show a changed legal relationship or other sufficient circumstances to justify an exception to the doctrine of collateral estoppel.it merely goes to the weight of the evidence regarding contamination at defendants sites and their subsequent remediation efforts.as such,the district has not shown the court erred by refusing to hold a second phase trial on its legal claims based on the discovery of allegedly new evidence.
iv.evidentiary issues 
evidence code section 
the district contends the trial court erred by applying evidence code section in its statement of decision to justify viewing the district causation evidence with distrust because of certain deficiencies in the district presentation of evidence.the deficiencies identified by the trial court included the district failure to conduct a fate and transport analysis of voc contamination in the north basin area the district failure to update its and contaminant plume maps for trial the district failure to calculate the rate of natural attenuation for voc contamination and the district failure to conduct an adequate analysis for the nbgpp.
evidence code section provides as follows if weaker and less satisfactory evidence is offered when it was within the power of the party to produce stronger and more satisfactory evidence,the evidence offered should be viewed with distrust.section only applies when it can be shown that a party is in fact in possession of or has access to better and stronger evidence than was presented.people taylor d,see people marshall cal th,fn.it does not apply to evidence that does not exist.see people von villas th,statute does not apply to the failure to create evidence or record evidence in a certain fashion people coleman d,statute does not apply to prosecution failure to obtain fingerprint evidence.we review the question of whether the court properly invoked evidence code section for substantial evidence,whether the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the court decision supported the application of the statute.
the paradigmatic example of the application of evidence code section is where a party has documentation of an event,but instead offers oral testimony by a potentially biased witness.the witness testimony may be viewed with distrust under the statute.hardesty sacramento metropolitan air quality management district th,see pelayo lee management th,failure to produce summons vallbona springer th,failure to produce documentation of financial liabilities largey intrastate radiotelephone,d,failure to produce corporate records concerning board meetings.
here,the question is whether the district failure to conduct certain analyses,either by its own staff or its expert witnesses,falls within the scope of the statute.we conclude it does not.the trial court did not find that the district failed to produce the results of these analyses it found that the district did not conduct the analyses at all.the evidence the trial court believed should be produced did not exist.it therefore can not be the subject of an adverse inference under evidence code section.see people von villas,supra,th at people coleman,supra,d at.
defendants point out that the statute references the power of the party to produce stronger and more satisfactory evidence.evid.code,italics added.they claim that the district had the power to produce,create the analyses at issue.but,as the foregoing cases demonstrate,the statute has not been applied merely where a party has the ability or opportunity to create evidence.the evidence must itself already exist the court therefore erred by invoking evidence code section without a showing that the district had evidence in existence that it had not produced.
that said,the trial court was entitled to judge the credibility and weight of the district causation evidence,separate and apart from evidence code section.the court could take into account a variety of factors,including whether the evidence was outdated or did not reflect the relevant professional standards of a given scientific field.in its statement of decision,the trial court identified a number of additional reasons it distrusted the district causation evidence,including the district failure to provide its expert witnesses with important information,expert witness waddell confusing and misleading classification system for voc groundwater contamination,his use of exhibits based on inaccurate data,the district reliance on leading questions during waddell direct examination,waddell admissions on that his testimony was simply wrong in certain instances,and his advocate demeanor.
the district has the burden of showing prejudice stemming from the trial court erroneous application of evidence code section.the district must show there is a reasonable probability,a reasonable chance,it would have obtained a more favorable result absent the error.see college hospital superior court cal th,see also kinsman unocal cal th.the district makes little effort to establish prejudice in its briefing.it states that the trial court application of the statute call s into question the propriety of all of the trial court factual findings and references its prior discussion of causation with respect to each defendant.these conclusory assertions do not establish prejudice.given the evidence showing a lack of causation,and the trial court other identified grounds for distrusting the district causation evidence discussed above,we conclude the district has not shown prejudice based on the court erroneous application of evidence code section 
grab samples 
the district claims the trial court improperly discounted the results of the district grab sample evidence while crediting defendants similar evidence.the district contends its grab samples were a reliable method of identifying contamination at defendants sites.see united states federal resources id.d,crediting the results of sampling to show site contamination.the district does not contend the trial court excluded the evidence at issue.the challenge raised by the district therefore goes only to the weight accorded to the district evidence,not its admissibility.our standard of review precludes reweighing the evidence on appeal,so the district challenge must fail 
groundwater recharge activities 
the district argues the trial court improperly used the district groundwater recharge activities as a reason to distrust its causation evidence.in its statement of decision,the court stated,moreover,the district conduct made it more difficult to determine which entities,including,contributed to groundwater contamination or the threat of groundwater contamination.this conduct by the district made it more difficult to determine which entities other than trial defendants could or were likely to have contributed to groundwater contamination.
while the court remarked on the difficulties created by the district recharge activities,the court did not draw an adverse inference based on those activities.the court did not mention recharge activities in its enumerated list of reasons to distrust the district causation evidence under evidence code section.instead,recharge activities were discussed in connection with the court assessment of the district causation evidence in general.we therefore disagree with the premise of the district argument,that the trial court drew an adverse inference based on the district recharge activities.and,even if the district had established error,it has not shown prejudice for the reasons stated above.
declaratory relief 
the district challenges the trial court declaration that defendants have no liability to the district for damages,response costs,or other costs claimed by the district,or any future costs.the district argues that its request for declaratory relief was derivative of its other claims,so the court declaration must be reversed if the district successfully urges reversal of its other claims.we agree.the court judgment in favor of northrop on the district ocwd act claim must be reversed.see part ii,ante.to that extent,the court declaration in favor of northrop must be reversed as well.and,for reasons we have explained,the court declaration in favor of northrop as to future costs under the hsaa must be reversed.see part,ante.we therefore need not address the district further asserted ground for reversal concerning the its future costs and northrop.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed in part as to district cause of action against northrop under the ocwd act and the declaration finding no liability in favor of northrop.on remand,the trial court shall reexamine the relevant evidence in conformity with the views expressed herein,receive such additional evidence as the court deems necessary and appropriate,make new findings of fact and conclusions of law concerning the issues subject to reversal,and enter judgment accordingly.in all other respects,the judgment is affirmed.as between the district and alcoa,arnold,cbs,and crucible,these defendants shall recover their costs on appeal.as between the district and northrop,the parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.
certified for publication 
large portions of the record are unclear in this regard.where the record permits,we have endeavored to use as precise a term as possible.the term groundwater can also refer to perched groundwater,which is created when clay layers or other less permeable soils prevent water from migrating downwards toward the shallow and principal aquifers,forcing it to collect or perch atop the less permeable soil.however,in this appeal,the usual use of the unqualified term groundwater excludes perched groundwater.
one defendant at trial,mag aerospace industries,mag,successfully moved for judgment on the district equitable claims under code of civil procedure section and thereafter obtained judgment on the district remaining legal claims as well.we consider the judgment involving mag in a separate opinion filed this date.orange county water district mag aerospace industries,june,th.
the abbreviation gpm refers to gallons per minute,a measure of the capacity of the extraction wells to pump groundwater.
as a public agency,the district board and committee meetings are open to the public.the district provides notice of agenda items and,at least hours prior to the meeting,technical backup information.the district accepts written public comments on agenda items and holds a public comment period during meetings.
an is a unit of measurement equal to the volume of water required to cover an area of one acre with one foot of water.
the evidence at trial showed that the drinking water production wells that had been removed from service because of voc contamination in the principal aquifer were located in an area of the north basin that would not be affected by the nbgpp.the district determined that active treatment of the voc contamination plume in that area was unnecessary.it believed monitored natural attenuation would be sufficient to protect human health and the environment there.
larson also believed that one proposed extraction well was unnecessary,even accepting other elements of the nbgpp on their own terms,because of its proximity to other treatment wells whose pumping rates could be increased to compensate for the removal of that well.
waddell acknowledged that another upgradient property,the nonparty jonathan manufacturing site,contributed to tce and pce contamination in groundwater.
mag leased the site at east valencia from through.as noted,we consider the judgment involving mag in a separate opinion filed this date.orange county water district mag aerospace industries,supra,th.
other contaminants,such as tce,were detected at the south raymond and east valencia sites.waddell believed that these contaminants had migrated there from an adjacent sites.for south raymond,the site waddell identified was the nonparty chicago musical site,which was heavily contaminated with pce,tce,and and was being remediated by the dtsc.over a test period,almost pounds of voc were removed through a soil vapor extraction system at the chicago musical site.for south valencia,waddell identified the nonparty monitor plating and american electronics sites.waddell testified that tce detections at south valencia were the result of migration from the monitor plating site.the american electronics site,in waddell view,contributed both tce and pce.
the rwqcb found,as a preliminary matter,that i t is apparent that voc from this site have impacted groundwater.the letter does not specify whether this impact came from voc released at the surface or subsurface voc migration from sources.stephens interpreted the letter as concluding that there was no definite impact to groundwater from the pce contamination in the area of the former dip tank.
the pce groundwater contamination identified by the rwqcb was relatively minor.it was below the applicable maximum contaminant level for pce in drinking water.
waddell opinions involving vista paint were undermined by his admissions,on,that the district had not provided him with relevant information regarding vista paint activities and that he had not referenced any vista paint discovery in his expert report.
around this time,the district staff reviewed northrop activities.although they found that northrop soil study and cleanup was thorough and comprehensive,the district was concerned that the site impact on groundwater remained inadequately investigated.
northrop offered testimony from a second expert witness,john lambie,who testified regarding the necessity and reasonableness of the nbgpp.he agreed with defense expert larson that the voc plume in the north basin area was stable and chemical concentrations were not increasing.as part of his analysis,lambie calculated the volume of voc flowing into groundwater from each of northrop sites.lambie relied on a similar analysis as tofani,but he concluded that the emd site did contribute voc,including tce and,to groundwater.lambie came to similar conclusions about the kester solder site for pce and the site for tce and.lambie compared the total estimated volume of voc releases from northrop sites to the total voc volume in the nbgpp treatment area.he concluded that northrop sites had contributed percent of the pce volume,percent of the tce volume,and percent of the volume.based on these contribution estimates,lambie determined the proportion of the district nbgpp expenditures for which northrop would be responsible.lambie estimates were not based on the actual amount of voc contamination captured by the district extraction wells but on the total amount of voc contamination in the area to be treated by the nbgpp.lambie testified that the latter calculation was the most equitable so looking at the entirety of the problem,whether it captured or not,is,in my view,the equitable way to look at the mass contribution of a party.
the court credited expert testimony that grab samples were only a snapshot of conditions at a portion of a site,were not indicative of past groundwater conditions or trends,were not reproducible,and were not accepted by california regulatory agencies as the sole method for determining whether contamination at a site has impacted groundwater.
as noted above,the court previously granted several defendants motions for summary adjudication of the district negligence claim on statute of limitations grounds.the motion for judgment as to the district negligence claim was therefore brought only by cbs and crucible.
the quoted language became effective on january.stats,ch.prior to that date,among other changes,the beginning of the sentence read,any person who has incurred removal or remedial action costs in accordance with this chapter former health saf.code,subd.e.the parties agree this was a nonsubstantive change in the context of this appeal,so we will refer to the current language in our discussion.
the district contends it is not a private plaintiff,but rather a state under cercla,and need only prove that its costs are not inconsistent with the ncp.see a a.we disagree and will address this argument in part,post.
the cited provision concerns securing a site where hazardous substances have been released,by posted signs or fencing,rather than contribution.health saf.code.contribution is addressed in health and safety code section,which we will discuss in detail below.
this section describes the attorney general right of action to recover costs from liable parties at the request of the dtsc or rwqcb.
fullerton redevelopment agency southern california gas th fullerton redevelopment does not address this issue.although fullerton redevelopment described the hsaa private right of action as limited to a claim for contribution and indemnity and all such claims are equitable in nature id.at,the import of the court language which quoted a lower court minute order is unclear.the reference to contribution and indemnity simply repeats the terms of the statute.the reference to equity appears to mean that actions under the hsaa are equitable,rather than legal,in nature.in any event,the parties in fullerton redevelopment were all liable parties,so the court had no occasion to determine whether nonliable parties may sue under the hsaa.id.at.moreover,in light of our conclusion,we need not decide whether orange county water district arnold engineering th,already decided this issue in the district favor.
the united states supreme court later held that liable parties may also bring a private cause of action for indemnity under united states code section a.atlantic research,supra,at.but this holding did not affect the right of nonliable parties to bring such an action as well.id.at.
defendants alternatively offer the following argument the district does not appeal the hsaa claim under section,subdivision d,for contribution or indemnity that it pled in the operative complaint and that was tried to conclusion.the district has therefore abandoned that issue in this appeal.fn.omitted.this argument is frivolous.the district devoted the bulk of its opening brief to the merits of its hsaa claim,as did defendants in their respondents brief.which hsaa claim did the district address in its briefing,if not the claim that it pled in the operative complaint and that was tried to conclusion 
although we conclude it is reasonably probable the trial court would have made different findings on causation,this conclusion alone does not mandate reversal of the trial court judgment in favor of northrop on the district hsaa claim.the court judgment rested on several grounds,any one of which was sufficient to support the judgment.we will consider the district contentions regarding those additional grounds below.
the district relies heavily on a perceived distinction between cases,where the contamination and the remediation action occur at the same location,and cases,where the locations are different.we reject this distinction.as one federal district court explained,after a review of the statute,its legislative history,and applicable case law,the court holds that the analytical framework that applies in a cercla case is no different than the framework that applies in a cercla case.rather,a always requires a plaintiff to prove,in its prima facie case,that a release from a facility for which the defendant is a responsible person caused the incurrence of response costs.asarco llc cemex.d.
defendants do not articulate a clear position on the issue of causation.on one hand,defendants appear to agree with the district that the correct causation standard focuses on the consequences of a release at a site for which defendant is liable.on the other hand,defendants cite the trial court conclusions that defendants own activities did not cause response costs as conforming to that standard.viewing their briefing as a whole,it appears defendants believe the latter articulation of the standard was correct.defendants state,for example,that the district was required to prove nbgpp would actually treat contamination released by respondents,defendants,not contamination released by another entity.for the reasons we have discussed,this articulation of the hsaa causation standard is incorrect.in any event,defendants devote the bulk of their discussion to the issue of whether substantial evidence supported the trial court findings and do not address the potential prejudice stemming from the trial court use of an incorrect causation standard.defendants heading for this section makes this focus clear substantial evidence supports the finding that no respondent released contamination causing the district to incur response costs.some capitalization omitted.this statement of the causation standard,which is limited to defendants activities only,is incorrect.
if multiple releases or threatened releases each cause the same response costs,the defendants liable for those releases or threatened releases may each be responsible for the full extent of those response costs.under the hsaa,however,a defendant may obtain apportionment of those costs in two ways.first,a party found liable for costs recoverable under this chapter who establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that only a portion of those costs are attributable to that party actions shall be required to pay only for that portion.health saf.code,subd.a.this affirmative defense,in contrast to the causation standard discussed above,focuses on the actions of the defendant in question.second,if the evidence is insufficient to establish the first method of apportionment,the court shall apportion those costs,to the extent practicable,according to equitable principles,among the defendants,subd.b see,subd.d in resolving claims for contribution or indemnity,the court may allocate costs among liable parties using appropriate equitable factors.in its statement of decision,the trial court found,based on the failures of causation it identified,t here is no factual basis for allocation of responsibility for past or future expenditures among the trial defendants or as between one or more trial defendant s and the district.contrary to defendants interpretation,the trial court did not apportion zero costs to defendants.instead,it found no basis on which to make such an apportionment at all.to the extent the court statement of decision could be read to make an allocation,it was simply relying on its causation findings,as we will discuss in part,post.
in its briefing,the district explained that it will be focusing primarily on errors of law,such as the trial court improper standard of causation,which are reviewed de novo.in some instances,the district makes explicit substantial evidence arguments,which we will address below.to the extent the district contends the evidence did not support the trial court judgment more broadly,however,the district has waived this contention because it discusses primarily evidence favorable to its position in its opening brief,rather than all evidence relevant to the court judgment.foreman clark fallon cal d,pope babick th.for example,the district largely omits any discussion of unfavorable testimony from defendants experts on the issue of causation.
the district also claims that it incurred response costs constructing monitoring wells to evaluate contamination from the alcoa site.to support this assertion,the district cites only the testimony of its expert witness waddell,who stated that a district monitoring well on the eastside of the chicago musical site provided data that he used in his evaluation of the alcoa site.this testimony does not relate to causation at all.nowhere does waddell testify that releases at the alcoa site caused the district to install the monitoring well in question.given the trial court factual determination that releases at the alcoa site did not cause shallow aquifer contamination at all,the district has not shown there is a reasonable probability the trial court would have found that those releases caused its claimed investigatory costs.
by contrast,the court found that pce contamination at the arnold site did not impact groundwater,based on admissions by the district expert witness waddell.this finding conforms to the correct causation standard under the hsaa.and,with respect to tce,the court found that arnold did not use that chemical at all.the district argues that the evidence does not support the court finding regarding tce.we disagree.the district had the burden of proof on this issue.the district evidence of arnold tce use consisted of testimony by an arnold employee,daniel hopen,who recalled such use but was not confident and tce contamination in the shallow soil based on soil samples taken two decades after arnold left the site.arnold evidence in opposition consisted of testimony by a arnold maintenance manager who was aware only of use over the entire time of arnold operations and various permits and reports from the second half of arnold tenancy at the site that do not reference tce but in some cases do reference.given the district weak evidence,and the conflicting evidence offered by arnold,the trial court could reasonably find that the district had not carried its burden of showing that arnold used tce.while we may have come to an opposite conclusion had we considered this issue in the first instance,our standard of review precludes the trial court in this manner.given this finding,even if the district had proven that a tce release at the site had impacted groundwater and caused response costs,the district hsaa claim would nonetheless fail because arnold can not be a responsible party for a hazardous substance it did not dispose of.see a.
in its briefing,northrop claims,lambie also testified that any voc historically released at northrop or upgradient kester solder site will not reach any proposed extraction wells as a result of the installation and operation of northrop groundwater treatment well.northrop overstates lambie testimony.lambie testified that he gave northrop credit for its remediation activities,including its recirculation well,that reduced its share of the voc contamination that would reach the shallow and principal aquifers.in explaining the credit,lambie stated,i reduced their share of chemicals going to the recirculation system by virtue of the fact that their chemicals will not continue to arrive there.i would submit that what they have contributed to the aquifer in the past has already reached the area that the district proposed recirculation system will remove.but that the recirculation well is sufficient to control any migration or contribution ongoing from kester solder to the shallow aquifer.the focus of lambie analysis was northrop contribution to voc contamination in the aquifer system,not northrop contribution to contamination actually captured by the district extraction wells.as mentioned above see fn,ante,lambie believed the former analysis results in a more equitable allocation of responsibility and cost.given lambie focus,our interpretation of his testimony is that northrop remediation activities resulted in a net zero contribution of voc contamination in the aquifer system and the nbgpp treatment area after those activities were fully implemented.lambie did not opine on the potential for the nbgpp to treat past voc contamination caused by northrop sites or the ongoing contamination caused by the site that was not treated by northrop recirculation well.we note that while northrop remediation of contamination from sites may have some relevance to cost allocation under lambie methodology,it can not prevent a finding of causation as to the northrop contamination that escapes remediation.
the district cites three federal district court opinions that adhere to the contrary view that municipalities should be considered states in cercla cost recovery actions.see,city of new york exxon,city ofnew york exxon,arizona motorola,no.civ dist.lexis.it appears that these cases represent the minority view of the federal district courts,and we find them unpersuasive for reasons we have already discussed.the district also relies on two opinions that construe other cercla provisions.carolina casualty insurance oahu air conditioning service.d,fn.carolina casualty construing cercla contribution cause of action,f unigard insurance city of lodi,no.civ.wl,unigard construing cercla savings provision against federal preemption,a.neither opinion engaged in a textual analysis of cercla distinction between states and their political subdivisions in its definition of person.and,unlike the cercla provisions at issue in those opinions,the cercla provision here makes an explicit distinction between states and other person s.a a b.for these reasons,unigard and carolina casualty are unpersuasive.we note additionally that these opinions appear to have relied on the policies behind the cercla provisions at issue to include political subdivisions within the term states.we will consider the policy considerations implicated by the use of the term in cercla cost recovery provisions below.
the district attempts to distinguish scvwd on the grounds that the water district at issue there,unlike the district,was not specifically empowered to perform environmental remediation.this difference,however,does not affect our textual analysis of the statute.and,for reasons we explain post,the district environmental remediation powers do not make it a state under cercla.
defendants claim the district was also required to show its costs were reasonable.but neither the hsaa nor cercla have an express requirement that costs be reasonable.the concept is instead part of the requirement that costs be consistent with the ncp.we will consider defendants criticisms in connection with that requirement.
in its discussion of causation,northrop contends its remediation efforts render the nbgpp unnecessary because it is not needed to remediate voc contamination from northrop sites.northrop cites various authorities interpreting the cercla necessity requirement.but,as the placement of northrop discussion shows,the specific relationship between contamination for which northrop is responsible and the district specific response costs is an issue of causation,not necessity,under the cercla and the hsaa.we have already addressed northrop arguments regarding causation in part,ante.
because the district focuses on its overall response to voc contamination in the north basin area,and not any specific response costs,we need not consider whether any specific response costs were consistent with the ncp.the district focus appears to be part of its effort to hold defendants liable for some part of its future costs related to the nbgpp,rather than its past incurred costs only.
the district contends its status as a public agency is evidence that the ncp public participation requirement was satisfied.we disagree.the ncp governs response actions by public agencies and private parties alike.the specific public participation requirements of the ncp would have no meaning as applied to public agencies if their status as public agencies were sufficient to satisfy those requirements.indeed,even the federal government and states must show their actions are not inconsistent with these requirements in order to prevail in a cost recovery action.a a.while the district status as a public agency may,at the margins,make it more likely that its actions will substantially comply with the ncp public participation requirements,the deficiencies we have identified outweigh any such benefit the district might receive in this regard.the district reliance on bedford affiliates,supra,is unpersuasive.in that case,the court held that a statewide agency approval of a private party remediation action may obviate the need for formal public comment where a state agency responsible for overseeing remediation of hazardous wastes gives comprehensive input,and the private parties involved act pursuant to those instructions,the state participation may fulfill the public participation requirement.id.at.here,there was no similar state involvement.and,in bedford affiliates,none of the parties to the action dispute d the quality or cost of plaintiff cleanup efforts,so to preclude its recovery solely because of the lack of public comment would have been unjust.id.at.by contrast here,the parties certainly dispute the quality and cost of the nbgpp.
the district claims the trial court prevented it from presenting evidence showing the actual cost of water treated by the million nbgpp.the district does not describe the context of the trial court decision and does not attempt to show the decision was error.the district claim therefore has no effect on our analysis.
in its briefing,the district estimates the reduction in voc contamination in the shallow aquifer at pounds
