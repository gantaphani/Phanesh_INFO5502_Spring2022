petitioners committee to save the hollywoodland specific plan and hollywood heritage collectively the committee or petitioners appeal judgment on their petition for peremptory writ of mandate.petitioners sought to compel the city of los angeles city to rescind its approval of a specific plan exception for a wooden fence that a homeowner had constructed atop one of the historic granite walls of hollywoodland.the trial court denied the petition,finding the city properly relied on an exception to the hollywoodland specific plan hsp and a categorical exemption under the california environmental quality act ceqa to approve the fence.we affirm in part and reverse in part,concluding that although under the terms of the hsp and the municipal code,the city properly granted an exception to the hsp,under ceqa,the city improperly granted an exemption.
factual background and procedural history 
in the early,when the hollywoodland housing tract was developed,european stonemasons constructed numerous granite support walls abutting the winding,curving streets of the area.in,the city designated the walls,along with several staircases in the area,as monument.in,the city adopted the hsp in part to provide protection for these walls.the hsp states its purpose is to protect hollywoodland,a unique and historical residential community in hollywood,planned in the early as a custom home,subdivision with a european village character.
the record reflects that numerous homes in the tract have granite walls ranging from three to feet in height many of these have no fences or guardrails.the record also contains photographs depicting numerous wooden fences atop curbs.section.of the hsp provides,no structures,including fences or walls,shall be attached to a granite wall or granite stairway when the wall or stairway is located in a public.the hsp at section.prohibited new fences or walls in excess of six feet built within three feet of the lot line.in addition,the city municipal code provided that n o permit for demolition,substantial alteration or relocation of any building,structure or site contained in said list shall be issued,and no such site,building or structure shall be substantially altered without first referring the matter to the city cultural heritage commission former los angeles admin.code,
the administrative proceedings before the city.
in september,mike and laura armstrong,the owners of property at durand drive,constructed an unpermitted high wooden fence atop one of the granite walls supporting durand drive which abuts the rear of the property.the armstrong property consists of three parcels,and the street curves around all three parcels.the fence is feet long.the property sits below the street grade,and the granite wall,which is about feet high,is not visible from the street.only the fence can be seen from the street,as well as a guardrail that runs along a portion of the fence.architectural renderings in the record depict the current wooden fence attached to a curb that sits atop the granite wall.
on february,the city department of building and safety issued an order to comply to the armstrongs for a violation of municipal code section,subdivision a citing the fence as being in violation of the hsp,and ordering its removal.the order specifically noted that the fence had been erected on city property which is also a registered monument and did not observ e the required setback required by the hollywoodland specific plan 
in november,the armstrongs applied for an exception to the hsp to allow them to construct a new fence to replace the unpermitted fence.the application stated that the fence is necessary for safety reasons as durand ranges from seven to seventeen feet above the armstrongs sic property.there is no barrier or guard rail along durand at this location to prevent vehicles or pedestrians from failing into the armstrongs property there have been past instances of vehicles and people falling off of durand drive and into the armstrongs property.the application stated that enforcement of the setback rule was not feasible because durand drive was above the grade of the armstrong property,and that the lot adjacent to the fence was used as their back yard.as the wall that supports durand drive sits partially on the property owned by the armstrongs,the construction of a fence on top of the curb is the only feasible method of erecting a barrier to prevent pedestrians and vehicles from falling into the armstrongs lot.
in february,robert cutler purchased the armstrongs home.
on march,hollywood heritage wrote to the city planning department,stating that t he fence negatively impacts the city landmark granite retaining wall at that address and sets a precedent to further degradation of the stone walls within the hollywoodland tract.the owner who erected the fence claimed it was done for safety reasons but,based on an inspection,it is obviously not so.a steel guardrail in front of the fence,as is installed elsewhere throughout the hollywoodland tract,would prevent a car from crashing through it it is obvious that the true purpose of the fence is aesthetic,to provide privacy for the house backyard and pool.while this is understandable,it is not grounds for a variance of the historic designation for privacy we suggest the owners plant a hedge or cedar trees between the pool and the retaining wall.
on august,the city historic preservation section recommended denial of the application because the wooden fence was not an appropriate treatment of the historic resource.the historic preservation section recommended that any subsequent proposed alterations or additions to the monument be reviewed by the cultural heritage commission,and that the project conform to the department of interior standards for the treatment of historic resources the hollywoodland design review board drb recommended denial of the application because the homeowners had refused to meet with them to discuss compromises.several neighbors wrote to the city in support of the wood fence,and several expressed their opposition.
cutler submitted a report from a garden design firm stating that the planting of a ficus hedge or other trees would not address the safety issues.the plants would need to reach feet in height,and at such height would not be sufficiently full to constitute a barrier trees would need to be planted too close together to make a uniform hedge and ficus roots were destructive,and could damage the wall.
the city held a hearing august,to consider the exception.
on september,the hollywoodland drb wrote the city and advised it that any safety railing would need to withstand a pound per linear foot load,and that such load would be transferred to the historic wall generally,an architect or engineer would need to calculate whether the proposed design could withstand the load,but to the drb knowledge,no such study had been done.another member of the drb wrote to advise the city that durand drive upslope and downslope granite walls rested on the public curb,and that it was assumed the curbs were installed at the same time as the walls 
following the hearing,on september,the city department of building and safety issued a report the tokunaga report.the tokunaga report recommended that the exception be disapproved,but recommended instead a inch fence be built in place of the existing fence,with no other structures within the setback area.the tokunaga report required,prior to the issuance of any permits,that a detailed site and elevation plan be submitted for review to the satisfaction of the cultural heritage commission and the design review board staff of the planning department.the tokunaga report specifically found 
strict application of the regulations of the hsp to the property would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purpose and intent of the hsp.in particular,the report found that the subject property consisted of three parcels the portion of the property used as a rear yard was technically the front yard because all three parcels fronted on durand drive the hsp required a setback the armstrongs fence was unpermitted and installed upon an existing curb and metal guard rail that were inadequate to prevent cars or pedestrians from falling into the yard.the proposed shorter fence would provide both safety and privacy.
there were exceptional circumstances or conditions which were applicable to the subject property or to the intended use of the development of the subject property that generally do not apply to other properties within the specific plan area.in particular,the report found that portions of the street were feet above the rear yard,and that if the setback requirement was imposed,there would be a gap between the wall and the flat portions of the yard.
the requested exception was necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right or use generally possessed by other property within the area,but which,because of such special circumstances and practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships,was denied the property in question.in particular,the report found that the significant grade difference made compliance with the setback rule a practical difficulty.
the granting of the exception would not be detrimental to the public welfare and injurious to property or improvements adjacent to or in the vicinity of the subject property.the report noted that a in height fence along this section of durand drive will offer public safety to the motorists and pedestrians who use this portion of the street.without the fence,the only separation between the yard of the homeowner and a falling car or object including pedestrians is an curb and metal guard rail.a setback offers no additional benefit in providing safety and would actually create a gap between the curbed granite wall and a fence,providing enough space for debris to accumulate as well as space for automobiles and pedestrians to fall into.
the granting of the exception was consistent with the principles,intent and goals of the hsp.the tokunaga report found that the hsp required new fences and walls to maintain a setback from the front lot line the requirement was intended to provide a buffer between the street and the entrance to the house so that persons could enter the home without directly walking or driving onto the street.however,the armstrongs lot line was actually the rear yard,and there was no entrance to invoke the rationale behind the setback rule.
the tokunaga report found the project would not have a significant effect on the environment and found it exempt under ceqa.
on november,the city issued its notice of exemption from ceqa for the specific plan exception issued to the armstrongs.
on december,the committee to save the hollywoodland specific plan committee wrote to the city planning commission to object to the tokunaga report.the committee took the position that no hsp exception should be granted because the findings of the report,necessary under los angeles municipal code section.for a specific plan exception,could not be factually supported.further,the permit would confer upon the owner a special privilege not enjoyed by other owners in the area in violation of los angeles municipal code.
the committee contended a categorical exemption was inapplicable because the exemption was limited to minor area variances,building location and configuration variances,yard variances,or slight modifications which do not result in any change in land use or additional dwelling units.furthermore,even if the exemption applied,the committee contended it would not be allowed because the project had a potentially significant impact on a historic resource because the fence had been constructed by making significant alteration to the stone wall.the committee proposed alternatives of screen planting,and requested that the fence was not required because a steel guard rail,not touching the historic monument,would serve the safety objectives.finally,the committee took the position that the curb was city property,as evidenced by the order to comply issued february,the applicants had erect ed a wooden fence on city property which is also a registered monument,triggering the review requirement of municipal code section 
a planning commission meeting was held december.cutler advised the planning commission that he had gone before the hollywoodland drb and reached a compromise concerning fence design that involved the installation of a,open fence.cutler asked the planning commission to support the new design and to amend its recommendation to approve the specific plan exception for the installation of a wrought iron fence.petitioners appeared and opposed the exception on the grounds that it was an erosion of the plan itself and in violation of municipal code section specific plan procedures,and that the situation was not unique nor did it present a hardship.they pointed to other houses in the neighborhood that had dealt with privacy and safety issues without altering landmarks.further,the proposed fence was on the public right of way.with respect to this last point,tokunaga informed the commission that it was not the city intent to take a position where the fence stood,but that the city viewed the granite wall and curb as one,and that was the reason for sending the matter for ultimate review to the cultural heritage department.
on december,the city planning commission issued its determination disapproving the specific exception as requested,but approving an exception that permitted a fence,measured from the top of the curb which measures eight inches adjoining the property.the commission adopted the tokunaga report findings and found a categorical exemption under ceqa.
on january,the committee to save the hollywoodland specific plan,hollywood heritage,and hollywood united neighborhood counsel appealed the commission determination to the city council,on the grounds set forth in the committee december,letter,a copy of which was attached to the appeal 
on march,cutler,who was now the owner of the property,wrote to the planning and land use management plum committee in support of the planning commission approval of the fence.cutler pointed out that the fence had been built by the previous owners,and although the fence was close to the granite retaining wall,it did not come into contact with it.a curb sat on top of the retaining wall,and the fence was attached to the curb poles drilled into the curb did not touch the retaining wall.cutler pointed out that it was imperative that either the city or he take action to prevent injury to persons,and that he was willing to pursue appropriate city approvals for the fence.to that end,cutler proposed to build a fence that took into account public safety,but that did not jeopardize the integrity of the historic monument.
the city council set a hearing before its plum committee to consider the appeal for march,and set a hearing before the full city council for march.the plum committee meeting was continued to march.at the meeting,tokunaga informed the plum committee that as part of the approval of the fence,the new owner was required to go before the design review board of the planning department for approval,and that the planning department recommended denial of the appeal.
one homeowner in attendance objected to the fence because the curb was public property,the current fence and the proposed fence would both rest upon the curb,and attaching a fence to the unreinforced granite wall would impose weight upon the wall.furthermore,the review of the project had not included a survey or a study by a landscape architect or a structural engineer.
the president of hollywood heritage stated that if the city allowed the fence to be installed as planned,it would create bad precedent.further,the city admitted that the existing curb and metal guardrail were inadequate to prevent cars from driving over the curb or pedestrians from falling into the yard.
the committee to save the hollywoodland specific plan requested that the plum committee deny the categorical exemption to.of the hsp because the proposed new wall would be on top of the cultural monument which is on the public right of way,and would therefore violate the hsp section,as well as being a significant alteration to a cultural monument.denial of the categorical exemption would permit review of alternative safety features more appropriate to the monument.cutler requested the exception be approved.
the hollywoodland homeowners association stated that they would rather see an aesthetically pleasing fence than an extended guardrail,and had in december approved the hollywoodland drb approval of the revised plans.the plum committee denied the appeal.
cutler requested and received a continuance of the city council meeting to april.at the meeting,the city council adopted the categorical exemption and plum committee report to the specific plan exception from the hsp.the council found the action was categorically exempt from ceqa pursuant to the city environmental guidelines the council adopted the planning commission findings,and denied the committee appeal.
on april,the city issued its exception to the hsp.
the petition for writ of mandamus.
on may,petitioners filed their petition for writ of mandate seeking to set aside the city approval of the exception to the hsp and ordering removal of the fence.
after several stays of the action to pursue settlement,the trial court set the matter for hearing on november.
petitioners argued that the specific exception to the hsp constituted a special privilege that violated the los angeles municipal code because the fence was located on the public.they argued that cutler property was not unique in the area,and did not suffer from unnecessary hardships sufficient to support a variance.furthermore,substantial evidence did not support the city determination that the exception qualified as a class categorical exemption under ceqa because it was not a minor alteration in land use limitations.they argued that even if the fence fit within the terms of the categorical exemption,the city could not apply the exemption because the proposed fence impacted the granite wall and had a significant impact upon the environment by destroying the european village character of the neighborhood.
the city argued that strict application of the hsp to the property would result in practical difficulties and unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the purpose of the hsp the property circumstances were unique an exception was necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right the exception would not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or adjacent properties and the exception was consistent with the hsp.the city also contended the exception was categorically exempt for alterations in land use limitations because the proposed fence did not result in any changes to the property,nor was it attached to the granite wall.
cutler opposed,contending that the city findings supported a hardship.the subject portion of the property was used as a side and rear yard the existing curb and guard rail were inadequate and the setback requirement rationale would not be served by its enforcement because of the gap created.further,cutler argued the ceqa exemption was supported because in applying the exception,the city necessarily rejected any contention that the granite wall was on the public right of way cutler presented evidence it was on his property and,because the fence would not be attached to the granite wall,it would not be altered in any fashion.
petitioners replied that the city granted an exception for an encroachment onto the setback,not for an attachment of a fence to a granite wall within the public right of way.petitioners disputed cutler claim that the fence was not on the wall and was not in the public right of way,and contended the curb was part of the historic granite wall.they contended cutler engaged in a bait and switch by seeking approval for one design of fence,and then obtaining approval for another.finally,they asserted the proposed design is unsafe.see ar.
at the hearing,the committee argued that the hsp required the city to get more input from city planners,the drb,and the cultural heritage commission before approval,and therefore the process had been conducted in reverse.the committee also contended that there was extensive evidence of negative impact on the stone wall,and that although there was evidence in the record to support the city position,this impact evidence outweighed evidence supporting the granting of the exception.finally,the committee contended the city erred in granting relief from hardships under los angeles municipal code section.
on december,the trial court entered its judgment denying the petition.the court found substantial evidence supported city findings,noting that at feet,the property has one of the longest lots abutting durand drive.because of the acquisition of the adjacent properties,the rear yard is technically listed as having a front lot line,but there is no entrance or exit from this parcel.most other homes in the area have rear and side yard fences up to six feet high and the plan allows those.there will be no detriment to the public welfare because the fence will help ensure the safety of people and cars.the gap between the curb and a three foot setback would create an unacceptable safety risk.the practical difficulties of the property in question warrant the exception.the court also found the exception qualified under categorical exemption class,tit,city guidelines art.iii,par.e class because there was no substantial change to the historical resources.the court specifically found that the wall was below grade,not on the public right of way,and a fence on top of the curb supported by the wall would not affect the resource.
discussion 
the committee contends that the city grant of an exception to the hsp was erroneous because the exception violated the hsp,the municipal code and height restrictions,and the fence improperly relieved a hardship and the city erroneously relied upon a ceqa exemption.
substantial evidence supports the specific plan exception.
standard of review.
when evaluating the validity of an administrative decision,both the trial court and appellate court perform the same function we will affirm the city decision if it is supported by substantial evidence.in doing so,we review the entire record.we may not interfere with the city discretionary judgments and must resolve reasonable doubts in favor of the administrative findings and decision.code civ,subd.b dore county of ventura th,d.we may not substitute our judgment for the city and reverse because we believe a contrary finding would have been equally or more reasonable.cipriotti board of directors d.however,although the city was required to make and expressly state certain findings,we do not presume that the city decision was based on the required findings or that those findings are supported by substantial evidence.thomas county of los angeles d.
b.the city findings complied with the requirements of the los angeles municipal code regarding specific plan exceptions.
the committee argues that the city approval of the specific plan exception violates los angeles municipal code section.because the evidence does not support a finding of unnecessary hardship and the necessity of preserving the enjoyment of a substantial property right further,the city improperly provided relief from a hardship.we disagree,because a reading of the hsp and the relevant municipal code provisions demonstrates that the city complied with them.
the guidelines for exceptions from the city specific plan are contained in los angeles municipal code section.under that ordinance,before granting an exception,the city was required to make five findings 
a that the strict application of the regulations of the specific plan to the subject property would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purpose and intent of the specific plan 
b that there are exceptional circumstances or conditions applicable to the subject property involved or to the intended use or development of the subject property that do not apply generally to other property in the specific plan area 
c that an exception from the specific plan is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right or use generally possessed by other property within the specific plan area in the same zone and vicinity but which,because of special circumstances and practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships is denied to the property in question 
d that the granting of an exception will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements adjacent to or in the vicinity of the subject property and 
e that the granting of an exception will be consistent with the principles,intent and goals of the specific plan and any applicable element of the general plan.los angeles.the standards for granting variances and exceptions must be sufficiently broad and flexible to provide municipalities with the necessary discretion to address a wide variety of circumstances.matthews board of supervisors d.
a zoning variance,and by analogy a specific plan exception,must be grounded in conditions peculiar to the particular lot as distinguished from other property in the specific plan area.zakessian city of sausalito d.zakessian.unnecessary hardship therefore occurs where the natural condition or topography of the land places the landowner at a disadvantage other landowners in the area,such as peculiarities of the size,shape or grade of the parcel.id.at.zakessian also discerned in the hardship requirement an additional finding that the hardship be substantial,and that the exception sought must be in harmony with the intent of the zoning laws.id.at.
further,the special circumstances pertaining to the property must be such that the property is distinct in character from comparable nearby properties.in topanga for a scenic community county of los angeles cal d,the landowner obtained a zoning variance to build a mobile home park on acres in topanga canyon on property zoned for light agricultural and residences.id.at.applying government code section topanga found insufficient evidence supported the grant of the variance because there was there was no evidence concerning comparable neighborhood properties,and therefore concerning whether the variance was necessary to bring the landowner into parity with other parties holding property in the same area.id.at.
here,substantial evidence supports the city findings that enforcement of the setback requirement would impose a substantial hardship on the property because of its unusual circumstances,and that there is a safety need for a variance from the fence height limitation.the property possesses a unique hardship because it is a site with no real backyard all of the property faces the winding street.much of this yard is below grade,rendering enforcement of the setback problematic.
further,the property sits below grade on a winding street,and enforcing the requirement would create a greater hazard by providing a gap between the wall and yard into which persons and debris could fall.the fact that other properties in the area may have a similar configuration and do not have such fences does not detract from the necessity of ameliorating the substantial safety hazard which would remain if the city strictly enforced the setback requirement 
in addition,contrary to the committee assertion,the city complied with former los angeles administrative code section,which provided that n o permit for demolition,substantial alteration or relocation of any building,structure or site contained in said list shall be issued,and no such site,building or structure shall be substantially altered without first referring the matter to the city cultural heritage commission this provision does not require that matters first be presented to the cultural heritage commission before an exception to the hsp can be granted rather it provides that they shall be referred before a permit is granted.currently,the cultural heritage commission holds veto power over any proposed fence because the exception so provides.therefore,nothing in the municipal code supports the committee argument that the proceedings were backwards because the matter was not presented first to the commission.
the committee argument that the city did not comply with the hsp is circular.the request for and granting of an exception assumes the hsp has been violated.the issue therefore becomes whether the city complied with the los angeles municipal code in granting the exception.the committee factual arguments concerning whether the curb is in the and therefore in violation of the hsp are inconsequential to our conclusion.
finally,the committee argues that because cutler bought the property with knowledge of the issues associated with the fence,any hardship here is and the city improperly granted an exception.see city of san marino roman catholic archbishop d.city of san marino.we disagree.in city of san marino,the property owner purchased property zoned for residential use and then sought a zoning variance in order to build a rectory,parking lot,and playground.id.at.city of san marino concluded the hardship was,and denied the variance,noting that o nly that type of hardship which inheres in the particular property is recognized id.at.here,the hardship is not because the hardship inheres in the topography of the property,and this circumstance does not change with ownership.
ii.the city erred in relying on a categorical exemption.
the committee contends the city erred in relying on a categorical exemption because permitting the owners to attach the fence to a historical monument was not a minor alteration of a limitation further,even if the exemption could apply,it would not here because the fence had a strong possibility of having an adverse impact upon the historic monument.we agree.
to achieve its objectives of environmental protection,ceqa has a structure.davidon homes city of san jose th,d see also ceqa guidelines,k describing process.first,if a project falls into an exempt category,or it can be seen with certainty that the activity in question will not have a significant effect on the environment,citation no further agency evaluation is required.no oil,city of los angeles cal d.second,if there is a possibility the project will have a significant effect on the environment,the agency must undertake an initial threshold study if that study indicates that the project will not have a significant effect,the agency may issue a negative declaration.finally,if the project will have a significant effect on the environment,an environmental impact report eir is required.ibid.
the ceqa guidelines provide for classes of projects that generally do not have a significant effect on the environment and therefore may be exempted from ceqa review.pub.resources code,subd.b azusa land reclamation main san gabriel basin watermaster th,d azusa land.the exemption at issue here,a class exemption,exempts projects that consist of minor alterations in land use limitations in areas with an average slope of less than,which do not result in any changes in land use or density,including but not limited to a minor lot line adjustments,side yard,and set back variances not resulting in the creation of any new parcel.ceqa guidelines.
even if an activity fits within an otherwise exempt category,the agency may not find it exempt if the project will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.ceqa guidelines,subd.c.under that guideline,a process is followed to determine whether an exception applies.the evaluation considers whether the circumstances of the particular project i differ from the general circumstances of projects covered by a particular categorical exemption,and ii those circumstances create an environmental risk that does not exist for the general class of exempt projects.azusa land,supra,th at,d.
furthermore,a categorical exemption is not applied to projects that may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historic resource.pub.resources code,subd.e guidelines,subd.f.categorical exemptions also do not apply where the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place over time may be significant.ceqa guidelines,subd.b.
the agency decides whether a project is categorically exempt as a part of its preliminary r
