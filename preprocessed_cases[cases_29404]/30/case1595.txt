background 
congress passed the surface mining control and reclamation act of smcra or the act,stat.codified at et,to establish a nationwide program to protect society and the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations.a.the supreme court has upheld the constitutionality of the smcra.hodel.surface mining reclamation ass n,d.
before the enactment of smcra,many surface mining operations result ed in disturbances of surface areas that destroy ed or diminish ed the utility of land,among other things,by causing erosion and landslides,by contributing to floods,by polluting the water,by destroying fish and wildlife habitats and by counteracting the governmental programs and efforts to conserve soil,water,and other natural resources.c.in order to remedy the negative effects of surface mining,smcra established a permitting process.the act required organizations to obtain a permit from the secretary of the interior or the relevant state authority before engag ing in or carry ing out on lands within a state any surface coal mining operations.id.a.standards were established governing the grant or denial of permits.id.smcra established the osm in the department of the interior and gave it authority to administer the act.id.
smcra further provided that the secretary of the interior or the relevant state authority,depending on which entity is responsible for the enforcement of smcra in the particular region,had discretion u pon petition pursuant to subsection c of this section,to designate an area as unsuitable for all or certain surface coal mining,id.a,if such surface mining would,among other things,affect renewable resource lands in which such operations could result in a substantial loss or reduction of productivity of water supply,id.a.
the process for designating an area as unsuitable for mining begins with the filing of a petition by a ny person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected by such mining.id.c.the regulatory authority must then hold a public hearing in the locality of the affected area within ten months of providing appropriate public notice and publication of the date,time and location of such hearing.id.finally,the regulatory authority must w ithin sixty days after such hearing,issue and furnish a written decision regarding the petition,and the reasons therefore.id.this procedure is known as the lum lands unsuitable for mining petition process.the statute thus contemplates that the lum procedure will be completed approximately one year after giving public notice of the filing of the lum petition,ten months plus sixty days.in tennessee the smcra is implemented by the federal department of the interior,see supra note,and the secretary of the interior has delegated to the director of osm the authority to make final decisions on land unsuitable petitions.at.
appolo is a kentucky corporation that entered the mining business in.during the late,appolo became aware that its existing coal reserves would be exhausted by the mid,and it sought to acquire more lands on which to mine.appolo particularly sought reserves in the little yellow creek watershed also known as the fern lake watershed,a area situated on the border within close proximity to its existing operations,acres of which fell within tennessee.the tennessee portion of the little yellow creek watershed included within its bounds fern lake,which served as the water supply for the city of middlesboro,kentucky.in,more than a decade after the enactment of smcra,appolo acquired lease,providing mining rights in approximately acres of land within the yellow creek watershed.later that year,appolo obtained further mining rights in the little yellow creek watershed by acquiring lease.then in,appolo purchased acres immediately surrounding fern lake in tennessee.
on february,appolo filed a smcra permit application with osm to mine acres on its leased land in the tennessee part of the little yellow creek watershed.shortly thereafter,the city of middlesboro,kentucky,and the national parks and conservation association filed a lum petition with osm,requesting that all acres of land in the tennessee portion of the little yellow creek watershed the petition area be designated as lands unsuitable for mining.at the time the petition was filed,the only interests held by appolo within the petition area were the portion of lease in the tennessee part of the little yellow creek watershed and acres of appolo parcel surrounding fern lake.subsequently on march,osm notified appolo that its permit application was administratively complete but,in accordance with,the application would be held in abeyance until the lum petition was decided.at.the agency further explained that if osm reaches a decision to designate parts of the petition area as unsuitable for all or certain types of mining operations,your application could not be approved.at.osm proceeded with the lum petition review process,which involved preparation of a petition evaluation document ped and an environmental impact statement eis as required by the smcra,d,and the national environmental policy act of,c.
meanwhile,in furtherance of its plan to mine the little yellow creek watershed,appolo acquired lease in february,consisting of approximately acres adjacent to lease,approximately acres of which were located in the lum petition area.this lease explicitly recognized that the existing lum petition could impact a portion of the acreage covered by the lease.appolo added lease in february,and leases and in june,all of which were adjacent to leases and.only a small part of the acreage of leases,and was within the lum petition area.
in may of,appolo wrote to osm,inquiring as to the delay in osm processing of the lum petition.in response,osm explained that it was in the process of developing a ped and an eis for the contested area and that osm has not intentionally delayed this process.at.rather,the process had been delayed by a combination of unusual environmental conditions that inhibited access to water samples necessary for the ped and eis as well as a heavy workload in the osm field office.
after publishing a draft ped and eis in the federal register in january,osm issued a final decision on the lum petition,designating the entire petition area as unsuitable for all surface coal mining operations on september.at.the director of osm described the findings of the ped and eis that informed his lum decision 
surface coal mining conducted within the fern lake watershed would significantly impair the water quality of fern lake by altering both the physical and chemical characteristics of the water.if surface coal mining operations occurred,chemical changes to the water are predicted to last several hundred years.
furthermore,no other domestic water supply of the same quality was identified which it would be economically feasible for the city to utilize.
the director explained that his most important consideration in granting the petition was the impact of surface coal mining operations in the petition area on productivity of the fern lake water supply.at.appolo later acquired two more leases containing mining rights within the area designated as unsuitable for mining lease in september and lease in august.
in november,appolo filed a petition for review of osm lum decision in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee pursuant to.appolo fuels,babbitt.the district court,however,dismissed the case without prejudice in july upon appolo motion.
appolo filed this suit in the court of federal claims in january,alleging that osm lum decision constituted a categorical regulatory taking of appolo mining interests in the petition area,including portions of leases,and,or,in the alternative,that the lum decision constituted a partial regulatory taking of these mining interests.appolo also claimed that osm improperly delayed its decision on the lum petition beyond the period established in c,thereby effecting a temporary taking.
following discovery,the government moved for summary judgment on may.a primary focus of the parties dispute concerned the relevant parcel for purposes of the takings analysis.the government argued that the relevant parcel was all of appolo coal interests in the petition area and surrounding areas controlled by lease or fee ownership,including the entirety of leases,and.def.mot.for summ.mem.of law at,appolo fuels,united states.may.appolo argued instead that the the facts at present weigh in favor of using only the property which was subject to the lum decision as the denominator,that is the portion of leases,and fully within the petition area.pl.combined br.in op.to def.mot.for summ.in limine at,appolo fuels,united states.appolo urged that w ith respect to the lease approximately of the tonnage has been lost and o n the,the percentage is.id.at.
the court of federal claims entered summary judgment in favor of the government on december.appolo,fed.cl.at.the court held that the relevant parcel for the takings analysis could not be limited to the petition area as urged by appolo.the court,however,also rejected the government assessment of the relevant parcel,explaining that leases and must be excluded because they were purchased after the lum decision and that lease must be excluded because both plaintiff and defendant experts agree that the lease provided plaintiff with no reserves with any economic value.id.at.following case law that requires a court to consider a plaintiff overall business plan in determining the relevant parcel,the court included within the relevant parcel the entirety of leases,and as well as appolo fee simple acres around fern lake because it found that appolo viewed these interests as part of its overall plan to mine within the creek watershed.id.at.
based on this definition of the relevant parcel,the court rejected appolo categorical takings claim because the plaintiff was not prohibited from exploiting its leases and its fee property in areas outside the petition area,and these portions had value.id.at.
likewise,the court of federal claims rejected appolo partial regulatory takings claim.in reaching this decision,the court considered the three penn central factors applicable to the partial regulatory takings analysis the plaintiff reasonable expectations the character of the government action allegedly effectuating a taking and the economic impact of the alleged taking.see penn cent.transp.city of new york,d.relying on our decisions in rith energy,united states,rith i,reh g denied,rith ii,the court held that appolo lacked reasonable expectations 
plaintiff commenced its effort to obtain coal mining rights in the little yellow creek watershed with the acquisition of lease in.thus,this lease was acquired more than ten years after the enactment of smcra.the two amendments to lease expressly stated that a lum petition was pending.plaintiff argument that lum petitions are extraordinary remedies is unavailing,given that plaintiff has not claimed that it was unaware of the possibility of a lum petition moreover,such an argument would be disingenuous in light of plaintiff self proclaimed status as a veteran of negotiating the smcra permitting process plaintiff can not deny that the temporal relationship between the enactment of smcra and the time it purchased the parcel at issue gave it notice that it was subject to regulation.
appolo,fed.cl.at.the court also held that the character of the government action cut against appolo partial takings claim because mining in the petition area would have constituted a nuisance under tennessee law,explaining 
it is clear that water pollution is an abatable nuisance under both tennessee common law and the tennessee water quality control act of.by granting the lum petition,osm exercised its police power to protect its citizens from a nuisance,thereby weighing this factor of the penn central analysis in the government favor.
id.at.as to the economic impact prong of the penn central analysis,the court held that given the expectations and nuisance findings,even a showing of severe diminution in economic value will not result in a compensable partial regulatory taking.id.however,the court continued,even if it had decided that appolo had legitimate expectations and that mining the petition area would not have constituted a nuisance,appolo still would have put forth an insufficient showing to generate a genuine issue of fact as to the economic impact prong of the penn central analysis because it did not submit any evidence that it can not exploit the portions of its leases that lie outside the petition area.id.at.
finally,the court of federal claims rejected appolo temporary takings claim,applying the analytic framework established by the supreme court in preservation council,tahoe regional planning agency,d,and by our court in wyatt united states.the court held that osm total delay was approximately one year and t o characterize such a delay as extraordinary would not be consistent with the import of supreme court and federal circuit precedent.appolo,fed.cl.at.
appolo appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment without deference.tabb lakes,united states.
appolo first contends that the court of federal claims erred in rejecting its categorical takings claim.in order to warrant compensation for a categorical taking,a plaintiff must show that the regulation at issue has denied it of all economically beneficial or productive use of its whole parcel of land.see lucas coastal council,d emphasis added.appolo argues that the court of federal claims rejected its categorical takings claim based on a mischaracterization of the relevant parcel and that there was a categorical taking under a proper definition of the relevant parcel.we disagree.even if the court of claims definition of the relevant parcel was overly broad,an issue we do not decide,appolo still can not recover on its categorical takings claim.
the supreme court has long held that the regulatory takings analysis,with respect to both categorical takings and partial takings,must be applied to the parcel as a whole.penn central,at.the court of federal claims properly rejected appolo argument that the relevant parcel should have included only those portions within the petition area.the supreme court explained in that defining the property interest taken in terms of the very regulation being challenged is circular and emphasized that the court has consistently rejected such an approach to the denominator question.at.on appeal,appolo appears to have abandoned this argument,instead arguing that only leases and should have been included.appolo concedes that it will not quibble with the court inclusion of its or leases as part of the relevant parcel.br.for appellant at.this concession is well taken because lease and lease profitable reserves were the focus of appolo expectations,reply br.for appellant at,and were purchased as a discrete mining unit.appolo purchased lease in as the first step in fulfilling its expect ation that it would ultimately acquire and mine all of the surface mineable coal within the little yellow creek watershed,br.for appellant at,and appolo continued its plans for mining within the fern lake watershed by acquiring the lease in february,id.at.under our precedent,the purchase of these two leases as part of one unified mining plan is sufficient to include them in the relevant parcel.see forest,united states,holding that relevant parcel included two tracts of land because their development was treated as a single integrated project,despite the fact that they were acquired in different transactions at different times,that different local government authorities had regulatory jurisdiction over the two locations,and that the two segments were capable of separate development see also palm beach isles assocs.united states,palm beach i focusing the relevant parcel analysis on whether the owner planned to develop the parcels as a single unit,aff on reh g,reh g en banc denied.
because the relevant parcel includes leases and,appolo is not entitled to compensation for a categorical taking.it did not lose all economically viable use of these leases.neither lease falls entirely within the lum petition area.appolo had the burden in response to the government summary judgment motion to present evidence of complete loss of value.see celotex catrett,d see also seiber united states.in opposing summary judgment,appolo claimed that w ith respect to the lease approximately of the tonnage has been lost.on the,the percentage is.pl.combined br.in op.to def.mot.for summ.in limine at.but appolo expert appraiser only valued the reserves within the petition area.id.and,indeed,appolo admitted that it did not even instruct its expert to assess the before and after value of this area.id.at.even assuming these percentages are correct,appolo showing was insufficient to defeat summary judgment on the categorical takings claim.the supreme court has made clear that a categorical taking only occurs when there has been a complete elimination of value or a total loss and that the categorical rule would not apply if the diminution in value were instead of,at.internal quotation marks omitted see also rith ii,at holding that a loss of of available coal did not constitute a categorical taking.a showing of a loss of the value of one lease and a loss of the other is manifestly insufficient.
having rejected appolo contention that there has been a categorical regulatory taking,we turn to the partial regulatory takings question.
it is a settled principle of federal takings law that under the penn central analytic framework,the government may defend against liability by claiming that the regulated activity constituted a state law nuisance without regard to the other penn central factors.see,at.lucas,at.mugler kansas.palm beach i,at m j coal united states,loveladies harbor,united states.rock indus.united states.appolo concedes this principle,but it argues that the court of federal claims mistakenly held that osm lum decision established existence of a nuisance under tennessee common law appolo argues that osm did not make a nuisance determination and,in any event,was not empowered to make such a determination as the lum decision and concomitant findings are made on a different standard than that which applies to the nuisance question in a takings claim.br.for appellant at.rather,appolo contends,the court of federal claims was obligated to determine de novo whether surface mining in the petition area would have constituted a nuisance under tennessee law.we find it unnecessary to resolve this question because we conclude that there has been no taking under the penn central analysis,quite apart from the nuisance defense 
as noted above,the penn central analysis requires us to consider t he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct expectations and the character of the governmental action.penn,at.these factors are considered in terms of the parcel as a whole.id.at.
first,we consider the economic impact of the alleged partial regulatory taking.for purposes of this analysis,we assume the accuracy of appolo claim that it lost approximately of lease value and of lease value even so,we conclude in light of the other two penn central factors that there has been no partial regulatory taking.
we address first the reasonable expectations prong of the penn central analysis.as a preliminary matter,we must decide the relevant date for assessing appolo expectations,and in particular whether the enactment of smcra in,before acquisition of the leases in question,defeats appolo reasonable expectations.in palazzolo rhode island,d,a five to four decision,the supreme court reversed the rhode island supreme court holding that the postregulation acquisition of title was fatal to a claim for deprivation of all economic use under the takings clause,id.at,holding instead that a takings claim is not barred by the mere fact that title was acquired after the effective date of the restriction,id.at.the majority opinion did not address the bearing of the regulatory environment at the time of land acquisition on the reasonable expectations prong of the penn central analysis.justice,however,explained in her concurring opinion that the court holding does not mean that the timing of the regulation enactment relative to the acquisition of title is immaterial to the penn central analysis.id.at,concurring.rather,she affirmed that the regulatory regime in place at the time the claimant acquires the property at issue helps to shape the reasonableness of those expectations.id.
shortly before the court decision in palazzolo,we decided rith i,which raised similar issues concerning expectations.we rejected the takings claim,emphasizing that the plaintiff could not have had a reasonable expectation that it would not be subject to restraints when it acquired the coal leases because smcra was enacted eight years before the plaintiff purchased the coal leases at issue.at.after the decision in palazzolo,the in rith filed a motion for rehearing on the theory that it was entitled to stand in the shoes of its predecessors who owned before smcra because palazzolo taught that the mere fact that an owner bought after a regulatory scheme was passed can not defeat a partial takings claim.rith ii,at.we denied the petition for rehearing,explaining that palazzolo,in light of justice concurrence,only rejected the theory that a person who purchases property after the date of the regulation may never challenge the regulation.id.emphasis added.we concluded that palazzolo did not reject the principle that the regulatory regime in place at the time the claimant acquires the property at issue helps to shape the reasonableness of those expectations.id.quoting palazzolo,at,concurring.likewise,we conclude that appolo reasonable expectations are shaped by the regulatory regime in place as of the date it purchased the leases at issue.
under such circumstances,our en banc opinion in commonwealth edison united states,instructs us to consider in particular three factors relevant to the determination of a party reasonable expectations whether the plaintiff operated in a highly regulated industry whether the plaintiff was aware of the problem that spawned the regulation at the time it purchased the allegedly taken property and whether the plaintiff could have reasonably anticipated the possibility of such regulation in light of the regulatory environment at the time of purchase.id.at here each of these factors argues against a finding of reasonable expectations.
first,as we explained in rith ii,the coal mining business is obviously a highly regulated industry.at.one has to look no farther than the smcra itself to reach this conclusion,and the smcra comprehensive statutory and regulatory system has been in effect since appolo early years in the industry and predates appolo purchases of any of the leases at issue in this litigation.second,there is no suggestion here that appolo was unaware that surface mining was a potentially environmentally hazardous activity.third,in light of the regulatory environment at the time appolo purchased the leases at issue,it could have reasonably anticipated the possibility of a lum decision prohibiting the mining of part or all of its leases.appolo admits that the existence of the act should play a role in the expectations analysis,stating on appeal that it was acutely familiar with the smcra statutory and regulatory system and that it certainly knew that its land would be fettered by had successfully pursued its mining operations for years following smcra.reply br.for appellant at see also br.for appellant at appolo not only survived smcra passage it thrived by adapting its methods to the act requirement its de
