santa clarita organization for planning the environment scope appeals from the trial court denial of its writ of mandate.through the writ of mandate,scope sought to set aside the city of santa clarita the city approval of a master plan to allow real parties henry mayo newhall memorial hospital the hospital and g l valencia,llc collectively real parties to expand the hospital and medical office building facilities on the existing hospital campus the project we reject scope claims and affirm the decision of the trial court.
contentions 
scope raises two contentions on appeal.first,scope argues that the city conclusion that complete mitigation of the project impact on climate change is infeasible is not supported by substantial evidence or adequate analysis in the record.
in addition,scope argues that the city failed to proceed in a manner required by law when it concluded that the project will not adversely affect adjacent residents and the character of the neighborhood.specifically,scope argues that the city did not have the discretion to engage in a balancing of the project harm against the project overall benefit to the city.
factual background 
the hospital 
the hospital has served the santa clarita valley and neighboring areas for nearly years.since opening in,the hospital has expanded into a bed,community hospital with over employees and medical staff members.the site currently contains buildings or square feet of building space.currently,percent of the site is landscaped and none of the buildings is more than two stories high.the tallest building,which is the hospital itself,is only feet high.parking is limited to surface parking spaces,including handicap stalls and seven emergency vehicle stalls.the hospital campus currently lacks sufficient parking and hospital space and does not have a useable helipad.
the project 
the project at issue is a plan to expand the hospital campus.at full build out,the amount of hospital and medical office space on the site would nearly double from its current size of square feet to square feet.
the project includes the construction of an additional inpatient hospital beds,new intensive care unit beds,and nine new beds in a nursing pavilion.the project also provides gross square feet of additional medical office space for added outpatient care,hospital administration,and associated medical uses,as well as an additional parking spaces.nine proposed structures will be built over a year period,including three medical office buildings,one inpatient hospital building,a central plant building,two helipads,and four parking structures.additionally,real parties plan to demolish an square foot building currently on the site and construct landscaping and traffic improvements.
in oral testimony at the september,city council hearing,roger seaver,president and ceo of the hospital,explained to the city council that with the current capacity of the hospital and existing demand,citizens of the santa clarita valley community would soon have to seek medical care outside of the valley.jim barber,president of the hospital association of southern california,commented that while demand and needs for hospital facilities are increasing,hospital capacity is actually going down.fifteen hospitals in los angeles county have closed in the past years,as well as five emergency rooms.barber stressed the need for an integrated medical campus for good communication and efficiency.there was testimony that the population in the santa clarita valley has more than tripled since the hospital opened in,and that hospital expansion is necessary in order to meet the needs of the growing community.
the project site is zoned residential low rl on the city zoning map.it is intended for detached homes at a density of up to dwelling units per gross acre.however,the rl zone permits hospital and related uses with the approval of a conditional use permit cup or master plan.
project approval process 
in august,real parties filed an application for a cup to expand the hospital campus.in compliance with the california environmental quality act ceqa,the city circulated a notice of preparation nop of an environmental impact report eir in november.
in,the city adopted an update to its unified development code udc which required real parties to obtain a master plan.in response to the new ordinance,real parties modified the project application to seek a master plan instead of a cup.in,real parties further modified the application to request a development agreement.
the city released a draft eir in november and a revised draft eir in september.after relevant planning commission hearings,the city circulated a final eir in january.following further hearings and revisions,the city circulated a revised draft eir in june.the june revised draft eir included an analysis of greenhouse gas ghg emissions.the city then circulated a september revised draft eir.the november final eir feir included the september revised draft eir and technical appendices comments and written responses to comments on the june and september revised draft eirs responses to oral comments received at the september,city council hearing and a mitigation monitoring and reporting program.it also incorporated by reference the and draft eirs,as well as all public and agency comments and responses with respect to those documents.
on november,the city council held a public hearing.at the hearing,the city council passed resolution,adopting a statement of overriding considerations and certifying the feir.at the same meeting,the city council also conducted the first reading of an ordinance for development agreement.on december,the city approved ordinance,formally adopting the development agreement between the city and real parties.as part of ordinance,the city found that the development agreement will not a dversely affect the health,peace,comfort or welfare of persons residing or working in the surrounding area.resolution,the city adoption of the master plan,contains a similar finding.
in support of this finding,the city explained that operational characteristics of the hospital campus will not change substantially,and that implementation of the master plan is intended to preserve the desired neighborhood character.the city council found that the master plan would create a medical campus that balances the needs for medical service expansion with the need to preserve the character of the valencia master plan neighborhoods that surround this regional services institution.
ghg emissions associated with the project 
in june,the governor office of planning and research opr issued a technical advisory calling for lead agencies to make a effort,based on available information,to calculate,model,or estimate the amount of and other ghg emissions from a project,including the emissions associated with vehicular traffic,energy consumption,water usage and construction activities.the agencies were called upon to then determine whether these emissions have a significant environmental impact.id.at.
in accordance with the june technical advisory,the city calculated ghg emissions in its september draft eir.in doing so,the city used three categories of emissions sources scope,which included emission sources owned or controlled directly by the project,natural gas combustion,boilers,furnaces,scope,which included ghg emissions from energy purchased energy,energy from water use,energy from waste disposal and scope,which included indirect emissions that are a consequence of activities of the project,but which are not owned or controlled by the project,including ghg emissions from transportation sources.the city concluded that impact from scope and scope ghg emissions would be less than significant.however,despite the implementation of recommended mitigation measures,ghg emissions attributable to scope emissions sources mobile sources would remain significant.this significant impact was described as unavoidable.
procedural history 
scope is a nonprofit organization that is concerned with protection of the environment.on december,scope and community advocates for healthcare scv collectively petitioners filed their petition for writ of mandate respondents demurred,and after the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend,petitioners filed a second amended petition which is the operating petition in this case.
in the opening brief on the merits filed in support of the petition,petitioners argued,among other things,that neither the record nor the eir contain a scintilla of evidence or analysis to support the conclusion that more could not be done to reduce or mitigate the project contribution to global warming.petitioners explained that scope had included with its comments to the city a list of potential mitigation measures developed by the office of attorney general.petitioners argued that the city response to the attorney general suggested mitigation measures was inadequate.
in addition,petitioners challenged the city finding that the master plan did not adversely affect the health and welfare of neighboring residents.petitioners argued that the finding was dishonest and must be set aside because the city was not permitted to weigh the impact to the residents against the alleged overall benefit to the community.
real parties opposed the petition,arguing,among other things,that the petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and that the eir complied with ceqa.
the hearing took place on february.the trial court issued a tentative decision denying the petition,which became the court statement of decision.among other things,the trial court held that 
the city was not required to adopt all measures recommended by the attorney general letter.lead agencies have wide discretion to determine feasibility based on a balancing of factors.city of marina board of trustees of.state cal th.the letter itself warns that the measures cited may not be appropriate for every project.moreover,only one of the four sections of the letter is even applicable to the project.even so,the city found that the project embraced many of the strategies identified as key to combating global climate change.id.
as to petitioners argument that the city balancing of the project benefits and detriments was improper,the court found 
an agency view of the meaning and scope of its own ordinance is entitled to great weight.friends of davis city of davis th.the city council determination that the project was consistent with its plan and udc was reasonable and entitled to deference.unlike ceqa,the udc allows for the weighing of the project benefits and impacts,therefore,the court finds that the council consideration and conclusion that the project was consistent with the udc is supported by substantial evidence.
on april,petitioners filed their notice of appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
on appeal,the appellate court task is the same as that of the trial court that is,to review the agency actions to determine whether the agency complied with procedures required by law.citation.the appellate court reviews the administrative record independently the trial court conclusions are not binding on it.citations.gentry city of murrieta th,gentry.
in any action challenging the decision of a public agency,the inquiry shall extend only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.pub.resources code,gentry,supra,th at.however,n oncompliance with substantive requirements of ceqa or noncompliance with information disclosure provisions which precludes relevant information from being presented to the public agency may constitute prejudicial abuse of discretion regardless of whether a different outcome would have resulted if the public agency had complied with those provisions.citation.county of amador el dorado county water agency th,pub.resources code,subd.a.in other words,when an agency fails to proceed as required by ceqa,harmless error analysis is inapplicable.county of amador,at.
substantial evidence is defined in the ceqa guidelines as enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion,even though other conclusions might also be reached,tit,subd.a.the agency is the finder of fact and we must indulge all reasonable inferences from the evidence that would support the agency determinations and resolve all conflicts in the evidence in favor of the agency decision.citation.save our peninsula committee monterey county bd.of supervisors th,save our peninsula.
we presume the correctness of the agency decision.the project opponents thus bear the burden of proving that the eir is legally inadequate.citations.save our peninsula,supra,th at.
ii.exhaustion of administrative remedies 
we first address an issue raised by real parties in their responsive brief whether scope exhausted its administrative remedies as to some of the issues it raises before this court.
exhaustion of administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to challenging any project approval.an action or proceeding shall not be brought unless the alleged grounds for noncompliance with ceqa were presented to the public agency orally or in writing by any person during the public comment period or prior to the close of the public hearing on the project before the issuance of the notice of determination.pub.resources code,subd.a tracy first city of tracy th.t he objections must be sufficiently specific so that the agency has the opportunity to evaluate and respond to them.citation.citation.tracy first,at.this requirement serves to provide an administrative agency with the opportunity to decide matters in its area of expertise prior to judicial review.citation.napa citizens for honest government napa county bd.of supervisors th.
real parties argue that the following issues were never raised before the city that the city should have considered the specific examples of mitigation measures now raised by scope that the city response to scope october,comment,which attached the attorney general letter,was inadequate and that substantial evidence does not support the findings regarding the infeasibility of mitigation of ghg emissions in resolution.
scope responds that while ceqa does require petitioners to raise their concerns with a lead agency before filing a lawsuit,less specificity is required to preserve an issue for appeal in an administrative proceeding than in a judicial proceeding.scope cites citizens for sensible development of bishop area county of inyo d,citizens,which explained the logic behind this rule 
this is because i n administrative proceedings,parties generally are not represented by counsel.to hold such parties to knowledge of the technical rules of evidence and to the penalty of waiver for failure to make a timely and specific objection would be unfair to them.citation.citation.
we question whether a rule protecting individuals who are not well versed in the technicalities of administrative proceedings is properly applicable to scope.as scope notes in its opening brief,it has been an active participant in the city of santa clarita land use and environmental review process,and has in the past successfully challenged the city.scope indicates on its website that it has extensive experience participating in administrative proceedings 
over the last years scope has reviewed many dozens of projects from housing developments to oil pipelines,landfills and water appropriation applications.members regularly attend city and county planning hearing as well as participating in many other agency meetings to encourage our government officials to preserve oaks and the santa clara river,provide adequate schools,libraries and roads for new development and to promote clean air and water.
scope has also participated in judicial proceedings seeking review of administrative action.see,santa clarita organization for planning the environment county of los angeles th.given its expertise,and considering the number of projects scope has been involved in over the years,it seems disingenuous for scope to claim that it should be held to a standard applicable to parties unfamiliar with the technicalities of administrative proceedings and subsequent judicial proceedings.despite these reservations,we decline to depart from precedent and therefore evaluate real parties claim of failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the less stringent standard articulated in citizens.
scope referred to the inadequacy of ghg mitigation only once,in its comment letter of october,which attached the list of mitigation measures developed by the attorney general.scope stated,we have attached the list of mitigation measures developed by the office of the attorney general to our comments.we request that the city incorporate these measures into any project approval that might be granted for this project.despite the general nature of scope comment,we find that this letter fairly apprised the city of scope concerns.save our residential environment city of west hollywood th.even applying the lenient standard that scope has advocated,we conclude that scope claims have not been forfeited for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
iii.mitigation of impact on climate change 
in this section,we review the merits of scope claims regarding mitigation of climate change or ghg emissions.we conclude that the city analysis was adequate,and that substantial evidence supported its findings.
ceqa requirements regarding mitigation of climate change 
ceqa requires that agencies mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects that it carries out or approves whenever it is feasible to do so.pub.resources code,subd b.public resources code section provides that 
n o public agency shall approve or carry out a project for which an environmental impact report has been certified which identifies one or more significant effects on the environment that would occur if the project is approved or carried out unless both of the following occur 
a the public agency makes one or more of the following findings with respect to each significant effect 
changes or alterations have been required in,or incorporated into,the project which mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment.
those changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency and have been,or can and should be,adopted by that other agency.
specific economic,legal,social,technological,or other considerations,including considerations for the provision of employment opportunities for highly trained workers,make infeasible the mitigation measures or alternatives identified in the environmental impact report.
b with respect to significant effects which were subject to a finding under paragraph of subdivision a,the public agency finds that specific overriding economic,legal,social,technological,or other benefits of the project outweigh the significant effects on the environment.
ceqa does not authorize an agency to proceed with a project that will have significant,unmitigated effects on the environment,based simply on a weighing of those effects against the project benefits,unless the measures necessary to mitigate those effects are truly infeasible.city of marina board of trustees of california state university cal th,city of marina see also,tit,subd.a an eir shall describe feasible measures which could minimize significant adverse impacts,including where relevant,inefficient and unnecessary consumption of energy.feasible means capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time,taking into account economic,environmental,legal,social,and technological factors,tit.
b.the city finding regarding global climate change 
in accordance with the ceqa requirements set forth above,resolution contained an attachment entitled findings required by ceqa.section of the attachment is captioned cumulative global climate change.in this section,the city stated that,the project contribution to cumulative greenhouse gas emissions from vehicle exhaust are considered to have a significant effect on global climate change.construction of the master plan project would also therefore result in a significant and unavoidable cumulative impact in regards to global climate change.
however,the report then set forth various facts,and referred to various mitigation measures,which indicated that the significant effects of the proposed project have been reduced or avoided to the extent feasible.nevertheless,despite these mitigation measures,certain significant impacts on global climate change remain,and are thus,unavoidable.
scope presents two arguments regarding the city findings regarding mitigation measures that the city conclusion that adequate mitigation of the project cumulative impact on climate change is infeasible is not adequately explained and that this conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence.
adequate explanation for the city conclusion is provided 
scope argues that n either the city findings nor the feir include any facts or analysis to support and sustain the city conclusions regarding the project impact on climate change.scope acknowledges that,in exhibit a to resolution,there is an explanation of the city finding that the project impact on climate change is unavoidable.this explanation recites a number of traffic and air quality mitigation measures which the city contends will reduce the project impact on climate change.however,scope protests that t he city finding does not assert that the city ever considered or analyzed any other mitigation measures that could potentially reduce the project ghg emissions or otherwise mitigate the project cumulative impacts.
scope does not cite any specific authority indicating that the city was required to set forth an analysis of each mitigation measure that it considered and rejected as infeasible.citing los angeles unified school dist.city of los angeles th,los angeles,scope contends that the feir violates ceqa because it did not specifically consider and discuss any of the mitigation measures suggested by the attorney general letter.
first,we note that the city considered,and in fact implemented,several measures which are consistent with the recommendations in section of the attorney general.the city response to scope comments stated,in part 
it is important to note that the project design,as an infill development in close proximity to public transportation and as an employment center near residential neighborhoods,embraces many of the strategies identified as key to combating global climate change.in addition,mitigation related to energy efficiency and solid waste reduction has already been included for the proposed project.these measures are consistent with the recommendations in section of the attorney general.
in addition,section,land use,includes a discussion of environmental sustainability.the discussion notes that the city will be considering a number of the potential mitigation measures presented in section as part of its current general plan update 
furthermore,the los angeles case does not support scope position that the city was required to specifically address the numerous mitigation measures listed in the attorney general letter.in los angeles,the los angeles unified school district lausd petitioned for a writ of mandate compelling the city of los angeles to vacate its resolution approving a development.the petition challenged the sufficiency of the eir because,among other things,it failed to discuss feasible measures for mitigating the effects of increased air pollution on two nearby schools including,specifically,the feasibility of air conditioning and filtering at the schools so that windows could be closed against the polluted air.los angeles,supra,th at.lausd had specifically suggested this mitigation measure to the city during the administrative process,and the city failed to directly respond.id.at.the los angeles court confirmed that an eir need not analyze every imaginable alternative or mitigation measure its concern is with feasible means of reducing environmental effects.citation.ibid.however,because lausd had raised a specific,concrete suggestion,the court found the city was required to respond in keeping with the statute and guidelines,an adequate eir must respond to specific suggestions for mitigating a significant environmental impact unless the suggested mitigation is facially infeasible.citations.ibid.
here,in contrast,scope submitted a letter containing more than general suggestions.scope did not single out any specific suggestions from this list,but instead articulated a broad request that the city incorporate these measures into any project approval that might be granted for this project.the letter itself indicates that the measures cited may not be appropriate for every project.considering the large number of possible mitigation measures set forth in the letter,as well as the letter indication that not all measures would be appropriate for every project,it is unreasonable to impose on the city an obligation to explore each and every one.
scope acknowledges that such a request would be unreasonable,and was not what was intended with its comment letter.instead,scope applauds the trial court interpretation of scope request i think fairly read,the letter said here a list of mitigation measures and you should consider using at least some of them.
as scope concedes,the city did incorporate some of them.the city response to scope letter pointed out that some of the already imposed mitigation measures are consistent with the measures suggested by the attorney general.scope position that its request required the city to explore in writing further mitigation measures although which specific measures were never articulated regardless of their feasibility,is simply not supportable under the law 
topanga for a scenic community county of los angeles cal d topanga does not suggest otherwise.in topanga,the supreme court addressed a challenge to a county agency decision to permit a variance.the high court held that a governing administrative agency,in adjudicating an application for a variance,must make findings which will enable the parties to determine whether and on what basis they may seek review and,in the event of review,to apprise the court of the basis for the agency action.id.at.specifically,the planning committee findings did not include comparative data from surrounding properties information which was critical to a determination that the variance had been properly permitted.id.at.here,there is no contention that the city failed entirely to make critical findings allowing an understanding of the basis for the city actions.instead,scope claims that the city failed to address nonspecific additional mitigation measures above and beyond those which were delineated in the feir.topanga does not suggest that such broad discussion is required.the feir is sufficient to disclose the analytic route the agency traveled from evidence to action.topanga,at.
under the circumstances,scope has failed to show that resolution contains insufficient analysis of its conclusions regarding the project impact on climate change.scope is asking more than is legally required.village laguna of laguna beach,board of supervisors d,village laguna.
substantial evidence supports the finding 
scope also argues that there is an absence of evidence to support the city infeasibility determination.scope frames the issue as whether substantial evidence supports the city finding that the project significant cumulative impact on climate change is unavoidable.again,scope complains of the city failure to consider requiring the mitigation measures set forth in the attorney general comment letter.
as explained above,scope did not ask the city to consider any specific mitigation measure.thus,scope vague claim regarding insufficient evidence is difficult to address.as to scope claim that the city failed to explain why additional mitigation measures,including those listed in the attorney general letter,would be infeasible,we have already determined that such an explanation was not required under the circumstances.
scope makes the broad claim that the city finding that significant cumulative impact on climate change would be unavoidable was unsupported because neither the city findings nor the feir contained any facts or analysis to support this conclusion.this claim is demonstrably incorrect.
as explained above,during the project approval process,the eir global climate change analysis was prepared in accordance with a technical advisory prepared by the opr in june.this was one of the only documents providing guidance in this area at the time.it required agencies to undertake a analysis i dentify and quantify the ghg emissions assess the significance of the impact on climate change and if the impact is found to be significant,identify alternatives mitigation measures that will reduce the impact below significance.
the eir analysis followed these three steps.first,the eir contains a lengthy discussion of the various ghg emissions and the environmental and regulatory mandates.the eir calculated the current ghg emissions and used that as a baseline for evaluating the project impacts.the eir then quantified the ghg emissions from the project operations and construction activities.the city found that ghg impacts with respect to scope and scope emissions were insignificant a finding that scope does not challenge.ceqa does not require the consideration of mitigation measures for insignificant impacts.san franciscans for reasonable growth city and county of san francisco,supra,d at pub.resources code,subd.b.ghg impacts were significant only with respect to scope emissions vehicles and transportation.
with respect to the scope emissions,the eir pointed out that t he emissions from vehicle exhaust are controlled by the state and federal governments and are outside the control of this project.the eir noted that no thresholds of significance had been established by the opr,the california air resources board,or the southern california air quality management district.however,the eir concluded that it is likely that if a significance threshold were adopted,scope ghg emissions would exceed the proposed emissions threshold due to the scale of the proposed project.the eir pointed out that transportation sources represent over percent of the state emissions and the project would contribute significantly to this sector.therefore,the eir concluded,even with all feasible mitigation measures incorporated,the project scope emissions would cause a significant and unavoidable cumulative impact.
traffic mitigation measures designed to minimize the project impact on the flow of traffic were set forth in section of the september eir.this report set forth a detailed description of the existing roadway system,existing traffic volumes,and maps of the primary affected intersections.mitigation measures through discussed the addition of traffic lanes to ease the flow of traffic around the project site.by improving the flow of traffic,fewer greenhouse gases would be emitted from vehicles,thus further reducing greenhouse gas emissions.two proposed bus stops would allow the public to access the hospital through public transportation.
in addition to these traffic mitigation measures,real parties point out that the city was required to comply with new standards requiring,among other things,that the project comply with the city sustainable policies as well as the city transportation demand management tdm program,which is designed to reduce the number of motor vehicle trips the length of the trips.in particular,the project was consistent with the city requirements for the construction of bus turnouts,efficient site design for both motorists and pedestrians,adequate parking for vehicles and bicycles,and other conditions that promote a reduction in vehicle miles traveled.furthermore,by locating the medical office buildings at the hospital campus,the project reduces the amount of vehicle trips by percent over the baseline.the city reliance on existing standards is sufficient under ceqa.tracy first city of tracy th,tracey first.
we must uphold the agency action if there is any substantial evidence in the record to support the agency decision that the eir is adequate and complies with ceqa.tracy first,supra,th at.ceqa requires a good faith effort at full disclosure it does not mandate perfection,nor does it require an analysis to be exhaustive.citation.ibid.substantial evidence,described above,supported the city determination that complete mitigation of the project cumulative impact on climate change is infeasible 
iv.health and welfare of neighboring residents 
scope next argues that the city council abused its discretion by finding that the project will not detrimentally affect the health and welfare of neighboring residents.specifically,scope argues that the city impermissibly engaged in a balancing of the project perceived benefits against its adverse impacts on neighboring residents.scope insists that the city findings must be set aside because the city failed to proceed in the manner required by law.
the city of santa clarita udc requires that the city find that a proposed development will not adversely affect the health,peace,comfort,or welfare of persons residing or working in the surrounding area.udc,subd.e a.the city is also required to make a finding that the location,size,design,and operating characteristics of the proposed use will be compatible with and will not adversely affect or be materially detrimental to adjacent uses,residents,buildings,structures,or natural resources udc,subd.g.
finding a,set forth in ordinance,specified that the development agreement between real parties and the city will not adversely affect the health,peace,comfort,or welfare of persons residing or working in the surrounding area.the ordinance went on to explain that this finding was described more fully in the eir,and that the operational characteristics of the hospital campus will not change substantially.in addition,the plan was designed to create a visually cohesive and operationally organized and successful medical campus that balances the needs for medical service expansion with the need to preserve the character of the neighborhoods that surround this regional services institution.
finding b specified that the development agreement would not be materially detrimental to the use,enjoyment,or valuation of property of other persons located in the vicinity of the site.the ordinance explained that no aspect of the proposed plan has been designed to avoid a significant alteration of views from surrounding areas and that the project is expected to have a adverse impact on the visual character of the area and the quality of the campus.
city councilmember marsha mclean challenged the city finding set forth in finding a.she stated,how can this wording remain if there are going to be things that can not be mitigated but you saying it not going to affect the peace of the people during construction and everything else the city attorney responded,in part 
the test of whether something adversely affects the health,peace,comfort,or welfare of persons residing or working in the surrounding area,according to this paragraph,is measured not just by what impacts there are going to be on the surrounding neighborhood for construction,et cetera,but what benefits there are going to be in terms of the project when it ultimately developed.and you have to balance those out,and that that what that paragraph talks about.
councilmember mclean then urged the city to at least use more honest language in describing the balancing of interests that was taking place.the city did not act on her suggestion.
scope claims that the plain language of udc section,subdivision e,does not permit the kind of balancing articulated by the city attorney.scope argues that the general rule in california is that evaluation of a project detrimental impact on the welfare of the neighboring residents must be made solely based on the project potential adverse impacts,without regard to the project potential public benefit.
scope cites several cases in support of its position.however,these cases are not directly on point.see lucas valley homeowners county of marin d,articulating test as whether these impacts are potentially detrimental or significant,but concluding there indeed was substantial evidence in the whole record demonstrating the absence of detrimental traffic impacts thomas,county of los angeles d,findings in support of denial of cup were irrelevant to the criteria set forth in the county code desmond county of contra costa th,denial of land use permit properly based on testimony from neighboring property owners harris city of costa mesa th city determination that proposed building would be detrimental to the public welfare upheld based on objections of neighboring property owners saad city of berkeley th,inadequacy of a single finding does not undermine denial of permit where other adequate findings were made.because these cases do not address the propriety of balancing a project perceived benefits against its adverse impacts on neighboring residents,they do not convince us that the city actions were improper.cases are not authority for propositions not considered.citation.emeryville redevelopment agency harcros pigments,th.
neither party argues that the relevant udc sections are ambiguous,therefore we restrict our analysis to the plain language of those ordinances.day city of fontana cal th.the plain language of udc section,subd.e,does not foreclose the type of balancing that the city engaged in.in its entirety,the section reads 
findings.the planning commission may recommend and the city council may grant a development agreement prescribed by this section,as applied for or in a modified form,if,on the basis of the application and the evidence submitted,the applicant substantiates,to the satisfaction of the commission and the council,the following facts 
that the proposed development agreement will not 
adversely affect the health,peace,comfort,or welfare of persons residing or working in the surrounding area or 
be materially detrimental to the use,enjoyment,or valuation of property of other persons located in the vicinity of the site or 
jeopardize,endanger or otherwise constitute a menace to the public health,safety or general welfare.
the ordinance does not limit the factors that may be considered in making the finding at issue.indeed,it seems logical that a decision as to whether a project will adversely affect a community must necessarily include consideration of the project benefits to that community 
in addition,as the trial court pointed out,an agency view of the meaning and scope of its own ordinance is entitled to great weight unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.friends of davis city of davis th.city of davis here,the city decision to weigh the benefits of the project in reaching its decision regarding the adverse effects of the project is not clearly erroneous nor is it specifically unauthorized.because the city actions were consistent with the ordinance,we decline to find error 
real parties cite examples of cases where an agency actions in balancing the benefits versus the detriments of a project have been upheld in similar situations.in bowman city of berkeley th,the petitioners appealed from a denial of their writ of mandate challenging the construction of a housing complex.the city had determined that the project would not be detrimental to the adjacent properties,surrounding areas or the general welfare of the city because,among other things,the demolition would remove a vacant commercial building that had become a nuisance.as to concerns regarding sunlight,the city concluded,any detriment resulting from the shadowing that will be created by the project is outweighed by the benefit of providing additional dwelling units including reserved for low and income senior households.id.at.while the balancing that the city engaged in was not specifically challenged,denial of the petitioners writ,on this and other grounds,was affirmed.similarly,in schumm board of supervisors d schumm,the county determination that a clubhouse and swimming pool would not be detrimental to the surrounding community was based on the following facts that the area is relatively uninhabited,that similar uses had already been granted,that
