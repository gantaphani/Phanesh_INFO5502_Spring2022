the environmental protection information center epic filed suit against the united states fish and wildlife service fws and simpson timber company,simpson redwood company and arcata redwood company simpson.epic alleged that the fws violated section of the endangered species act esa,by refusing to reinitiate consultation with itself about the effect that an incidental take permit issued to simpson for the northern spotted owl might have on two other marbled murrelet and the coho salmon.the marbled murrelet and the coho salmon were added to the threatened species list after the fws issued the spotted owl permit to simpson.epic sought an injunction to halt simpson logging activities on its acres of timberland in northern california until the fws had reinitiated and completed the consultation.see.
the district court granted simpson motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.see.b the court held that the fws had not retained sufficient discretionary control over simpson incidental take permit to require it to take steps that would benefit the marbled murrelet or the coho salmon,and therefore reinitiation of consultation was not required.epic appeals.we have jurisdiction under and we affirm.
section of the esa makes it unlawful to take an endangered species.see a b.the fws has extended this prohibition by regulation to include threatened species.see a.the term take is defined broadly to mean harass,harm,pursue,hunt,shoot,wound,kill,trap,capture,or collect.the secretary of the interior has interpreted the term harm to cover significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns,including breeding,feeding or sheltering.eliminating a threatened species habitat thus can constitute taking that species for purposes of section.see babbitt sweet home chapter of communities for a great oregon,d.
section a of the esa requires all federal agencies to insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction of critical habitat.a.the term action includes all activities or programs of any kind authorized,funded,or carried out,in whole or in part,by federal agencies,including the granting of permits.the parties agree that issuing an incidental take permit qualifies as agency action for purposes of section a.
when undertaking an action,an agency the action agency must determine whether the action may affect an endangered or threatened species.a.if so,the agency must formally consult with either the fws or the national marine fisheries service nmfs consultation agencies,depending on which agency is in charge of that species.id.during consultation the parties can not make any irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources with respect to the agency action which has the effect of foreclosing the formulation or implementation of any reasonable and prudent alternative measures which would not violate section a.d.after formal consultation,the appropriate consultation agency issues a biological opinion evaluating the potential effect on the protected species.if the consultation agency biological opinion concludes that the proposed activity is likely to jeopardize an endangered or threatened species,the agency identifies reasonable and prudent alternatives to avoid the action negative impacts.a b a.if the consultation agency biological opinion concludes that the proposed activity is not likely to jeopardize an endangered or threatened species,then the proposed action is permitted.
the section duty to consult can be ongoing,and consultation must be reinitiated under certain circumstances.an agency is required to reinitiate consultation where 
discretionary federal involvement or control over the action has been retained or is authorized by law and 
a if the amount or extent of taking specified in the incidental take statement is exceeded 
b if new information reveals effects of the action that may affect listed species or critical habitat in a manner or to an extent not previously considered 
c if the identified action is subsequently modified in a manner that causes an effect to the listed species or critical habitat that was not considered in the biological opinion or 
d if a new species is listed or critical habitat designated that may be affected by the identified action.
emphasis added.the duty to reinitiate consultation lies with both the action agency and the consultation agency.see id.reinitiation of consultation requires either the fws or the nmfs to issue a new biological opinion before the agency action may continue.graham red squirrel madigan,cir.
epic argues that the fws duty to reinitiate consultation has been triggered because that agency retained discretionary involvement or control over the action permitted by simpson spotted owl permit,and the marbled murrelet and coho salmon,two species that may be affected by what simpson does with its permit,have been added to the threatened species list.the marbled murrelet was added to the list in the fall of,several months after the fws issued the incidental take permit to simpson.see h.close to five years later,the nmfs added the coho salmon to the threatened species list.see id.both the marbled murrelet and coho salmon inhabit simpson timberland however,it is not certain that simpson logging activities have had or will have a negative effect on either of them 
simpson land is also habitat for the northern spotted owl,which the fws listed as a threatened species in.see id.when that happened,simpson logging activities exposed the company to potential liability under section of the esa for taking northern spotted owls.in order to continue its logging operation,simpson applied for an incidental take permit from the fws under section of the esa authorizing it to take some northern spotted owls provided such taking is incidental to,and not the purpose of,the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity.a b.
as part of the application for its incidental take permit,simpson was required to submit a habitat conservation plan hcp and an implementation agreement ia.the hcp is an extensive document that explains i the impact which will likely result from the taking ii what steps the applicant will take to minimize and mitigate such impacts and iv such other measures that the secretary may require as being necessary or appropriate for purposes of the plan.a a.the ia outlines how the permit holder will carry out the obligations described in the hcp.these documents then become part of the application and,if the application is approved,are incorporated into the incidental take permit.
simpson prepared an hcp detailing measures designed to minimize the impact of its logging on the spotted owl,including mitigation measures,reporting requirements,and monitoring by the fws and state agencies.simpson also provided research showing that these measures would ensure no significant adverse impact to the spotted owl and that its conservation program would contribute to the survival and recovery of that species.in addition,in its hcp,simpson promised that the timber harvesting plans thps it would submit to california department of forestry under california law would include numerous mitigation measures.the hcp states,
in addition to addressing the specific needs of the spotted owl,simpson thps to be submitted to the california department of forestry will be designed to 
retain to percent canopy and percent ground cover along class i and large class ii streams 
protect ponds,swamps,bogs,and seeps as separate riparian areas and identify them in the thp as habitat retention areas 
protect resource values during site preparation through measures such as limitations on burning,exclusion of heavy equipment from retention areas,and construction of additional firelines where appropriate around retention areas 
design,construct,and maintain roads to minimize impacts and the number of stream crossings through riparian areas 
modify silvicultural systems as appropriate to ensure compatibility with the habitat requirements of other speciesfound within simpson ownership that are considered sensitive by state and federal regulatory agencies.
these measures will benefit other species of concern as well as the owl and meet or exceed current state forest practice rules.
hcp at emphasis added.
because the fws action in issuing the incidental take permit would affect the spotted owl,it completed an internal consultation process as required by section a of the esa then,on september,the fws issued a permit to simpson allowing it to take a limited number of northern spotted owls over a period in the process of its logging operations.the permit does not allow simpson to take any other species.
the fws retained some ongoing authority over simpson permit ten years after the permit issuance,the fws will review the permit and evaluate whether simpson has complied with its terms before allowing simpson to continue logging operations under the permit.the fws can also suspend the permit at any time in the event of any significant violation or breach of the permit it also has the authority to revoke the permit if activities authorized under it result in the taking of threatened species not the subject of the permit,including the marbled murrelet and coho salmon.
the district court concluded that,although a number of provisions in simpson permit gave the fws some involvement in the continuing administration of the permit,those provisions were not sufficient to establish the discretionary federal involvement or control required for reinitiation of consultation under.the district court dismissed epic suit with prejudice,and this appeal followed.

simpson challenges epic standing to bring this suit under the provision of the esa,codified at g.that statute provides,
g citizen suits 
except as provided in paragraph of this subsection any person may commence a civil suit on his own behalf 
a to enjoin any person,including the united states and any other governmental instrumentality or agency to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment to the constitution,who is alleged to be in violation of any provision of this chapter or regulation issued under the authority thereof or 
c against the secretary of commerce or the interior where there is alleged a failure of the secretary to perform any act or duty under section of this title which is not discretionary with the secretary.
the citizen suit provision is a means by which private parties may enforce the substantive provisions of the esa against regulated private entities and government agencies.bennett spear,d.in the present case,epic is suing to enforce section a of the esa,a substantive provision that requires all federal agencies to insure that any action authorized,funded or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat of such species.a.
simpson relies on bennett in arguing that the esa provision does not apply to suits for maladministration of the esa and that epic suit falls within this category.simpson misreads bennett.there,the fws,as the consultation agency,issued a biological opinion allowing the bureau of reclamation,as the action agency,to undertake a water reclamation project subject to certain restrictions.although the bennett court held that the fws could not be sued for maladministration of the esa under g a,the court expressly recognized that citizen suits are a permissible means to enforce the substantive provisions of the esa against regulated government agencies like the fws in its role as the action agency.see bennett,at.here,epic seeks to enforce the substantive obligation imposed on the fws to ensure that no action authorized by it is likely to jeopardize a threatened species.accordingly,epic has standing to bring this lawsuit under the provision of the esa.
even if we were to read bennett to preclude standing for epic under the esa,epic would still have standing to sue under the apa.epic complaint alleges that the fws failure to comply with section a of the esa was arbitrary,capricious,and not in accordance with procedures required by law,in violation of the apa.see a.when a plaintiff challenges an agency action under the apa,it must also show that the interests it seeks to protect are arguably within the zone of interests to be protected by the statute in question.yesler terrace cmty.council cisneros,cir quoting ass of data processing serv,camp,d.the interests epic seeks to protect in this litigation clearly fall within the zone of interests contemplated by section a of the esa.section a requires agencies,before authorizing action,to obtain a biological opinion on the environmental impact of that action in order to ensure that the action will not jeopardize a threatened species.epic,as a organization that seeks to protect threatened species,has a direct interest in seeing that the fws complies with section a.thus,epic has standing under of the apa,as well as under the provision of the esa.
duty to reinitiate consultation 
epic argues that,under the plain language of and our decision in pacific rivers council thomas,cir,the extent of fws control over simpson permit,combined with the subsequent listing of the coho salmon and the marbled murrelet as threatened species,is sufficient to trigger the fws duty to reinitiate consultation.alternatively,epic argues that if we determine that sierra club babbitt,cir,not pacific rivers,governs this case,the fws discretionary power over simpson permit satisfies even the sierra club test because the fws discretionary control can benefit the marbled murrelet and the coho salmon.
for the reasons stated below,we conclude that sierra club provides the appropriate test,and under that test the fws is not required to reinitiate consultation on simpson spotted owl permit.
sierra club involved a suit against the bureau of land management blm for its failure to consult with the fws about the effect of a proposed logging road on the northern spotted owl.a private timber company was going to build a road on public land pursuant to a agreement with the blm.the sierra club claimed that the agreement represented ongoing agency action and that the blm was required to consult with the fws about the potential impact of the road on a newly listed species,the spotted owl,because the blm retained discretionary involvement and control over the.under the agreement,the blm could object to the timber company project in three limited instances,none of which was at issue or related to endangered or threatened species.id.at.we held that the blm did not have a duty to consult with the fws because it could not influence construction of the roadway for the benefit of the spotted owl 
in light of the statute plain language,the agency regulations,and the case law construing the scope of agency action,we conclude that where,as here,the federal agency lacks the discretion to influence the private action,consultation would be a meaningless exercise the agency simply does not possess the ability to implement measures that inure to the benefit of the protected species.
id.at emphasis added.
under sierra club,to survive a rule b motion to dismiss,epic must allege facts to show that the fws retained sufficient discretionary involvement or control over simpson permit to implement measures that inure to the benefit of the marbled murrelet and the coho salmon.id.although epic contends its complaint satisfies the sierra club test,its first line of attack is to avoid that test by arguing instead that pacific rivers controls the outcome of this case.we disagree.
pacific rivers held that the forest service was obligated to consult with the nmfs upon its listing of the snake river chinook salmon as threatened because the forest service land resource management plans lrmps,which establish plans for government lands,have an ongoing and effect even after adoption and therefore represent ongoing agency action.at.simpson incidental take permit is not analogous to the lrmps at issue in pacific rivers.lrmps are comprehensive management plans which govern agency action in forest planning decisions.the forest service has plenary control in this area because it is the agency charged with promulgating,approving and implementing lrmps on forest service land.in contrast,simpson esa section permit,like the agreement in sierra club,involves agency authorization of a private action and a more limited role for the fws.in such a case,the issue of ongoing agency involvement turns on whether the agency has retained the power to implement measures that inure to the benefit of the protected species.sierra club,at.sierra club,not pacific rivers,controls the present case.
addressing the sierra club test,epic argues that the language of the hcp reserves to the fws discretionary involvement and control to such an extent that it must reconsult on the impact of simpson spotted owl permit on marbled murrelet and coho salmon.most significantly,epic cites a passage from the hcp section on mitigation measures captioned overall resource management.this passage states that i n addition to addressing the specific needs of the spotted owl,simpson thps submitted to the state of california will be designed to m odify silvicultural systems as appropriate to ensure compatibility with the habitat requirements of other species found within simpson ownership that are considered sensitive by state and federal regulatory agencies.hcp at.
epic argues this assurance obligated simpson to benefit species that might be listed as threatened after simpson permit was granted,including marbled murrelet and coho salmon.we disagree.the sentence in the hcp on which epic relies was one of numerous mitigation measures set forth in the hcp to ensure protection of spotted owls as per state and federal laws and to mitigate and minimize,to the maximum extent practicable,the potential effects of timber harvesting on the resident owl population.id.at.the most reasonable interpretation of the promise to m odify silvicultural systems is that the language means simpson will modify silvicultural systems to accommodate other currently listed species,not species that might subsequently be listed.as the fws points out,nowhere in the various permit documents did the fws retain discretionary control to make new requirements to protect species that subsequently might be listed as endangered or threatened 
epic argues the fws interpretation of the permit documents,and its position in this litigation,are undercut by a statement it made in its biological opinion letter.a sentence in that letter states reinitiation of formal consultation is required if a new species is listed or critical habitat designated that may be affected by this action.biological opinion letter at.this statement,however,is not a statement of any continuing discretionary power retained by the fws over simpson permit.it simply restates the general regulatory requirement found at,a requirement which becomes applicable only when sufficient discretionary involvement or control has been retained to trigger reinitiation of consultation.id.
epic also argues that other provisions of the hcp and ia authorize the fws to require protection for species other than owls.the provisions to which epic refers identify thresholds for the owl population that trigger plan modifications and corrective measures,and establish a contingency plan when thresholds are exceeded or unforeseen events occur.the provisions also allow the fws to review corrective action to eliminate plan deficiencies,suspend the permit for significant violations or breaches of the permit,and incorporate revisions to the hcp as necessary to ensure that the conservation goals of the hcp are met.see hcp at ia at.none of these provisions addresses the scope of the fws authority to implement measures to benefit species other than the spotted owl.
for example,one provision of the ia allows the fws to review annual reports and notify simpson of any deficiencies in the report or in permit compliance,specifying what additional information or actions are required to correct those deficiencies.ia at.this provision gives the fws the ability to seek further information,to notify simpson of noncompliance,and to provide guidance on how to cure those deficiencies.it does not give the fws the power,however,to act to benefit marbled murrelets or coho salmon.
similarly,the ia provision allowing the fws to revise the contingency plan as may be necessary to ensure that the conservation goals of the hcp are met does not expand the conservation goals of the hcp to include reinitiation of consultation to determine the permitted activity effects on the marbled murrelet and coho salmon.id.at.instead,it allows the fws to revise the contingency plan to protect spotted owls in the event of unforeseen occurrences or if the reproductive success rates of spotted owls fall below thresholds established by the ia.id.at.the ia also allows the fws to suspend the permit i n the event of any significant violation or breach of the permit or this agreement.id.at.however,as the fws points out,this provision authorizes remedies for breach,not discretionary power to demand additional measures to protect new species.
in sum,none of the provisions of the hcp or ia gives the fws the power to reinitiate consultation on simpson spotted owl permit to impose measures to protect the marbled murrelet or coho salmon.nevertheless,epic contends,relying on natural res.def.council houston,cir,that so long as a permitting agency maintains some discretionary control,it has a duty to reconsult under section a.epic argues houston demonstrates that existing contracts and permits that are in no way related to the esa or do not provide mechanisms to protect threatened and endangered species may require alteration if necessary to comply with the esa.epic opening br.at.we do not read houston as supporting epic argument.
in houston,we held that the bureau of reclamation was required to consult with the nmfs because its renewal of water contracts,which was statutorily mandated to be on mutually agreeable terms with water purchasers,involved agency discretion to set the contract terms.negotiating and executing contracts constituted agency action.id.at.the bureau retained the requisite discretionary control because,depending on the outcome of the consultation,it had the discretionary power to decrease the total supply of water available for sale and thereby to decrease the amount of water granted in the renewed contracts.see id.at.therefore,the bureau was required to initiate consultation if its action might affect a listed species.
we did not suggest in houston that once the renewed contracts were executed,the agency had continuing discretion to amend them at any time to address the needs of endangered or threatened species.houston is inapposite.
finally,epic argues that b,which allows the fws to amend any permit for just cause at any time during its term,upon written finding of necessity,creates the discretionary authority to impose measures for the benefit of the marbled murrelet and coho salmon this regulation,however,can not be interpreted to give the fws the discretion to amend an esa section permit where the agency has not otherwise retained discretion under the permit to impose such an amendment.such an interpretation would mean that sufficient discretionary involvement or control to consider impacts on newly listed species is always reserved,making irrelevant requirement that th
