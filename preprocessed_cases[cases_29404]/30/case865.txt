fishermen finest,north pacific fishing,and fishing,llc,fishermen appeal from the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of the secretary of the united states department of commerce.fishermen challenges the secretary issuance of a final rule adopting amendment to the fishery management plan fmp for groundfish of the bering sea and aleutian islands management area bsaima.
the government allocates pacific cod in the bsaima among different sectors of the fishing industry.fishermen belongs to the trawl cp sector.it contends that the most recent allocation,which reduced its share of the pacific cod fishery,did not comport with applicable law.
we affirm because we agree with the district court that the secretary did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in adopting amendment.
fishermen operates two vessels that fish for pacific cod,flatfish,rockfish and atka mackerel in the bsaima.the bsaima fishery is located off the northwest coast of alaska.it is this nation largest in terms of harvest and area.pollock is the most lucrative and largest fishery in the bsaima pacific cod is second.different means of fishing are employed in the bsaima.allocations are made among different methods of fishing,because of their individualized environmental and socioeconomic impact.a trawler is a fishing vessel that fishes by dragging a large net or trawl through the water.cp vessels process fish by removing the head and gut as soon as they are caught,hence fishermen belongs to a sector colloquially known as the head gut sector.
to understand the substance of fishermen claims requires an overview of the government regulation of fishing.finding that c ertain stocks of fish have declined to the point where their survival is threatened,a a,congress enacted the fishery conservation and management act msa in to conserve and manage fishery resources and to achieve and maintain,on a continuing basis,the optimum yield from each fishery.id.b.in order to achieve these ends the msa established eight regional fishery management councils councils,which could set the total allowable catch tac for each fish species in different fishing zones.see id.b c,b h.the fmp,and amendments thereto,do not become effective,however,until they are approved by the secretary.see a b.the secretary has delegated this responsibility to the national marine fisheries service nmfs,which only promulgates the regulation after ensuring the fmp and amendments are consistent with the msa ten national standards,inter alia,a b,and after a period of public comment.id.a b b a.
fishermen complains that the most recent allocations of the pacific cod tac in amendment to the current fmp of the bsaima violated national standard and national standard of the msa.national standards and provide that 
conservation and management measures shall be based upon the best scientific information available.
conservation and management measures shall not discriminate between residents of different states.if it becomes necessary to allocate or assign fishing privileges among various united states fishermen,such allocation shall be a fair and equitable to all such fishermen b reasonably calculated to promote conservation and c carried out in such a manner that no particular individual,corporation,or other entity acquires an excessive share of such privileges.
a.the msa requires the nmfs to promulgate guidelines interpreting the national standards.id.at b.according to the guidelines,national standard best scientific information includes,but is not limited to,information of a biological,ecological,economic,or social nature.b.further,fmps and amendments must take into account the best scientific information available at the time of preparation and if new information becomes available between initial drafting and nmfs review,it should be incorporated into the final fmp where practicable.id.b.where there are conflicting facts and opinions,the fishery management councils may choose what to consider but should justify the choice.id.b.
with regards to national standard,allocations are fair and equitable if they are rationally connected to the achievement of optimum yield or with the furtherance of a legitimate fmp objective.id.c i a.further,i nherent in an allocation is the advantaging of one group to the detriment of another.id.thus,a n allocation of fishing privileges may impose a hardship on one group if it is outweighed by the total benefits received by another group or groups.id.c i b.for example,section of the msa sets aside a portion of tac for eligible villages as part of the western alaska community development quota program.see i a.
fishermen also argues that tac allocation violates a of the american fisheries act afa by creating an adverse impact on fishing vessels.in,the afa created a monopoly in fishing rights to pollock assigned to specific vessels that met a past participation test in that industry.afa.fishermen does not belong to this group.it is referred to as a participant in bsaima fishing.the vessels granted a monopoly by the afa operate as cooperatives that also engage in fishing for other species,as was anticipated and approved of by the afa.because of the competitive advantage the specific afa vessels gained due to their pollock monopoly,congress sought to limit their impact on other fisheries by dictating that councils 
shall recommend for approval by the secretary such conservation and management measures as it determines necessary to protect other fisheries under its jurisdiction and the participants in those fisheries,including processors,from adverse impacts caused by this act or fishery cooperatives in the directed pollock fishery.
afa a emphasis added.congress also built in protections in the afa against unfair competitive advantages for the afa vessels by imposing sideboards,which are limits on how much fish of other species afa vessels are allowed to catch.afa b c.for example,in the pacific cod fishery,afa trawl cp vessels operated under a sideboard limit of of tac and afa trawl cv vessels operated under a sideboard limit of of tac.as a result of the afa,vessels increased their harvest of species,as they were now excluded from pollock.final rule.at.
an fmp for the bsaima was first promulgated in.it includes annual tacs for each of seventeen target species,including pacific cod.in,for the first time,amendment allocated the pacific cod tac,to the fixed gear and pot sector,to the trawl sector,and to the jig gear sector fishing lure methods.these allocations reflected the harvests in those sectors from to,with the exception that the jig gear allocations was increased to encourage growth.amendment also gave the nmfs authority to reallocate pacific cod from vessels from one sector to another anytime the nmfs determines that one gear group or the other will not be able to harvest its allocation of pacific cod.at.
in,amendment divided the trawl allocation between catcher vessels cv and cp and allocated to fixed gear,to trawl gear divided equally,and for jig gear,codified at pt.amendments and,passed in and,respectively,further refined sector subdivisions from the original fixed gear sector into five groups.see,codified at pt,codified at pt.these amendments did not alter the tac allocated to the trawl cp group.see,february,proposed rule noting a tac quota for trawl cps between and.
on september,the nmfs updated the fmp for groundfish of the bsaima with amendment,which sets forth new allocations for the tac of pacific cod that each of nine sectors may catch annually.fisheries of the executive economic zone off alaska,pacific cod allocations in the bering sea and aleutian island management area.september,codified at pt.for the first time since the msa,trawl cps were divided between afa trawl catcher processors part of the fleet granted pollock fishing rights under the afa and trawl catcher processors those who had no pollock fishing rights.at.because afa trawl cp vessels were now limited in their amount of pacific cod by a direct allocation,there was no longer a need for the sideboard limit imposed by the afa.the sideboard was phased out.
the north pacific council,which has authority over the bsaima,sought the adoption of because g rowing demand for pacific cod,a fully exploited fishery,and other distributional concerns among sectors led the council to consider a n action to revise allocations of pacific cod among the many bsai ma groundfish sectors.at.revision of allocations had become necessary because current allocations meant that one or more sectors are typically unable to harvest their annual allocation of the pacific cod tac.at.thus,to provide an opportunity for the full harvest of bsai pacific cod tac,existing allocations of pacific cod that are projected to be unharvested by some sectors are annually reallocated by nmfs to other sectors.id.since bsai pacific cod sector allocations have been in effect,nmfs has reallocated pacific cod each year from the trawl and jig sectors to fixed gear sectors.see also fishery management council,public review draft environmental impact regulatory flexibility analysis for proposed amendment and table march,hereinafter noting that between and,trawl cps reallocated of their sector quota.the nmfs also carried out other more minor reallocations.id.
the problem statement setting forth the objectives of reads as follows 
the bsaima pacific cod fishery is fully utilized and has been allocated among gear groups and to sectors within gear groups.the current allocations among trawl,jig,and fixed gear were implemented in amendment and the cdq community development quota allocation was implemented in.these allocations are overdue for review.harvest patterns have varied significantly among the sectors resulting in annual of tac.as a result,the current allocations do not correspond with actual dependency and use by sectors.
participants in the bsaima pacific cod fishery who have made significant investments and have dependence on the resource need stability in the allocations to the trawl,jig,fixed gear and cdq sectors.to reduce uncertainty and provide stability,allocations should be adjusted to better reflect historic use by sector.the basis for determining sector allocations will be catch history as well as consideration of and community factors.
as other fisheries in the bsaima and goa are incrementally rationalized,historical participants in the bsaima pacific cod fishery may be put at a disadvantage.each sector in the bsaima pacific cod fishery currently has different degrees of license requirements and levels of participation.allocations to the sector level are a necessary step on the path towards comprehensive rationalization.prompt action is needed to maintain stability in the bsaima pacific cod fisheries.
at.in pursuing socioeconomic factors,the north pacific council stated that it was particularly interested in expanding,local opportunities to fish cod for coastal alaskan communities that may be due to the high fixed cost barrier to entry present in other fishing methods.id.
the council aimed to allocate pacific cod based on the average of catch history.the and allocations can be summarized as follows all numbers are a percentage of tac 
at,table current and proposed allocations of bsaima pacific cod tac and average harvest share by sector percent emphasis added.when it began its analysis in,the council considered alternative options for the data that should be used in determining the historical catch.the council selected the most expansive set of years,choosing to analyze catch history data from,when allocations began,to.in april,the council voted to take final action and propose new sector allocations,including providing the trawl cp sector with a share of the tac.fishermen points out that these allocations have a significant financial impact on fisheries as each percent of the tac allocated represents approximately million in revenue.
by that time further catch history data from and was available.the trawl cp sector had an average of percent of the retained harvest between and.at,table average share percent of retained harvest.whereas the data from to was processed based on fish tickets,which issue only upon sale or transfer of fish,the and data was extrapolated from observer estimates.further,observer coverage varied between sectors.id.
the council disregarded the and data because it considered it inequitable to favor the trawl cp sector,which in response to high market demand for pacific cod and in anticipation of evaluation of usage,had been able,thanks to its prior,to increase steadily its pacific cod fishing,while other sectors which suffered from,remained limited to smaller usage.thus,the council considered the data to illustrate recent harvest trends,but did not rely upon them in establishing allocations.
consistent with the problem statement,the council allocated higher than the average historical catch to those sectors that would most benefit coastal alaskan communities the small fixed gear sector,of which is comprised of residents of coastal alaskan communities,and the jig sector,which uses coastal processing facilities.in justifying the trawl cp sector allocation,the council also noted that the trawl sectors had never funded allocation increases for the small fixed gear cv sector above its historic average,that cv sectors contribute more to the economy of coastal communities than cp sectors because of onshore processing,and that cv sectors had suffered greater impacts from restrictions to protect stellar sea lions.
also occurred based on the need to preserve a directed cod fishery for various sectors.the term directed fishery refers to whether vessels intend to catch that particular species of fish or whether the fish is caught incidentally.fish caught incidentally are known as bycatch.vessels previously would discard the dead or dying bycatch back into the sea although some were kept for sale.because of the waste and detrimental environmental effects of this practice,msa national standard requires that bycatch be minimized.a.accordingly,in,the nmfs required vessels to retain all,or specified amounts of,pollock and pacific cod,by adopting amendment for the bsaima fmp,codified at.in proposing,the council sought to allocate enough pacific cod tac to the afa trawl cp sector so it could maintain the minimum necessary for a directed pacific cod fishery.the council was motivated by the fact that the afa trawl cp sector was efficient in its pacific cod fishing,with a higher percentage of its allocation being used up by directed fishing.the council also made the decision to favor those with less bycatch by counting historical catch data even though that data did not include bycatch.
fishermen contends that the north pacific council allocated pacific cod tac to the afa trawl cp sector as part of an impermissible and arbitrary political compromise in order to ensure that one sole vessel of that fleet,the katie ann,had a directed cod fishery.councilman fuglvog expressed concern about whether the afa trawl cp sector allocation would be sufficient to allow the katie ann to continue its directed cod fishery.in response,councilwoman salveson stated that this action is intended to establish allocation to better reflect historic use by sector not to provide for a directed fishery for any one vessel.final allocations to the afa trawl cp sector were within the range calculated based on historic use.
on february,the nmfs published its proposed rule and request for comments.at.on september,it promulgated its final rule and published the comments and responses.at.there were numerous comments addressing the allocation of cod to trawl cps.see.at comment,comments and,comment,comment.
on october,fishermen filed this action in federal court challenging under the judicial review powers over regulations promulgated under the msa,including fmps,granted by the apa.f.the district court upheld secretary decision in a summary judgment order on december.it held that allocations were rationally connected to the objectives set forth in the problem statement and resulted in a fair and equitable result as required by national standard the inclusion of the years and exclusion of the years in calculating historical catch data was not a failure to consider the best scientific information available under national standard the allocation to the afa trawl cp sector was not a political compromise merely for the benefit of the katie ann and the allocations did not create an adverse impact in violation of the afa by robbing the trawl cp sector to benefit the afa trawl cp sector.fishermen has timely appealed.this court has jurisdiction under and.
fishermen contends that the secretary violated national standard and national standard in promulgating.further,fishermen contends that creates an adverse impact on vessels in violation of the afa.
this court reviews a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo with all facts read in the light most favorable to the party.yakutat,gutierrez,cir quoting covington jefferson county,cir.in reviewing regulations promulgated under the magnuson act,our only function is to determine whether the secretary of commerce has considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.alliance against ifqs brown,cir quoting.crab producers,mosbacher,cir.we determine only if the secretary acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in promulgating such regulations.alliance against ifqs,at.under the apa,we will reverse the agency action only if the action is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise contrary to law.lands council powell,cir,amended by cir.
to be valid must be consistent with the national standards presented in the act.see yakutat,at the fishery management plans must be consistent with the national standards described in the magnuson act.the regulations implementing national standard require that motives for new allocations be justified in terms of the objectives of the fmp.c i a.fishermen argues that,because reduces the trawl cp allocation below fishermen definition of historical use,the changed quota fails to meet the stated objectives.fishermen contrasts the problem statement,which points out that allocations did not reflect actual dependency and use,with the new regulations that reduce their share below their actual average usage in and.at.fishermen narrowly focuses on this one clause at the expense of a more comprehensive,coherent reading of the entire statement.while the final problem statement does begin describing,among other concerns,a discrepancy between allocations and actual use,it specifically provides that the basis for future allocations will be catch history and other socioeconomic considerations.at.fishermen was allocated an annual tac that was the average of their historic usage of pacific cod from to.in terms of socioeconomic and community factors,their share was reduced in part to fund the small fixed gear sector of coastal alaskan residents.
fishermen also attempts a novel combination of national standard of the msa with a of the afa.fishermen points out that national standard forbids excessive privileges to one group while a forbids adverse impacts caused by any unfair advantages to the afa vessels.fishermen then would have us conclude that,by shifting percentage points in its final allocation from the trawl cp sector to the afa trawl cp sector,violated both.the council,however,may under national standard,impose a hardship on one group if its outweighed by the total benefits received by another group or groups.id.c i b.as noted above,part of the reduction was due to socioeconomic factors leading the council to fund sectors that favor growth for coastal alaskan residents.further,whatever shift in percentage points that could be traced from the trawl cp sector to the afa trawl cp sector was rationally justified by the need to preserve the more efficient directed cod fishery of the latter.as for a,we discuss it separately and do not believe there is any statutory confluence that requires special treatment of a with national standard.
fishermen attempts to combine the requirements of afa a with national standard,by claiming the nmfs was required to analyze specifically any adverse impact would have on the trawl cp sector caused by benefitting the afa trawl cp sector.as explained below,however,if anything,had an adverse impact on the afa trawl cp sector,thus,there can be no reasonable expectation that the nmfs should analyze a harm.
fishermen has failed to demonstrate that the allocation,although disadvantageous to them,was not fair or equitable in furthering the beneficial objectives of the fmp.thus,comports with national standard.
fishermen makes a related argument that the nmfs failed to analyze the impact of the allocations under national standard by failing to consider its potential loss of a directed cod fishery.the regulations state that the council should make an initial estimate of the relative benefits and hardships imposed by the allocation.c i b.however,the demonstrates that the council did consider the impact of the changes on the trawl cp sector.for example,the council considered the extent limitations on bycatch would prevent a direct cod fishery for the trawl sector,and noted that separate allowances would prevent the trawl sector from closing down directed cod fishing for the entire trawl sector.further,the responses to the comments published with the final rule show that the nmfs determined that,even under a worst case scenario,the trawl cp sector would be able to maintain a directed cod fishery.see.at.the national standards do not require any particular outcome with respect to allocations rather,they provide a framework for the council analysis.there is nothing in the msa that guarantees fishermen a directed cod fishery.fishermen is to a certain extent a victim of its own success,because the greater its operations for other fish species,inevitably the greater its incidental bycatch of pacific cod.one of the bsaima fmp objectives under the msa is conservation and management.accordingly,under national standard,the fmps,and the amendments thereto,must minimize bycatch.the council is not tied down by the need to allocate in order to preserve directed cod fisheries for participants with high levels of bycatch.the council fulfilled its obligations under the framework by analyzing the impact of the new allocations on the trawl cp sector.thus,none of the secretary actions on this issue were arbitrary or capricious.alliance against ifqs,at.
under national standard,conservation and management measures shall be based upon the best scientific information available,a,which,includes,but is not limited to,information of a biological,ecological,economic,or social nature.b.fishermen argues that the council failed to consider the most relevant data in developing the new allocations.fishermen asserts that the council considered data that was too old and no longer relevant to reallocation information,and failed to consider the relevance of the most recent available data.fishermen further argues that instead of basing the decision on scientific analysis it was an arbitrary political compromise.
fishermen maintains that the older catch history data analyzed by the council was irrelevant.they argue that any data collected before is particularly misleading because catch regulations changed in.in support,fishermen point out that in,a concurrent amendment designed to reorganize all species fishing in the bsaima,data was ignored because there was a concern the data would fail to best represent the traditional harvest patterns of the a sector.at final rule.the council,however,stated its rationale for including the older data in.the year of was selected as a starting point because it immediately followed the first act allocations.the council acknowledged that there were intervening events that may have changed the circumstances of the allocations,in particular the afa legislation and attempts to protect the steller sea lion.for example,the passing of the afa legislation pushed the trawl sector into increased cod fishing.the afa,however,pushed all pacific cod participants into increased pacific cod use,not just fishermen.the key difference is that because fishermen belonged to a sector with one of the most significant prior to,it was one of the few who could increase its usage without being limited by its allocation in response to the afa.if the council focused exclusively on post data,it would benefit fishermen unfairly while ignoring harvest trends for the industry as a whole not just fishermen sector.
further,the data fishermen disputed was not the only national standard data the council was allowed to rely on in making its decision,considering the objectives of the fmp.the council also made reallocations based on sociological data,which pointed towards increasing allocations to the small gear sector that consisted mainly of coastal alaskan residents.
finally,it is evident that the council examined several potential data sets before selecting the range including to.even with regards to the selection of the years in question,the council determined that a smaller set of years would produce skewed results based on a too narrow view of market demand for cod in those years.in other words,although the afa legislation and stellar sea lion protection measures were significant variables that did threaten to render data misleading,the council justified its choice,as required by b,to include the data because it believed a host of other variables were influencing catch history and a more accurate representation could only be reached by broadening the set of years to include all years with comparable data since allocations began.ultimately,any selection of data inherently places one party at a disadvantage fishermen has failed to demonstrate how this selection of this data was arbitrary or capricious.the council stated a permissible rationale for including data and nothing in the record of the council deliberations on this issue appears capricious or contrary to the evidence.see yakutat,at council drew a rational line by omitting from analysis of which boats to include in pacific cod fishery because those boats omitted as a result not dependent on that one species.
fishermen argues that the council failed adequately to consider data from the two most recent catch years and.fishermen relies on the requirement that fmp must incorporate new information as it becomes available where practicable.b.the secretary concluded that,t he council and nmfs considered more recent and harvest data from the nmfs catch accounting database in reviewing harvest history to illustrate recent harvest trends as that information became available,but it was not available in the same format as the data from through.see.at comment and response.for to,the council had data from federal weekly production reports and alaska department of fish and game fish tickets.the nmfs noted that using a set based on retained harvest from was more accurate than using data from later years because the latter is based on observer estimates.at.to use observer data would be inequitable because certain sectors,such as the afa trawl cp group,are observed more carefully than others who would have to rely on extrapolated data.id.in fact,fish tickets only became available in raw data form for the and years in march,a month prior to the council issuing its proposed allocations.given the time needed to process the information,and the fact that the council deliberations were coming to a close after more than two years,incorporating the new information was not practicable and so need not have been considered under national standard.see b if new information becomes available between initial drafting and nmfs review,it should be incorporated into the final fmp where practicable.emphasis added.
the secretary also contends that the council did take into account data for and,even if those numbers did not form the basis for the final historical catch numbers.as a review of the secretarial review draft of demonstrates,data from and was analyzed.the council noted that the trawl cp sector had a harvest share in that was greater than any other year.id.at.however,the nmfs noted that,despite this increase in harvest,the higher and numbers did not mean that the combined trawl cp sector was catching its entire allocation.at.in part,the council discounted this recent data because of unusually high market demand for pacific cod in those years,as well as the likelihood of competition for pacific cod among sectors in anticipation of this action.because of its prior,fishermen belonged to a sector that could increase its usage in response to these incentives,unlike other sectors.the secretary provided a rational explanation for the council action the council did not wish to reward fishermen sector for their prior by perpetuating it while telling the other sectors they did not need bigger allocations because they had maximized their current allocations.
the record shows that the council also considered the best available sociological data,which indicated that tac percentage needed to be subtracted from other sectors to benefit the coastal alaskan communities.the need to maintain consistency in data and treat all sectors equally is an ample justification for using the data.it was not practicable to include the data.the secretary decision in this regard was neither arbitrary nor capricious.
fishermen point to the council treatment of the katie ann,an afa trawl cp vessel,for the argument that inappropriate political considerations interfered with rational decision making.regulations that are a product of pure political compromise in the absence of scientific justification will generally be viewed as arbitrary and capricious.midwater trawlers dep t of commerce,cir specific allocation of fishing rights to indian tribe not based on scientific rationale in violation of msa.while the council had considered allocating of the tac to the afa trawl cp sector,they increased the quota to this sector to based,in part,on the concern that the katie ann would not be able to maintain its directed cod fishery.in other words,absent an increased allocation,ships like the katie ann would only be able to catch cod as bycatch during their directed pollock fishery.a council member noted there were negotiations and discussions that led to the increased allocation.reading the record as a whole,it is clear that the council considered not just the katie ann in the context of maintaining a directed cod fishery,but the sector as a whole and its historic use.as the secretary points out,however,ample rational and scientific reasons supported the final allocations,which reflected fishermen historic usage.in fact,the agency acted consistently with its original position,which had always been to allocate the afa trawl sector between and and the trawl cp sector between and,based on historical usage.furthermore,the afa trawl cp sector,with a much smaller allocation than the trawl cp sector,was managing to maintain a directed cod fishery because it had less bycatch as a proportion of its pacific cod fishery.under national standard,which requires bycatch to be minimized,the council decision to ensure the continuance of the directed cod fishery had practical conservation and management objectives,not political ones.thus,political concerns did not predominate as they did in midwater trawlers,at,where the final agency decision was pure political compromise,as the agency did not engage in any scientific analysis.
the afa requires that the council shall manage the bsaima in a way to protect vessels from adverse impacts of the directed pollock monopoly,note,afa a fishermen claims has such an adverse impact because it robs the trawl cp sector to benefit the afa trawl cp sector.before,the trawl cps were one sector allocated of the tac.see.at.the afa itself protected the trawl cp sector by allocating to the afa trawl cp sector a sideboard limit of of pacific cod catch.afa b a.effectively replaces this protection by splitting the two sectors and allocating each a set allocation,with the trawl cp sector limited to and the afa trawl cp sector to.the substance of fishermen argument is that causes adverse impact as defined in a because the historic catch of the sector was higher than its allocation whereas the historic catch of the afa sector was lower than its allocation.fishermen argument that they were injured in violation of a ignores the fact that a as defined in the afa permitted greater impact by the afa
