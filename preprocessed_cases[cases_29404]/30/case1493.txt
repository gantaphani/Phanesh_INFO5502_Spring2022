the issue on appeal is whether h of the nuclear waste policy act of,et,repealed or superseded the authority of the nuclear regulatory commission nrc under the atomic energy act of,et,to license the storage of private spent nuclear fuel at privately owned storage facilities.the state of utah and others challenged the nrc jurisdiction to grant a private license to develop and operate a private storage facility on the ground that h barred such facilities.the nrc rejected utah interpretation of h and declined to institute a rulemaking to amend its regulations.utah and others seek review of the order denying the petition to institute a rulemaking,contending that the nrc interpretation is contrary to the plain language of h and to the structure and legislative history of the nuclear waste policy act.we hold that h does not repeal or supersede the nrc authority under the atomic energy act to license private storage facilities,and we therefore deny the petitions for review.
the atomic energy act of aea,et,authorized the nrc to regulate the possession,use,and transfer of the constituent materials of spent nuclear fuel,including special nuclear material,source material,and byproduct material.see id,b see also.while the aea does not specifically refer to the storage or disposal of spent nuclear fuel,it has long been recognized that the aea confers on the nrc authority to license and regulate the storage and disposal of such fuel.see pac.gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm n,d illinois,cir jersey cent.power light township of lacey,cir.pursuant to its aea authority,the nrc promulgated regulations in for licensing onsite and spent nuclear fuel storage facilities for private nuclear generators.see part.
two years later,congress enacted the nuclear waste policy act of nwpa,et,in response to a national problem created by the accumulation of spent nuclear fuel from private nuclear generators,as well as radioactive waste from reprocessing such fuel,activities related to medical research,diagnosis,and treatment,and other sources.id.a.finding inadequate the federal efforts in the past years to devise a permanent solution,id.a,congress established a schedule for siting,construction,and operation of a permanent federal repository subtitle a,id,and developed a federally monitored retrievable storage program in the event the permanent repository was unavailable by the specified deadline subtitle c.id.finding further that the generators and owners of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel have the primary responsibility to provide for,and to pay the costs of,the interim storage of such waste and spent fuel,id.a see also id.a,congress,under subtitle b,id,limited the federal government obligation to assist private nuclear generators with interim storage of spent nuclear fuel.as a precondition of federal interim storage,private generators were required to exhaust onsite options for storage.id.b see also id.a.while the nrc was responsible for the licensing of technology used at the reactor site,id,and for developing the criteria for eligibility,id.g see also id.a b,the department of energy doe was directed to provide,and authorized to enter into contracts for,interim storage of not more than metric tons of capacity,but only until january.id.a b,a.that said,congress provided 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,nothing in this chapter,nuclear waste policy,shall be construed to encourage,authorize,or require the private or federal use,purchase,lease,or other acquisition of any storage facility located away from the site of any civilian nuclear power reactor and not owned by the federal government on january.
the dispute over the effect of h on the nrc authority under the aea to license private storage facilities arises in connection with a lease.the skull valley band of goshute indians band entered into a lease with private fuel storage,llc pfs for the development of a private spent nuclear storage facility on the band reservation located miles west of salt lake city,utah.pursuant to nrc regulations,see,pfs filed a license application,and the nrc atomic safety and licensing board board initiated an adjudicatory licensing proceeding.see in the matter of private fuel storage,llc,nrc hereinafter licensing proceeding.after permitting the state of utah and the ohngo gaudadeh devia ogd,an association consisting primarily of members of the band,to intervene,id.at,the board concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to decide whether h excluded from the nuclear waste management program the creation and use of private storage facilities because such argument constituted an attack on the nrc regulations.id.at.
proceeding to the nrc,utah made two filings in.the first was a suggestion of lack of jurisdiction,claiming that the nrc lacked jurisdiction over pfs license application.utah argued that congress had established in the nwpa a comprehensive national nuclear waste management system for the storage of spent nuclear fuel,and h made clear that the storage of such fuel at privately owned facilities was prohibited.the second filing was a petition to institute rulemaking and to stay licensing proceeding to amend part in light of h repeal or supersession of the nrc authority under the aea to regulate private facilities,and to suspend the licensing proceedings during the rulemaking.the ogd also submitted a brief to the nrc adopting the arguments advanced by utah petitions.
the nrc declined to stay the licensing proceeding.see in the matter of private fuel storage,llc,nrc,wl.the nrc also rejected utah argument that it lacked jurisdiction to issue pfs license,and denied utah request for rulemaking.see in the matter of private fuel storage,llc,nrc,wl hereinafter rulemaking order.the nrc interpreted h to have no effect on its licensing authority under the aea of private storage facilities.id.at.observing that h contains no prohibitory language and is facially neutral on the question of the nrc general aea authority to license private facilities,id.at,the nrc opined that congress intended h to recognize and distinguish,not abrogate,existing provisions of law authorizing spent fuel storage.id.at.as each word has its own significance when read in the context of the whole of subtitle b,the nrc concluded that congress simply limited the scope of h to those programs created under the nwpa itself.id.at.by providing that the nwpa did not authorize the use of a private storage facility,congress limited doe authority.id.at.as doe authority to store spent nuclear fuel originated with the nwpa,h ensured that doe would not take over a private facility to fulfill doe obligations under the nwpa.id.the nrc authority,on the other hand,to license private generators to store spent nuclear fuel,originated with the aea,and hence the nwpa failure to authorize storage at private facilities had no effect on this preexisting authority.id.the nrc pointed out that congress did not need to provide that the nwpa did not encourage or require doe to use private facilities,but did need to use those terms in describing the nwpa conditions on private generators use of federal interim storage.id.subtitle b included several provisions that encourage d private generators to expand onsite storage,see,and through h,the nrc reasoned,congress made clear that such provisions were not also encouraging the expansion of private storage.id.context and legislative background further explained why congress would specify that the nwpa did not require private storage such a requirement appeared early in the legislative process and in prior bills.id.at.by contrast,the nrc noted,utah interpretation of h as repealing or superseding the nrc authority under the aea provided no role for encourage and require to play.id.at.the nrc thus concluded that neither the text of h nor the nwpa structure or legislative history indicated that congress intended to repeal or supersede the nrc authority under the aea to license and regulate private spent fuel storage facilities.id.at.
utah,the ogd,and nine individual goshute members petition for review of the nrc rulemaking order,renewing the arguments before the nrc in challenging the nrc inter
