in this quiet title action brought pursuant to the federal quiet title act,sunrise valley,llc and western rock product together,western rock,are appealing the order entered by the district court dismissing their amended complaint under.b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.having considered the decisions of the united states supreme court in watt western nuclear,d and bedroc,united states,d,we conclude that the district court correctly determined that the sand,gravel,and rock that is located on plaintiffs real property are minerals reserved to the united states under the homestead act of.exercising jurisdiction under,we therefore affirm.
factual background 
in,pursuant to the homestead act,zera hunt homesteaded the property in southern utah located under patent,which underlies the property in question.the patent except ed and reserv ed to the united states all the coal and other minerals in the lands so entered and patented together with the right to prospect for,mine,and remove the same pursuant to the provisions and limitations of the homestead act.aplts app.at.of the property at issue covered by hunt patent,western rock product owns about acres,and sunrise valley owns the balance.
from to the present,the property owned by western rock has been operated by its owners as an open pit sand and gravel removal operation.aplts opening br.at.as the district court explained,western rock continued to exercise ownership over the property by operating an open pit sand and gravel operation until when the united states first claimed an ownership interest in the sand,gravel,and rock on western rock property.aplts app.at.
in,sunrise valley,llc,began purchasing property in the same part of southwestern utah,and it began searching for available sand,gravel,and rock.aplts opening br.at.it subsequently discovered a sand,gravel,and rock pit located on part of the property on which it had options.id.according to western rock,however,sunrise valley has been unable to remove any sand,gravel,and rock from its property because the bureau of land management claims ownership over those common materials.id.at.
in its amended complaint,western rock requested that the district court quiet title in its favor to all of the sand,gravel,and rock that is located on its real property.relying on the supreme court decision in watt western nuclear,d,defendants filed a motion to dismiss under.b,arguing that the united states owns the sand,gravel,and rock that is located on plaintiffs property because those materials are minerals for purposes of the reservation of rights under the srha.
in determining that western rock failed to state a claim,the district court observed 
in watt western nuclear,d,the supreme court unmistakably held that gravel constitutes a mineral reserved to the united states in lands.in western nuclear,the defendant owned lands granted under an srha patent,which reserved to the united states all the coal and other minerals in the land.see id.at.the blm ruled that the defendant committed unintentional trespass by removing cubic yards of gravel from its land.see id.at.the defendant contested the ruling,arguing that gravel was not included within the reservation of minerals to the united states under the srha.id.the supreme court rejected the defendant argument,holding that gravel is a mineral reserved to the united states in lands patented under the srha,id.at,because gravel is mineral in character can be removed from the soil can be used for commercial purposes and there is no reason to suppose gravel was intended to be included in the surface estate.western nuclear,at.the court explained that the congressional purpose of reserving mineral rights under the srha was to facilitate the concurrent development of both surface and subsurface resources.id.at.because ranching and farming do not ordinarily entail the extraction of mineral substances,id.at,and because congress understood that surface lands were patented chiefly for grazing and raising forage crops for the support of a family,id.at,the court found that it was best able to honor the congressional purpose of the srha by construing the mineral reservation to encompass gravel.id.at.
this case is controlled by western nuclear.as in western nuclear,plaintiffs acquired title to land covered by an srha patent,which reserved to the united states all the coal and other minerals in their land.
aplts app.at.
the district court also rejected plaintiffs argument that western nuclear is not applicable because it was essentially overruled by the concurring opinion in bedroc.id.at.as the court explained 
at issue in bedroc was land patented under the pittman underground water act of,a statute pertaining only to nevada that reserved all valuable minerals to the united states on lands patented thereunder.id.at.the bedroc court held that the reservation of minerals under the pittman act did not reserve sand and gravel to the united states since sand and gravel were not valuable mineral s.on this basis,plaintiffs argue that the continued viability of western nuclear is highly questionable.
plaintiffs interpretation of bedroc is misguided.although the petitioners in bedroc asked the supreme court to overrule western nuclear,the plurality refused this request,stating specifically that we decline to overrule our recent western nuclear precedent.bedroc,at.in his concurrence,while justice thomas criticized the holding in western nuclear,he specifically declined to overrule western nuclear b ecause the government identifies significant reliance interests that would be upset by doing so.id.at.the dissent also refused to overrule western nuclear,stating that although the majority in western nuclear may have misinterpreted congress intent,id.at,there does not exist adequate justification for disturbing a decision that has been settled law for two decades.id.thus,the bedroc court unanimously decided not to overrule western nuclear.
at footnote omitted emphasis in original.the district court granted the motion to dismiss and western rock timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
western rock challenges the district court decision,arguing that the property rock,sand,and gravel are not minerals under the homestead act instead,the court decision in bedroc,united states,d,interpreting valuable minerals under another statute is applicable to this case,and would exclude rock,sand,and gravel from the government mineral reservations and unlike in bedroc,no intervening contract rights would be disturbed from such exclusion.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that bedroc s reach is not so expansive,and that,under western nuclear undisturbed holding,the government mineral reservations include rock,sand,and gravel,and that western rock amended complaint is legally insufficient to state a claim for relief under the quiet title act.
standard of review 
because the sufficiency of a complaint is a question of law,we review de novo the district court grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,applying the same standards as the district court.moore guthrie,cir.those standards require that we must accept as true all facts,and construe all reasonable allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.united states.supreme court,cir.the court function on a rule b motion is not to weigh potential evidence that the parties might present at trial,but to assess whether the plaintiff complaint alone is legally sufficient to state a claim for which relief may be granted.sutton utah state sch.for the deaf blind,cir quotation omitted.
b.the homestead act of 
all land patents issued by the united states under the homestead act are subject to an express reservation of mineral rights in favor of the united states.the homestead act,the last of the great homestead acts,provided for the settlement of homesteads on lands the surface of which was chiefly valuable for grazing and raising crops and not susceptible of irrigation from any known source of water supply.western nuclear,at.quoting ed.congress purpose was to bifurcate the surface and mineral rights to facilitate concurrent development.id.at.it would,thu
