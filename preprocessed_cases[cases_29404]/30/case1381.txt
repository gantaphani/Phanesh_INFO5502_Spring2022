this case centers around the fate of stiltsville,a collection of stilted buildings located in biscayne bay,off the southern coast of key biscayne,florida.these buildings presently rest within the boundaries of biscayne national park,and accordingly the national park service nps is charged with their administration.however,in,prior to the assumption by the nps of responsibility for their management the structures were leased by the state of florida to individual occupants for year terms.these leases expressly provided that upon their expiration on july,the stiltsville structures would be removed.as this deadline approached,however,the lessees of these buildings successfully undertook to extend their exclusive occupancy.
on may,appellants the national parks conservation association npca and tropical audubon society tas responded to the lessees efforts by filing this action in the united states district court for the southern district of florida.they alleged that the nps failure to discontinue the exclusive private use of the stiltsville structures violated the national park service organic act organic act,et,the biscayne national park general management plan general management plan,the national environmental protection act nepa,et,several of the administrative regulations that attend the organic act and the nepa and the equal protection component of the fifth amendment.with the exception of the equal protection claim,which they brought under the due process clause of the fifth amendment,npca and tas advanced each of their claims under the administrative procedures act apa,a.appellants sought to compel the nps to either remove the structures or make them accessible to the public.
the district court granted summary judgment to the nps on all of appellants claims.it reasoned that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the apa because decisions whether and how to comply with the organic act,general management plan,nepa and their implementing regulations are vested entirely within the nps discretion.accordingly,the court applied the apa committed to agency discretion exception to the rule providing for judicial review of administrative action.see a heckler chaney,d.the district court also held that appellants lacked standing to advance their fifth amendment equal protection claim.npca and tas appeal both of these holdings.
after thorough review,we find that the district court conclusion that appellants apa claims were was correct,as was the entry of final summary judgment for appellee on appellants equal protection claim.however,we base both of these results on different grounds than were relied on by the district court.see lucas grainger,cir noting that we may affirm the district court judgment on any ground that finds support in the record quoting jaffke dunham,d.in particular,we conclude that we lack subject matter jurisdiction over appellants apa claims because the nps has not taken any action the future management of stiltsville that can be considered final within the meaning of.furthermore,although npca and tas enjoy standing to pursue their equal protection claim,that claim is unavailing on its merits.
stiltsville is a collection of structures constructed on stilts in the shallow waters of biscayne bay south of key biscayne,florida.the buildings are largely weekend homes,restaurants and nightclubs that were built by wealthy individuals beginning in the.by there were stilted structures in the bay,and by the there were such structures in relatively close proximity to each other,and this collection of buildings became known as stiltsville.over the years,the majority of these structures have been destroyed by hurricanes,and today only remain in existence.
during the,the florida department of natural resources asserted its jurisdiction over the submerged lands on which stiltsville rests,and issued to private individuals renewable leases for the structures at nominal rent.subsequently,in congress established biscayne national monument,the northern boundary of which was approximately five miles south of the stiltsville structures.congress created the monument to preserve and protect for the education,inspiration,recreation,and enjoyment of present and future generations a rare combination of terrestrial,marine,and amphibious life in a tropical setting of great natural beauty,stat.in,the state of florida replaced the leases with exclusive campsite leases that expired on july,and set the rent at per year.these agreements expressly provided that the lessees forfeited all rights to the buildings other than those provided for in the leases,and that the structures were to be removed by the lessor upon the leases expiration.
in,congress passed the biscayne national park enabling act enabling act,et,which converted biscayne national monument into biscayne national park.the park encompasses acres that the monument did not,including the area in which stiltsville is located.the enabling act directed the park service to preserve and administer the park in accordance with the provisions of the organic act,and to develop a revised management plan for the new park.accordingly,in the nps issued t he general management plan,development concept plan,wilderness study and environmental assessment for biscayne national park.this plan was prepared with public notice and comment after the completion of environmental review as required by the nepa,and it remains in effect.the plan states that the stiltsville buildings and surrounding area will be managed as a natural area for the protection of the natural resources within the park,that the leases pertaining to the structures will expire on july,and can not be renewed,and that the buildings are to be removed upon the expiration of the leases.however,the plan does not specify the method or exact timing of the removal.in,florida deeded to the federal government the submerged lands on which stiltsville sits,an action that resulted in the nps becoming landlord for the leaseholders 
from the execution of the campsite leases in until near the end of the year lease term,the structures were occupied without incident.however,as the july,expiration date approached,the leaseholders undertook a series of actions aimed at preserving their exclusive use of the buildings.they twice filed with the keeper of the national register applications to have the buildings listed in the national register of historic places.these applications were opposed by the nps and both ultimately were denied.then,on june,with the threat of a lawsuit looming,appellee and the leaseholders entered into a standstill agreement which provided for the continued private occupancy of the buildings until december.on november,this agreement was extended through november.subsequently,bills were introduced in both the and congresses to modify the borders of biscayne national park to exclude stiltsville,see,cong.sess,cong.sess,but neither of these measures passed.
as the november,extended deadline neared,the stiltsville occupants filed two separate actions in the united states district court for the southern district of florida in an effort to forestall the termination of their leases.these were captioned bay chateau,united states,and miami springs power boat club united states,and in each the plaintiff leaseholders claimed that the nps lacked authority under the leases to evict them.on november,the district court entered a temporary restraining order preventing the nps from moving to evict the stiltsville residents,and then on december,the court converted the tro into a preliminary injunction that remained in place until april.that same month,while these suits were pending,congress passed an appropriations rider extending the second standstill agreement until march.see,stat.
on march,the parties settled the miami springs power boat club and bay chateau cases.the settlement agreement required the nps to forebear from evicting the leaseholders until april.in addition,the agreement expressly provided that it does not constitute a transfer or conveyance by the united states of any right,title,or interest to the stiltsville occupants.
against this background,on may,the national parks conservation association and the tropical audubon society filed this suit under the apa,a,and the due process clause of the fifth amendment.they alleged that the nps repeated acquiescence in the standstill agreements and other failures to evict the stiltsville leaseholders upon the expiration of the campsite leases were tantamount to the grant of an exclusive lease to the buildings occupants.appellants claimed that this inaction by the nps violated the organic act,the general management plan,the nepa,several administrative regulations that attend these provisions and the equal protection component of the fifth amendment due process clause.the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment,and although the district court denied appellants motion it granted summary judgment in favor of the nps.the court reasoned that although the apa provides for judicial review of agency action that is final or that is specifically made reviewable by statute,there are two notable statutory exceptions to this general proposition.under a,judicial review is unavailable where statutes preclude judicial review or agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.the district court quickly concluded that judicial review was not prohibited under any of the substantive statutes that plaintiffs alleged the nps to have violated,which left as potentially applicable only the exception codified at a.
in heckler,the supreme court held that judicial review is not to be had under a if the statute in question is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency exercise of discretion.at.at.relying on heckler exposition of the committed to agency discretion exception,the district court in this case determined that none of the statutory provisions that allegedly had been violated by the nps contained a standard that was sufficiently definite to permit meaningful judicial review.in fact,the district court held that congress delegated the entire area of parks management to the secretary of the interior.district court opinion at quoting maloney sheehan.although the court acknowledge d appellants contention that the organic act supplies a meaningful standard for judicial review,it held that this act merely establishes a series of general directives to promote and regulate the national parks.the organic act,the court continued,is silent as to the means by which this promotion and regulation are to be realized.the district court also noted that the only discernible congressional policy regarding the stiltsville leases is consistent with the nps inaction,as evidenced by congress direction to extend the standstill agreement until march.based on this analysis,the court concluded that neither the organic act,the general management plan nor the nepa supplies a meaningful standard against which to review appellees failure to evict the stiltsville occupants.as such,it held that appellants claims sounding in the violation of these statutes were unreviewable by a court.as for their equal protection claim,the district court held that npca and tas lacked standing to vindicate the interest of all members of the public in fully enjoying biscayne national park.accordingly,it determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this claim.
based on the foregoing analysis,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the nps,and it is from this order that npca and tas presently appeal.on appeal,npca and tas argue that this case is readily distinguishable from heckler,where the fda was held to have absolute discretion whether to undertake enforcement activities,as the nps is not afforded discretion under the organic act,general management plan or nepa.as a corollary of this argument,appellants note that the exception codified at a is narrow in scope,and contend that these enactments do provide a meaningful and altogether sufficient standard against which to review appellees inaction.they also assert that the district court erred by holding that they lack standing to advance their fifth amendment equal protection claim,as they seek not to vindicate the rights of the public at large,but rather of their membership specifically.
in response,appellees advance three primary arguments.first,seeking to analogize their inaction to the inaction of the fda that was at issue in heckler,they characterize their failure to terminate the stiltsville leases as a wholly discretionary decision not to exert their enforcement power.as such,they say,this decision is entirely unreviewable by a court under a.second,appellees assert that judicial review may be had only of final agency actions,and that their decision not to evict the stiltsville leaseholders is.finally,they contend that appellants claims are not ripe.although the nps does not defend the district court determination that appellants lack standing to advance their fifth amendment equal protection claim,it argues that this claim is unavailing on its merits.
before evaluating the central issues in this lawsuit,we observe that since the inception of this action the nps has taken several meaningful steps toward the implementation of a permanent management plan for the stiltsville structures.in particular,appellee asserts that as the bay chateau and miami springs power boat club litigation proceeded it began a comprehensive and process for reviewing the management of park resources,including stiltsville,and evaluating potential management options for the future.the national park service observes that it published in the federal register a notice of intent to prepare a new management plan for biscayne national park and an attendant draft environmental impact statement deis.see intent to prepare a draft environmental impact statement for the stiltsville management plan,biscayne national park.in this notice the nps described its forthcoming plan as guid ing public use and management of the buildings,id.at,with the attendant deis evaluating the potential environmental impacts associated with the management options being considered.the nps also points to its establishment of a member committee which,notably,included a representative of tas to review alternatives for the future use and management of the stiltsville structures.this committee held several public meetings during and,see meeting notice,may,announcing a may,public hearing notice of intent,june,noting that public hearings on stiltsville had been conducted on september and,and ultimately submitted a report to the nps.
most importantly,roughly weeks prior to oral argument in this case appellee promulgated both the planned amendment to the general management plan,in which it outlines four management alternatives for stiltsville,and a deis that evaluates each of these options.see notice of availability,announcing the availability of these documents biscayne national park general management plan amendment and draft environmental impact statement,available at http last visited.the period for public comment on these alternatives and the deis expired on february,and appellee presently is reviewing the public feedback as a preface to making a final decision regarding stiltsville future.at oral argument we asked the parties to submit briefs proposing a timeframe for an ultimate,binding decision as to the prospective management of the structures.notably,the nps says that it anticipates making a final decision by m,and appellants have indicated this timeframe is a reasonable one from their perspective.
against this background,we address the merits of the parties arguments.
we review a summary judgment ruling de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.see johnson bd.of regents,cir.in conducting this examination,we view the materials presented and all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the party.see adickes kress,d.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.the burden of demonstrating the satisfaction of this standard lies with the movant,who must present pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any that establish the absence of any genuine,material factual dispute.id.
as a general rule,actions taken by federal administrative agencies are subject to judicial review.abbott labs.gardner,d,overruled on other grounds,califano sanders,d.however,as the district court noted,under a federal courts lack jurisdiction over administrative action where statutes preclude judicial review or agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.notably,these are not the only circumstances under which federal courts can not review an agency acts as is especially relevant in the present context,federal jurisdiction is similarly lacking when the administrative action in question is not final within the meaning of.see independent petroleum ass of am.babbitt,t he requirement of a final agency action has been considered jurisdictional.if the agency action is not final,the court therefore can not reach the merits of the dispute.quoting drg funding sec.of hous.urban.this section provides in pertinent part that a gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review.a preliminary,procedural,or intermediate agency action or ruling not directly reviewable is subject to review on the review of the final agency action.
in bennett spear,the supreme court delineated the contours of the final agency action requirement.it held 
as a general matter,two conditions must be satisfied for agency action to be final first,the action must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.and second,the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow.
d quoting chicago air lines,waterman.and port of boston marine terminal ass rederiaktiebolaget transatlantic,d see also darby cisneros,d t he finality requirement is concerned with whether the initial decisionmaker has arrived at a definitive position on the issue that inflicts an actual,concrete injury quoting williamson county reg l planning comm hamilton bank of johnson city,d franklin massachusetts,d the core question in the finality determination is whether the agency has completed its decisionmaking process,and whether the result of that process is one that will directly affect the parties.by contrast,the supreme court has defined a nonfinal agency order as one that does not itself adversely affect complainant but only affects his rights adversely on the contingency of future administrative action.american airlines,herman,cir quoting rochester.united states.
in bennett,which featured a challenge to a position set forth in a federal fish and wildlife service biological opinion,the supreme court distinguished the case at bar from two previous decisions in which the court had held the administrative action in question to be under.see at.at distinguishing franklin,d and dalton specter,d.it said 
in the former case franklin,the agency action in question was the secretary of commerce presentation to the president of a report tabulating the results of the decennial census our holding that this did not constitute final agency action was premised on the observation that the report carried no direct consequences and served more like a tentative recommendation than a final and binding determination.and in the latter case dalton,the agency action in question was submission to the president of base closure recommendations by the secretary of defense and the defense base closure and realignment commission our holding that this was not final agency action followed from the fact that the recommendations were in no way binding on the president,who had absolute discretion to accept or reject them.
id.internal citations and punctuation omitted.the court concluded in bennett that final agency action requirement was satisfied in that case because u nlike the reports in franklin and dalton,which were purely advisory and in no way affected the legal rights of the relevant actors,the biological opinion at issue here has direct and appreciable legal consequences.at.at.
upon applying these general principles to the facts of this case,we conclude that the nps failure to discontinue the private occupancy of the stiltsville structures can not be considered final agency action within the meaning of.preliminarily,we note that although appellee may have acted less than expeditiously in its planning for stiltsville future since the expiration of the campsite leases on july,not all of the blame for the delay in implementing a management plan can be properly attributed to the nps.indeed,from november,through april,appellee was expressly barred by judicial order and subsequently barred by both judicial order and legislative mandate from disturbing the stiltsville occupants exclusive access to the structures.even had the nps been disposed to act during this period it was forbidden from doing so.
moreover,as we have explained at some length,the nps is actively planning the prospective management of stiltsville.specifically,it has crafted four management alternatives for stiltsville and a draft eis that evaluates each of these options.see biscayne national park general management plan amendment and draft environmental impact statement,available at.this document is pages long,and plainly reflects a great deal of care and effort in its formulation.we find it notable that none of the four options being considered provide for the continued private occupancy of the structures.finally,we again observe that appellee has assured this court that its decisionmaking process will be completed by.simply put,although to date it has made no final decision,it is indisputable that the nps is actively engaged in planning,and has set an anticipated date for resolving,stiltsville future,and none of the management alternatives under active consideration would maintain the status quo that appellants find to be objectionable.
under these circumstances,we can not conclude that the nps has taken any final action or engaged in a pattern of inaction that can be said to mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking process or to be one by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow.bennett,at.at citations omitted see also darby,at.at holding that administrative action will be considered final only if the agency has arrived at a definitive position on the issue in question citation omitted.it is beyond any doubt that further administrative action is forthcoming one of the four proposed management alternatives will soon be selected and implemented.as such,nothing that the nps has done or refused to do to date can be deemed the consummation of its decisionmaking process.see,city of san diego whitman,cir holding that an epa opinion letter did not constitute final agency action with respect to the appellant then unfiled application for renewal of a modified national pollutant discharge elimination system permit because there were several administrative steps that necessarily would be taken before the application,once filed,would be conclusively approved or denied mobil exploration producing,of interior,cir holding that a united states minerals management service letter did not represent final agency action because it served only to initiate further proceedings by which the mms could conclusively determine whether plaintiffs owed royalties.
similarly,because the agency has done nothing beyond establishing a committee to review alternatives for the future use and management of stiltsville,formulating management options and submitting those plans for public comment,no rights or obligations have been fixed by its behavior,nor has it taken or refused to take action so as to impose any legal consequence on any party.it has generated prospective governance proposals,nothing more and nothing less.this is precisely the sort of tentative behavior characterized by the supreme court in bennett as falling short of the final agency action bar.at.at.
a telling comparison may be made between the facts of this case and those at issue in whitman am.trucking ass ns,d.whitman featured a challenge to the epa revisions to its national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter and ozone.the epa argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the challenge because these standards did not represent reviewable final agency action.in rejecting this contention,the supreme court said 
only if the epa has rendered its last word on the matter in question,is its action final and thus reviewable.that standard is satisfied here.the epa decisionmaking process,which began with the proposal and continued with the reception of public comments,concluded when the agency,in light of these comments,and in conjunction with a corresponding directive from the white house,adopted the interpretation at issue here.since that interpretation issued,the epa has refused in subsequent rulemakings to reconsider it,explaining to disappointed commenters that its earlier decision was conclusive.
id.quoting harrison ppg,d other citations omitted.in the present case,by contrast,the nps has yet to select any of the four management plans and,indeed,remains busily engaged in the process of charting the course of stiltsville future.although the nps has completed its receipt of public commentary on its four alternatives,as the epa had in whitman,it has yet to adopt one of them.thus,the critical step that rendered the epa standards reviewable in whitman is absent here.nothing remotely resembling the nps final word on this matter has been rendered.
to the extent that appellants suggest that the length of the nps inaction in this case renders that inaction reviewable,we are unpersuaded.we agree,as a general matter,that an administrative agency can not legitimately evade judicial review forever by continually postponing any action and then challenging federal jurisdiction on final agency action grounds.see,cobell norton,as this court has noted in the past,where an agency is under an unequivocal statutory duty to act,failure so to act constitutes,in effect,an affirmative act that triggers final agency action review.were it otherwise,agencies could effectively prevent judicial review of their policy determinations by simply refusing to take final action.citations and internal punctuation omitted sierra club thomas,noting that to deem unreviewable an agency withholding of action that would be reviewable under the apa could be to permit the agency to forever evade our review.
in this case,however,the nps has not forestalled decisive action regarding stiltsville future such as would render its inaction reviewable.as we have explained,not all of the delay in implementing a management plan is attributable to the nps between november,and april,appellee was explicitly barred by judicial order and legislative mandate from taking any action with respect to the stiltsville buildings.additionally,as we also have discussed,the nps has promulgated,and received public comment on,four management alternatives for the structures and a deis pertaining to each of these options.finally and notably,appellee assures us that it will reach a final decision regarding the future of the stiltsville buildings by of this year.thus,the nps is not presently withh olding or delay ing final action at all.moreover,it is evident that the plan that the nps ultimately adopts will satisfy the concerns raised by appellants none of the four alternatives that appellee is considering provide for the continued private occupancy of the stiltsville buildings.
in sum,the nps has has not process of selecting and implementing a management plan for the buildings that comprise stiltsville.because appellee has not completed this undertaking,the actions that it has taken to date can not be deemed the consummation of its decisionmaking process,and accordingly the bennett test for final agency action is unsatisfied in this case.by contrast,because the nps is albeit after a lengthy period of inactivity presently engaged in the aforementioned planning process,we are not confronted with reviewable administrative inaction.accordingly,we lack subject matter jurisdiction over all of appellants apa claims,those alleging violations of the organic act,nepa,general management plan and numerous regulations that attend these provisions.
we stress,however,that our opinion should not be construed as tacit approval of any future inaction on the part of the nps the formulation and implementation of a final management plan for the stiltsville buildings.we agree with the parties that appellee proposed decisionmaking timeframe is reasonable,seeing no reason barring any unforeseen external influence,another judicial or legislative decree or some emergency why a final management plan for stiltsville can not be decisively implemented by the start of june of this year.should this matter not be finally resolved by then,npca and tas may renew their apa claims.
based on these conclusions,we find it unnecessary to address appellee contentions regarding ripeness or the applicability of a in this case.indeed,we offer no opinion as to the merits of the district court holding regarding the apa committed to agency discretion provision.however,because the final agency action requirement implicates federal subject matter jurisdiction,the district court entry of summary judgment for the nps on appellants apa claims was improper as a procedural matter.this is so because i f the court has no jurisdiction,it has no power to enter a judgment on the merits and must dismiss the action.charles alan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed see also whitt sherman int l,cir holding that because federal jurisdiction can not be found,the district court entry of summary judgment was a nullity.instead of entering summary judgment in favor of appellee,the district court should have dismissed appellants apa claims,sua sponte if necessary,pursuant to.h.accordingly,although we agree with the court conclusion regarding the justiciability of these claims,although for wholly different reasons,we vacate its order of summary judgment and remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss these claims pursuant to.h,which provides that w henever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter,the court shall dismiss the action.see also.b providing for the dismissal of an action upon motion of a party where the court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter of the dispute.
notably,however,this does not dispose of appellants equal protection claim because this claim is brought directly under the due process clause of the fifth amendment,see davis passman,d,and not under the apa,the final agency action requirement is inapplicable to it.see generally ukiah valley med.ctr.ftc,cir a finding of finality,or of an applicable exception,is essential when the court reviewing authority depends on one of the many statutes permitting appeal only of final agency action,such as of the apa.accordingly,we review the district court order of summary judgment for appellee on this claim separately.
ultimately,we conclude that although the district court erred by finding that appellants lack standing to advance their equal protection that federal subject matter jurisdiction consequently exists over this challenge is unavailing on its merits.thus,we affirm the district court summary judgment as to this claim,albeit on grounds other than those on which it relied.
