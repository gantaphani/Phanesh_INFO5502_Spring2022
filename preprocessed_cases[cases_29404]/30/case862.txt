this case concerns the national park service decision to permit the continued use of motorized rafts and support equipment in grand canyon national park.plaintiffs contend that such motorized activities impair the wilderness character of the canyon and that the park service decision violates its management policies and various federal statutes.plaintiffs asked the district court to set aside the decision under the administrative procedure act apa.for reasons explained in this opinion,plaintiffs have not satisfied the high threshold required to set aside federal agency actions under the apa 
background.
grand canyon national park park was established by congress in and expanded in.the park consists of more than million acres located on the southern end of the colorado plateau in arizona.
the park includes a stretch of the colorado river referred to in this order as the colorado river corridor or the corridor.the park service regulates the colorado river corridor through a colorado river management plan management plan.in november of,the park service issued a final environmental impact statement feis for the management plan.on february,the park service issued a record of decision rod that adopted and approved the management plan.the management plan permits the continued use of motorized rafts,generators,and helicopters in the colorado river corridor.
plaintiffs river runners for wilderness,rock the earth,wilderness watch,and living rivers constitute a coalition of organizations committed to protecting and restoring the grand canyon wilderness character and unique natural resources and ensuring fair access to it.plaintiffs filed this action against the park service and various individual defendants 
the district court subsequently permitted two private organizations to intervene in the canyon river outfitters association,which consists of commercial operators of motorized and rafts in the colorado river corridor,and grand canyon private boaters association,which consists of private rafters and kayakers of the corridor collectively,intervenors.
following exchanges of information and compilation of the administrative record,plaintiffs,defendants,and intervenors all filed motions for summary judgment.the district court held oral argument on october.
park service management of the colorado river corridor.
the waters of the colorado river originate in the mountains of colorado,wyoming,and utah and run miles to the gulf of california.the colorado is the longest and largest river in the southwestern united states.once in the grand canyon,the river flows some to feet below the rim of the canyon through cliffs,spires,pyramids,and successive escarpments of colored stone.access to the bottom of the grand canyon can be gained only by hiking,riding mules,or floating the river.those floating the river typically do so in rubber rafts,rubber rafts,dories,or kayaks.floating the river through the grand canyon is considered one of america great outdoor adventures and includes some of the largest rapids in the united states.
use of the colorado river corridor increased substantially after glen canyon dam was completed in and produced a relatively steady flow through the canyon.because of this increased use,the park service initiated a series of river planning and management efforts,culminating in a december river use plan.the plan concluded that motorized craft should be of use in the grand canyon.the plan also concluded that commercial user days and user days would be allocated for the season,but that commercial use would be scaled down to user days by a draft environmental impact statement concluded that t he use of motors should be eliminated as soon as possible from the river environment and that t he propose d elimination of motorized trips will hav e a positive environmental impact.
the park service initiated a colorado river research program in to examine,among other things,the impact of motorized activities on the river.in september of,the park service issued a document suggesting that the use of motors is contrary to established health and safety standards and again opining that the use of motorized craft should be eliminated.the document noted that n travel is more compatible with wilderness experience and that m otor noise levels may have adverse effects on pilot performance,resulting in potential safety hazards.the park service was unable,however,to document any difference in numbers and degree of injuries between the two types of craft.
the park service released the first management plan in december of.use of motorized watercraft between lees ferry and separation canyon was to be phased out over a period.the management plan stated that such a was consistent with the objective of the master plan,corresponded with the park wilderness proposal,and was based on the extensive colorado river research project for the grand canyon.the management plan increased the allocated commercial user days from per year to and increased the allocated user days from to.in september,the park service proposed that the colorado river corridor be designated as potential wilderness and,once motorboat use was,as wilderness.
congress countermanded the management plan in a appropriations bill for the department of the interior.the bill prohibited the use of appropriated funds for the implementation of any management plan for the colorado river within the park which reduces the number of user days or for commercial motorized watercraft excursions.members of congress sent a letter to the park service expressing their wish that the management plan be amended to accommodate the level and pattern of commercial,motorized watercraft access while at the same time protecting the increased allocation which the plan provides.the park service subsequently revised the management plan to retain motorized use and the increase in that had been intended as compensation for the of motors,resulting in more motorized use of the river.
the park service issued a second management plan in.the management plan was similar to the revised management plan.it included the same allocation of user days for commercial and boaters,but increased the number of launches.
b.the management plan.
planning for the management plan began in with the solicitation of public comments and a series of public workshops in oregon,utah,and arizona.after this process was suspended and restarted following the filing of two lawsuits,the park service published in the federal register,on june,a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement for a revised management plan.seven additional public meetings and stakeholder workshops were held in colorado,utah,arizona,nevada,maryland,and california.more than one thousand people attended the meetings and the park service received more than written submissions.
in the fall of,the park service released for public review a draft environmental impact statement deis for the revised management plan.the deis presented eight alternatives alternatives for managing the river from lees ferry to diamond creek,a stretch of miles referred to in this order as the lees ferry segment and five alternatives alternatives for managing the river from diamond creek to lake mead,a stretch of miles referred to in this order as the lower gorge.the alternatives included motorized and options.because of the complexity of the deis and the level of public interest,the park service extended the standard comment period for one additional month.the park service also hosted public meetings in colorado,utah,washington,nevada,arizona,and california.the park service received some written submissions,including approximately substantive and comments on the deis.the park service coded,organized,analyzed,and responded to the substantive comments,and modified the deis where it felt modifications were warranted.
the park service received comments from a coalition of groups representing both commercial and boaters of the colorado river often at odds with each other on issues of river management.the coalition included intervenors,american whitewater,and grand canyon river runners association.the coalition supported equal allocation of river time between commercial and boaters and the continued authorization of appropriate levels of motorized use.
in november,the park service issued the final environmental impact statement.the feis addressed the same alternatives discussed in the deis,with some modifications to alternatives h and,and expressed a preference for modified alternative h for the lees ferry segment and modified alternative for the lower gorge.the selected alternatives permitted the use of motorized rafts,generators for emergencies and inflating rafts,and helicopters to make passenger exchanges at the whitmore helipad.as noted above,in february,the park service issued a rod that formally adopted modified alternatives h and for the management plan.
ii.the district court task.
plaintiffs argue that the management plan is unlawful and should be set aside.the court task is not to make its own judgment about whether motorized rafts should be allowed in the colorado river corridor.congress has delegated that responsibility to the park service.the court responsibility is narrower to determine whether the park service management plan comports with the requirements of the apa,et.
the apa does not allow the court to overturn an agency decision because it disagrees with the decision or with the agency conclusions about environmental impacts.yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,citing kleppe sierra club.an agency decision may be set aside only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.the standard is deferential.the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency concerning the wisdom or prudence of the agency action.or.envtl.council kunzman,cir.
in conducting an apa review,the court must determine whether the agency decision is founded on a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made and whether the agency has committed a clear error of judgment.cattle growers ass fish wildlife,cir.the agency action need only be a reasonable,not the best or most reasonable,decision.wildlife fed.burford,cir.
plaintiffs assert that the management plan is arbitrary and capricious under the apa because it violates the park service own policies,the national park service concessions management and improvement act concessions act,and the national park service organic act organic act.each of these arguments will be addressed separately,and this opinion is precedential only as to those issues appealed.
iii.compliance with park service policies.
enforceability of the policies.
even though congress has never acted on the park service recommendation to designate a substantial portion of the park as wilderness,plaintiffs claim that the park service own policies give rise to a legally binding obligation to maintain the wilderness character of the park.plaintiffs claim that the park service has breached this legal duty by authorizing the continued use of motorized activities in the management plan.defendants and intervenors argue that the park service policies do not have the force and effect of law and therefore may not be enforced against the park service in this action.
in their motion for summary judgment,plaintiffs identified three policies that allegedly create binding obligations on the park service the master plan,the general management plan,and the park service management policies the policies.two of these master plan and the general management not on appeal.plaintiffs instead focus on the policies,arguing that they are binding because they are written in mandatory language,were mentioned in the federal register,and have been found binding in utah wilderness alliance park,d.
in united states eclectus parrots,cir,we established a test for determining when agency pronouncements have the force and effect of law 
to have the force and effect of law,enforceable against an agency in federal court,the agency pronouncement must prescribe substantive interpretive rules,general statements of policy or rules of agency organization,procedure or conform to certain procedural requirements.to satisfy the first requirement the rule must be legislative in nature,affecting individual rights and obligations to satisfy the second,it must have been promulgated pursuant to a specific statutory grant of authority and in conformance with the procedural requirements imposed by congress.
id.at internal quotes and citations omitted.
the policies fail the first part of the eclectus parrots test because they do not purport to prescribe substantive rules.as the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit recently held with respect to these very policies while the text of the policies on occasion uses mandatory language,such as will and must,the document as a whole does not read as a set of rules.it lacks precision in its directives,and there is no indication of how the enumerated policies are to be prioritized.the wilderness soc y norton.
the text of the policies makes clear that they are intended only to provide guidance within the park service,not to establish rights in the public generally.the introduction describes the policies as a basic policy document,as a guidance document,and as a statement of policy designed to provide park service management and staff with clear and continuously updated information that will help them manage parks and programs effectively.that the policies are not intended to have the same force as binding park service regulations is made clear by the introduction explanation that existing,park service regulations will trump inconsistent provisions in the policies until such time as the regulations are formally revised through the rulemaking procedure.
equally significant,the introduction to the policies provides that park service management can choose to waive or modify the policies adherence to policy is mandatory unless specifically waived or modified in writing by the secretary,the assistant secretary,or the director.waivers and modifications will be considered on a basis,the policies explain.needless to say,policy statements that may be waived or modified by an agency can hardly be said to have the binding force of law.as the circuit noted,this language does not evidence an intent on the part of the agency to limit its discretion and create enforceable rights.rather,the agency top administrators clearly reserved for themselves unlimited discretion to order and reorder all management priorities.wilderness soc y,at.
nor do the policies purport to create substantive individual rights or obligations for persons or entities outside the park service.the policies set forth priorities,practices,and procedures to be followed by park service personnel in administering the national park system.in the words of eclectus parrots,they are interpretive rules,general statements of policy or rules of agency organization,procedure or practice.at quotes and citations omitted.see also united states alameda gateway,cir agency rule did not have the force or effect of law in part because i t was not intended to create substantive rights in third parties moore.apfel,cir agency provision did not satisfy the eclectus parrots test,as it creates no substantive rights and instead provides agency staff with internal procedures chrysler brown,whether an agency pronouncement affects individual rights and obligations is an important touchstone for distinguishing those rules that may be binding or have the force of law internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the policies also fail the second part of the eclectus parrots test.the apa requires that publication or service of a substantive rule shall be made not less than days before its effective date.d.the policies were not published in the federal register.the park service did publish a notice of the availability of a draft of the policies and a notice of new policy,but never published the policies themselves.see.what is more important,the policies were never published in the code of federal regulations.this suggests that the park service did not intend to announce substantive rules enforceable by third parties in federal court.see radio servs,espy,cir stating,in its determination that two agency documents did not satisfy the eclectus parrots test,that n either document is published in the federal register or the code of federal regulations.the circuit found this lack of publication particularly noteworthy in concluding that the policies are not substantive law.wilderness soc y,at see also brock cathedral bluffs shale oil,the real dividing point between regulations and general statements of policy is publication in the code of federal regulations.
this conclusion is bolstered by the park service own characterization of the policies.in its federal register announcement that a draft of the policies was available for public comment,the park service explained that park superintendents,planners,and other park service employees use management policies as a reference source when making decisions that will affect units of the national park system.a reference source,of course,is not the same as binding substantive law.
in sum,the policies are not enforceable against the park service in this action.the policies do not prescribe substantive rules,nor were they promulgated in conformance with the procedures of the apa.eclectus parrots,at.the court therefore may not set aside the management plan because it fails to comply with portions of the policies requiring the park service to treat the colorado river corridor as wilderness or potential wilderness.
plaintiffs chevron cases.
plaintiffs argue that the lack of formal rulemaking does not prevent the policies from having the force and effect of law.for support,plaintiffs rely primarily on united states mead,and utah wilderness alliance,d.plaintiffs in mead challenged a tariff ruling by the united states customs service.plaintiffs in utah wilderness alliance challenged a decision by the park service to ban motorized vehicles in a portion of canyonlands national park.in both cases the courts were required to decide whether the agency decisions were entitled to deference under chevron natural resources defense council.
the supreme court explained chevron deference in this manner when congress has expressed an expectation that an agency will speak with the force of law and resolve ambiguities or fill gaps in statutory law,a reviewing court has no business rejecting an agency exercise of its generally conferred authority simply because the agency chosen resolution seems unwise,but is obligated to accept the agency position if congress has not previously spoken to the point at issue and the agency interpretation is reasonable.mead,at citations omitted.in short,courts are not to interfere with reasonable agency decisions rendered within areas where congress has authorized the agencies to act.
among other considerations,a court applying the chevron doctrine asks whether an agency decision is intended by congress to have the force of law.the supreme court noted in mead that the existence of formal rulemaking is a strong indicator of such authority.the supreme court went on to explain,however,that as significant as rulemaking is in pointing to chevron authority,the want of that procedure here does not decide the case,for we have sometimes found reasons for chevron deference even when no such administrative formality was required and none was afforded.id.at.the district court in utah wilderness alliance relied on this language and found that chevron deference was due the park service decision to ban motorized vehicles in canyonlands even though the decision was based on the policies that were not adopted through formal rulemaking.d at.plaintiffs rely on this holding and the language from mead to argue that the same policies should have the force and effect of law in this case.
there is a difference,however,between application of the chevron doctrine in suwa and the question to be decided in this case.the plaintiffs in suwa argued that the policies were not entitled to deference and that a decision based on them should be set aside.the district court relied on the chevron doctrine to conclude that the policies provided a sound basis for deference to the park shield for the agency decision concerning the proper administration of canyonlands national park.plaintiffs in this case seek an opposite use the same policies as a sword to set aside park service decisions concerning the proper administration of grand canyon national park.
chevron analysis does not control this case.whether an agency decision falls within the scope of activity intended by congress to resolve ambiguities or fill gaps in the governing statutes and therefore is entitled to deference in the courts is a different question than whether an agency decision becomes binding law that gives outside parties the right to enforce the decision against the agency in court.the first question asks whether the agency has acted within the realm and with the expertise congress intended.the second focuses on the substance and form of the agency action and asks whether the agency intended to promulgate binding law for itself and the outside world.this case presents the second question to be decided under eclectus parrots.as explained above,the policies are not enforceable against the park service under eclectus parrots.
c.the policies do not render the management plan arbitrary and capricious.
citing ecology center,austin,cir,and related cases,plaintiffs alternatively argue that the management plan is arbitrary and capricious even if the policies do not have the force and effect of law.we held in ecology center that the forest service could not disregard a soil standard when the forest service own environmental impact statement purported to comply with the standard.to disregard the standard,we held,would render the environmental impact statement misleading and unlawful.id.at.plaintiffs argue that because the feis and rod purport to follow the policies and the general management plan,but in fact fail to do so,they are arbitrary and capricious.we do not agree.
plaintiffs base their argument on the fact that the colorado river corridor has been classified by the park service as potential wilderness.the policies provide the following guidance with respect to the management of potential wilderness areas 
the national park service will take no action that would diminish the wilderness suitability of an area possessing wilderness characteristics until the legislative process of wilderness designation has been completed this policy also applies to potential wilderness,requiring it to be managed as wilderness to the extent that existing conditions allow.the national park service will seek to remove from potential wilderness the temporary,conditions that preclude wilderness designation.
policies sar.the feis makes this same commitment with respect to the colorado river corridor.see feis vol.i at.
the language of makes clear that the park service is required to manage potential wilderness areas as actual wilderness only to the extent that existing conditions allow.this language does not require the park service immediately to remove existing this case,motorized rafts.it requires the park service to manage the colorado river corridor as wilderness to the extent possible given the existing use of motors.in light of this clear provision,the court can not conclude that the management plan is arbitrary and capricious for failing to remove motorized uses in the colorado river corridor immediately 
section further states that the park service will seek to remove from potential wilderness the temporary,nonconforming conditions that preclude wilderness designation.policies sar.seasonal uses of motors on the river do not preclude wilderness designation.plaintiffs do not contend that such uses work any permanent change on the corridor that would preclude later wilderness treatment.seasonal float trips are not like the construction of a road or other physical improvements that might disqualify an area for wilderness designation in the future.motorized float trips can readily be eliminated if congress decides that the corridor should be designated as wilderness.the feis concludes that the use of motors in the corridor is only a temporary or transient disturbance of wilderness values and does not permanently impact wilderness resources or permanently denigrate wilderness values.feis,vol.i at see also ar discussion of limited effect of motorized uses on soils,ar same for water quality,ar same for air quality,ar same for natural soundscape 
we note,additionally,that federal agencies are entitled to some leeway when interpreting their own policies and regulations.stinson united states,provided an agency interpretation of its own regulations does not violate the constitution or a federal statute,it must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.when that leeway is added to the management plan general consistency with the policies,the court can not conclude that the policies,even if not enforceable in court,render the management plan arbitrary and capricious.
finally,plaintiffs argue that the management plan is arbitrary and capricious because it contradicts earlier park service decisions to phase out motorized boating in the colorado river corridor.as noted above,the management plan called for motorized watercraft between lees ferry and separation canyon to be phased out over a period.sar.the court can not conclude,however,that the management plan is arbitrary and capricious solely because it differs from earlier park service decisions.part of the discretion granted to federal agencies is the freedom to change positions.as the supreme court has explained,a n agency view of what is in the public interest may change,either with or without a change in circumstances.but an agency changing its course must supply a reasoned analysis.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto ins,quotation omitted.the question posed by this lawsuit,therefore,is not whether the management plan differs from past park service decisions,but whether it is arbitrary and capricious in light of facts in the administrative record and the reasoning of the feis.for reasons explained herein,the court finds the management plan sufficiently reasonable to pass apa muster.
iv.the concessions act.
plaintiffs contend that the management plan is arbitrary and capricious because it fails to comply with the requirements of the concessions act.the act governs the granting of commercial concessions within the national park system.to make visits to national parks more enjoyable for the public,congress authorized the park service to grant privileges,leases,and permits for the use of land for the accommodation of visitors.such privileges,leases,and permits have become embodied in national parks concession contracts.park hospitality ass dep t of the interior.the specific provision of the act relied on by plaintiffs articulates a congressional policy for the granting of concessions 
it is the policy of the congress that the development of public accommodations,facilities,and services in units of the national park system shall be limited to those accommodations,facilities,and services that 
are necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the unit of the national park system in which they are located and 
are consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of the resources and values of the unit.
plaintiffs claim that the management plan is arbitrary and capricious because the park service never determined that the types and levels of motorized uses authorized by the management plan are necessary and appropriate for public use and consistent with the park resources and values.before addressing this argument,we must address the legal standard that governs review of a concessions act claim.
legal standard under the concessions act.
in support of their concessions act argument,plaintiffs rely heavily on high sierra hikers ass blackwell,cir,a case in which we struck down the forest service grant of permits to commercial packstock operators in the ansel adams and john muir wilderness areas of california.the court held that the forest service must make a finding that the number of permits granted was no more than was necessary to achieve the goals of the act.id.at.plaintiffs argue that blackwell requires a similar park service finding for the number of motorized raft trips permitted in the management plan.
it is significant,however,that the court in blackwell was applying the wilderness act,not the concessions act.the wilderness act places strict limitations on the use of lands formally designated by congress as wilderness.with narrow exceptions,the wilderness act prohibits commercial enterprises,permanent roads,and motorized vehicles in wilderness areas.c.federal agencies are obligated to manage such areas to preserve their wilderness character.id.at b.we explained in blackwell that the forest service obligation to limit commercial packstock permits flows directly out of the agency obligation under the wilderness act to protect and preserve wilderness areas.at.it was this ultimate interest and overarching purpose of the wilderness protect the ansel adams and john muir wilderness areas from led the ninth circuit to hold that the packstock permit decision violated the forest service statutory responsibility.id.at.
this case,by contrast,does not concern a wilderness area.congress has never acted on the park service recommendation that portions of the park be formally designated as wilderness.the park service,therefore,is not under the same statutory responsibility that applied to the forest service in blackwell.the court must look to the concessions act,not the wilderness act,for the governing legal standard.
in wilderness preservation fund kleppe,cir,we decided a case under,the statutory predecessor to the concessions act.see city of sausalito,cir kleppe decided under predecessor to concessions act,stat.superceded by.the predecessor statute,like the concessions act,stated a congressional policy that commercial concessions in national parks should be limited to those that are necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the national park area in which they are located.kleppe,at.in rejecting a challenge under this policy to the park service allocation of rafting permits in the colorado river corridor,kleppe recognized the administrative discretion granted the park service and invoked a judicial presumption favoring the validity of administrative actions.id.at.
this more deferential standard appears to be warranted.the park service is charged with administering almost national parks.see national park service,about us,last visited october.the concessions act does not impose strict wilderness requirements on those parks,but instead articulates a policy that calls for the park service to balance the interests of public use and resource preservation.b.the park service balancing of those interests over the broad range and diverse circumstances of hundreds of national parks is appropriately accorded the kind of deference recognized in kleppe.the court concludes that the deferential approach of kleppe,rather than the statutory application of the wilderness act in blackwell,should govern this case.
b.the management plan and the concessions act.
plaintiffs first contend that the park service failed entirely to determine that the types and levels of commercial services authorized by the management plan are necessary and appropriate.we disagree.the park service made the following determinations 
since many visitors who wish to raft on the colorado river through grand canyon possess neither the equipment nor the skill to successfully navigate the rapids and other hazards of the river,the park service has determined that it is necessary and appropriate for the public use and enjoyment of the park to provide for experienced and professional river guides who can provide such skills and equipment.
s ervices provided by commercial outfitters,which enable thousands of people to experience the river in a relatively primitive and unconfined manner and setting when many of them otherwise would be unable to do so,are necessary to realize the recreational or other wilderness purposes of the park.
feis vol.i at.
plaintiffs argue that although the park service may have found commercial outfitters to be necessary and appropriate generally,it never made such a finding for motorized commercial services.again we disagree.the rod specifically states that d etermination of the types and levels of commercial services that are necessary and appropriate for the colorado river through grand canyon national park were determined through the feis.rod at emphasis added.among the eight management alternatives considered by the park service in the deis and feis were two that did not authorize any motorized uses in the colorado river corridor alternatives b and c.after evaluating these alternatives,the park service found that they violated the basic premise of this planning effort that of reducing congestion,crowding and impacts without reducing access of visitors to the colorado river.feis vol.iii at.as demonstrated by the park service analysis of the alternatives,a decision by the park service to eliminate the motorized trip option would cause a dramatic reduction in the public availability of professionally outfitted river trips.id.at.the park service explained that continued authorization of motorized use for recreational river trips in the park is essential to meeting the management objectives for the management plan.id.thus,the park service quite clearly concluded that motorized commercial services were necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the corridor.b.
plaintiffs contend that even if the park service found that motorized services were necessary and appropriate,it made no determination as to the amount of such services that are necessary,and therefore failed to limit motorized uses to those that are necessary and appropriate as required by the congressional policy statement of the concessions act.it is true that the feis and rod do not contain a specific discussion of the amount of motorized traffic found necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the corridor.but the absence of such a specific discussion does not necessarily require the agency action to be overturned.while a court may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency action that the agency itself has not given,the court will uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency path may reasonably be discerned.bowman,freight,citations omitted.the park service consideration of the amount of motorized traffic required in the colorado river corridor can reasonably be discerned from the feis.
the management plan established use levels that were still in effect when the management plan planning process began.among the alternatives considered in the deis and feis was a alternative an alternative that would have left the levels in place.this alternative,designated in the feis as alternative a,would continue to allocate user days to commercial operators motorized and and user days to users.feis vol.i at.alternative b would have eliminated all motorized traffic on the river and allocated user days to commercial operators and to.id.at.alternative c also would have eliminated all motorized trips,but would have increased commercial user days to and to,presumably to accommodate sufficient numbers of visitors with the slower trips.id.at.alternatives d,e,f,and g would have permitted motorized uses,but varied the amounts for commercial and traffic.id.at.the levels of motorized user days for alternatives d,e,f,and g would have been,and,respectively.id.
user days were not the only variables evaluated by the park service.the feis also considered months without motors on the river,trip lengths,trip lengths during various parts of the year,group sizes,numbers of launches,numbers of passengers,and helicopter exchanges at the whitmore helipad.id.at.the park service evaluated these alternatives against environmental,social,and factors including impacts on soils,water,air,soundscape,caves,vegetation,terrestrial life,aquatic resources,special status species,cultural resources,visitor experience,resources,park management and operations,adjacent lands,and wilderness character.id.at.
the park service ultimately concluded that alternatives b and not meet the agency objective of providing a diverse range of quality recreational opportunities for visitors to experience and understand the environmental interrelationships,resources,and values of grand canyon national park because of the significantly reduced number of visitors who could experience the colorado river corridor.id.at see feis vol.ii at.the park service evaluated a range of motorized use times in the other alternatives and,after considering all factors and variables,selected modified alternative h.that alternative included specific allocations for motorized and uses a total of commercial user days consisting of motorized and,and an estimated user days.feis vol.i at.
modified alternative h reduced the amount of motorized traffic in the colorado river corridor and the months within which it can occur,while significantly increasing the traffic for uses.the time period during which it prohibited motorized uses in the corridor each year is september through march months longer than under the management plan.feis vol.i at.modified alternative h also reduced motorized commercial launches from per year to per year,and total motorized passengers from to.id.at.maximum group sizes for commercial motor excursions were also reduced from to.id.at.commercial user days were held essentially level at,while user days were more than doubled to an estimated.id.at 
in sum,the park service decision concerning the amount of motorized trips on the river was made after considering competing alternatives and a significant number of variables.the park service chose an alternative that reduced motorized uses from current levels.the court is satisfied that the park service,as stated in the rod,determined the type and level of traffic on the river that was necessary and appropriate,including the type and level of motorized uses.rod at.
plaintiffs argue that even if the park service made such a determination,the determination was arbitrary and capricious.as noted above,however,the decision occurred only after an extensive analysis of various alternatives.defendants have identified a number of factors in the administrative record that support the park service decision to allow motorized traffic to continue.first,because motorized trips take less time to complete days as opposed to days for trips,substantially more people can see the park each year from the river if motorized trips continue.feis vol.i at vol.iii at.second,motorized trips are frequently chartered for groups,educational classes,family reunions,or to support kayak or other paddle trips.third,because of their increased mobility,motorized trips help alleviate overcrowding at popular campsites and attractions in the corridor.feis vol.i at vol.iii at.fourth,some individuals feel safer when traveling in motorized rafts.feis vol.iii at.in addition,studies performed as part of the deis found that visitors are able to experience the river as wilderness in the presence of motorized uses and that those who took motorized trips were significantly more likely to stress safety and trip length as the most important factors in the choosing the type of trip they took.
given the judicial presumption favoring the validity of administrative actions and the administrative discretion granted the park service under the concessions act,kleppe,at,the court can not conclude that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it found that the modified alternative h levels of motorized uses were necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the colorado river corridor.b.the question is not whether this court agrees with the park service decision,but whether it is reasonably supported by the administrative record.in light of the deis and feis analysis outlined above,we conclude that it is.
plaintiffs spend little time addressing the other policy statement of the concessions the necessary and appropriate public uses should be consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of
