the city of jacksonville city originally brought this action in a florida state court against the united states department of the navy navy alleging past violations of state and local air pollution control laws enacted pursuant to the federal clean air act,q caa and seeking punitive penalties for these past offenses.the navy removed the case to federal district court pursuant to a,and the district court denied the city motion to remand.the navy made a motion for judgment on the pleadings,arguing that congress did not waive the federal government sovereign immunity in the caa for these punitive penalties.the district court denied the navy motion and certified its ruling for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.we granted the navy petition for permission to take the appeal,and now reverse,concluding that congress did not clearly and unequivocally waive the united states sovereign immunity from punitive penalties under the caa.additionally,we find that removal was not precluded by the caa and was thus proper under a.
congress,in enacting the caa,has given the individual states a great responsibility for ensuring that national air quality standards are attained within their geographical areas.see.state and local governments are required to develop plans that provide for implementation,maintenance,and enforcement of national air quality standards.see.in addition,preserves the states rights to adopt and enforce their own standards,so long as they are not less stringent than the national standards.the federal facilities section of the caa provides that federal facilities shall be subject to,and comply with,all state and local requirements,administrative authority,and process and sanctions respecting the control and abatement of air pollution in the same manner,and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity.thus,the navy facilities located in jacksonville are subject to both the state and city air pollution regulations.
the city alleges that beginning in and continuing through,the navy had violated various state and local air pollution regulations.these allegations include the following exceedance of sulfur limiting standards,failure to comply with vapor pressure requirements for various solvents,pressure drop range violations,failure to comply with testing requirements,and record keeping violations.of these alleged violations,the city does not claim that any are continuing in nature.nonetheless,the city filed a complaint in state court in march,seeking punitive penalties up to per occurrence for each past violation.as amended,the complaint includes seven counts alleging over violations.
on april,the navy removed the case to federal district court pursuant to a.the city then filed a motion to remand,arguing that the plain language of the caa expressly precluded removal under a.while this motion was pending,the navy filed its own motion with the district court for judgment on the pleadings under rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure,alleging lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the navy argued that dismissal of the case was proper because the city instituted this action purely to recover punitive penalties,and congress did not waive the federal government sovereign immunity with regard to punitive penalties under the caa.
after oral argument on the issues,the district court denied both motions.the district court found that nothing in the caa prohibited the navy from removing the case to federal court,and that the case was otherwise properly removed.with respect to the merits,the district court found that the caa unequivocally waives the united states sovereign immunity as to punitive penalties for state and local air pollution control violations.thereafter,the district court certified its ruling on the sovereign immunity issue for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.we granted the navy petition to bring this appeal.although the issue of removal was not certified in the interlocutory appeal,it is properly before this court because a b appeal brings up the entire district court order.see moore liberty life ins,cir.
since the relevant removal statute provides the only basis for federal jurisdiction in this case,we must address this issue first.we review the district court denial of the city motion to remand de novo.see behlen merrill lynch,cir.a had traditionally provided for removal to federal court for actions involving officers of the united states,and in congress amended a so that it now also authorizes removal by the united states and its agencies.see a.it was pursuant to a that the navy removed the case against it to federal district court.the city,however,claims that e of the caa implicitly prohibits removal in this instance.we find no congressional intent,either in the language of e or in the legislative history,to support this contention.
with regard to the merits of this case,the navy has claimed the defense of sovereign immunity,and thus it is exactly the type of action that congress intended to be resolved in federal court.in enacting the amendments to a,congress recognized that federal agencies have had to defend themselves in state court,despite important and complex federal issues such as preemption and sovereign immunity,at.congress purpose was clearly to provide a federal forum for the sovereign immunity issue at the heart of this case.see,at,reprinted in,this section fulfills congress intent that questions concerning the scope of federal immunity be adjudicated in federal court.
despite this clear congressional intent,the city contends that a set of amendments to the caa,found in e,implicitly prohibit removal in actions by state and local governments against the united states or one of its agencies.the language of e on which the city bases its argument reads as follows 
nothing in this section or in any other law of the united states shall be construed to prohibit,exclude,or restrict any state,local,or interstate authority from 
bringing any enforcement action or obtaining any judicial remedy or sanction in any state or local court 
against the united states under state or local law respecting control and abatement of air pollution.
e.as is apparent from the above language,congress does not explicitly address the issue of removal in e.the city argues,however,that unlike,which provides for removal in instances where there is original jurisdiction in federal courts,there is no language in requiring congress to expressly override removal in particular circumstances.compare with a except as otherwise expressly provided by act of congress,any civil action may be removed emphasis added.though the requirement to expressly provide is not contained within a,in order to find that e precludes removal in this type of action,we must at least find congress intent to be clear and manifest.see patel quality inn,cir noting that repeals by implication are disfavored and so to find a repeal by implication congress intent must be clear and manifest.
the city claims that the plain language of e unequivocally demonstrates congress intent to preclude removal.to support this argument,the city relies on the ninth circuit decision in california ex rel.sacramento metro.air quality mgmt.dist.united states,cir.in sacramento,the ninth circuit examined the language of e set forth above,particularly the language authorizing local governments to obtain remedies and sanctions in state court against the united states.see id.at.the sacramento court found that unless e precluded removal,plaintiffs could not be guaranteed the right to obtain judicial remedies and sanctions in state court.see id.the ninth circuit also reasoned that e indicates that a plaintiff right to obtain relief in state court is not to be restricted by any other law of the united states.see id.the court found that any other law included the removal statute.see id.we respectfully disagree with the ninth circuit reasoning.at the time these amendments to the caa were written in,the a removal statute did not authorize the federal government or its agencies to remove actions to federal court.thus,we doubt that congress in intended to preclude removal by the united states when sued pursuant to e where it had not even contemplated the authorization of removal by the federal government until it amended a in.
we can not find a clear and manifest intention in the plain language of e to preclude removal in this action.the plain language clearly enables state and local governments to enforce local air pollution regulations in state courts.nothing,however,in this plain language prevents the united states from removing these actions to federal court.the courts are not at liberty to pick and choose among congressional enactments,and when two statutes are capable of,it is the duty of the courts,absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary,to regard each as effective.morton mancari,d.the ninth circuit claimed that it was giving full effect to both e and a,yet it found that e precludes the application of the removal statute to state and local actions enforcing local air pollution laws against the federal government.by this interpretation of e,however,the sacramento court was actually only giving partial effect to these provisions.to the contrary,we find that the plain language of these two statutory provisions do not conflict and accordingly give them both full effect state and local governments may bring enforcement actions in state courts pursuant to e and the united states may then remove these actions so long as the federal government complies with the requirements of a.such removal is optional,not mandatory.
the city,however,contends that the legislative history of the caa supports the conclusion that congress unequivocally intended to preclude removal in actions brought against the united states pursuant to e.the legislative history does indicate congress intent to provide greater assistance to the states in enforcing local air pollution laws against federal facilities.see,at,reprinted in.congress was confronted with federal facilities resisting full compliance of local air pollution laws,and it therefore intended to explicitly make federal facilities subject to these laws.see,at,reprinted in at.it also intended to enable state and local authorities to bring judicial actions in state or local court pursuant to state or local law.see,at,reprinted in at.there is nothing,however,in any of this legislative history that gives any indication that congress intended to prevent removal of these actions to federal court,especially when important federal issues,such as sovereign immunity,must be resolved.in fact,the legislative history of the amendments contains explicit evidence that congress did not intend to prohibit removal.see conf,at,reprinted in.congress deleted a provision in the final version of the amendments that would have barred removal of suits against federal facilities to federal courts.see conf,at,reprinted in at.we disagree with the ninth circuit assumption that had this language been included,it would have simply been redundant.see sacramento,at.such an assumption is directly contrary to the clear instructions of the supreme court.where congress includes limiting language in an earlier version of a bill but deletes it prior to enactment,it may be presumed that the limitation was not intended.russello united states,d.
the city then calls this court attention to particular language in the clean water act cwa,which was enacted the same year as the caa,and whose language is identical to the caa in many respects.see conf,at,reprinted in.the cwa expressly authorizes removal of actions against the united states.see a.this provision in the cwa,however,does not grant a right of removal,for the substantive right of removal is found in et rather,this provision is merely an express intent not to preclude the already existing right.the absence of this express language in the caa preserving the right of removal can not provide a basis to preclude removal without any express affirmative support indicating that such is the intent of congress.
after examining the legislative histories of a and e,we find no clearly expressed congressional intent indicating that these two statutory provisions can not each be given full effect.congress intent to enable state and local governments to enforce local air pollution laws in state courts does not conflict with congress intent to give federal agencies the option of removing appropriate cases to federal court.it is clear that congress intended to make it possible for federal courts to resolve issues like sovereign immunity.cases removed under a ordinarily assert such a defense.see magnin teledyne continental motors,cir finding that in order for a state court action against a federal officer to be removable,there must be an assertion of a federal defense thus,although contemplates state and local governments enforcing local air pollution laws in state courts,if there is a federal issue involved such as sovereign immunity,congress recognized that the wholly local nature of the action disappears.in this instance,pursuant to congress intent in enacting a,it is appropriate for the case to be heard in federal court.
whereas e does not unequivocally prohibit removal,a explicitly and unambiguously gives the federal government the right to remove actions in which they are named as a defendant to federal court.despite congress intent to authorize enforcement of local air pollution laws in state courts,we find no intent in the legislative history or plain language of e to preclude removal.congress has demonstrated in other statutes that it can unequivocally preclude removal in certain instances if it chooses.see breuer jim concrete of brevard,cir citing a,aff,d.nevertheless,there is legislative history that demonstrates that congress expressly refused to do that here.see conf,at,reprinted in at.accordingly,we conclude that the navy properly removed this action to the federal district court pursuant to a,and we therefore have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the merits of this case.
the city is seeking punitive penalties for the navy alleged past violations of local air pollution laws.the navy concedes that had the city alleged continuing air pollution violations,the federal government would be subject to coercive sanctions,such as an injunction or coercive fines,under the caa.the city,however,makes no allegation of any continuing violations,and so only seeks punitive penalties for the past violations.the navy claims that it is not subject to these penalties as a matter of law,as congress has not waived the united states sovereign immunity from punitive sanctions under the caa.
the city maintains that punitive penalties are necessary for effective enforcement of local air pollution laws,and the city encourages this court to find a waiver in the statute on this basis.however,even without the availability of punitive penalties,federal facility compliance can still be accomplished through the use of coercive sanctions,such as injunctions and coercive fines.moreover,the supreme court rejected a similar argument made by the state of ohio arguing that coercive fines are not a sufficient deterrent under the cwa 
to say that compliance can not be accomplished without such coercive fines is to assume that without sanctions for past conduct a federal polluter can never be brought into future compliance,that an agency of the national government would defy an injunction backed by coercive fines and even a threat of personal commitment.the position seems almost to ignore the fact that once such fines start running they can be every dollar as onerous as their punitive counterparts it could be a very expensive mistake to plan on ignoring the law indefinitely on the assumption that contumacy would be cheap.

in order for this court to find a waiver of sovereign immunity with regard to punitive penalties,it must be unequivocally expressed in the statutory text.see lane pena,d.any waiver of immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign,and it can not be enlarged beyond what the statutory language allows.see id.see also united states dep t of energy,at,d.moreover,where a waiver would authorize payments from the federal treasury,as the city claims the waiver in the caa does,it must extend unambiguously to such monetary claims.lane,at.it is pursuant to these above principles that we conclude that neither the federal facilities section of the caa,a,nor its citizen suit provision,e,clearly and unequivocally waive the united states sovereign immunity from punitive penalties.
the city first claims that the federal facilities provision of the caa,a,waives the united states sovereign immunity with regard to punitive penalties.the relevant language of the federal facilities provision reads as follows 
each department,agency,and instrumentality of the executive,legislative,and judicial branches of the federal government having jurisdiction over any property or facility,or engaged in any activity resulting,or which may result,in the discharge of air pollutants,and each officer,agent,or employee thereof,shall be subject to,and comply with,all federal,state,interstate,and local requirements,administrative authority,and process and sanctions respecting the control and abatement of air pollution in the same manner,and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity.the preceding sentence shall apply a to any requirement whether substantive or procedural including any recordkeeping or reporting requirement,any requirement respecting permits and any other requirement whatsoever,b to any requirement to pay a fee or charge imposed by any state or local agency to defray the costs of its air pollution regulatory program,c to the exercise of any federal,state,or local administrative authority,and d to any process and sanction,whether enforced in federal,state,or local courts,or in any other manner.this subsection shall apply notwithstanding any immunity of such agencies,officers,agents,or employees under any law or rule of law.no officer,agent,or employee of the united states shall be personally liable for any civil penalty for which he is not otherwise liable.
a emphasis added.neither the united states supreme court nor any other circuit court has yet addressed whether a waives the federal government sovereign immunity from punitive penalties however,the supreme court has addressed this issue in the context of the cwa federal facilities provision,a,which has similar,if not identical,language to the relevant portion of the federal facilities provision of the caa see united states dep t of energy ohio,d.
in united states department of energy,the supreme court found that although the cwa federal facilities section waived the federal government sovereign immunity with regard to coercive sanctions,the language did not unequivocally waive immunity from punitive penalties see id.at.the supreme court rejected ohio claim that since the federal government was subject to sanctions under a,this necessarily included punitive sanctions.see id.at.the court found that the term sanction is spacious enough to cover not only what we have called punitive fines,but coercive ones as well,and use of the term carries no necessary implication that a reference to punitive fines is intended.id.at.thus,to determine what the term sanction refers to in the caa federal facility provision,a,we must examine its context.see id.at.as is the case in the cwa federal facilities provision,a,each time the word sanction appears in a of the caa,it is within the phrase process and sanction s.the supreme court found it significant that sanction was paired with process because p rocess normally refers to the procedure and mechanics of adjudication and the enforcement of decrees or orders that the adjudicatory process finally provides.id.at.the pairing of process and sanctions can be contrasted with the absence of the word sanctions when the text speaks of subjecting the federal government to substantive requirements.see a united states dep t of energy,at.this is significant because substantive requirements,as opposed to process,may be enforced by punitive penalties.see united states dep t of energy,at.thus,we follow the supreme court reasoning and conclude that because the text uses the term sanction in the context of enforcing process as opposed to substantive requirements,there is good reason to infer that congress was using sanction in its coercive sense,to the exclusion of punitive fines.id.at.
the city,however,argues that despite the almost identical language found in the federal facilities provisions of the cwa,a,and the caa,a,there are material differences between the two provisions that mandate a different result.in united states department of energy,the supreme court did discuss particular language in the cwa that is not present in the caa.the cwa federal facilities provision provides,in relevant part,that the united states shall be liable only for those civil penalties imposed by a state or local court to enforce an order or the process of such court.a.the supreme court found that this language serves a clarifying function in that it makes it apparent that the civil penalties referred to in this section must be limited to coercive sanctions.see united states dep t of energy,at.the city argues that the absence of this clarifying language in the caa federal facilities provision must lead to the conclusion that congress did not intend to limit the federal government liability to only coercive sanctions this language,however,did not serve as the basis for the supreme court decision in united states department of energy rather,the court found that this language simply confirmed the conclusion it had already reached in analyzing the phrase process and sanctions.id.at.moreover,the absence of this language in a of the caa does not make any kind of affirmative statement.for this court to find that congress intended to waive the government immunity from punitive penalties,there must be an unequivocal statement within the statutory language itself.see lane,at.indeed,the only affirmative and unequivocal language indicating the scope of the government immunity is within the language we analyzed above discussing process and sanctions.from this express affirmative language,we conclude that the federal facilities section of the caa unequivocally waives the federal government sovereign immunity from coercive sanctions,but not from punitive penalties.
the city next contends that even if the federal facilities section,a,does not waive the united states sovereign immunity from punitive penalties,waiver can still be found in the citizen suit provision,e.this subsection provides 
nothing in this section shall restrict any right which any person or class of persons may have under any statute or common law to seek enforcement of any emission standard or limitation or to seek any other relief including relief against the administrator or a state agency.nothing in this section or in any other law of the united states shall be construed to prohibit,exclude,or restrict any state,local,or interstate authority from 
bringing any enforcement action or obtaining any judicial remedy or sanction in any state or local court,
against the united states under state or local law respecting control and abatement of air pollution.for provisions requiring compliance by the united states in the same manner as nongovernmental entities,see section of this title.
e emphasis added.the navy argues that this provision is not an independent waiver of sovereign immunity,but is merely a savings clause providing only that the citizen suit provision does not preempt any other available remedies.with respect to the first sentence of this subsection,we agree with the navy that it does serve as a savings clause.see.air pollution control,at virginia united states,cir.see also city of milwaukee illinois and michigan,d finding e of the cwa,with language virtually identical as the first sentence of e of the caa,to be a savings clause.we disagree,however,with the navy contention that the second sentence is also only a savings clause.
if the second sentence of e is simply a savings clause,then it would merely be duplicating the first sentence.this second sentence was added within the amendments to the caa.clean air act amendments of,c,stat.prior to these amendments,state and local governments had no r
