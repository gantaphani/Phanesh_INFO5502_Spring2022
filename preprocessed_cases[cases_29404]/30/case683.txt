we must decide whether the environmental protection agency regional haze regulations for the state of montana lawfully prescribe emission limits at certain power plants.

the act imposes several requirements on states and on epa relevant to this case.first,the act requires epa to promulgate regulations to assure reasonable progress toward meeting the national goal of regional haze reduction.a.second,the act invites each state to submit to epa a state implementation plan sip setting forth emission limits and other measures necessary to make reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal.see a,b.if,like montana,a state chooses not to submit such a plan,the act requires epa to produce a federal implementation plan fip for that state.see c a.
the act further provides that all implementation plans must require installation of the best available retrofit technology bart to reduce emissions from certain emission sources that were operational between and sources.see b,g.five statutory factors determine which type of technology constitutes bart for such sources 
a the costs of compliance 
b the energy and quality environmental impacts of compliance 
c any existing pollution control technology at a source

e the degree of visibility improvement anticipated.
pursuant to the act,epa promulgated its regional haze regulations the regulations,which asked certain states,including montana,to analyze sources of emissions within the state and to develop a plan to eliminate all visibility impacts by.see.at.the regulations require any implementation plan to include reasonable progress goals a calculation of baseline and natural visibility conditions a strategy for achieving reasonable progress goals and additional monitoring of emission sources in class i federal areas.see d.after the circuit vacated the provisions of the regulations relating to bart determinations,see am.corn growers,at,epa promulgated new bart regulations in its regional haze regulations and guidelines for best available retrofit technology bart determinations the regulations,which revised the text of the earlier regulations.see.july.

the proposed rule required petitioner ppl montana to take various actions to reduce emissions of two compounds nitrogen oxide nox and sulfur dioxide at two power plants it partially owns and operates,colstrip and corette.first,ppl montana was required to implement several new technologies at units and of the colstrip station.to reduce nox emissions to a day rolling average of,the proposed rule required ppl montana to install two new technologies separated overfire air sofa and selective reduction sncr at colstrip units and.id.at.to reduce emissions to a day rolling average of,the proposed rule required ppl montana to implement two additional new technologies at colstrip units and lime injection and a fourth scrubber.id.at.the proposed rule did not require ppl montana to implement new technologies at colstrip units and.
second,the proposed rule required ppl montana to limit nox and emissions at the corette station.the proposed rule imposed day average rolling emission limits of for nox and for.see id.at.it required ppl montana to achieve such emissions using current technology unlike at colstrip units and,the proposed rule does not require installation of new technology at corette.id.at.
both ppl montana and npca commented on the proposed rule.at the conclusion of the notice and comment period,epa issued its final fip for montana on september.see approval and promulgation of implementation plans state of montana the final rule or the rule,codified at.the final rule implemented the proposed rule in almost all respects relevant to this appeal 
ppl montana and npca both filed petitions for review of epa bart determinations at colstrip and corette,which petitions were consolidated for purposes of this appeal.ppl montana contends that the emissions limits set forth in the rule for nox and at colstrip units and as well as the bart determinations underlying such limits are essentially too stringent.it argues that epa failed reasonably to explain the rule bart selections and that epa visibility model does not reasonably anticipate visibility improvement as a result of the rule requirements.ppl montana also challenges the emissions set forth in the rule for corette.
npca also challenges the rule emissions limits and bart determinations at colstrip units and and corette,contending essentially that such limits are not stringent enough.according to npca,epa decision not to require installation of more advanced technology at these locations was unexplained,arbitrary,and capricious.moreover,according to npca,epa decision not to require installation of any new technologies at colstrip units and fails to satisfy the requirement that the rule make reasonable progress toward visibility improvement.

ppl montana and npca each contest the rule bart determinations and prescribed limits for nox and emissions at colstrip units and and,for similar reasons,corette.
the heart of the dispute about epa bart selection at colstrip units and is its determination that use of sncr in addition to sofa is,and that use of selective catalytic reduction scr a more aggressive technology in addition to sofa is not.both parties urge that epa analysis fails appropriately to consider the costs of compliance and degree of visibility impairment,as required by the act,see g,at step three of epa bart analysis under the guidelines,see pt,app.y.
the rule requires ppl montana to reduce nox emissions at colstrip units and to over a day rolling average.see c.epa concluded that such reduction could be achieved by installing both sofa and sncr technologies.see final rule.at.npca contends that epa offered insufficient justification for its rejection of scr as bart in favor of sofa and sncr together,and argues that ppl montana should be required to install scr instead of sncr,and in addition to sofa,at all four colstrip units.ppl montana makes a related point,but on the other side of the argument,contending that epa offered insufficient justification for requiring sofa and sncr as bart instead of sofa alone a remedy ppl montana does not oppose.epa responds that the bart determination is discretionary and that it considered all of the relevant factors in reaching its conclusions.
the parties also challenge several more minor aspects of epa analysis.ppl montana argues that epa use of the metric for balancing cost and visibility benefit was improper.npca,for its part,maintains that epa underestimated the emissions baseline at colstrip units and,and that it miscalculated the cost of implementing scr at these units.
epa identified the costs of the various technologies for nox reduction at colstrip units and as follows 
see proposed rule,tables.at.
the rule offers essentially no reasoning behind epa selection of sofa and sncr together,as opposed either to sofa alone or sofa and scr together,as bart to reduce nox emissions at colstrip units and.with respect to the decision to require sncr in addition to sofa,epa asserted in the proposed rule only that the cost of sofa and sncr together is justified when the visibility improvement is considered.see proposed rule.at.in response to ppl montana comment requesting that epa explain this assertion,epa noted that the proposed rule discloses the cost for both sofa alone and sofa combined with sncr,and that it selected sncr as bart in consideration of these costs,all of which were presented to the public in our proposed rule.final rule.at.but ppl montana objection is not that epa failed to disclose the cost differential between implementing sofa alone and sofa along with sncr.it contends instead that epa failed to explain the reasons why the improvement achieved through sofa alone was insufficient,but the improvement achieved through sofa and sncr together was deemed both sufficient and.
with respect to scr,epa simply asserted that the cost of sofa and scr together ton at colstrip unit was not justified by the visibility improvement of deciviews,but that t he lower cost of sofa sncr ton is justified when the visibility improvement of deciviews is considered.proposed rule.at.epa maintains that it did not use a set or improvement threshold to disqualify scr,and we do not suggest that it must do so.but absent any explanation at all of how epa determines,it is impossible for the rule reader to determine why epa ruled sofa and sncr in and ruled scr out.
epa acknowledged that the regional haze rule does not prevent it from implementing what it called a bright line rule for,but contends that its regulations do not require it to do so.see final rule.at.to be sure,the act and the regulations do not specifically require that epa explain its decisions through use of a bright line rule.but the law does require epa to cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner.see state farm,at greater yellowstone coalition,servheen,cir requiring a rational connection between the data before the agency and its conclusion nw.envtl.def.ctr.bonneville power,cir.epa unexplained assertions that the combination of sofa and sncr is,but that sofa alone is insufficient,and that the combination of sofa and scr is not,are unsupported by any explained reasoning.these assertions leave the rule reader wondering what metric,if any,epa used to determine bart,or if epa employed no metric,why not.therefore,we conclude that epa bart determination for nox emissions at colstrip units and is arbitrary and capricious.
epa responses to petitioners more minor challenges to its analysis make clear that it is capable of the required rational explanation.
first,npca challenges epa selection of the years as the emissions baseline period for calculating bart at colstrip units and.it contends that epa underestimated the potential benefit of using scr by first underestimating the existing emissions baseline.epa bart guidelines require it to choose a representative baseline period that supplies a realistic depiction of anticipated annual emissions for the source.bart guidelines.at.epa chose the period on the reasoning that colstrip had installed additional combustion controls in,reducing its emissions.see id.npca argues that epa should have chosen earlier periods because ppl montana is not required to maintain the rate of emissions achieved between,describing the changes at colstrip as unenforceable.but epa offered a reasoned response to npca comment about its choice that colstrip had achieved reduced emissions using technology it has no plans to deactivate and npca has suggested no reason to believe that ppl montana would change course and remove the additional combustion controls it had already installed.epa gave a reasoned,rational response to this argument,a response to which a reviewing court defers.see latino issues forum epa,cir.
second,ppl montana objects that epa reliance on a metric to calculate cost effectiveness is inappropriate because it does not actually measure the improvement achieved in visibility.but epa responded that it has previously defined cost effectiveness as tons of pollutant emissions removed compared with annualized control costs.regulations.at.indeed,ppl montana essentially abandoned this argument in reply after epa pointed to its regulation in its response brief.
third,npca objects that epa improperly calculated the cost of installing scr at colstrip units and,leading it to reject scr as bart.it challenges epa calculation of the capital cost,its choice of interest rate,and the lifespan and maintenance costs assumed in epa calculation.epa provided a reasoned response to npca comments on these questions.see final rule.at.npca maintains that epa should have looked to different data sources to determine these costs.but it offers a reason that epa should look to different underlying cost data in only one example case.it contends epa should have chosen a interest rate instead of a interest rate in calculating these costs to comport with the requirements set forth in the epa air pollution cost manual.but that manual instructs industry actors that they may wish to use a different interest rate for their own calculations.as epa explained,see final rule.at,epa manual clearly contemplates that epa will use the interest rate set by the omb,as it properly did here,in pursuing its own calculations.see id.
both petitioners dispute the rationality of epa selection of a fourth scrubber as bart for emissions control at colstrip units and for essentially the same reasons they dispute epa nox bart determinations.epa determined the costs of the various technologies for reducing emissions at colstrip as follows 
see proposed rule,tables.at.
ppl montana contends that epa underestimated the cost of installing a fourth scrubber at colstrip units and and failed sufficiently to explain its determination for this requirement.npca,to the contrary,contends that epa should have required installation of replacement advanced scrubbers at colstrip,not just the introduction of an additional scrubber.epa responds that it appropriately explained its calculation of the costs involved in adding an additional scrubber and that it appropriately decided not to require an entirely new system of scrubbers,as opposed only to adding one additional scrubber.
epa analysis with respect to emissions at colstrip units and suffers the same defect as its with respect to nox emissions.epa analysis is an improvement in one respect epa acknowledged the incremental cost of adding an additional scrubber vessel ton at colstrip unit,see final rule.at,and noted that adding a scrubber vessel would incrementally improve visibility from deciview using lime injection alone to deciview using lime injection and an additional scrubber vessel.see id.but epa then concluded that it continue s to find that the cost is reasonable given the visibility benefits.id.although in this case epa acknowledged the comment concerning incremental,it nevertheless still failed to explain what makes a cost reasonable in light of potential visibility benefits.
the rule emission limits for colstrip units and force ppl montana to spend an additional in capital costs and an additional annually to achieve a visibility improvement of deciviews at the sampled location.see id.this improvement very well may be necessary and ultimately.but epa has supplied no reasons justifying that determination.based on its explanation,the rule reader is left to wonder what rationale epa used to determine.again,the law requires a reasoned answer to that question.see state farm,at servheen,at nw.envtl.def,at.
by contrast,epa thoroughly and rationally explained its response to npca objection on this point.npca contends that epa should have considered requiring complete replacement of the existing control systems for emissions at colstrip units and.epa explained its decision not to do so its bart guidelines recommend constructing a new system when a current control system achieves less than percent removal efficiencies.final rule.at quoting regulations.at internal quotation marks omitted.the current emissions control system at colstrip units and achieves removal efficiencies exceeding percent,see proposed rule.at,and therefore epa is not required to consider replacement technology.see final rule.at.
this kind of explanation not elaborate,but rational,and thus adequate is missing from epa conclusion that ppl montana must install a fourth scrubber at colstrip units and.epa determination of bart to control emissions suffers the same failure of rational explanation as its bart determination for nox emissions.because the rule offers no reasoned explanation to support its requirement of a fourth scrubber at colstrip units and,we conclude that such requirement is arbitrary and capricious.
ppl montana also,relatedly,contends that epa bart determinations at colstrip units and are arbitrary and capricious because they are inconsistent with epa corette analysis,which does not require additional controls at that station,see final rule.at.ppl montana points out that epa rejected implementation of sofa at corette,but found similar costs for sofa installation justified at colstrip units and.see supra.npca,on the other hand,argues that epa conclusion that additional controls at corette were not was arbitrary and capricious.
the entirety of epa reasoning with respect to corette follows we have weighed costs against the anticipated visibility impacts for corette.any of the control options would have a positive impact on visibility however,the cost of controls is not justified by the visibility improvement.proposed rule.at.again,this reasoning fails to reveal to a reader how epa determined that the cost of controls were not justified.moreover,ppl montana is correct that this reasoning appears inconsistent with epa analysis for colstrip units and.at those units,epa concluded that a rate of approximately for nox emissions controls was justified.see supra.yet at corette,epa concluded that a rate of did not justify the potential emissions reductions.see proposed rule.at.corette,moreover,is closer to class i areas than colstrip,and emissions controls there could have improved visibility at least as much as they were set to control visibility at colstrip.see id.the seeming inconsistency in epa bart determinations at colstrip units and and corette is,absent explanation,the hallmark of arbitrary action.sierra club epa,see also chem.united states,per curiam finding analysis arbitrary and capricious because it was internally inconsistent and inadequately explained.
finally,ppl montana objects,on two grounds,to epa use of the visibility model in determining bart at colstrip units and.ppl montana first objects that the maximum potential incremental visibility benefit of sncr is below the range of perceptibility and falls within the model margin of error,meaning such improvement can not be reasonably anticipated as required by the act.see g.it also challenges the application of calpuff to the emissions sources at issue because of their distance from class i areas,contending the model is inaccurate at such great distances.
epa responds that,because the calpuff model was approved in the guidelines,epa need not defend its every application.see final rule.at.epa also responds that the regional haze rule itself anticipated and rejected ppl montana argument,reasoning that f ailing to consider contributions to visibility impairment would ignore the caa intent to have bart requirements apply to sources that contribute to,as well as cause,such impairment.final rule.at quoting regulations.at.epa further responds that it has acknowledged that there is uncertainty in the calpuff model predicted visibility impacts,and the calpuff model can both underpredict and overpredict visibility impacts,but that calpuff is a reasonable application to determine whether such a facility with an impact exceeding or deciviews can reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility.final rule.at quoting regulations.
epa fails to understand ppl montana first argument.ppl montana does not object wholesale to epa use of the calpuff model for visibility measurement.instead,it argues that the results the model predicts in this case are too insignificant for the model to measure,and therefore can not be reasonably anticipated as the act requires.during the notice and comment period,ppl montana argued that the maximum incremental visibility benefit to be gained by installing sncr at colstrip units and would be deciviews,an incremental improvement ppl montana contends falls within the calpuff model margin of error.epa responded by explaining that its regulation permits visibility improvements to be required even when visibility impacts fall below the threshold of perceptibility.see final rule.at.epa further responded that its regulations direct use of the calpuff model to estimate the percentile of visibility impairment,rather than the highest data collected,to minimize uncertainty in its calculations.see id.at.but ppl montana does not ask epa to discontinue application of calpuff below the perceptibility threshold,or to run the model using different data points than the ones selected it asks how calpuff explains epa conclusion that additional measures will lead to reasonable anticipation of visibility improvement in this case,when,ppl asserts,an improvement of deciview is beyond the calpuff model ability to predict with any confidence.
epa response does not meaningfully address ppl montana comment,as it must.see columbia falls aluminum epa,eagle picher,epa,i f the model is challenged,the agency must provide a full analytical defense.it is no answer to respond,as epa did,that low levels of visibility impairment must be addressed even though they are not perceptible to the human eye,or that measures have been taken to minimize the margin of error.the issue is not the perceptibility of the proposed improvements,but the model ability to anticipate improvements at a level allegedly within
