mallinckrodt,intervened in a comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla contribution action between the metropolitan louis sewer district msd and the environmental protection agency epa.mallinckrodt opposed the entry of a consent decree between the parties.over mallinckrodt objections,the district court entered the consent decree.thereafter,mallinckrodt filed motions for reconsideration based on newly discovered evidence pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure e and b.the district court denied these motions.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
background 
cercla grants the executive branch substantial authority and broad discretion to provide for the cleanup of sites.the government,however,does not bear the complete cost of site cleanup.cercla provides that monies spent by federal and state governments to clean up hazardous substances will,whenever possible,be recovered from responsible parties,including owners and operators of facilities where hazardous substances are disposed.
the united states spent cleaning up the contamination of hazardous substances at the great lakes container corporation superfund site the site in louis,missouri.from to,a facility that reconditioned used steel drums operated on the site.during this period,the site became contaminated with various hazardous substances.the larger portion of this site consists of a,roughly rectangular,parcel on which the drum reclamation facility was located.mallinckrodt operated a drum recycling plant there between and.prior to that time,mallinckrodt corporate predecessor ran the plant.the remainder of the site,just west of the former facility,is a parcel that was owned by the louis metropolitan bridge terminal railway company until msd bought the property for expansion of its secondary treatment facilities.however,msd never built additional facilities,and its property remained vacant.
in early,the epa invited msd and mallinckrodt to negotiate a settlement on the clean up costs.the epa initially assigned a share of approximately of the total cost to msd for clean up of the site.the epa concluded that msd was most likely a passive landowner that neither participated in nor profited from the contamination of its property by hazardous substances,even though approximately of the contaminated soil that was removed from the site,by volume,came from the tract owned by msd.after extensive negotiations,msd and the epa negotiated a consent decree,which required msd to reimburse the united states in response costs.this reduced msd share of the clean up costs to about of the total.
epa and msd filed this consent decree with the district court,and a public comment period ensued.during this period,the united states received comments from mallinckrodt,a defendant in a companion cercla case involving the same site,arguing that the amount to be paid by msd was too small and that mallinckrodt and other potentially responsible parties prps would be unfairly saddled with the remainder of the costs.since cercla provides for joint and several liability for all prps,any reduction in msd liability could increase mallinckrodt.mallinckrodt formally intervened in the district court case between msd and the epa and filed its opposition to the united states motion to enter the consent decree.after considering the parties briefing and argument,the district court entered the consent decree.
after entry of the consent decree,mallinckrodt timely filed a.e motion to alter or amend the judgment,alleging the discovery of new evidence.mallinckrodt claimed that an expert report prepared in its companion cercla case,which interpreted aerial photographs of the site,established that msd actively participated in the transportation and disposal of wastes on its part of the site mallinckrodt also submitted three documents it obtained from the epa in support of this claim.the district court denied mallinckrodt motion,stating that the evidence was not new.
after the district court denied its rule e motion,mallinckrodt filed a motion pursuant to rule b,asking the district court to reconsider.mallinckrodt claimed that counsel for msd and the epa made fraudulent statements at the hearing on the consent decree.the district court denied mallinckrodt rule b motion.mallinckrodt filed a timely notice of appeal of the district court entry of the consent decree and its rulings on the motions.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,mallinckrodt contends that the district court granted the consent decree settlement because msd falsely represented itself as a passive owner,and this misrepresentation prevented mallinckrodt from fairly presenting its objections.in addition,mallinckrodt suggests that newly discovered evidence establishes that msd actually materially contributed to the contamination,and this new evidence is both material and outcome determinative.specifically,mallinckrodt argues that the expert report submitted after the consent decree was entered,prepared by wayne grip,an expert in interpreting aerial photographs,established that msd was a substantial contributor to the contamination of the site.therefore,mallinckrodt contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying its motions for relief.we disagree and affirm.
rule e motion 
a district court has broad discretion in determining whether to grant or deny a motion to alter or amend judgment pursuant to rule e,and this court will not reverse absent a clear abuse of discretion.innovative home health care.of the black hills,cir.it should be noted that rule e motions serve the limited function of correcting manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.id.quoting hagerman yukon energy,cir.such motions can not be used to introduce new evidence,tender new legal theories,or raise arguments which could have been offered or raised prior to entry of judgment.id.to prevail on a rule e motion,the movant must show that the evidence was discovered after trial the movant exercised due diligence to discover the evidence before the end of trial the evidence is material and not merely cumulative or impeaching and a new trial considering the evidence would probably produce a different result.see xpress enter.hunt,cir discussing factors one must show to prevail under rule b,which are the same under rule e.
mallinckrodt argues that the district court should have granted its motion for a new trial pursuant to rule e based on newly discovered evidence,namely,the newly acquired grip analysis of msd activities on the site.first,mallinckrodt states that it did not discover the evidence that msd materially contributed to the contamination of the site until days after the judgment,when grip completed his expert report.second,mallinckrodt avers that it exercised due diligence to discover the evidence.mallinckrodt asserts that the focus of the hearing on the consent decree was whether msd knowingly allowed others to contaminate its whether msd itself had materially contributed to the contamination.the district court found that the documents and photographs underlying the grip report were in mallinckrodt possession or readily available prior to the consent decree.mallinckrodt responds by stating that this finding ignores the context in which mallinckrodt acted.mallinckrodt argues that it had no reason to doubt the epa and msd representations that msd had not contributed to the contamination.consequently,mallinckrodt claims that it had no reason to look for this evidence.
third,mallinckrodt suggests that this evidence is material,not cumulative,because it is the only evidence on the topic of msd contribution to the site contamination.for that same reason,mallinckrodt states that a new trial considering this new evidence would produce a different result.under cercla,the settlement is to reflect the relationship of the settlement figure to the proportion of the settling party waste.based on its purported new evidence,mallinckrodt claims msd settlement is unfair and contrary to the aims of cercla.it further avers that it has offered far more than speculation,and for that reason,the district court abused its discretion in denying its rule e moti
