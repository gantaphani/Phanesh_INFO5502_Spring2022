eight organizations representing environmental and fisheries interests sued the united states bureau of reclamation bor and the national marine fisheries service nmfs for injunctive and declaratory relief,alleging violations of the federal endangered species act esa.the lawsuit concerned the federal government efforts to operate an irrigation project in accordance with its responsibilities under the esa to protect the threatened southern oregon northern california coast soncc coho salmon and its habitat.on appeal,the pacific coast federation of fishermen associations and the other plaintiffs collectively referred to as pacific coast contend that the government actions are arbitrary and capricious,in violation of the esa.they argue that the government plan employs a phased approach but does not analyze how the first two phases,encompassing eight years of a ten year plan,will avoid jeopardy to the coho salmon.appellees,the federal agencies,and klamath water users association kwua urge that the plan reflects the agency best judgment in the face of scientific uncertainty and contains sufficient analysis to support the nmfs conclusion that its proposed action will avoid jeopardy to the coho.the district court struck down parts of the nmfs original plan,but upheld the eight years of measures that are the sole issue in this appeal.we conclude that the measures are arbitrary and capricious,and remand the case to the district court for the issuance of injunctive relief in accordance with this opinion.
legal and factual background 
a.the endangered species act 
this case requires us to review a biological opinion biop prepared by the nmfs as part of its obligations under the esa to ensure that federal actions in the operation of a federal irrigation project do not jeopardize anadromous fish species we begin with a brief overview of the esa and the consultation process so that the legal and procedural context of our review is clear.
the esa obligates federal agencies to afford first priority to the declared national policy of saving endangered species.valley auth.hill,d.section of the esa establishes a consultation process to insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by a federal agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat a.when an action has the potential to affect an anadromous fish species,the nmfs has responsibility for consultation.
before undertaking any action,the federal agency must determine whether any threatened or endangered species might be present in the area of the proposed action.id.at c.if such a species might be present,the agency must prepare a biological assessment to determine whether the species is likely to be affected by the proposed action.id.the biological assessment serves as a basis for the formal consultation with the nmfs.
during formal consultation,the nmfs must prepare a biological opinion,or biop,which determines the effects that the proposed action might have on the listed species or its critical habitat.id.at b a.if the nmfs determines that the proposed activity might cause jeopardy to a listed species or adversely modify its habitat,the agency must suggest reasonable and prudent alternatives rpas to the proposed action that would avoid jeopardy or adverse modification of habitat.id.the implementing regulation defines rpas as 
alternative actions identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action,that can be implemented consistent with the scope of the federal agency legal authority and jurisdiction,that is economically and technologically feasible,and that the director believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.
in this case,the nmfs determined that the bor proposed operation of a federal irrigation cause jeopardy to the soncc coho salmon,and it therefore developed the rpa that is at the heart of this appeal.
b.the klamath river basin and the klamath project 
the klamath river basin straddles northern california and southern oregon.at the center of this case is a fish population that is unique to the region,the soncc coho salmon.the soncc coho spawns and matures in the main stem and tributaries of the klamath river.
the klamath river basin supports a variety of agricultural activities that are possible in part because of irrigation water from the klamath project,a federally funded irrigation system established in the early century.the klamath project consists of a number of dams and reservoirs.the coho salmon population populates the main stem and tributaries of the klamath river until its passage is blocked by the iron gate dam,which is the component of the klamath project closest to the pacific ocean.the flows past the iron gate dam into the klamath river determine to a great extent the quantity of water available in the river.at issue in this appeal are the nmfs determinations regarding the quantity of water that the bor must release from behind the iron gate dam to the klamath river.
a number of factors make water management especially difficult in the klamath river basin.see generally pac.coast fed of fisherman ass ns bor,d,pcffa i kandra united states,d.the primary reservoir is relatively shallow,and is home to populations of two different species of endangered fish,known as suckers,that require maintenance of certain minimum water levels.kandra,d at.marshlands in two national wildlife refuges are irrigated by the klamath project to create bird habitat.id.at.several tribes in the area have treaty rights to klamath river fish,and the department of interior must meet the united states fiduciary duty to maintain these resources.id.at.numerous farmers have contracts for irrigation water that the bor must supply each growing season.pcffa i,d at.the klamath basin has been the focus of previous cases dealing with endangered species conservation and water use and management 
c.the soncc coho salmon 
the soncc coho ranges throughout the north pacific ocean.during the twentieth century,populations of coho declined substantially in california and oregon.the biop states that the number of wild coho in the klamath river is extremely low,and has been declining for most of the past two decades.the population of the soncc coho is estimated to have declined from an estimated range of to wild coho in the to fewer than wild coho in.the soncc coho salmon was listed as a threatened species under the esa in the major factors threatening the soncc coho include logging,grazing,dams,and water withdrawal for irrigation.the facts below are drawn from the nmfs description of the soncc coho life cycle and assessment of its habitat needs in the biop.
the soncc coho has a life cycle,spending half its life in fresh water and half in salt water.coho eggs typically hatch in march.coho fry emerge two weeks after hatching,and spend up to months in fresh water.the fry preferred habitat is shallow areas near stream banks.fry become smolt after months and migrate to the sea between march and june.after about three years,coho return to the same streams in which they were born to spawn,migrating upstream between september and february,and spawning between november and january.sufficient water flows must be available in the main stem of the klamath river to enable the fish to migrate upstream during september through february and to migrate downstream at maturity from march through june.habitat conditions in the main stem are also important because degraded habitat or low flow in tributaries causes coho fry to seek additional habitat in the main stem.
during the spring months,march through june,newly hatched fry need shaded habitat near stream banks and migrating smolt need sufficient water in the river to leave tributaries and migrate to the sea.the biop makes clear that nmfs considers these the most critical months in which to provide an adequate amount of water in the main stem because of the needs of the fry and smolt.the nmfs reports that studies in other basins show that increased flow during these months resulted in lower mortality due to migratory delay,predation,and exposure to potentially poor main stem habitat conditions.during the summer months,the primary concerns are to ensure that there is sufficient habitat in the main stem for juveniles displaced from tributaries by poor water quality or competition,and that the water temperatures are sufficiently cool.from october through february,the primary concern is maintaining sufficient water in the main stem for upstream migration and access to tributaries.the nmfs notes that in fall and winter water often flows freely past the iron gate dam,resulting in uncontrolled releases of water.
prior scientific assessments of the klamath river basin 
the biop at issue here is the product of several iterations of scientific study and review,including two previous biops and two government studies of the basin that reached conflicting conclusions.the nmfs issued the first biop for the klamath project in.at this time,a scientific assessment of the flow needs of anadromous species in the klamath river basin was released.known as phase i of the hardy report,that assessment provided interim recommendations on flow levels needed to support aquatic life.
in,a severe drought limited water availability in the basin.kandra,d at.two biops,one for the soncc coho and one for the other endangered fish that inhabit the reservoir,called for maintenance of high levels of water in both the reservoir and the main stem of the river.the bor complied with the biops and,as a result,did not deliver water to irrigators.significant agricultural losses followed.
following the dry irrigation season,the national research council nrc was asked by the department of interior to independently review the scientific and technical validity of the government biological opinions.the nrc report,released in february,found that there was no scientific support for the flow recommendations in the nmfs coho salmon biop.the report reviewed existing scientific literature and data on coho in the klamath river basin.it concluded that incremental depletions beyond those that are reflected in the recent historical record could be accomplished only with increased risk to coho salmon.at the same time,the available information provides little support for benefits presumed to occur through the increase of flows beyond those of the last decade.the conclusion questioned the validity of the biop.the nmfs requested clarification from the nrc,which responded that the nrc committee did not conclude that nmfs must be wrong in its recommendations on flows.in its biop,the nmfs attributed the conclusions of the nrc report to lack of information on distribution and abundance of coho and the lack of studies focused on coho and factors limiting its population in the klamath river basin.the nmfs did not dismiss the nrc report,but it did not adopt its conclusions in full.
phase ii of the hardy report was released in draft form in november.its conclusions about flow requirements conflict with those of the nrc the phase ii report,calling itself the best available science,used habitat modeling and estimates of the unimpaired flows in the main stem to arrive at a recommendation for flows for each river reach.the report determined that flows lower than approximately cubic feet per second cfs during the late summer would likely expose the soncc coho to dangerously high water temperatures,thereby increasing the risk of harm to the species.
e.the current biological opinion 
the process through which the current biop was created began when the bor prepared its most recent biological assessment in february.the bor proposed maintaining a flow regime that varied river flows by water year type,meaning that less water need be provided in years in which less precipitation has fallen in the region,reflecting natural variations in river flows.for each type of water year for instance,dry or wet,the bor used the historic average water flow for that type over the previous period to set its goals by type of year for the next ten years of operation.any available water beyond that needed to meet the goal would be allotted for irrigation.in addition,the bor would establish a water bank to store total acre feet of water to meet the flow requirements.
when the nmfs reviewed the proposed operations plan in the bor biological assessment to prepare the current biop,it determined that if the klamath project were operated as the bor intended,it would cause jeopardy to the soncc coho and adversely modify its critical habitat.the nmfs was concerned that the bor use of the minimum flow over the past ten years as the planning target for establishing monthly flows would drive down the average flow in the klamath river from below its average,which would lead to adverse effects to habitat and individual coho in the main stem.among the nmfs concerns were that decreased flows would reduce the amount of suitable coho fry habitat,make it more difficult for smolt to migrate downstream,and prevent adult coho from accessing tributaries during their upstream migration.in the biop,therefore,the nmfs developed an rpa to replace the bor proposed plan of operations.the rpa is the subject of the instant appeal.
the rpa covers operations for the klamath project from until.an organizing principle of the rpa is that the bor should bear responsibility only for the share of water losses caused by the klamath project.because the project irrigates percent of land in the basin,the rpa provided that the bor would provide percent of the water needed for the coho,and establish an intergovernmental workgroup to develop the other percent of the flows.the rpa permitted the bor to use a water bank to provide its share of the water.
the rpa is divided into three phases.phase i,lasting from through,calls upon the bor to gradually develop resources in the water bank,begin development of the intergovernmental task force,and conduct scientific studies.during phase i,the bor must provide,at a minimum,the flows that were established in its biological assessment,supplementing those flows in the spring summer by use of the water bank.
phase ii,which is to last from to,requires the bor increase the water bank to acre feet and provide the greater of the percent share or the flows proposed in the biological assessment.
during phase iii,which encompasses water years and,nmfs anticipates that percent of the salmon flow needs will be met through the bor percent share and the percent contribution from unspecified sources.the discussion in this section explains how the nmfs calculated the flow levels that it believed were necessary to avoid the likelihood of jeopardy to the coho.the agency determined that the species could withstand a percent reduction in habitat from what it would have received under an unimpaired flow regime,and calculated the flows that must be provided to achieve this quantity of habitat.the agency also determined that in summer months,flows of less than cfs would threaten coho in the main stem with dangerously high water temperatures,and required maintenance of flows of cfs or greater.
f.the proceedings below 
the litigation below began with an unsuccessful request by pacific coast for a temporary restraining order in response to interim measures initiated before the biop was finalized.the nmfs completed the final biop on may.after chinook,coho,and steelhead salmon died in an unexplained fish kill in the klamath river between september and,pacific coast filed an amended complaint against the federal defendants.
the parties filed for summary judgment,on which the district court ruled on july.the district court overturned a significant aspect of the rpa,finding the requirement that the bor provide only percent of the flows to be arbitrary and capricious.the court concluded that the nmfs had inappropriately considered the effects of actions that were not reasonably certain to occur when it determined that the coho would receive percent of the flows through a collaborative process.the federal defendants do not appeal this ruling,nor does pacific coast challenge the flow levels established for phase iii.
at issue in this appeal is the district court determination that phases i and ii of the rpa,or the measures,were not arbitrary and capricious.pacific coast challenged the flow levels established in phases i and ii,arguing that the phase i flows were the same flows rejected by the nmfs as insufficient in its review of the bor biological assessment and that the phase ii flows provided only percent of the flows that the nmfs recognized the coho required.the court acknowledged that the rpa does not explicitly engage in an analysis of what effect the water flows in phases i and ii,with the addition of the available water from the water bank,will have on the coho salmon or their critical habitat.however,the court found that the nmfs had determined that providing less water during the would not jeopardize the coho.the court reasoned 
t he statements by the nmfs do not reflect a conclusion that it is necessary to consistently provide of the target flows throughout each phase of the program in order to avoid jeopardy to the salmon.in fact,implicit in the rpa phased approach is the ultimate conclusion that maintaining a percentage of the flow rates with the additional water provided by the water bank during phase i and ii will not jeopardize the salmon or adversely modify their critical habitat,provided that the flow rates are eventually met by phase iii of the program.
the court ordered the nmfs to revise its biop to address the deficiencies identified in phase iii of the rpa,but specified that the biop and the rpa would remain in effect until a revised biop was issued.pacific coast timely filed the instant appeal.the federal defendants initially the decision to strike down phase iii,but voluntarily dismissed the appeal prior to briefing.

if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise,
the agency action may be overturned as unlawful.motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.
b.the rpa flow requirements are arbitrary and capricious 
the biop and its rpa govern the bor actions for ten years.however,the bor is not required to provide the full quantity of water that the nmfs deems necessary for the coho until year nine.during the first eight years of implementation,the bor is required to provide at most percent of the species total water needs.we must determine whether the nmfs decision to delay the provision of the full quantity of water for eight years is supported by the record before us.we conclude that it is not.the biop contains no analysis of the effect on the soncc coho of the first eight years of implementation of the rpa,and thus we can not sustain the agency decision.
phases i and ii can not be sustained on the basis of implicit reasoning 
the district court reasoned that the agency had implicitly considered,in imposing the rpa,that all phases would ensure against jeopardy to the coho.the federal defendants assert that the district court properly found that the adoption of the phased approach implicitly recognized the agency determination that such an approach would avoid jeopardy.
we can not adopt the district court reasoning.it is a basic principle of administrative law that the agency must articulate the reason or reasons for its decision.see,motor vehicle,at.sec chenery.gifford pinchot task force forest,cir.cattle growers ass fish wildlife,cir.although a decision of less than ideal clarity may be upheld if the agency path may reasonably be discerned,we can not infer an agency reasoning from mere silence rather,an agency action must be upheld,if at all,on the basis articulated by the agency itself.beno shalala,cir quoting motor vehicle,at.the agency is obligated to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.nrdc dep t of interior,cir internal citations omitted.
thus,the rpa can not be sustained,as the district court held,by reliance on the agency unstated assumptions about the effects of phases i and ii.in a recent esa case,we rejected a similar assertion that an agency implicitly recognized the central role of recovery in its critical habitat analysis,because when reviewing a biological opinion,we rely only on what the agency actually said in the biop to determine whether the agency considered the appropriate factors.gifford pinchot task force,at internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,in an esa case where we approved the use of a phased approach,we noted specifically that the agency analysis revealed that it considered the relevant factors and reasonably found that the species could survive the loss of habitat during a period in which an agency gradually acquired replacement habitat.ctr.for biological diversity bor,cir.to permit an agency to implicitly conclude that a species would not be jeopardized by a proposed activity,and not require the agency to articulate a basis for its conclusion,would reject the bedrock concept of record review.gifford pinchot task force,at.we thus examine the biop in its entirety to determine whether the agency path to its conclusion that phases i and ii of the rpa would avoid jeopardy to the coho may reasonably be discerned.motor vehicle,at.
the analysis of phases i and ii does not provide a reasoned explanation for the agency decision 
our review of the biop has been searching and careful,as we have attempted to identify the basis for the agency conclusions that the coho will not be jeopardized during the first two phases of the rpa.marsh,at.the agency analysis of the beneficial effects of the flows,in combination with the absence of analysis of the effects of the substantially lower flows,lead us to conclude that the reasoning behind the agency plan can not be reasonably discerned.in fact,the agency decision appears to conflict with the analysis in the biop.the biop contains no analysis that suggests that the agency determined that,during the period encompassed by phases i and ii,the coho would receive sufficient protection against jeopardy under the proposed plan of operations.
even the sections of the biop relied on by the federal defendants in their briefing and at oral argument to support their assertion that the agency provides extensive analysis of the effect of the rpa over the full period provide only minimal support for their argument.almost all of the analysis in the rpa is concentrated on justification of the flow requirement,and there is little substance to the discussions of
