appellants lincoln place tenants association lpta and ingrid mueller mueller appeal from judgment denying their petition for writ of mandate to compel the city of los angeles city and its agencies to enforce mitigation measures imposed pursuant to the california environmental quality act ceqa contained in a vesting tentative tract map the city agency issued to aimco venezia,llc aimco concerning the redevelopment of lincoln place garden apartments,and refusing to enjoin aimco from proceeding with ellis act evictions and unlawful detainer actions on the remaining tenants of lincoln place.the principal issues on appeal are whether the ellis act permits aimco to evict the tenants without complying with the mitigation provisions,and whether writ relief was properly denied in any event because the tenants could assert their claims aimco had failed to comply with the mitigation conditions as defenses to the unlawful detainer proceedings.we reverse.
factual background and procedural history 
the lincoln place garden apartments,built between and,is a large complex located in venice.the complex consists of apartments located in buildings,and incorporates open green spaces and landscaping on winding streets and.currently,only tenants remain in the complex.we discuss the history of the case as it relates to the mitigation conditions at issue 
the redevelopment project and the vtt 
in,aimco predecessor applied to the city for subdivision approval to demolish lincoln place,and replace it with condominiums and townhomes,townhomes,and rental apartments.the project was to be built over a period,with the low income apartments to be built first.
in,the city planning department published a draft environmental impact report eir.in april,after modifications,revisions and inclusion of new mitigation measures,the city planning department recommended certification of the final eir.in late and early,the planning commission held hearings on the project after the committee to preserve lincoln place and the lincoln place tenants association appealed the planning commission recommendation.after the hearings,the planning commission directed its staff to clarify the project conditions and eir mitigation measures to prevent the issuance of demolition permits unless each of the households affected by such permit are afforded the opportunity to relocate to a comparable or better vacant unit on site at no cost either for the move or in additional rent above the amount paid o n the unit scheduled for demolition thus,every household at the project site is guaranteed the right to remain at lincoln place in a comparable or better unit at their then current rent unless they choose voluntarily to move from the site in which event the applicant will still be obliged to provide relocation assistance.
in april,the city planning commission approved aimco vesting tentative tract map.the tenants and others appealed the approval,contending the project would remove affordable housing stock from the market.
in september,while the tenants appeal was pending,as part of its inducement to the city to approve the project,aimco predecessor developer wrote to the city,noting that current lincoln place buildings were nearing the end of their useful life expectancy and the site did not meet current code requirements for parking,access for the disabled,and energy or water conservation.further,t o ensure that existing tenants are not displaced,the applicant has made several unprecedented commitments,all of which are reflected in the planning commission project approval a.the project would be phased over a period of years no existing tenant would be involuntarily displaced from the site and no particular phase of the project would proceed unless every existing tenant in such phase could be supplied with an existing unit or a new unit at the owner cost.the developer further stated that all of the project tenant protection and affordable housing commitments were made voluntarily,and in the absence of any adopted city policy or regulation requiring greater or even similar mitigation.moreover,to the best of our knowledge,no other privately funded subdivision or condominium conversion project in the city of los angeles has ever provided greater tenant protection and affordable housing benefits.
in,after litigation relating to the removal of affordable housing from the market was resolved,the city referred the matter to its plum planning and land use management committee for review.the plum committee concluded that the eir was sufficient,and held public hearings on the project in november.the city approved the project based on the plum committee recommendation.in connection with the approval,on november,the city certified eir with its incorporated findings,conditions,and mitigation measures.the city approved the proposed subdivision of the property,and incorporated into vtt map the mitigation conditions of the eir.
the vtt relocation plan provided that p rior to the issuance of each building permit or demolition permit associated with the proposed project,the applicant will submit a relocation plan for review and approval by the general manager of the los angeles housing department.the relocation plan would permit current tenants of the complex to relocate to a comparable or better vacant unit at the project,or opt to receive the maximum relocation payment permissible under the city rent stabilization ordinance or to accept one of the newly constructed affordable rental units,including free moving costs.the relocation plan also provided for an informational program designed to notify existing lincoln place residents of their rights under the rso and the applicant relocation plan as approved by the city.aimco was required to maintain records of the relocation and actions taken by each of the existing lincoln place households,and to provide summary information annually to the general manager of the los angeles housing department throughout the development of the project 
the vtt stated that s ignificantly,the project conditions and eir mitigation measures prevent the issuance of demolition permits unless each of the households a ffected by such permit are afforded the opportunity to relocate to a comparable or better vacant unit on site at no cost either for the move or in additional rent above the amount paid in the unit scheduled for demolition.s ee advisory agency condition.thus,every household at the project site will be guaranteed the right to remain at lincoln place in a comparable or better unit at their then current rent unless they choose voluntarily to move from the site in which event the applicant will still be obliged to provide relocation assistance.accordingly,there is no possibility that the project will involuntarily displace current lincoln place tenants at any income level.
petitioners contend that aimco has not sent any of the lincoln place tenants los angeles city planning department form,required by mitigation measure,to be signed by the tenants and filed with the city.in addition,petitioners contend that none of the tenants has ever received a notice of relocation assistance package as set forth in condition,including a description of the relocation option to relocate to comparable or better vacant unit on site.the record does not reflect that aimco has kept records concerning tenant relocation in the fashion the vtt requires,or that it has provided the required information to the los angeles city housing department.
lincoln place ii 
in,aimco applied to the city for demolition permits lpta filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking to have the city set aside its approval of the project and to stay demolition of the units on the grounds that the city findings certifying the eir were inadequate because they failed to adequately consider the historical and cultural impact of demolishing the apartments.another party,the century architectural alliance,filed a petition seeking to set aside the demolition and to enjoin the issuance of further demolition permits contending the permits were issued in violation of ceqa.
lincoln place ii found that although the permits were properly issued under the city provisions relating to buildings of historical or architectural significance,the city failed to comply with ceqa when it issued demolition permits without requiring compliance with certain predemolition conditions that aimco take photographs of the complex and offer the buildings for sale of the vtt,and in failing to conduct ceqa review to determine whether the conditions were infeasible.lincoln place ii,supra,at,d.
in particular,we held that in the present case,the city failed to proceed according to law by permitting the owners of lincoln place to proceed with the demolition of structures on the property without complying with the predemolition conditions,without stating a legitimate reason for ignoring those mitigation measures,and without preparing and circulating a supplemental eir.for these reasons the demolition permits were unlawful and invalid and the trial court erred in denying alliance petition for a writ of mandate and an injunction to prevent further demolition until the owners complied the existing preconditions on demolition or the city modified or deleted those conditions through a supplemental eir.lincoln place ii,supra,at,d.
on remand,the trial court enjoined any further demolition of lincoln place.no public hearings have been held since july,to change any of the project conditions.
tenant evictions and the unlawful detainer actions.
in,aimco employed a relocation assistant who provided relocation consulting to the tenants of lincoln place.at that time,of the remaining units at lincoln place were occupied.from until july,the relocation assistant relocated tenants,all of whom executed voluntary relocation agreements and received relocation benefits and assistance.some tenants received mortgage assistance and became home buyers.many of the remaining tenants,including plaintiff mueller,refused relocation assistance.
in march,aimco began serving the remaining tenants with eviction notices,and filed ellis act notices with the city.the march,notice relating to plaintiff mueller relied exclusively on the rso for the authority to evict,and stated that she was eligible to receive in relocation assistance and the unit was to be vacated by july.aimco stated the justification for removing the unit from the rental market was that owner is removing the accommodations to withdraw the accommodations from the rental housing market.
in april,aimco sent a letter to lincoln place tenants stating that c ertain activists are providing wrong information implying that the ellis act evictions are flawed or illegal.the city of los angeles approved the ellis act evictions on march,two attempts to get historical designation for lincoln place have failed.the current second appeal lincoln place ii has no bearing on the legality of the ellis act and these activists are trying to confuse the two issues.these activists say that by signing up for the bonus relocation program you would lose your right of first refusal if aimco your unit.this is true,but irrelevant since aimco is tearing down all the buildings and is going out of the rental business on this entire property 
on may,aimco extended the right of certain tenants to remain until august.aimco continued to offer relocation assistance in the form of relocation to alternative housing offsite.a large number of tenants who had left lincoln place voluntarily contended that they had not been given the option of staying at lincoln place,and had they been given the option to remain at lincoln place by relocating to another apartment,they would have chosen that option.
in july,aimco commenced unlawful detainer proceedings against the remaining tenants as of august,there were unlawful detainer cases pending on appeal to the appellate department of the superior court.the unlawful detainer proceedings have been stayed pending this appeal.
in july,frieda and leslie marlin,tenants of the lincoln place apartments,filed a declaratory relief action against aimco challenging the propriety of aimco march ellis act notices.we reversed the court order granting the motion to strike the complaint.marlin aimco venezia,llc th,d.
on august,lpta and mueller filed a petition for writ of supersedeas,requesting this court to stay the unlawful detainer actions.on september,we denied their petition.
writ of mandate proceedings.
on june,lpta filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking to compel the city to comply with the mitigation measures adopted under ceqa in the vtt,and to enjoin aimco from evicting the remaining tenants from lincoln place.the petition alleged that aimco eviction notices constituted an unfair business practice under the ucl because they violated conditions and of the vtt and that the city failed to review the eviction notices pursuant to its duties under ceqa to ensure the mitigation measures were enforced.
lpta argued that the city failed to proceed in accordance with ceqa when it issued approval of the ellis act notices without requiring compliance with the conditions or conducting ceqa review to establish that the conditions were not prerequisites to eviction.furthermore,injunctive relief was required to stop the evictions because they constituted unlawful business acts under the ucl.finally,lpta argued that violation of mitigation conditions constituted an unlawful business practice.
aimco and the city opposed the petition,raising numerous arguments.aimco contended that lincoln place ii did not address its rights under the ellis act,but only precluded demolition where it had not complied with mitigation conditions the petition was barred by collateral estoppel because lincoln place ii established that only two mitigation conditions need be complied with taking photographs prior to sale and offering the structures for sale and that those conditions were preconditions to demolition only the unrecorded vtt is not binding and can not be used to interfere with aimco rights under the ellis act the ellis act does not implicate ceqa the ellis notices were privileged under civil code section the action was barred by the statute of limitations of public resources code section,subd.a plaintiffs were attempting to the unlawful detainer actions and plaintiffs were not entitled to an injunction because they had an adequate remedy at law to assert their claims in the unlawful detainer proceedings.
the city contended its receipt of the ellis act notices did not constitute an approval or authorization to evict under the ellis act,it could not condition aimco right to evict on compliance with conditions and it could only exercise powers impliedly granted it by laws other than ceqa the lincoln place ii opinion did not control because it applied to demolition permits the action was under public resources code section,subd.a and the vtt did not provide authority to enforce conditions and because the subdivider was not required to record the map the conditions did not apply until the map was recorded,and the map could expire before the conditions were complied with.
petitioners responded that civil code section,subdivision b did not contain a privilege to violate ceqa suit was not premature traditional mandate proceedings were required to enforce the mitigation measures the ellis act did not preempt the mitigation conditions lincoln place ii had already rejected the argument that the of the vtt affected its potency and the statute of limitations did not apply to an action challenging mitigation enforcement.
at the august,hearing,the court indicated it was reluctant to make any rulings inconsistent with those made in the unlawful detainer proceedings,and chastised petitioners counsel for failing,under code of civil procedure section,to point out the parallel proceedings in his brief where petitioners were requesting the same relief.petitioners argued that the issues differed in the mandate proceedings from the unlawful detainer proceedings because of the ceqa issues and because the city was not a party to the unlawful detainer proceedings.although petitioners argued that the evictions were contrary to the mitigation conditions,the court declined to issue a writ because it had already enjoined the demolition on remand pursuant to lincoln place ii,and it believed demolition was at issue in this case because aimco needed to evict the tenants to commence demolition.further,the trial court believed petitioners were trying to obtain a ruling contrary to those in the unlawful detainer proceedings,and that lamc section e provided that failure to give relocation assistance was a defense in an unlawful detainer proceeding.the court denied the petition and the request for a preliminary injunction.

i.the ellis act does not preempt enforcement of the ceqa mitigation.standard of review and principles of statutory construction.
this case requires us to consider the interrelation of ceqa,the ellis act,and to a lesser extent,the subdivision map act,et,to determine whether aimco had the absolute right under the ellis act to evict the remaining tenants of lincoln place.we address the issue of whether aimco could,through those ellis act notices and eviction proceedings against the remaining tenants of lincoln place,evade the ceqa mitigation conditions imposed by the city in connection with the lincoln place redevelopment project.we conclude it can not.

b.the ellis act.
the ellis act was the legislature direct response to nash city of santa monica cal d,nash,in which the supreme court upheld the rent control ordinance of santa monica despite the fact that its practical impact was to compel the landlord of a apartment to remain in the rental business.id.at,mosk,dissenting.at the core of the ellis act is the prohibition on this type of restraint on a landlord right to go out of the rental business no public entity shall,by statute,ordinance,or regulation,or by administrative action implementing any statute,ordinance,or regulation,compel the owner of any residential real property to offer,or to continue to offer,accommodations in the property for rent or lease,subd.a.
initially,case law strictly interpreted the ellis act consistent with its avowed purpose to permit landlords an unobstructed right to go out of the rental business.see.in city of santa monica yarmark d.yarmark,the landlord sought to evict tenants and withdraw his rental units from the market however,the city through section i of its city charter,prohibited eviction unless t he landlord seeks to recover possession to demolish or otherwise remove the controlled rental unit from rental residential housing use after having obtained all proper permits from the city of santa monica and met removal conditions specified in section t.id.at.yarmark concluded the ellis act preempted the ordinance because the ellis act,a matter of statewide concern,entirely occupied the field of substantive eviction controls over landlords.id.at.in passing the ellis act,the legislature has explicitly indicated it will tolerate no local measures providing substantive grounds for defenses in unlawful detainer actions brought by landlords who wish to go out of the business.id.at.yarmark did recognize that act contains explicit boundaries,leaving areas for local control in a fashion consistent with its terms.such boundaries included the right to regulate land use,and the conversion of rental units to condominiums.id.at.
a companion case to yarmark,supra,d,javidzad city of santa monica d.involved the same parties as yarmark.the landlord in javidzad sought to demolish the units.id.at.javidzad rejected the city arguments that the ordinance was a permissible local regulation of land use and therefore not in conflict with the ellis act.on the contrary,javidzad reasoned,the section at issue did not purport to regulate the use of the land subsequent to the withdrawal of the units and therefore conflicted with the ellis act.t he section does prescribe standards governing the board approval of a removal permit in the first instance and thus infringes on a landlord decision to go out of the rental housing business and thereby directly conflicts with the act.id.at.
lincoln place i,supra,th,d,addressed the city ordinance restricting the developer right to demolish the lincoln place apartments.the ordinance,among other things,prohibited the issuance of a demolition permit unless the landlord had city approval to build the project,namely,approved tract maps,or the landlord agreed not to build for years.id.at,d.lincoln place i held the ordinance unduly restricted the landlord right to go out of business,concluding that the city impermissibly infringed on the owner right to simply go out of the rental business in the first instance by refusing to issue a demolition permit based on conditions which are not a part of the ellis act the practical effect of the ordinance is that the plaintiffs will be compelled to remain in the rental business at that location.id.at,d.lincoln place i rejected the city argument the ordinance amounted to lawful local regulation under the ellis act,finding the ordinance did not simply regulate future use of the land.id.at,d.
first presbyterian church city of berkeley th,d first presbyterian dealt with the ellis act ramifications of two ordinances,the first a local neighborhood preservation ordinance placing limits on the demolition of rental units,and the second a local landmark preservation ordinance and a related eir regarding the proposed demolition of the removed units.id.at,d.with respect to the landmark preservation ordinance,first presbyterian upheld the ordinance.the city had affirmed the designation of the property at issue as a historical landmark,and required the preparation of an eir relating to its proposed demolition.subsequently,the church removed the property from the rental market by giving notice to the tenants pursuant to the ellis act,but did not prepare an eir.ibid.the trial court granted the city writ petition,finding that the ellis act entirely preempted the city demolition procedures including those under ceqa and concluded that the ellis act guaranteed the granting of an application for demolition as a purely ministerial action.id.at,d.on appeal,the court declined to read the ellis act to provide landlords seeking to demolish buildings a blanket exemption from all environmental and landmark preservation land use regulations.id.at,d.instead,the court found the landmark preservation ordinance did not conflict with the ellis act because it did not require the landlord who had been denied a demolition permit to continue to offer the property for rent.the ellis act is not intended to interfere with the police power of local governments to regulate land use.it is implicated only when the conditions or regulations sought to be imposed on a demolition permit would restrict a landlord right to remove units from the rental market and leave the rental business.id.at,d.
as a result of these cases,in the legislature amended the ellis act to expressly state it is not intended to p reempt local or municipal environmental or land use regulations,procedures,or controls that govern the demolition and redevelopment of residential property,subd.b.the legislative history indicates these amendments to clarify the scope of the ellis act reach were specifically directed at the holdings of javidzad,first presbyterian,and lincoln place i,among others.since the ellis act was adopted in,a string of court decisions has undermined the compromise reached in ellis between the rights of a property owner to remove rental units from the market and the ability of a local government to mitigate the effects of tenant displacement and to regulate the subsequent use of the property.housing comm.develop,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.april,comments,para.the amendments to the ellis act make it clear that local governments have authority to regulate the demolition of rental property and the authority to regulate the conversion of nonresidential use following its withdrawal from rent or lease.housing comm.develop,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended august,comments,para.

aimco may not proceed with the evictions because they are contrary to the mitigation conditions conditions and of the vtt and the evictions are not saved by resort to the ellis act.
to support its actions under the ellis act,aimco principally argues that the mitigation conditions of the vtt relate to demolition permits and do not implicate the relocation provisions or its right to go out of the rental business under the ellis act.aimco also argues that because the vtt was not recorded,its conditions are not binding.we conclude that the mitigation conditions imposed on this project do not conflict with aimco ellis act rights to go out of the rental business because aimco agreed to those conditions when it sought approval of its vtt the mitigation conditions do not impermissibly burden aimco right to go out of the rental business and the mitigation conditions,imposed under ceqa,fit within the ellis act express exception for local land use and environmental regulations 
aimco promised not to evict tenants from lincoln place as a condition of approval of the vtt.
ellis act jurisprudence concentrates on the landlord right to go out of business,unfettered by local controls except for reasonable relocation assistance provisions that have been upheld,such as those promulgated under the rso.aimco relies on this jurisprudence for its argument that it has complied with the mitigation conditions because it has provided what it considers to be relocation assistance that comports with the rso and the very generous hiring of a relocation specialist.however,aimco argument is misplaced because,long prior to its invocation of the ellis act,aimco agreed to additional mitigation above and beyond the rso to ameliorate the tenants displacement from their apartments,some of whom have lived at the lincoln place apartments for many years.throughout the approval process and the many public hearings held in this matter,community opposition to the project was very vocal,and as a result,aimco and its predecessor promised,over and over,that no tenant will be involuntarily displaced from lincoln place.further,aimco promised,to gain approval of its project,that the tenants would receive the right of first refusal on new units,or would be relocated to comparable units at lincoln place while the project was phased in.as a result,the vtt provides that t he relocation plan shall specify all operating details whereby existing households will be provided options for relocation,as follows accepting the applicant offer to relocate to a comparable or better vacant unit on site 
by their nature,evictions are involuntary and hence are contrary to the mitigation conditions of the vtt.aimco has to date attempted to avoid the restrictions to which it agreed and which were necessary to mitigate the impact of the project,by emptying the units of their tenants.it convinced a majority of the tenants,who may have been unaware of the scope of conditions and,to leave in there were approximately remaining through its relocation packages.once those tenants were gone,aimco commenced eviction proceedings against those tenants who refused to accept what it offered under the rso,believing they were entitled to more.nothing in the record shows any effort on aimco part to offer to relocate the remaining tenants to other units in lincoln place while the project is being built,or that it intends to offer them first refusal rights when the new units in the project are built.
it is inaccurate and misleading to characterize the mitigation conditions as being nothing more than what the rso guarantees.the language of the conditions that the tenants would be relocated to another unit does not refer to merely relocating the tenants off site as the rso relocation provisions permit.the vtt mitigation provisions evidence an intent that tenant displacement from lincoln place would be held to a minimum,and require no displacement in the absence of the tenants voluntary agreement to leave.throughout the approval process,tenants were told they could choose to remain on site this promise is memorialized in conditions and.eviction is inconsistent with these provisions.
furthermore,prior to commencing the evictions,aimco did not advise the city or the tenants that it intended to abandon the project on the contrary,as its arguments concede,the evictions are a prelude to proceeding with the project.its april letter to the remaining tenants evidences its continuing intent to proceed with the project the activists are saying that by signing up for the bonus relocation program you would lose your right of first refusal if aimco your unit.this is true,but irrelevant since aimco is tearing down all the buildings and is going out of the rental business on this entire property 
had aimco intent to proceed or the circumstances underlying the project changed,aimco could have sought to modify or delete the mitigation conditions if they had become impractical or unworkable.lincoln place ii,supra,th at,d see also napa citizens for honest government napa county bd.of supervisors th,d.as we suggested in lincoln place ii,although napa citizens did not specify the procedure to follow in deciding whether a mitigation measure is no longer feasible,because an initial determination a mitigation measure is infeasible must be included in the eir and supported by substantial evidence,it is logical to require a later determination a mitigation measure is infeasible be included in a supplemental eir and supported by substantial evidence.lincoln place ii,supra,th at,d,fns.omitted.however,there is no evidence in this record that aimco has sought to delete or modify the mitigation provisions of the vtt,or that they have become impractical or infeasible.
aimco argument that is it not bound by the terms of the unrecorded vtt is unsupported by any authority.nothing in the map act addresses the effect,or lack thereof,of an unrecorded map.on the other hand,the mitigation conditions and other conditions in the vtt constitute enforceable covenants under ceqa,to be fulfilled before the final map may be recorded thus,both statutory schemes operate in harmony to compel the conclusion that mitigation conditions are to be fulfilled before final maps may be recorded.aimco can not attempt to defeat the conditions it imposed upon itself in order to obtain approval of the vtt by ignoring such conditions or attempting to render them meaningless by moving ahead with the project in spite of them.see bakersfield citizens for local control city of bakersfield th,d.such conduct amounts to piecemealing,a practice ceqa forbids.lincoln place ii,supra,th at,d.ceqa requirements can not be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into pieces which,individually considered,might be found to have no significant effect on the environment or to be only ministerial.footnote omitted.ibid.
the mitigation conditions here are within the ellis act exception for local land use and environmental controls.
under rules of statutory construction,we must construe ceqa and the ellis act together and harmonize them.drouet superior court cal th,d.the amendment to the ellis act clarifies that it does not preempt local or municipal environmental or land use regulations,procedures,or controls that govern the demolition and redevelopment of residential property,subd.b.the ellis act also provides it does not diminish or enhance any power which currently exists or which may hereafter exist in any public entity to grant or deny any entitlement to the use of real property,including,but not limited to,planning,zoning,and subdivision map approvals,subd.b.the ellis act further exempts from its reach the power of any public entity to mitigate any adverse impact on persons displaced by reason of the withdrawal from rent or lease of any accommodations,subd.c.
in drouet superior court,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court considered whether state statutes governing defenses that could be raised in unlawful detainer actions conflicted with the ellis act.drouet held that the defense of retaliatory eviction set forth in civil code section may be asserted in an unlawful detainer action brought in an ellis act action.id.at,d,
in so doing,drouet carefully balanced the competing interests of a tenant seeking to avoid a wrongful eviction brought under the guise of the ellis act with a landlord bona fide intent to go out of the rental business under the ellis act,requiring the two statutes to be harmonized.we must do the same here with ceqa,which is made relevant here by the ellis act explicit exceptions for a public entity power to regulate,among other things,planning,subdivision map approvals,the demolition and redevelopment of residential property,and the mitigation of adverse impacts on persons displaced by reason of the withdrawal of rental accommodations.such items are the common focus and byproducts of the ceqa process,as they were in the case here.we therefore conclude that ellis act does not preempt,and must be applied subject to,the mitigation conditions here.
the mitigation conditions of the vtt do not impermissibly burden aimco right to go out of the rental business.
the mitigation conditions of the vtt,to which aimco agreed,do not impermissibly burden its right to go out of the rental business because it may,upon completion of the conditions to which it agreed,exit such business with respect to the units at issue.the conditions permit the tenants to remain at lincoln place while the project is built out,are not particularly onerous,and do not preclude aimco from ultimately going out of the rental business at the site 
we reject any argument that because aimco complied with the rso ellis act provisions and relocation benefits,it may go out of the rental business without reference to conditions and of the vtt.aimco specifically agreed to additional conditions in the vtt to mitigate the demolition of a very large apartment complex that had been part of the community for many years,the removal of more than units from the marketplace,and the displacement of those tenants,in order to get permission to redevelop the land.it may not now act as if those events never occurred.
ii.the scope of the unlawful detainer proceedings is inadequate to address the ceqa issues here,and a writ must issue.
here,the trial court denied writ and injunctive relief on the grounds that the tenants could obtain the necessary relief by raising as defenses to eviction aimco alleged with the mitigation conditions.however,the court erred.the city,as the entity responsible for enforcement of the mitigation conditions,is an indispensable party to any proceedings respecting the enforcement of the mitigation conditions of the vtt.
a.the city is not a party to the unlawful detainer actions.
unlawful detainer actions are necessarily expedited because of the limitations imposed on pleadings and issues that may be litigated.the only triable issue is the right to possession and incidental damages resulting from the unlawful detention.underwood corsino th,d glendale fed.bank hadden th,d.affirmative defenses may be asserted only to the extent they might defeat the landlord right to possession.see,green superior court cal d,warranty of habitability defense schweiger superior court cal d,retaliatory eviction minelian manzella d.excessive rent in violation of rent control.
the enforcement of the mitigation measures of the vtt does relate to the tenants possessory rights to the units,because pursuant to the vtt,aimco may not evict them.however,determination of the enforceability of the mitigation measures under ceqa requires more than an evaluation of law.further,to address the ceqa issues,the city joinder is required because it is the party responsible for enforcement of the ceqa mitigation measures.code of civ,subd.a countrywide home loans,superior court th,d.the introduction of these issues and an additional party into the proceedings would improperly and unnecessarily expand the scope of the summary unlawful detainer proceedings beyond mere issues of possession.knowles robinson cal d.
b.the trial court is directed to issue a writ and injunction.
where a public agency has failed to comply with ceqa,the trial court must vacate the ceqa determination,finding or decision in whole or in part if the court finds that a specific project activity will prejudice the consideration and implementation of mitigation measures or project alternatives and could result in an adverse physical environmental change,mandate that the agency and any real party in interest suspend specific activity until the agency complies with ceqa mandate that the agency take specific action necessary to comply with ceqa.pub.resources code,subd.a.the court must specify what specific action by the agency is necessary to comply with ceqa pub.resources code,subd.b,but can not direct the agency to exercise its discretion in a particular way pub.resources code,subd.c.federation of hillside canyon associations city of los angeles,supra,th at,d.
here,the city failed to enforce the mitigation conditions placed on the project when it failed to monitor whether the measures were being complied with,and when it permitted the ellis act notices to be filed without taking action to determine whether such notices were valid.at issue here is whether the city was enforcing the mitigation conditions,not whether it approved the ellis act notices.we therefore reject the city contentions that it could not approve the ellis act notices because the rso does not require it to do anything in response to such notices.as discussed above,the mitigation conditions imposed a greater duty on the city than to sit idly by while aimco improperly attempted to evict the tenants.
further,the city argues that it had no notice that aimco was evicting the tenants,it had no mechanism by which to prevent aimco from evicting the tenants,it had no powers under ceqa to do anything,and that the vtt was just a proposal and not binding on anyone.these arguments find no support in this record,or in the law.first,the ellis act notices at the very least put the city on inquiry notice concerning the propriety of aimco actions.second,the city had the authority to enforce the mitigation measures through legal action to compel ceqa compliance.finally,the vtt was more than a proposal it was the document embodying the city approval of the final eir of the project and was the prelude to the recordation of the final tract map.
we reject the city contention that the matter is moot.the city argues that the trial court can no longer grant the relief requested by petitioners because i n the hope of precluding an unnecessary appeal,the trial court sweepingly declared the rights of tenants to assert as an affirmative defense in any action by aimco to recover possession the landlord failure to satisfy relocation assistance conditions,and the judgment of the trial court declares with finality that the tenants of lincoln place have all of the protections against evictions without relocation assistance which they sought to obtain through writ of mandate.the city misconstrues the mootness doctrine a final judgment does not render an issue moot.rather,a case becomes moot when a court ruling can have no practical effect or can not provide the parties with effective relief.californians for alternatives to toxics department of pesticide regulation th,d.here,nothing in the unlawful detainer proceedings can or will resolve the issue of ceqa compliance therefore,this court ruling will have a practical effect on compliance with the mitigation conditions and provide relief to the tenants.
we need not reach petitioners unfair competition law claims to determine that the evictions must be enjoined.as discussed above,consistent with ceqa and the ellis act,aimco may not evict the tenants without first complying with the mitigation conditions of t
