between and,the united states produced plutonium for use in nuclear weapons manufacture at the hanford nuclear reservation in southeastern washington near the confluence of the columbia,snake,and yakima rivers.plutonium production and related activities at hanford created enormous the millions of radioactive,hazardous,and mixed radioactive and hazardous wastes,much of it still at hanford awaiting treatment disposal.the department of energy doe is responsible for the treatment,storage,and disposal of this vast waste inventory.this suit arises out of a longstanding dispute between the state and doe concerning doe management of hanford existing backlog of mixed radioactive and hazardous waste,commonly known as trum,and doe decision to ship additional trum to hanford for storage pending the future disposal of such waste at the waste isolation pilot plant wipp,a nuclear waste repository in southeastern new mexico where the wastes are expected to be placed in a salt bed approximately feet below the earth surface.
the state contends that doe management of this trum violates provisions of the state hazardous waste management act hwma and its implementing regulations,which act in lieu of the federal provisions of the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra.see,authorizing the state of washington to administer its hwma in lieu of rcra.admin.code a doe argues that it no longer has an obligation under hwma to treat trum waste or to limit the length of time such waste is stored at hanford or any other location,because the waste has been designated by the secretary of energy for disposal at wipp,in accordance with the wipp land withdrawal amendment act of,a also referred to as the wipp amendments or the amended act.
after agreeing to dismiss without prejudice counts and of the state amended complaint,the parties filed for summary judgment on the remaining claim of whether trum designated for wipp was exempt from hwma provisions by virtue of the amended act.the district court rejected doe interpretation of the amended act and found that neither the plain text nor the legislative history demonstrated that the designation exemption reached waste at any location other than wipp.see washington abraham,d.because the district court found that the amended act applied only to wipp,it declined to reach the preemption issue and awarded summary judgment for the state.id.we review de novo,and affirm.
background 
among the wastes generated during plutonium production at hanford were large quantities of transuranic waste.transuranic consists of a variety of materials,including tools,equipment,protective clothing,rags,graphite,glass,and other material contaminated during the production and reprocessing of waste that has been contaminated with radioactive elements and carries a periodic table value greater than uranium.although it is less radioactive than spent fuel or waste,it is toxic and longlived.when transuranic waste is mixed with hazardous waste,such as solvents or heavy metals,the resulting waste is known as mixed transuranic waste,or trum.there are at least drums and large boxes of suspected trum in retrievable storage shallow,unlined soil hanford,all of which has yet to be treated or properly disposed.because trum contains hazardous waste in addition to being radioactive,its storage,treatment,and disposal is regulated under subtitle c of rcra,which was enacted by congress in order to subject hazardous waste like trum to stringent regulation united technologies epa.because rcra,and its counterpart the federal facilities compliance act ffca are crucial to our inquiry as to the effect of the designation exemption in the amended act,we begin our discussion there.
rcra subjects trum to both safe storage requirements and land disposal restrictions the land disposal restrictions ldrs were added to subtitle c of rcra by the hazardous and solid waste amendments of hswa,as part of the solid waste disposal act swda,see rcra b m,b m.the swda amended rcra to ensure that hazardous waste will only be if the waste involved as well as the disposal unit meet very stringent requirements.land disposal of hazardous waste is prohibited unless that waste is pretreated in a manner that minimizes and threats to human health and the environment,rcra m,m or unless the epa determines,with a reasonable degree of certainty,that there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from the disposal unit or injection zone for as long as the waste remain s hazardous.rcra d,e,and g,d,e,and g.further,epa regulations governing land disposal of hazardous waste requires comprehensive waste analysis and to certify that a waste is eligible for land disposal,specifies treatment standards for the land disposal of restricted waste,and specifies procedures for obtaining exemptions.with respect to exemptions,the epa anticipated that there would be relatively few cases in which a demonstration can be made,and that,if approved,after a formal rulemaking process,the determination would apply only to the land disposal of the specific restricted waste at the individual disposal unit and would not apply to any other restricted waste at that disposal unit,or to that specific restricted waste at any other disposal unit.i see also id.at a requiring an identification of the specific waste in the petition,including a waste analysis of the subject waste.
the ldrs also prohibited around the prohibitions on land disposal by preventing trum from being stockpiled in storage.these storage prohibitions restrict storage to that which is solely for the purpose of the accumulation of such quantities of hazardous waste as are necessary to facilitate proper recovery,treatment or disposal.rcra j emphasis added,j the amount of time a facility can store waste is limited to one year unless the facility can prove that further storage is required in order to facilitate the proper recovery,treatment or disposal under j.see b c congress enacted this provision because it believed that permitting storage of large quantities of waste as a means of forestalling required treatment would involve health threats equally serious to those posed by land disposal,and therefore opted in large part for a treat as you go regulatory regime.hazardous waste treatment council epa.under this regime,accumulation of untreated waste for the purpose of reducing or closing other sites is strictly prohibited.see,edison inst.epa,rejecting a reading of j that would allow the accumulation and storage of wastes until qualified treatment or disposal capacity becomes available.
congress emphasized its intention to apply this treat as you go framework to federal the federal facility compliance act ffca,see,title i,a,b,stat,codified in scattered sections throughout.the ffca was enacted specifically to motivate recalcitrant officials at federal facilities into addressing the continuing backlogs of stored,untreated,mixed waste subject to rcra strict storage prohibitions.see,at,as reprinted in.in particular,the ffca waived sovereign immunity for the operation of federal facilities and clarified that states could impose civil fines on federal facilities for violations of rcra.see ffca a.the ffca also provided that with respect to trum at doe facilities,doe could avoid the fines and penalties associated with rcra violations so long as it developed site treatment plans including detailed management schedules regarding the treatment and storage of various the waste backlogs submitted those treatment plans for mixed waste to the states for approval,modification,or disapproval and maintained compliance with those plans.see ffca c b,codified in rcra.
at the time ffca was enacted,doe and the state of washington already had a plan,the hanford federal facility agreement and consent order hffaco,which satisfied the requirement of a site treatment plan under b a ii.it is through the development and maintenance of the hffaco that the state and doe conferred as to,among other materials,the resolution of hanford substantial backlog of trum,which was otherwise being the additional shipments of offsite violation of rcra j 
the same year ffca was enacted to deal with the enormous backlogs of nuclear waste at federal facilities,congress also proceeded with plans for opening another federal waste repository in southeastern new mexico known as wipp.see,stat.authorizing the development of the wipp site.due to its unique,salt formations,wipp promised to be a safe and permanent repository for a substantial fraction of the nation transuranic waste.the wipp land withdrawal act of wipp act,stat,withdrew the site from public use,continued the test phase,and established a number of regulatory requirements that doe was required to meet before wipp could receive transuranic wastes for permanent disposal.see wipp act.in particular,the wipp act required that wipp,like any other facility,comply with a number of existing regulatory frameworks,including the ldrs that had been added to rcra by the swda.see id.at a c see also b the statute savings provision,stating that the wipp act did not supersede or modify the land disposal restrictions that were part of the swda 
four years later in,in compliance with a c of the wipp act and in light of wipp unique geologically stable salt formations,doe petitioned the epa under rcra d c for a no migration determination with respect to wipp.see,the import of this determination,like the determination that had been approved for the testphase of wipp,was that,if approved,it would allow wipp to comply with rcra land disposal restrictions by demonstrating that hazardous constituents will not migrate out of the wipp disposal unit for as long as the wastes remain hazardous a regulatory period of up to years.id.
while the no migration determination was pending,however,congress amended the wipp act by passing the wipp land withdrawal act amendments wipp amendments,stat.the effect of several of those amendments on hazardous waste at hanford is what is in controversy here.
ii.discussion 
the wipp amendments accomplished a number of objectives related to the wipp facility they eliminated outdated statutory requirements regarding the of wipp continued the epa obligation to establish criteria for determining compliance with its disposal regulations and inserted a number of provisions designed to expedite the commencement of wipp operations doe argues that the wipp amendments also established that trum not located at trum at hanford or intended for shipment to exempt from the storage prohibition in j.according to doe,such waste has been designated by the secretary of the department of energy for disposal at wipp,see a,and therefore,trum is no longer prohibited from one or more methods of land disposal as required for the storage prohibition in j to take effect doe alleges that as long as the waste has been so designated,and virtually all of the trum waste at hanford has been designated doe has no obligation under the state hwma to treat such waste or to limit the length of time it is stored at hanford,or any other location,prior to disposal at wipp.
doe argues that the plain language of the designation exemption in a read in conjunction with rcra j requires that this court adopt its interpretation of,and alternatively,that its interpretation of the designation exemption is entitled to substantial deference under chevron natural resources defense council,d,skidmore swift,or auer robbins,d.under chevron and its progeny,we first determine whether congress has spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if we,after employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertain that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.id.at.
these tools of construction require us first to engage in a textual analysis of the relevant statutory provisions and to read the words of statutes in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.if the proper interpretation is not clear from this textual analysis,the legislative history offers valuable guidance and insight into c ongressional intent.however,it is well established that legislative history which does not demonstrate a clear and certain congressional intent can not form the basis for enjoining regulations.

a.the text of section a 
we begin our analysis with the language of a and the statutory provisions invoked by that section.doe argues that the designation exemption plainly applies to wastes not at wipp.to determine what is plain,a court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and the design of the statute was a whole.mccarthy bronson,d.phrases that may seem ambiguous in isolation may be clarified by statutory context.united sav.ass timbers of inwood forest,d scalia,for the majority a provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.
section of the original wipp act is titled compliance with environmental laws and regulations,and provides that b eginning on the date of the enactment of this act,the secretary of energy shall comply with respect to wipp with the federal statutes and regulations listed in subsections a through h.see.while there is no question that the wipp act subjected the wipp facility to a panoply of environmental regulation including the ldrs the wipp amendments added exemption language to section,on which doe now relies.
that language is found in subsection a,after and below subparagraph h.in its entirety,the amended section a provides 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations.
a in general.
on the date of the enactment of this act,the secretary shall comply with respect to wipp,with 
a the regulations issued by the administrator establishing the generally applicable environmental standards for the management and storage of spent nuclear fuel,radioactive waste,and transuranic radioactive waste and contained in subpart a of part of title,code of federal regulations 
b the clean air act et 
c the solid waste disposal act et

e the toxic substances control act et 
f the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of et 
g all other applicable federal laws pertaining to public health and safety or the environment and 
h all regulations promulgated,and all permit requirements,under the laws described in subparagraphs b through g.
with respect to transuranic mixed waste designated by the secretary for disposal at wipp,such waste is exempt from treatment standards promulgated pursuant to section m of the solid waste disposal act m and shall not be subject to the land disposal prohibitions in section d,e,f,and g of the solid waste disposal act.
a emphasis to the amendment added.
doe argues that this amendment,which exempts designated trum waste from the land disposal prohibitions,and by extension the identical hwma provisions,establishes that doe no longer has an obligation to treat designated trum waste or to limit the length of time such waste is stored at hanford or any other location prior to disposal at wipp.
doe first argues that the doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius requires us to adopt its interpretation of the designation exemption.this doctrine requires that where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.see beach fed.bank,d internal citations and quotations omitted emphasis added.the cases that doe cites in support of its proposition,however,are not on all fours with the present case,because they do not involve differences in language within the same statutory section.see id.explaining that because a statutory right of rescission could cloud a bank title on foreclosure,that congress may well have chosen to circumscribe that risk in one part of the statute,while permitting recoupment damages regardless of the date a collection action may be brought in another part of the statute.or.natural res.council,kantor,cir finding that because the section discussing the deadline for publishing the final regulation does not mention the filing of the petition,the fact that the filing of the petition is mentioned in another section does not preclude a plain text reading of the publishing deadline.
unlike the cases cited by doe,the exemption language here falls within the a subsection,as congress confirmed when,in the savings provision of the wipp amendments,congress specifically referred to the exemption,described in section a.see further,a begins by stating that as of the date of the enactment of this act,the secretary of energy shall comply with respect to wipp,with the federal statutes and regulations in the subsequent subparagraphs.the plain and undisputed interpretation of this language is that the wipp facility must be in compliance with the enumerated environmental regulations.the second phrase with respect to trum is a of section a with respect to wipp.congress decision to place the designation exemption at this location indicates that it meant for the designation exemption to apply only with respect to wipp.
doe also asserts that we must adopt its interpretation of the designation exemption in order to give meaning to the phrase w ith respect to trum designated by the secretary for disposal at wipp in relation to the introductory phrase of section a,with respect to wipp.s tatutes must be interpreted,if possible,to give each word some operative effect.andreiu ashcroft,cir en banc quoting walters metro.educ,d.doe argues that in order to give meaning to the word designate and the designation process itself,we must assume that congress included the word designate to distinguish the scope of the designation exemption from the scope of the introductory phrase with respect to wipp.as a result,we would have to read the designation exemption as applying to wastes not at wipp,as opposed to only applying the exemption with respect to wipp.
our reading of the language and the design of the statute as a whole,mccarthy,at,however,conflicts with this interpretation and compels the opposite the designation exemption extends only to wastes at wipp.first,the wipp amendments as a whole are entirely focused on the ongoing establishment of the wipp site as a depository for transuranic waste.the language and design of the statute as amended pertain solely to wipp.no section of the statute deals with the conditions,contents,or schedules for the cleanup of wastes stored elsewhere.all references to the existing regulatory schemes,with the exception of the designated waste in question,emphasize that such regulations,without revision or exception,pertain to wipp.
further,the treatment standards from which waste designated for disposal at wipp is exempt are critical.such waste is exempt from treatment standards promulgated pursuant to section m of the solid waste disposal act and shall not be subject to the land disposal prohibitions in section d,e,f,and g because the treatment standards are relevant for wastes subject to land disposal prohibitions,rcra m,we turn to the land disposal prohibitions to which the exemption refers.
all of these prohibitions are plainly.a waste is not subject to land disposal prohibitions only if there is a reasonable degree of certainty,that there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from the disposal unit or injection zone for as long as the waste remain s hazardous.rcra d,e,g emphasis added.the epa regulations implementing these provisions are just as transparent.the regulations explain that determinations apply only to the land disposal of the specific restricted waste at the individual disposal unit and do not apply to any other restricted waste at that disposal unit,or to that specific restricted waste at any other disposal unit.i emphasis added.accordingly,an exemption from the prohibition from land disposal is contingent both on the identification of a specific restricted waste and the identification of a specific disposal unit.
the designation exemption does not,itself,specify the disposal unit where the waste will actually be exemption provides only that waste be designated for disposal at wipp but we need not look far to determine the unit from which congress intended to exempt the designated waste.congress explicitly identified the individual disposal unit when it chose to place the designation exemption within a with respect to wipp.doe position is not to the contrary.in fact,doe acknowledges in its opening brief that by amending the wipp act to include the designation exemption,congress in effect granted doe the determination that would have been required under rcra.with this acknowledgement,doe appears to recognize that congress did identify a disposal unit,and that designation of waste for disposal at wipp allows doe to only and ultimately dispose of the waste at wipp.throughout this litigation,doe has never,in fact,argued that the designation exemption allows doe to untreated but designated waste elsewhere on the basis that the designation itself establishes that the waste is no longer prohibited.
with respect to the storage prohibition,however,doe reverses course and argues that the designated waste escapes rcra storage prohibition wherever that waste may be located.doe arrives at this conclusion by reasoning that because the storage prohibition applies only to hazardous waste which is prohibited from one or more methods of land disposal,see rcra j,and designated waste is not prohibited from land disposal at wipp,the waste is in fact no longer prohibited.
this argument is not persuasive.first,by specifically invoking the narrow scope of the land disposal prohibitions at d,e,and g and nowhere mentioning the storage prohibition at j congress established that the waste designated by the secretary for wipp is exempt from the treatment standards and the land disposal prohibitions with respect to wipp.that is precisely what a determination would have accomplished.because an exemption for wipp says nothing about removing the land disposal prohibition from designated wastes at other locations,the logical consequence of congress action is that the wastes not at wipp continue to be prohibited from one or more methods of land disposal and that the land disposal restrictions,including the storage prohibition,apply at those locations.
doe attempts to rebut this argument by alleging that a successful determination renders the storage prohibition inapplicable to waste wherever such waste may be stored.this argument is without merit.doe citations to the federal register and the code of federal regulations,see,d,september,are inscrutable.they provide no support for the proposition that a determination for one location has the effect of excluding from the storage prohibition similar waste that is located at other locations.rather,the sum of these citations merely stands for the principle that if the identified waste is stored at an identified no migration location,and a petition for a determination is successful,that waste can be stored at that location without violating rcra storage prohibitions,so long as the determination is valid.
after reading the language of designation exemption in the context of the statute as a whole,we conclude that doe interpretation of the designation provision is not compelled by the plain meaning of the statute.the land disposal prohibitions enumerated in the designation exemption simply provide no basis on which to conclude that the specified provisions permit exemptions for itinerant waste or waste wherever such waste may be located.doe argument along such lines,which is not a position made explicit in any of doe records of decision designating waste for disposal at wipp,nor supported by any reference to the statute implementing regulations or to case law,is not compelled by the plain text of of the wipp amendments and is incompatible with the land d
