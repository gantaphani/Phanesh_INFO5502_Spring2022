the national corn growers association,the national sunflower association,the national potato council,and fmc corporation petition for review of the order of the environmental protection agency denying their objections to the epa final regulation revoking all tolerances for the pesticide carbofuran.we grant the petition for review in part and accordingly vacate the epa final rule to the extent it revoked import tolerances for carbofuran.we deny the petition for review in all other respects.
background 
the epa regulates pesticides pursuant to two federal statutes the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act fifra,u.et,and the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act ffdca.the fifra establishes a registration system under which the epa controls the sale,distribution,and use of pesticides.no one may sell a pesticide unless it has been properly registered with the epa,pursuant to the fifra,for a particular use,which requires showing that,so used,the pesticide will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.c c.
pursuant to the ffdca,the epa determines the maximum amount of a pesticide residue,which the statute terms a tolerance,that may remain on or in raw and processed food.the epa may establish or leave in effect a tolerance only if it is safe,that is,only if 
there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue,including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.
b a.absent an exemption from the administrator of the epa pursuant to c,a provision not here at issue,any food containing a pesticide residue that exceeds an established tolerance is deemed unsafe and adulterated and may not be moved in interstate commerce.id,a b.
the agency is required to modify or revoke an existing tolerance it later determines is not safe,id.b a i,which it does by way of a process.first,in what we refer to as the comment stage,it publishes a notice of the proposed revocation,provides a period for public comment and,having taken the comments into consideration,issues a final regulation.id.e.second,in what we refer to as the objection stage,any person may file an objection to and request a public evidentiary hearing on the final regulation,after which the epa issues an order stating the action taken upon each such objection and request and setting forth any revision to the regulation the administrator has found to be warranted.id.g.the ffdca requires that an objection specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and stat e reasonable grounds therefor.id.g a.the act requires the epa to hold a hearing only if and to the extent the administrator determines that such a public hearing is necessary to receive factual evidence relevant to material issues of fact raised by the objections.id.g b.under the epa implementing regulations 
a request for an evidentiary hearing will be granted if the administrator determines the material submitted shows the following 
there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact for resolution at a hearing.an evidentiary hearing will not be granted on issues of policy or law.
there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would,if established,resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor an evidentiary hearing will not be granted if the administrator concludes that the data and information submitted,even if accurate,would be insufficient to justify the factual determination urged.
resolution of the factual issue s in the manner sought would be adequate to justify the action requested.an evidentiary hearing will not be granted on factual issues that are not determinative with respect to the action requested.
in the epa concluded,in a dietary risk assessment,that human exposure to carbofuran,a pesticide used to control insect infestations in a number of crops,is above the agency level of concern.the epa sought to limit exposure to carbofuran by revoking all tolerances under the ffdca,which action would effectively ban the use of carbofuran on both domestic and imported food for human consumption.referencing its earlier risk assessment,the epa stated in the notice of proposed revocation that aggregate dietary exposure to residues of carbofuran is not safe.carbofuran proposed tolerance revocations,july,hereinafter proposed revocation.specifically,the epa concluded estimated exposure from food alone,as well as from food and water,significantly exceed s epa level of concern for children and estimated exposure for both children and adults who receive their drinking water from vulnerable sources exceeds the epa level of concern.id.at.
the petitioners submitted extensive comments in response to the proposed revocation.also during the comment period,fmc,the only manufacturer of carbofuran in the united states,voluntarily cancelled its registrations under the fifra for all but six crops and proposed that the epa amend the remaining registrations to limit usage in areas particularly susceptible to drinking water contamination the first fmc proposal,which proposal the epa accepted,carbofuran product cancellation order.
in may the epa issued a final regulation revoking all tolerances for carbofuran.carbofuran final tolerance revocation.may.it concluded that although the first fmc proposal would reduce exposure to carbofuran,the aggregate exposure from drinking water would still exceed the level of concern with respect to both children and adults.id.at.fmc then proposed another amendment to its registration under the fifra,which would further limit carbofuran usage the second fmc proposal,and the petitioners filed objections and a hearing request.in november the epa denied the petitioners objections and hearing request.carbofuran order denying fmc objections and requests for hearing,hereinafter hearing denial.the petitioners seek review of that decision pursuant to h.
ii.analysis 
the petitioners contend they raised four material issues of fact with respect to the revocation of domestic tolerances,each of which merits a hearing what are the concentrations of carbofuran in surface water and ground water what is the of carbofuran,which is relevant in determining the extent to which an individual recovers between exposures and what is the safe dose of carbofuran,the level below which exposures will not result in adverse effects.below we conclude the epa did not abuse its discretion by denying the petitioners requests for a hearing on the first two issues,which obviates the need to address the second two issues,for they are not by themselves.the petitioners also contend that,because the epa agrees the level of exposure to carbofuran from imported foods alone is safe,the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously by revoking import tolerances.before reaching any of these arguments,we consider the petitioners contention that the epa applied the wrong standard in determining whether an evidentiary hearing was warranted.
standard for holding an evidentiary hearing 
the parties agree the ffdca and the epa regulations establish a type standard for determining whether to hold a hearing the epa must hold a hearing if it determines an objection raises a material issue of fact.contrary to the position of the petitioners,however,our review of the epa exercise of discretion in determining whether an issue is material differs from our review of a summary judgment rendered by a district court,which we review de novo,venetian casino resort,llc eeoc.
the proper standard of review here,as we stated in another case arising under the ffdca,is necessarily deferential.cmty.nutrition inst.young.
mere differences in the weight or credence given to particular scientific studies,or in the numerical estimates of the average daily intake of a substance,are insufficient.we will not substitute our judgment on highly technical and factual matters for that of the agency charged with the supervision of the industry.
id.rather,our review is limited to an evaluation of whether the agency has given adequate consideration to all relevant evidence in the record.id.at.
