don norman,roger norman,and south meadows properties collectively appellants or the normans appeal two decisions of the united states court of federal claims.the first,issued april,dismissed the normans illegal exaction claim for lack of jurisdiction.norman united states.norman i.the second,issued december,dismissed,after a trial on the merits,the normans claim for just compensation under the fifth amendment.norman united states.norman ii.the court of federal claims issued final judgment on december,and appellants timely filed a notice of appeal on january.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
the opinion of the court of federal claims described the facts of this case in exhaustive detail.see norman ii.at.as the trial judge stated,t he background of this case spans over a decade of land acquisitions,purchases,sales,development plans,permit applications and issuances,with persons,parties,companies,partnerships and entities involved.id.at.we refer to the trial court findings of fact,which appellants do not challenge,and set forth here only those facts that are necessary for the resolution of the appeal.
the normans are real estate developers who,in the late,planned to develop commercial and industrial office space in reno,nevada,on a property previously used for ranching and agricultural activities the ranch.see id.at.in,a company called southmark corporation purchased the ranch,intending to develop it for commercial and residential uses.southmark prepared a master plan for the development of the property and submitted it to the reno city council for approval.on january,the city council conditionally approved the master plan,identifying conditions that the developer was required to satisfy before final approval would issue.one of those conditions required the developer to submit to the council plans approved by the united states army corps of engineers delineating wetlands or any other lands the development of which were subject to the issuance of federal permits.id.
in june of,the army corps of engineers the corps sent a team of wetlands experts to conduct field work necessary to prepare a final wetlands delineation.norman ii.at.in the months before that team arrived,the normans became interested in purchasing a commercial portion of the ranch for development as an industrial park,per the master plan prepared by southmark.id.the normans were unwilling,however,to purchase the commercial portion until the corps completed a final wetlands delineation of the property.id.
on september,the corps issued a delineation the delineation,prepared pursuant to the version of the corps wetlands delineation manual.the delineation identified acres of jurisdictional wetlands on the ranch property,of which acres were located on the parcel desired by the normans.following completion of the delineation,the normans acquired the property.id.at the same time,robert helms purchased the residential portion of the ranch.the normans and helms then entered into an agreement whereby they agreed to develop their properties consistently with southmark master plan.the parties do not dispute that the normans relied upon the delineation in purchasing the plot,or that their reliance was reasonable.
after the delineation became public,however,a storm of controversy erupted,as a variety of concerned entities criticized the delineation.id.at.the corps then revoked the wetlands delineation and conducted a new delineation under the version of the corps wetlands delineation manual the delineation.id.the new delineation effort began in april of and ended in october of.
the delineation substantially increased the acreage of jurisdictional wetlands on the subject property,identifying acres of such wetlands.of the wetland acres,acres were on the commercial portion of the parcel owned by the normans.this increased the wetlands acreage by acres.see norman ii.at.
the revocation of the delineation and the issuance of the subsequent delineation lie at the heart of appellants takings claims.the delineation allegedly forced the owners of the ranch property to revise their master development plan to account for the newly acreage.id.at.in,following creation of a new development plan that provided for development in three phases,the normans began purchasing smaller properties adjacent to their parcel.later that year,helms declared bankruptcy,and they purchased his parcel from his bankruptcy estate.the normans then petitioned the city of reno to that acres to the rest of the ranch property which had been during helms ownership and sought a master plan amendment to permit the parcel to constitute phase iii of their development plan.the city granted conditional approval in.as of that date,plaintiffs owned approximately acres of property intended for development in the master plan.see id.at.
in,appellants applied to the corps for a permit under section of the clean water act a permit enabling them to impact acres of jurisdictional wetlands and other waters of the united states.as mitigation for the proposed impact,plaintiffs proposed to create additional wetlands to ensure no net loss of wetlands functions and values.norman ii.at.the corps accepted the proposal and issued the permit.
in,appellants submitted another permit application,this time seeking permission to impact wetlands throughout the development site.see id.at.the corps responded that because appellants proposed actions would result in significant environmental impacts,the corps would have to prepare an environmental impact statement in compliance with the national environmental policy act of,unless appellants provided a mitigation plan which clearly reduced the project impacts to a less than significant level.id.the corps also provided a modified development alternative,suggesting a development plan with less significant environmental impacts.id.
in july of,appellants submitted a revised mitigation proposal that was,according to the trial court findings of fact,a result of a negotiations process between the corps and plaintiffs,in which the parties discussed which areas of property on the development could be utilized as mitigation wetlands.id.at.the resulting plan contemplated that the areas designated for storm drainage could sufficiently serve as mitigation wetlands due to the hydrology surrounding that area.id.at.under the modified development plan,a substantial portion of the mitigation wetlands would be on lands that would not otherwise have been developed in any case.
the corps approved the proposal and,on august,issued the normans a permit enabling them to proceed with their development plan the permit.the permit enabled appellants to fill approximately acres of wetlands in exchange,it required them to create or restore approximately acres of wetlands as mitigation.in addition,it required them to r ecord the formation of a corps approved funding mechanism for the long term maintenance of the mitigation and preserve areas,and r ecord deed restrictions maintaining all mitigation preservation areas as wetland preserves and wildlife habitat in perpetuity the deed of restrictions.norman ii.at.in order to comply with the permit requirement that appellants provide a funding mechanism,appellants elected to transfer title in acres to south meadows association,a property owners association initially controlled by the normans.id.
prior to and following issuance of the permit,appellants continued to sell the developable parts of the development to various independent third parties.id.at.at the time the permit actually issued,appellants owned only acres of the original parcel.
the normans filed the first lawsuit in this matter in,raising breach of contract and takings claims.the subsequent history of the litigation is lengthy and is recited in detail in norman ii.at.for our purposes here,the directly relevant trial court actions occurred beginning in.on april of that year,the court of federal claims issued an opinion dismissing appellants illegal exaction in an amended complaint filed in lack of jurisdiction.on november,two weeks before trial was scheduled to begin,appellants filed a motion to retroactively amend their complaint a second time to change the number of acres allegedly taken to the current.see norman ii.at.the trial court granted that motion on the first day of trial.trial was held in december of.following the conclusion of trial,appellants filed their second amended complaint,subsequent to which the government filed its answer.
following briefing,the court of federal claims issued an opinion and order denying all of appellants takings claims and ordering the clerk of court to enter judgment against appellants and dismiss their amended complaint with prejudice.the clerk entered final judgment,and appellants timely filed their notice of appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
in their appeal,the normans challenge the trial court rulings on both their takings claims and their illegal exaction claim.this court reviews the trial court findings of facts under the standard of clear error.hendler united states.we review the trial court conclusions of law,including questions involving jurisdiction,de novo.see mcdonnell douglas united states,casa de cambio comdiv united states.
significance of the delineation 
we recognize at the outset a fundamental tension in the normans takings claim.the normans place heavy weight on the revocation of the delineation and subsequent issuance of the delineation,arguing repeatedly that this single circumstance renders their takings claim unique and sui generis.they argue,essentially,that because they bought the parcel in reliance upon the delineation,the subsequent and less favorable culiminated in a taking of the acres set aside nearly a decade later in accordance with the permit.at the same time,appellants expressly disclaim any allegation that the permit,of itself,effected a taking they state that they are not ask ing this court to hold that the government routine requirement that a landowner set aside land as mitigation in exchange for a section wetland permit as occurred in the permit violates the just compensation clause.the primary error they allege is that by limiting its takings analysis solely to the permit,the trial court erred in excluding those very facts the corps mistake and unlawful redelineation that make this case uniquely a taking under the fifth amendment.
in other words,the normans want this court to evaluate the entire sequence of events from through as a single transaction,in which the mitigation of followed ineluctably from the unprecedented delineation.if we conclude that those two events were,for purposes of takings analysis,the events of did not,in appellants words,directly cause the normans to lose acres of property in then the bulk of their takings claims fail on that ground alone,because their challenge to the terms of the permit is,according to their own argument,based solely upon the role of the delineation in imposing those terms.
we find the normans argument unconvincing.the suggestion that corps action in directly caused the normans to lose acres of property,most of which they did not own until,strains the word directly well beyond its breaking point.the revocation and that preceded the permit by nearly a decade were but two of dozens of factual predicates leading up to the issuance of the permit others include the voluntary purchase,by appellants,of most of the land covered by that permit.that the decision to purchase that additional property may have been influenced,in small or large degree,by the events of does not render it involuntary.the causal relationship between the revocation of the delineation and the appellants alleged loss is simply too attenuated to support the weight the normans place upon it.
because the normans have disclaimed any challenge to the routine mitigation requirements of the permit except insofar as they resulted from the unique delineation,we believe this conclusion disposes of most of their takings claims without further analysis.in order to fully respond to the arguments appellants raise,however,we shall evaluate their claims in greater detail.
physical takings claim 
in general,this court has analyzed takings claims arising from section permit issues using the regulatory takings analysis set forth in penn central transportation new york,d.see,forest,united states,citing cases.here,however,the normans insist that,by its terms,the permit effected a physical taking because it required that they transfer title to the acres to a third party.it is axiomatic that w here the government authorizes a physical occupation of property or actually takes title the takings clause generally requires compensation.yee city of escondido,d.here,although the normans did transfer title in the wetland acreage to a nonprofit association,the record is clear that the title transfer was voluntary,and not a condition required under the permit.according to the parties joint stipulation,the normans transferred title in the wetland acreage to the south meadows association in order to comply with condition.a of the permit,which required that the appellants r ecord the formation of a corps approved funding mechanism for the long term maintenance of the mitigation and preserve areas.neither the permit nor the deed of restrictions contained any requirement that title to the affected acreage be transferred testimony offered at trial indicated that the funding mechanism requirement may be satisfied by several methods,and that although conveyance of title to a conservation group or nonprofit was one such method,the corps did not require it 
neither did the permit exact possession of the land.appellants argue that the normans loss of exclusive possession constitutes a categorical taking under the fifth amendment,relying for that proposition on nollan california coastal commission,d.we note as an initial matter that is not at all clear that appellants have,in fact,lost exclusive possession of the land at issue.nollan involved the use of a permit process to exact from a landowner an easement allowing public access across his land.no such physical government or the here.appellants have directed us to nothing in the permit or in the deed of restrictions that deprives the owners of the land of the right to exclude others from the acres.to the extent that appellants claim of loss of possession is predicated on the transfer of title,we have already concluded that that transfer was voluntary and therefore not a proper basis on which to premise a takings claim.
because we conclude that no physical invasion occurred here,the normans reliance on cases like united states pueblo of taos,and yuba natural resources,united states,is misplaced.those cases involved government surveys and found takings where,for example,the united states misidentified a boundary line and took property actually belonging to a landowner and sold it to a third party.in those cases the survey error led to an actual transfer of property from its rightful owner to another,or to the outright physical invasion of the plaintiff property by the that would constitute classic takings regardless of the survey error.they stand for nothing more expansive than the obvious principle that the government can not,by way of a simple survey error,take title to or physically invade private properties in ways that would otherwise be takings,without payment of just compensation.they are not relevant here.
even if the government action could reasonably be characterized as a physical invasion,the normans claim for compensation would fail under the principles set forth by the supreme court in nollan and in dolan city of tigard,d.those cases involved efforts by government authorities to exact from landowners easements across their property in exchange for the issuance of otherwise legitimate development permits.see nollan,at.dolan,at.the supreme court framed the question at issue as whether,given that requiring uncompensated conveyance of the easement outright would violate the fourteenth amendment,requiring it to be conveyed as a condition for issuing a permit alters the outcome.nollan,at.the court held that the permit issue did not alter the outcome.drawing on existing precedent in the regulation area,the court stated the general rule that a regulation does not effect a taking if it substantially advances legitimate state interests and does not deny an owner economically viable use of his land.id.it further provided that in order to avoid effecting a taking,there must be a nexus between the condition imposed and the original purpose of the regulation at issue.id.at.see also dolan,at.phrasing the issue as whether an essential nexus exists between the legitimate state interest and the permit condition exacted by the government internal quotations omitted.the condition must be related both in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development.dolan,at.
even if the nexus requirement of the nollan and dolan line of exaction cases were applicable we think it clear that it is would agree with the trial court conclusion that an appropriate nexus exists between the of the acres and the regulatory purpose.in the words of the trial court,t he public interest served by requiring the preservation of wetlands in exchange for the filling and dredging of other wet lands relates directly to the condition imposed.there is no disconnect.norman ii.at.
categorical takings claim 
a categorical taking is a regulatory taking in which government action deprives the landowner of all beneficial use of his property,such that the government action is the functional equivalent of a physical invasion.see lucas coastal council,d.the court of federal claims concluded that there has been no deprivation of all economically viable use of the parcel as a whole by virtue of the alleged taking of acres of wetlands,and that even if there was absolutely no use remaining for those acres,the percentage decrease in viable use would be insufficient to constitute a categorical taking.norman ii.at.
assuming,arguendo,that the normans intend to challenge the terms of the permit despite their disavowal of such intent,the question here is whether the permit in fact effected a deprivation of all beneficial use.the case law on categorical takings,and indeed lucas itself,is clear that only a complete deprivation will constitute a categorical or per se taking.see,lucas,at.council tahoe reg l planning agency,d describing categorical taking as an extraordinary circumstance and a narrow exception to regulatory takings principles.appellants lumping together of their physical and categorical takings claims obscures,perhaps willfully,the critical difference between those claims a physical taking of any portion of private property will ordinarily result in compensation,while a regulatory taking becomes categorical,and therefore requires compensation,only if the owner is deprived of all beneficial use of the parcel as a whole.if the government action does not deprive the owner of all beneficial use of the entire relevant parcel,then no categorical taking can be shown.see,at.appolo fuels,united states.
here,the trial court identified the parcel as a whole as the development,comprising the properties designated for development in phases i,ii,and iii of the development plan,exclusive of property conveyed to the state for.norman ii.at.its analysis is consistent with our precedent in this area,which states that the critical issue is the economic expectations of the claimant with regard to the property,and that w here the developer treats legally separate parcels as a single economic unit,together they may constitute the relevant parcel.forest,at citing cases.here,the record is clear that the appellants themselves regarded the parcel as a single economic unit in any case,appellants have not challenged the trial court analysis of the parcel as a whole without an effective challenge to the trial court identification of the parcel as a whole,appellants can not dispute that court conclusion that the facts here do not sustain a categorical takings claim.
regulatory takings claim 
having correctly found that there was no categorical taking of plaintiffs property,the trial court moved on to weigh the three factors of the penn central ad hoc analysis to determine whether a regulatory taking occurred.norman ii.at.that analysis requires the court to balance the extent to which the regulation has interfered with reasonable expectations the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant and the character of the governmental action at issue.id.citing penn cent.transp,at.
after undertaking a meticulous analysis of the penn central factors as applied to the facts at bar,the trial court concluded that appellants had reasonable expectations with respect to only the parcel described as wl,which appellants purchased in but which was first delineated as wetlands in the delineation.see id.at.the trial court then concluded that the economic impact factor weighed against a finding of a taking,because the permit actually increased the economic value of the parcel as a whole by allow ing plaintiffs to fill valuable commercial property and develop that property in exchange for setting aside other,less valuable property for mitigation.id.at.finally,the trial court analyzed the character of the government action,concluding that the issuance of the permit served a legitimate public welfare obligation that appellants were treated fairly by the corps and that the permit was itself the product of negotiations between the corps and appellants and that appellants were not singled out for disparate treatment.see id.at.weighing all these factors in light of the facts of the case,the trial court concluded that no regulatory taking of property occurred,because the corps actions simply did not unduly burden plaintiffs.id.at.
the normans challenge very little of the trial court penn central analysis.their briefs do not even mention the trial court extensive discussion of the character of the governmental action factor.with respect to the other two factors,their rather cursory arguments amount to little more than a reiteration of the claim,rejected above,that the critical causative element at issue here was not the permit but the events of.appellants argue,for the trial court erred in failing to measure economic impact as of the time of the delineation.this position is illogical.the normans can not explain why the trial court should have measured economic impact as of a time when they did not own the great majority of the property allegedly taken.
the same is true regarding reasonable expectations.the normans argue that their expectation interest should have been measured as of,when they purchased the initial parcel.we note first that the trial court did,in fact,measure appellants expectations with respect to the acres as of the date they purchased that land,and found that the normans had reasonable expectations in a few of those acres.see norman ii.at.appellants do not explain on what theory we should measure their expectation as of with respect to acreage they did not own until.it is axiomatic that a reasonable expectation must be more than a unilateral expectation or an abstract need.ruckelshaus monsanto,d quoting webb fabulous pharmacies,beckwith,d.as of,the normans simply could not have had any expectation in property in which they had not yet invested.
in addition,we note that although a takings claim is not barred by the mere fact that title was acquired after the effective date of the restriction,palazzolo rhode island,d,it is particularly difficult to establish a reasonable expectation in circumstances like these.the purpose of consideration of plaintiffs expectations,we have held,is to limit recoveries to property owners who can demonstrate that they bought their property in reliance on a state of affairs that did not include the challenged regulatory regime.cienega gardens united states,quoting loveladies harbor,united states.here,the normans were not only constructively but also actually aware of the applicable wetland restrictions,and purchased most of the land with full knowledge that portions of it were not subject to development.they could not have made those purchases in reliance on a state of affairs that did not include those restrictions.we conclude that the trial court correctly found that the appellants had reasonable expectations only wit
