in these consolidated cases,we consider two separate challenges to the environmental protection agency decision to include an industrial site bordering the hudson river on the national priorities list of contaminated sites considered priorities for environmental cleanup.one group of petitioners,several companies potentially responsible for cleaning up the site,claims that epa notice of the proposed listing was deficient and that the decision to list the site is unsupported by the record.the other petitioner,an adjoining landowner whose property epa considers part of the site,argues that epa failed to give fair notice that the parcel might be included and that the inclusion of its land was arbitrary and capricious.finding each of these challenges either without merit or forfeited,we deny the petitions for review.
known as superfund,the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of,cercla,requires the federal government to compile a national priorities list npl of known or threatened releases of hazardous substances that are priorities for remedial action,cleanup activities designed to address the environmental dangers associated with a contaminated site.id.a b.we have described the modest and limited purposes of the npl within the superfund scheme in previous cases.state dep t of transp.epa,quoting indus.epa,ii accord indus.epa,i,noting that congress intended the epa to employ the npl as a tool for identifying quickly and inexpensively those sites meriting closer environmental scrutiny.state,at.only sites placed on the npl are eligible for remedial action,see b,though listing a site does not mean that such funds will actually be forthcoming,for epa may pursue other appropriate authorities to remedy the release,including enforcement actions under cercla and other laws,id.b.listing a site,moreover,neither requires the owner or operator to take any action nor assigns liability to any party.see anne arundel county epa.once a site is listed,epa determines cleanup responsibilities in other proceedings.see.
the principal tool epa uses for determining whether to list a site on the npl is known as the hazard ranking system,or hrs.see pt,app.a hrs.the hrs evaluates four pathways,routes,through which hazardous substances can water,surface water,soil exposure,and air.hrs.for each pathway,epa considers,among other factors,the likelihood that hazardous substances will be released,the waste characteristics of those substances,toxicity,mobility,and the potentially threatened population or environmental targets,wells,animal habitats.id.employing hrs formulas and assumptions,epa evaluates the relevant factors and then assigns each site a value from to.id.sites scoring or higher may be added to the npl.i,at.
this case involves epa listing of an industrial site in edgewater,new jersey.see national priorities list for uncontrolled hazardous waste sites,proposed rule,proposed rule national priorities list for uncontrolled hazardous waste sites,final rule.known as the quanta resources site,the property lies on the western shore of the hudson river,directly across from new york city at street.until,allied signal and its predecessors,later acquired by petitioner honeywell international,used the property for coal tar processing.as the successor to the coal tar facility operator,honeywell is potentially responsible for cleaning up the site.see a,a.in the late,the quanta facility was used for oil storage and recycling,housing over sixty storage tanks.in,after discovering contaminated oil and other hazardous substances in the area,the new jersey department of environmental protection closed the facility.although epa supervised a series of removal actions to clean and decontaminate the area,later sampling revealed the continued presence of hazardous substances.a removal site investigation rsi,conducted pursuant to an epa administrative consent order,discovered that ground water,soil,and river sediments contained arsenic,chromium,lead,polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons,and other compounds.the investigation also documented an observed release of heavy end coal tar product consisting of hard,solid coal tar pitch,sticky coal tar roofing pitch,and viscous,coal tar both on the property and in the hudson.
using the hrs,epa scored the site and reported its findings in the hrs documentation package.among other things,epa determined that the portion of the hudson river adjacent to the site contained a fishery,the contamination of which posed a threat to the human food chain.epa assigned a score of to this component of the surface water pathway score.see hrs.epa scored none of the other pathways,explaining that they would have had no effect on the overall site score.hazardous ranking system documentation package quanta resources,hereinafter hrs documentation package.after additional calculations,the surface water pathway score produced an overall score of fifty,making the site eligible for placement on the npl.
in a proposed rule published in the federal register in january,epa announced its intention to list the quanta site on the npl.at.after considering comments opposing the listing and finding no basis for changing the hrs score,epa published a final rule that added the site to the npl.at.although neither the proposed rule nor the final rule provided a precise geographical description of the site,the hrs documentation package identified the site as located at river road and bordered to the north by the celotex industrial park,to the south by the former industrial park,to the west by river road,and to the east by the hudson river.hrs documentation package.
this case involves two separate challenges to the quanta resources npl listing.the first,brought by honeywell international and the edgewater working group,several companies connected to the site waste oil recycling operations,claims that epa failed to provide proper notice and a meaningful opportunity to comment on the proposed listing,and the agency fishery determination is unsupported by substantial evidence.throughout this opinion,we shall refer to petitioners honeywell and the edgewater working group collectively as honeywell.the other petition for review comes from three y,llc,which owns an adjoining parcel of land that epa included as part of the quanta npl site.three y argues that the proposed rule and associated documents failed to give fair notice that the company property might be included,and epa final decision to include the property was arbitrary and capricious.we consider each petition in turn.
under the administrative procedure act,a notice of proposed rulemaking must provide sufficient factual detail and rationale for the rule to permit interested parties to comment meaningfully.power light united states,see b.honeywell argues that the proposed rule fails this test because it nowhere mentioned what the company suspects is epa primary reason for listing the site,to obtain superfund monies to dredge the hudson,a remedial action that honeywell claims could pose serious environmental risks.epa failure to reveal its real objective,honeywell contends,deprived the company of a public outcry that almost certainly would have occurred had the public known that epa planned to dredge the hudson.honeywell reply br.at.
honeywell argument fails for a simple reason under the law of this circuit,epa has no obligation to discuss potential response listing a site on the npl.in industries epa,we explained that t he npl is simply the first step in a more,nothing less and credited epa assertion that the npl is not in itself remedial on the npl requires no cleanup nor any other action by site owners.ii,at.as we recognized in a related case bearing the same name,t he major purpose of the npl and the hrs is narrowly focused.it is to identify,quickly and inexpensively,sites that may warrant further action under cercla.listing does not represent a determination that action is necessary,or that the epa will take action.i,at.epa explained the limited function of an npl listing in its response to honeywell comments on the proposed rule epa exploration of response options is unrelated to the hrs site score.the hrs documentation package does not necessarily include an evaluation of every possible concern at a site nor does it make any suggestion as to response actions to be taken at a site.support document for the revised national priorities list final,hereinafter support document.in other words,listing a site does nothing more than identify it as sufficiently contaminated to warrant potential remedial action.see.state,at.because the notice did just that,it complied with the apa.
honeywell calls our attention to anne arundel county epa,in which we vacated and remanded an npl listing because epa failed to provide certain information in the proposed rule.at.in that case,however,we found the notice deficient because it omitted information that could have altered the hrs site score.id.at.here,the omitted information about a potential remedial action would have had no effect on the hrs score.
not only did epa have no obligation to disclose remedial options at this stage,but even if,as honeywell alleges,the agency listed the site because it eventually plans to dredge the hudson,the company has suffered no prejudice.before dredging or undertaking any other remedial action,cercla requires epa to publish its proposed plans for comment.see k.so if epa ultimately decides to dredge the river,honeywell and other interested parties will have an opportunity to raise their concerns.
honeywell next challenges the hrs score.specifically,it contends that epa finding that the section of the hudson bordering the quanta site contains a fishery is unsupported by the record and thus arbitrary and capricious.see a providing that a court will set aside an agency finding that is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.
when evaluating the surface water pathway,as it did here,epa considers among other things whether a threat to the human food chain exists.hrs.that inquiry focuses not on whether water is contaminated,but on whether contamination is present in aquatic organisms that humans consume.to answer that question,epa determines whether a fishery exists in the area,and if so,assigns a score according to whether the fishery is subject to actual or potential contamination and whether a portion of the fishery is within the boundaries of the observed release of hazardous substances.id.
although the hrs regulations explain how contamination will be assessed,they neither define fishery nor specify what evidence is needed to determine whether a fishery actually exists.epa hrs guidance manual answers both questions.the manual defines fishery as a ny area of a surface water body from which human food chain organisms are taken or could be taken for human consumption.hazardous ranking system guidance manual hereinafter hrs guidance manual,resp t br.ex.b,available at http.a fishery exists if h uman food chain organisms are present in the surface water body and s ome attempt has been made to catch those human food chain organisms.id.emphasis omitted.to make these determinations,u seful sources of information include state and local fish and wildlife agencies,local bait and tackle shops,visual observation during the site investigation of individuals fishing or of past fishery activity,fishing lines and hooks left behind near the surface water body.id.at.if such evidence demonstrates the existence of a fishery,then epa determines whether the fishery is subject to actual or potential contamination.hrs.actual contamination exists if a hazardous substance is present in the observed release issue in this case at least a portion of the fishery is within the boundaries of the observed release that is,it is located either at the point of direct observation or at or between the probable point of entry and the most distant sampling point establishing the observed release.id.
in this case,epa relied on two sources of information to conclude that a fishery exists in the area of the river where the heavy end coal tar product release had been observed.first,the contractor performing the hrs evaluation spoke with bill andrews,a biologist employed by the new jersey department of environmental protection bureau of marine fisheries.andrews informed the contractor that the area of the hudson river bordering edgewater,nj which includes the quanta resources site is fished for human consumption.phone conversation record.also,andrews records indicated that a gillnetter fishes this area for american shad,and that several other species are fished for human consumption from the area adjacent to the quanta resources site,including striped bass,white perch,white catfish,blue crab,tomcod,american eel,and winter flounder.id.second,the contractor spoke with jorge quinones who worked at the quanta site as a representative of a superfund technical assessment and response team.quinones reported that he had observed people fishing off the pier immediately north of the site.interview log.he marked the location on a location that,according to epa,lies approximately fifty feet from the contaminated waters.
honeywell argues that the information andrews and quinones provided amounts to hearsay and is therefore insufficient to demonstrate the existence of a fishery within the boundaries of the observed release.in particular,it claims that epa should have verified andrews statements by obtaining his records,the frequency and dates of fishing in the area,and the name of the gillnetter.circuit law,however,makes abundantly clear that administrative agencies may consider hearsay evidence as long as it bear s satisfactory indicia of reliability.echostar communications fcc,alteration in original quoting crawford dep t of.furthermore,hearsay can constitute substantial evidence if it is reliable and trustworthy.id.because honeywell points to nothing suggesting that the information provided by either andrews or quinones was unreliable,and given andrews and quinones positions a biologist working for new jersey bureau of marine fisheries and a member of a superfund technical assessment and response team,epa reliance on their statements was neither arbitrary nor capricious.as we said of a different agency in another case,epa was entitled to rely on representations by parties who were uniquely in a position to know the relevant information.ass of regulatory util.comm rs fcc,see also echostar,at rejecting petitioner claim that an uncorroborated and untested statement upon which the agency relied can not constitute substantial evidence where the statement was given under oath,the affiant had personal knowledge of the facts,and the petitioner submitted no contradictory evidence.
honeywell argues that nothing in the record indicates that andrews was aware of the boundaries of the observed release.the contractor notes,however,expressly refer to the area of the hudson river bordering edgewater,nj which includes the quanta resources site.phone conversation record.true,the notes do not indicate whether the contractor actually gave this description to andrews,but absent evidence to the contrary,we can not imagine that an epa contractor investigating whether a fishery exists within the boundaries of the observed release would have failed to inform andrews of the release boundaries.
honeywell has two specific objections to the information quinones supplied.the company claims first that his observation fails to support epa determination regarding the species of fish caught for human consumption.but given honeywell concession that andrews statement,if reliable,supports the hrs documentation regarding the specific species of fish,see honeywell br.at,and because we have concluded that andrews statement is in fact reliable,see supra,we need not address this concern.
second,honeywell argues that quinones observation fails to demonstrate that fishing occurred within the boundaries of the observed release.this is true,but epa rules require only that fish could be taken for human consumption,which the agency can demonstrate by documenting the presence of fish in the contaminated area and s ome attempt to catch them.hrs guidance manual at,resp t br.ex.epa documented both.relying on the andrews interview,epa concl
