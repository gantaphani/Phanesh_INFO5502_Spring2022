during the summer of,without obtaining a permit from the army corps of engineers the corps or the virginia state water control board the board,newdunn associates,orion associates,and northwest contractors collectively newdunn began ditching and draining wetlands on a property near newport news,virginia the newdunn property.pursuant to its authority under the clean water act cwa or the act,the corps brought a civil enforcement action in federal district court.the board initiated its own enforcement action in state court,premised on the virginia nontidal wetlands resources act of the virginia act.newdunn removed the state action to federal court,and the two cases were consolidated.after a bench trial,the district court ruled for newdunn in both cases,finding that the corps lacked jurisdiction over wetlands on the newdunn property under the clean water act,and that the jurisdictional reach of virginia law was merely coextensive with federal law.for the reasons stated below,we reverse.
in,newdunn associates purchased acres of land located in newport news,virginia.it is undisputed that approximately acres of the newdunn property the newdunn wetlands were wetlands,as that term is defined by the corps in its cwa regulations.b defining wetlands as those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support,and that under normal circumstances do support,a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.historically,before the construction of interstate,the wetlands on the newdunn property had a natural hydrologic connection to stony run,which is a navigable.presently,the newdunn wetlands remain connected to the navigable waters of stony run by the intermittent flow of surface water through approximately miles of natural streams and manmade ditches paralleling and crossing under.waters from the newdunn wetlands merge with clear water flowing south of the manmade ditch on the west side of.
in may of,following the supreme court ruling in solid waste agency of cook county swancc united states,d,which struck down the corps attempted exercise of jurisdiction under its migratory bird rule,newdunn informed the corps that it believed the corps lacked jurisdiction over the newdunn property,and began filling the newdunn wetlands without a permit.newdunn argued that there were no jurisdictional wetlands on the property,even though the property contained scientific wetlands.the corps disagreed with newdunn interpretation of swancc,and on july,attempted to assert jurisdiction over wetlands on the newdunn property by commencing an enforcement action in federal district court,alleging violations of sections and of the clean water act.
based on the same activities,and pursuant to virginia state law,the board issued an emergency special order eso,mandating that newdunn cease stumping and grading on its property.ann.newdunn ignored the eso,and as a result,on august,the board filed a civil enforcement action in state court,alleging violations of ann,and.newdunn removed the board action to federal court.the board,claiming that the district court was without jurisdiction to consider its case,filed a motion to remand.the court denied the board motion,and the corps and the commonwealth cases were consolidated for a bench trial in march of.
as to the federal suit,the district court held that the corps wetlands regulations were invalid because they exceeded congress grant of authority to the corps under the clean water act.on the state suit,the court ruled that the commonwealth has been unable to show that the virginia legislature has,at this time,granted regulatory authority independently of the corps jurisdiction.accordingly,the district court determined that the commonwealth lacked jurisdiction over the newdunn wetlands,since its authority was presumably coextensive with the corps.this consolidated appeal followed.

before reaching the merits of either case,we must first determine whether we have jurisdiction over the board enforcement action premised on virginia law.in cases where state law creates the cause of action,federal question jurisdiction is unavailable unless it appears that some substantial,disputed question of federal law is a necessary element of one of the state claims.franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d emphasis added.for a federal issue to be both a necessary and disputed element,the vindication of a right under state law must necessarily turn on some construction of federal law.id.at.emphasis added.
in the present case,the district court noted that both the virginia state statute and the corps federal regulations define wetlands as those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support,and that under normal circumstances do support,a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.b ann.based on this shared scientific definition the district court concluded that the state statute is coextensive with the cwa.in making this finding,however,the district court confused the definition of scientific wetlands and jurisdictional wetlands.
newdunn concedes,and the district court recognized,that at least acres of the newdunn property contained wetlands as that term is used in both b and ann.thus,from a scientific perspective,there is no disputed federal question as to whether the newdunn property contains wetlands because the resolution of this case in no way turns upon any interpretation of b,there can be no federal question jurisdiction based on virginia decision to adopt the corps technical definition of wetlands.see franchise tax,at.stated differently,the issue is not whether the newdunn property contains wetlands,but whether those wetlands are within the jurisdiction of the state water control board.the answer to this question is resolved solely by looking to the virginia wetlands resources act of,codified at ann.
the virginia act was crafted after this circuit announced its decision in united states wilson,cir,and after the circuit invalidated the corps tulloch rule,which had allowed the corps to regulate incidental fallback as a pollutant added to a wetland,see mining army corps of eng rs.following wilson and national mining,and the subsequent loss of federal control over virginia wetlands,nearly acres of nontidal wetlands were drained or were set to be drained in a period of less than six months.see tyler whitley,nontidal wetlands rules bill expected,richmond,at although virginia was losing wetlands at a dramatic pace,the state water control board was largely without authority to act.interpreting state law,former attorney general mark earley opined,t he board did not have authority to regulate wetlands beyond that contemplated by the certification process found in the cwa op.att y.
subsequent to this opinion,environmentalists petitioned the virginia general assembly to fill the regulatory vacuum.delegate preston bryant,responded to this call,and a bill to provide the state with a comprehensive,nontidal wetlands permitting program.in a letter to james gilmore,iii,delegate bryant explained the need for his proposal as follows 
for many years,the federal wetlands permitting program has fluctuated in its ability to protect virginia nontidal wetlands.this fluctuation has resulted not only from changing administrations and policies within the federal army corps of engineers,but more recently from changing federal case law a comprehensive state program would remove the uncertainty created by changing federal policies and case law decisions.
letter from preston bryant,delegate,to james gilmore,iii,governor,quoted in br.of amici curiae whipple,et at.delegate bryant bill was ultimately passed into law,becoming the virginia act at issue in this case.see,reg.sess,reg.sess.amending ann.newdunn posits that the virginia act was crafted narrowly to close only the tulloch loophole,and not to broaden the board jurisdiction within the commonwealth.the plain text of the virginia act,however,belies this contention.virginia law defines state waters broadly to include all water,on the surface and under the ground,wholly or partially within or bordering the commonwealth or within its jurisdiction,including wetlands.ann.emphasis added.the words including wetlands were added to the statute by the virginia act,without any jurisdictional limitation,reg.sess,reg.sess.in state waters,virginia law prohibits excavating,draining,filling,dumping,or any other activity that may significantly alter or degrade a wetland without a permit issued by the board.see ann.nothing in the virginia act refers to the cwa definition of navigable waters or the waters of the united states.a plain reading of the virginia act,therefore,makes it inconceivable that the term wetlands as it is used in the state legislation could necessarily turn on the resolution of a question of federal law 
alternatively,newdunn maintains that the board jurisdiction depends on a resolution of federal law because ann.provides issuance of a virginia water protection permit shall constitute the certification required under of the clean water act.based on this statute,newdunn posits that the board jurisdiction must be coextensive with the corps.newdunn theory,however,is premised on a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between the federal and state permitting procedures.
section a of the cwa requires an applicant for a federal permit to provide the licensing or permitting agency a certification from the state in which the discharge originates or will originate the commonwealth,by enacting,has taken advantage of this federal provision,so that when federal and state laws overlap,applicants may use their state permits to satisfy the certification requirements under section of the cwa.of course,simply because a state permit carries the added benefit of satisfying a potentially applicable federal requirement does not mean that the state jurisdictional reach turns on an interpretation of the cwa.undoubtedly,situations will arise where a permittee needs a state permit,but no federal permit.in those situations,the state permitting process would apply without reference to the cwa.
as the supreme court of virginia recognized,the cwa and federal regulations allow a state program to operate a discharge elimination system program in place of the federal program,provided that the state program is authorized under state law and has standards that are at least as stringent as the federal ones.state water control bd.smithfield foods,emphasis added.that is,for a state permitting procedure to satisfy the federal requirements of a,the state law must be at least as exacting as the clean water act,but of course,it may be more demanding.
even when state and federal requirements do overlap,as was the case in smithfield foods,the issue of whether the board has authority to regulate the subject wetlands remains a question of virginia law.accordingly,the board jurisdiction can not necessarily depend on any interpretation of federal law,even if it happens that federal and state laws are coextensive on the particular facts of a certain case.see franchise tax,at.
the virginia supreme court finding in smithfield foods that the interests and rights of both the federal and state entities we re vested in a single permit does not alter this analysis.see smithfield foods,at.in smithfield foods,because this court had already affirmed the finding of the district court that smithfield was liable,and because the united states supreme court denied certiorari,the federal determination was a final judgment for the purposes of res judicata.id.at.in the present case,while the corps and the board may ultimately require newdunn to obtain the same discharge permit,no final judgment in either case has been rendered.
depending upon how the corps and newdunn resolve the federal case on remand,the board interest may or may not be satisfied.accordingly,the board should be permitted to pursue its rights in a virginia court.of course,if either the state or federal actions were to result in a final judgment requiring the issuance of a permit satisfying both federal and state laws,then newdunn might elect to file a motion to have the unresolved action dismissed on the grounds of res judicata.see smithfield foods,at.
in sum,in light of the virginia act clear statutory language,it is apparent that virginia now regulates activities in wetlands beyond its federal mandate.goodwin,annual survey of virginia law,rich.at.it would be perverse,therefore,for this court to conclude that the jurisdictional limits of the virginia act depend upon the cwa.any determination as to the extent of the board jurisdictional reach is purely a question of state law that does not require the resolution of any federal question.because we lack jurisdiction over the board action,we reverse the district court ruling on the board motion to remand,and we remand the state enforcement action to the virginia court from which it was improperly removed.
we now turn to the only case for which federal subject matter jurisdiction corps civil enforcement action premised on the cwa.
the federal water pollution control amendments of,known collectively as the clean water act,were crafted to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.a.to achieve this ambitious goal,congress mandated that the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful except as in compliance with the act permitting procedures.id.the permitting scheme at issue in this case is articulated in section a,which gives the corps the authority to issue permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites.id.a.the cwa defines navigable waters to include the waters of the united states,including the territorial seas,id,and the corps regulatory jurisdiction is limited by this definition.
in,the supreme court ruled that the corps possessed the authority to exercise jurisdiction over wetlands that were adjacent to other waters,even though the wetlands themselves were not navigable.united states riverside bayview homes,d.the court deferred to the corps technical expertise on the matter,noting the considerable difficulty,both for the corps and for federal courts,in defining the jurisdictional limits of the act.id.at.the court explained 
in determining the limits of power to regulate discharges under the act,the corps must necessarily choose some point at which water ends and land begins.our common experience tells us that this is often no easy task the transition from water to solid ground is not necessarily or even typically an abrupt one.rather,between open waters and dry land may lie shallows,marshes,mudflats,swamps,short,a huge array of areas that are not wholly aquatic but nevertheless fall far short of being dry land.where on this continuum to find the limit of waters is far from obvious.
id.the corps had determined that wetlands adjacent to other waters should be included in the definition of waters of the united states,because wetlands adjacent to lakes,rivers,streams,and other bodies of water may function as integral parts of the aquatic environment even when the moisture creating the wetlands does not find its source in the adjacent bodies of water.id.at.the supreme court upheld the corps exercise of jurisdiction,concluding,we can not say that the corps conclusion that adjacent wetlands are inseparably bound up with the waters of the united as it is on the corps and the epa technical unreasonable.id.at.
the supreme court has recently reaffirmed riverside bayview homes,commenting it was the significant nexus between the wetlands and navigable waters that informed our reading of the cwa in riverside bayview homes.swancc,at.see also united states krilich,cir observing that the swancc court rea
