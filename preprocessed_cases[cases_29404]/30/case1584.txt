the united states court of federal claims dismissed the northwest louisiana fish and game preserve commission the commission takings claim against the united states as filed after the statute of limitations.see nw.fish game comm united states.final decision.the commission alleged that the united states corps of engineers corps red river navigation project the project effected the taking.the corps project limited the ability of the commission to draw down the level of louisiana black lake.accordingly,the commission could not control the growth of vegetation in the lake.the complaint alleges that the vegetation rendered the northern part of the lake inaccessible,unmanageable,and virtually useless,resulting in a taking.
because the growth of vegetation was a slow natural process that had not stabilized to cause the taking claim to accrue until at least,this court reverses the decision of the court of federal claims,and remands for further proceedings as appropriate.
this case arises from a conflict between the commission responsibility to maintain a natural preserve and the corps responsibility to maintain riparian navigation.the commission manages the northwest fish and game preserve,a complex of land and lakes maintained for recreation and for preservation of wildlife and fisheries.the preserve includes two lakes,collectively referred to here as black lake.black lake is subject to the growth of aquatic weeds.the commission controls these weeds by draining,or drawing down,the lake into the red river.
in,congress authorized the corps red river project to assure navigation on the red river.river and harbor act of,stat.amended by,stat.to achieve this purpose,the corps constructed a series of locks and dams on the river.this case involves the pool pool created by the third lock and dam l d.the water level in pool directly affects the draw down potential of black lake,which in turn may affect the growth of the aquatic weeds.
in,the corps approved a design for l d that would impound water in pool at feet above mean sea level msl,feet lower than the ordinary elevation of black lake.this impoundment limited the drawdown capability for black lake to about feet,between and less than the commission allegedly requires for weed control.when the construction of l d began in,the louisiana department of transportation and development the department notified the corps that the new water level could impede the commission regular lake management activities.the department requested the corps to seek alternatives to alleviate the potential detrimental impacts.
in,and,the corps conducted studies on the control of hyacinths or waterlilies.hydrilla,a submerged weed,was not a concern at that time.in,the corps initial studies of black lake focused on flood flows,and these studies indicated that pool would have no adverse effect on the capability of evacuating flood flows.the corps also stated that it was investigating alternatives to allow an increase in drawdown capability,and made a point of noting that before it would make a final determination on alternatives,that it had continuing authority to study and better define the impact of pool on the lakes.
in,the corps performed more studies of pool impact on black lake complex and gave an assessment that provided various alternatives for each lake,stating that its assessment could still,nevertheless,be revised.in,the corps also stated that the need for further corrective actions would be evaluated when the data showed a need,and that the corps would continue to request the commission staff input concerning efforts to minimize the effects of pool.
in,the corps advised the commission that it was continuing to study the impact of pool,and it noted that since most weed growth occurred at depths less than about feet that it did not believe that the loss of the drawdown capability would have any measurable impact on the environmental quality of the lake.however,the corps started a five year lake monitoring study to determine the effects of the operation on the navigation pool,which was scheduled to be completed in.thus,studies continued beyond december,when the designed elevation of msl for pool was reached,and these studies provided conflicting opinions on whether a problem would ultimately develop.after the complete elevation of pool,the corps continued to study,inter alia,pool so that it could determine whether additional project requirements should be implemented to minimize the impacts on the lakes.
nearly two years after pool reached msl and after the completion of l d,hydrilla emerged as a problem for the first time in the fall of.though hydrilla had been discovered in,it was believed killed by a drawdown in may of.it was rediscovered again sometime in,but it was not until that detailed studies showed it was spreading to an extent that it had become a problem.as a result,on october,the assistant of the commission informed the red river waterway commission rrwc,a louisiana entity created to collaborate with the corps on the project,of the hydrilla problem and the need for another drawdown.the asked if there was any possibility of lowering the water level in pool to allow such an action.the rrwc passed the question to the corps.while waiting for a response from the corps,on december,the commission meeting minutes noted that the hydrilla had just been reported as breaking up and spreading through the lakes.in january of the rrwc received a response from the corps.the rrwc advised the commission that,though it had requested the corps to determine if pool could be manipulated to accommodate the proposed drawdown,the corps flatly responded that it would not allow the proposed drawdown.thus,it was not until january of that the corps,for the first time,refused a drawdown,and instead suggested that the commission attempt to control the weed growth with herbicides and a limited available drawdown.
as a result,in february,the commission filed in state court a claim for land appropriation inverse condemnation against the rrwc.rrwc,in turn,impleaded the corps as a third party defendant.the corps had the suit removed to the united states district court for the western district of louisiana.the district court essentially allowed rrwc to withdraw from the case because the corps bore sole responsibility for raising the water level in pool.nw.fish game comm red river waterway comm n,slip op.at.july.
the commission then submitted,on december,an administrative claim against the corps.in this claim,the commission requested for curative work and associated damages.the commission claimed that the new water level in pool as of january caused the uncontrollable growth of aquatic vegetation.the commission also claimed that preserve property contiguous to the lake had been damaged as a result of floods also attributable to the level of pool.
on january,the corps office in vicksburg,mississippi rejected the claim as improperly filed.the vicksburg office noted,inter alia,that the commission had stated that the date of the incident leading to damage was january,outside of the statute of limitations for the federal tort claims act.the corps district counsel in vicksburg added that none of my comments are to be construed as a final agency decision on your letter.although the vicksburg office asked the commission to clarify the intent of its submission,the record does not show any further correspondence between the commission and vicksburg.
on july,the commission filed suit in the district court for the western district of louisiana against the united states,under the federal torts claim act,and as a taking.in this suit,the commission asserted that it had been prevented from carrying out its duties in managing the preserve,and noted that curative costs would be approximately million dollars.the district court found that the tort claim was barred under b nw.fish game comm united states,civil action,report and recommendation at.the district court held that the tort claim had accrued by january,when a committee of the commission authorized legal action,but the filing date of the suit in july exceeded the statute of limitations for tort claims.id.at.the district court then transferred any possible taking claim to the court of federal claims,which would properly be brought under the tucker act,which has a six year statute of limitations.nw.fish game comm united states,slip op.at.june.
in the court of federal claims,the commission amended its complaint to allege loss of use of land and water,diminution in market value of land,interference with wildlife habitat and recreational purposes,and damage to its property as a result of the raising of the water level of pool from msl to msl.the united states moved for dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,on the ground that the action,originally filed in july,was barred by the statute of limitations of.the court granted the motion,holding that accrual of the plaintiff cause of action with regard to the alleged taking due to aquatic growth occurred no later than december,when the corps raised the level of pool to msl.final decision,slip op.at.the court reasoned that at that time the commission knew about the damage that was going to occur as a result of raising the pool level.id.at.further,the court noted that the commission had calculated,as early as,the cost of controlling the aquatic growth over the lifetime of the project.it,thus,concluded the damages in this case were not only foreseeable,but foreseen even before.id.at.the commission appeals the dismissal disputing the accrual date,for purposes of the statute of limitations,that was arrived at by the court of federal claims.

this appeal only presents the application of the title,section statute of limitations to the commission claim.the commission filed its tort and takings claims in the western district of louisiana on july.the trial court correctly accepted this date as the appropriate filing date for the takings claim.final decision at.
a taking occurs when governmental action deprives the owner of all or most of its property interest.united states motors.the word property denote s the group of rights inhering in the citizen relation to the physical thing,as the right to possess,use and dispose of it.for example,w here the government by the construction of a dam or other public works so floods lands belonging to an individual as to substantially destroy their value there is a taking within the scope of the fifth amendment.united states lynah.the supreme court has held that t he backing of water so as to overflow the lands of an individual if done under statutes authorizing it for the public benefit,is such a taking as by the constitutional provision demands compensation.pumpelly green bay.canal,wall.
in this case,the accrual date of such a takings claim depends on several factors because the damage occurs gradually both as the water level increases and as the aquatic vegetation becomes uncontrollable.the commission argues that its right to possess,use,regulate,and maintain the property in question was appropriated by the corps when the corps refused to cooperate in a proposed drawdown of black lake to mitigate the growth of hydrilla and other aquatic plants.thus,according to the commission,the taking accrued in,after both the appearance of significant hydrilla growth and the corps first definite refusal to draw down the water level or otherwise help the commission mitigate its damages.
however,the trial court set the accrual date in.the trial court reasoned that a takings claim accrues when all events which fix the g overnment alleged liability have occurred and the plaintiff was or should have been aware of their existence.final decision,slip op.at see also japanese war notes claimants ass of the philippines,united states,cert.denied,d.the trial court further reasoned that december was the proper accrual date because at that time the plaintiff knew or should have known that raising the pool level would result in uncontrolled aquatic plant growth.
to the contrary,as revealed by the pleadings,the events that fix the corps alleged liability had not occurred by december.the events that fixed the corps alleged liability occurred,at the earliest,in.therefore,this court perceives an error in the reasoning of the court of federal claims.the trial court reasoned that accrual occurred when the commission knew or should have known of the damage that was going to occur as a result of raising the pool level.final decision,slip op.at.the correct standard recites that accrual occurs when the harmed party knows or should have known of their existence and all events which fix the government alleged liability have occurred.see boling united states,in general,a takings claim accrues when all events which fix the government alleged liability have occurred and the plaintiff was or should have been aware of their existence.citing hopland band of pomo indians united states,see also fallini united states,as a general matter,a cause of action accrues when all the events have occurred that fix the defendant alleged liability and entitle the plaintiff to institute an action.the harm in this case,the uncontrolled hydrilla growth,did not occur,was not fixed until well after the water level in pool reached its maximum height in december of.
the trial court reasoned that the corps was responsible only for the taking of the right to drain water from the black lake into the red river,not for uncontrolled aquatic growth.final decision,slip op.at.however,the uncontrolled aquatic growth was the harm that occurred as a consequence of the taking of the right to drain the lake.in the first place,that harm did not instantly occur when pool reached its maximum level.that december of event only set in motion the potential for future harm.that harm did not exist until much later.
when the damages from a taking only gradually emerge,as in recurrent flooding,a litigant may postpone a suit for a taking until the situation becomes stabilized and the consequences of inundation have so manifested themselves that a final account may be struck.united states dickinson.dickinson established the principle that,when the government allows a taking of land to occur by a continuing process of physical events,plaintiffs may postpone filing suit until the nature and extent of the taking is clear.fallini,at.dickinson discouraged a strict application of accrual principles in unique cases involving fifth amendment takings by continuous physical processes.applegate united states,citing dickinson,at.this court followed the supreme court dickinson mandate in applegate,and held that the gradual character of the natural erosion process to the properties south of the cape canaveral harbor made accrual of the landowner claim uncertain.at.likewise,in banks united states,this court also applied the stabilization doctrine to another shoreline erosion case.
this court predecessor,the united states court of claims,also held that a claim does not accrue until the claimant suffers damage.terteling united states.because some growth of hydrilla is normal,the damage in this case,which was uncontrolled overgrowth and the corps refusal to reduce the water level,did not occur until january.in,when the corps had not yet issued a final refusal,there was only the possibility or threat of damage or a taking.a possible future taking of property can not give rise to a present action for damages.united states acres of land,cir.thus,in this case,until the hydrilla had grown,and had grown to harmful levels,and the corps refused to drain the lake to alleviate the harm caused by the overgrowth of hydrilla,damages were not present,they were still unquantifiable and speculative.see alder united states,court affirming c
