at issue is the extent of the united states forest service obligations under its regulations to monitor management indicator species before approving forest management activities.finding the forest service monitoring efforts sufficient,the district court affirmed the record of decision authorizing the monroe mountain ecosystem restoration project.exercising jurisdiction pursuant to,we reverse and remand.
monroe mountain,part of the fishlake national forest approximately airline miles south of salt lake city in central utah,is the center of the monroe mountain ecosystem restoration project the monroe project.the monroe project area covers approximately acres,consisting of forest primarily fir occasionally mixed with aspen and grass and sagebrush land.
as part of the national forest system,the fishlake national forest is maintained under a forest management plan the fishlake forest plan,pursuant to the national forest management act nfma,the fishlake forest plan was approved in.forest management plans are to be revised every ten to fifteen years and can be amended.f.to accomplish nfma broad land management responsibilities,the forest service has promulgated regulations,including further clarification of general forest planning procedures,minimum forest management requirements,requirements to ensure diversity of plant and animal species,and habitat requirements for native and desirable species.
to execute specific forest management plans,the forest service proposes individual projects.see,ohio forestry,sierra club,d describing the steps involved in proposing and adopting a action under the wayne national forest management plan colorado environmental coalition dombeck,cir the forest service implements the forest plan by approving or disapproving particular projects.individual projects must comply with the nfma enacting regulations.i.specifically,any projects undertaken by the forest service in the fishlake national forest must be consistent with the fishlake forest plan.i,e 
in,a forest service interdisciplinary team considered portions of monroe mountain for immediate ecosystem restoration treatment.administrative record vol.ar doc.at.after assessing conditions in the relevant area,the monroe mountain ecosystem restoration project the monroe project was developed.the monroe project final environmental impact statement feis,which analyzes the potential effects of several management alternatives,states that the primary purpose of the monroe project is to move the forest and grassland ecosystems within the project area toward properly functioning condition of ecological structure and function.ar doc.at.to that end,six distinct objectives were developed restore aspen ecosystems,improve watershed conditions,reduce the risk of large wildfires,reduce the potential of epidemic spruce beetle infestation in stands,restore the ecosystem to improve wildlife and livestock habitat,and provide timber products for the local economy.to effectuate these objectives,five management alternatives were analyzed to determine the potential effects the monroe project might have on the area,as required by the national environmental policy act nepa,et.
proposing several actions to meet the specific objectives of the monroe project,the selected alternative includes timber harvesting,prescribed burns,and sagebrush treatments to monroe project land outside of inventoried roadless areas iras action within iras was limited by the plan to prescribed burning.the forest service record of decision found that the selected alternative met the six objectives of the project by converting over acres of mixed stands to aspen stands,thus restoring an abundance of aspen to the forest increasing riparian resiliency by improving understory vegetation and decreasing sediment production treating acres of mixed stands to reduce fuel,thereby decreasing the risk of intense wildfires reducing the density of acres of stands,thereby decreasing the risk of epidemic spruce beetle infestation converting over acres of sagebrush into areas,creating more habitat for livestock and wildlife and producing approximately million board feet of timber,thus supporting the local economy.slightly under of the monroe project area acres were subject to treatment under the selected alternative.
following the forest supervisor authorization of the monroe project,utah environmental congress uec filed suit in district court,alleging the forest service authorization of the monroe project violated nepa,the nfma,the administrative procedure act apa,and various forest service regulations.in march,the district court found in favor of the forest service on all claims.uec appeals,raising two primary allegations of error that the forest service failure to monitor management indicator species mis renders its authorization of the monroe project violative of the nfma,the nfma implementing regulations,and the fishlake forest plan and that the forest service revalidation of roadless areas during the monroe project development,which resulted in some previously labeled roadless areas no longer being categorized roadless,was illegal because such an action is not authorized at an individual project level.
we first address the forest service management indicator species mis monitoring judicial review of agency action under directs reviewing courts to set aside agency action if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.although our review of an agency decision is deferential,we will reverse if the decision is not supported by substantial evidence.hoyl babbitt,cir citations omitted federal power comm transcontinental gas pipe line,d recognizing that if an agency decision is not supported by the administrative record made,it must be vacated and the matter returned to the agency for further consideration.because we are obligated to undertake an independent review of the agency action in this appeal,we are not bound by the district court recitation of the facts below.olenhouse commodity credit,cir citation omitted.
when reviewing an agency interpretation of its own regulations,we defer to the agency view,unless it is unreasonable,plainly erroneous,or inconsistent with the regulation plain meaning.bar mk ranches yuetter,cir citation omitted.in the context of technical or scientific matters particularly,judicial deference to agency decisions is appropriate,wyoming united states,cir,and choices of suitable scientific methodology are entrusted to the agency,custer county action garvey,cir.
in the instant case,uec argues that the district court erred when it found that f or each of the five mis at issue in this case,the forest service has collected appropriate quantitative population data or has a valid reason for not collecting such data.utah environmental congress bosworth,et,slip op.at.on appeal uec maintains that the forest service did not collect appropriate quantitative data and improperly relied on habitat trends rather than actual species population trends.as a result,uec argues,the forest service decision to authorize the monroe project was arbitrary and capricious.
the fishlake management plan subdivided the fishlake national forest into nineteen separate management areas,each with its own management practices.the monroe project covers six different management areas within the fishlake national forest however,percent of the monroe project area is within management area.area is designated habitat for management indicator species,which indicates that priority should be given to managing the lands in accordance with the habitat needs of mis.ar doc.at.to this end,the forest service is required to estimate the effects of each management alternative on fish and wildlife species that are selected because their population changes are believed to indicate the effects of management activities.a.the species thus selected as mis should represent endangered or threatened plants and animals species with special habitat requirements which may be affected significantly by planned activities commonly hunted,trapped,or fished species special interest species and plant or animal species selected because their population changes are believed to indicate the effects of management activities on other species.id.because of their representative capacity,mis have been variously described as a class representative,inland empire pub.lands council united states forest,cir,a management,forest guardians united states forest,d,and a proxy for determining the effects of management activities on other species,dombeck,at.as the ninth circuit has observed,t he use of management indicator species is intended to allow the forest service to thoroughly evaluate the effects of the forest management alternatives on fish and wildlife populations by using a class representative,without having to evaluate each species individually.inland empire,at.
two groups of indicator species are utilized in the fishlake management plan one group serves as ecological indicators,ar doc.at,and the other represent s species of high interest.id.goshawk,cavity nesters,riparian dependent guild,sage nesters,macroinvertebrates,and resident trout,each selected for their sensitivity to habitat change and representative characteristics,were chosen as ecological indicator mis in the fishlake forest management plan.they were specifically selected to ensure that species with special habitat needs are adequately considered in forest management activities.elk,mule deer,and bonneville cutthroat trout were selected as high interest species mis.these high interest species were selected because of their threatened,endangered,or sensitive status,or because of high public interest in the species.
uec argues that the forest service authorized the monroe project without the relevant mis population,the effect of management activities on several violation of the apa,the nfma,the nfma implementing regulations,and the fishlake forest plan.in support of this argument,uec claims that the mis population data was deficient because the forest service used habitat trend modeling as a proxy for actual population surveys,rather than actual quantitative data,which they argue is required by.while conceding that applies to the development of forest management plans,as opposed to specific project level actions,uec insists that because forest service obligations under the fishlake forest plan continue as long as the plan is in existence,the forest service is required to evaluate planning alternatives under prior to authorizing specific projects,like the monroe project.
accordingly,as a preliminary matter,we must determine whether applies to the authorization of the monroe project.consistent with uec argument,we have previously applied the requirements to project level actions.for example,in dombeck,after noting that the forest service implements the forest plan through individual projects and that these projects must be consistent with the forest plan,we applied to a project level action.at.this application is in accord with the analysis of other circuits.see,sierra club martin,cir recognizing that although applies to the formulation of forest plans rather than to specific projects proposed,the duties of the forest service continue throughout the plan existence inland empire,at cir reasoning that b ecause any area contained within the boundaries of a forest having a plan would be an area covered by a forest plan,it would also be a planning area governed by regulation quoting.several district court opinions in this circuit have also applied to decisions,see utah environmental congress zieroth,d,forest guardians,d at.moreover,our analysis comports with the nfma,which requires that resource management activities be consistent with the forest plan.i.similarly,forest service regulations direct that activities affecting forest lands shall be based on the plan,and at a minimum,all management practices should p rovide that habitat for species chosen under is maintained and improved to the degree consistent with objectives established in the plan.because contemplates the application of to management activities,and as the forest service implements forest management plan activities by approving specific projects,we are convinced that read as a whole,the regulations anticipate application of to project level as well as plan level management actions.accordingly,we apply to the authorization of the monroe project.
having so concluded,we consider uec argument that requires the forest service to gather quantitative population data for mis in its management planning activities.the forest service counters that the regulation does not require the use of quantitative population data in the monitoring of mis.relying on the plain language of the regulation,the forest service claims that requires only that it monitor population trends of mis,leaving the method of habitat information,actual population data,or some combination of the the discretion of the forest service.although it recognizes that our recent decision in dombeck,did not address mis specifically,the forest service nevertheless argues that dombeck supports using habitat information to satisfy requirements in general.we decline to read dombeck so broadly.
dombeck addressed a challenge to the forest service decision to allow the vail ski resort to expand.at.colorado environmental coalition,among others,appealed,arguing that the forest service failed to properly analyze the effects of the proposed expansion on the canada lynx populations in the area.id.at.the coalition argued that the forest service was required to collect actual population data on the lynx before moving forward with the expansion the forest service maintained that habitat data could be substituted in cases where actual population data was unavailable and where actual data would not enhance the forest service analysis because the proposed action would not result in species loss.id.at.we were careful to note in dombeck that the population inventory requirements of that apply to management indicator species are irrelevant to the issue before us because the canada lynx was not an mis.id.at.therefore,our narrow holding was that the regulatory language does not require the forest service,under the circumstances of this case,to collect actual lynx population data.id.
moreover,our reasoning in dombeck rested on the observation that the regulatory language clearly presupposes the ascertainable presence of a species population within a given planning area.id.at.in the case of the vail expansion project,despite good faith efforts to confirm the presence of lynx,no one has seen an actual lynx in the project area in over years id.because we concluded that congress could not have intended to require the forest service to collect quantitative population data where no population exists,id.at,the forest service use of habitat analysis information to examine the effects of the vail expansion with an eye toward preserving the potential for a viable lynx population in the area in the future was all that was required under the regulations.id.additionally,we noted our agreement with the ninth circuit that the forest service should use actual population data when such data is available.id.at citing inland empire,at.we are therefore unconvinced that dombeck supports the forest service interpretation that habitat information alone is sufficient to fulfill its obligations under.
in keeping with the reasoning of the eleventh circuit and the district courts of this circuit,we conclude that requires the forest service to use actual,quantitative population data to effectuate its mis monitoring obligations.section mandates that as part of forest planning,f ish and wildlife habitat shall be managed to maintain viable populations of existing native and desired vertebrate species.further,forest management p lanning alternatives shall be stated and evaluated in terms of both amount and quality of habitat and of animal population trends of the management indicator species,a similarly,p opulation trends of the management indicator species will be monitored and relationships to habitat changes determined,a.plainly the regulations require that the forest service monitor population trends of the mis in order to evaluate the effects of forest management activities on the mis and the viability of desired fish and wildlife populations in the forest more generally.
our reading of the requirements of is strengthened by,which provides that to ensure diversity of plant and animals in forest planning,inventories which include quantitative data making possible the evaluation of diversity in terms of its prior and present condition shall be taken.we agree with the eleventh circuit in martin that these two sections of regulation are harmonious when read together.martin,at.because 
mis are proxies used to measure the effects of management strategies on forest diversity and because requires the forest service to use quantitative inventory data to assess the forest plan effects on diversity then,taken together,the two regulations require the forest service to gather quantitative data on mis and use it to measure the impact of habitat changes on the forest diversity.
id.similarly,the court in forest guardians reasoned that the language of required the forest service to acquire and analyze hard population data of its selected management indicator species before approving a timber sale,because these regulations clearly preclude reliance solely on habitat trend data as a proxy for population data or to extrapolate population trends.d at.likewise,we agree that a reading of as requiring only habitat analysis is inconsistent with the regulation plain meaning,yuetter,at.accordingly,we conclude that in order to effectuate its mis monitoring duties under the language of its regulations,the forest service must gather quantitative data on actual mis populations that allows it to estimate the effects of any forest management activities on the animal population trends and determine the relationship between management activities and population trend changes.
having determined that applies to project level activities and requires that the forest service gather quantitative data on specific mis populations,we turn to uec specific objections to the forest service approval of the monroe project.in particular,uec challenges the forest service monitoring of the goshawk,bonneville cutthroat trout,southwestern willow flycatcher,sage grouse and sage nesters,and cavity nesters.although we are not bound by the district court findings of fact regarding the forest service monitoring,see olenhouse,at,we will set aside the forest service approval of the monroe project only if based on the administrative record,the decision is arbitrary,capricious,not in accordance with the law,or not supported by substantial evidence,hoyl,at citations omitted.substantial evidence has been variously characterized as evidence sufficient to justify a court refusal to direct a verdict in a jury trial,or such relevant evidence a reasonable person would deem adequate to support the ultimate conclusion.id.at quotations omitted.
with respect to the northern goshawk,uec maintains that although the forest service has gathered population data in the monroe project area,the forest service has not gathered data.because the forest service lacks a context in which to place its project population data,uec argues,it can not measure the impact of any change in northern goshawk habitat in the project area on the diversity of the entire fishlake forest.see martin,at holding that nfma regulations require the forest service to gather quantitative data on mis and use it to measure the impact of habitat changes on the forest diversity.conversely,the agency maintains that it documented eleven goshawk territories in the fishlake forest,and therefore that completion of a survey is unnecessary and not required by the regulations.
the forest service conducted the following surveys helicopter surveys of the nesting and foraging habitat for the goshawk on monroe mountain in and goshawk surveys,relating to active nests and territories,two years prior to any proposed timber sale in the fishlake forest and a goshawk survey in the burnt flat analysis.in addition,the forest service mapped documented goshawk territories on monroe mountain and compiled goshawk flight data as well as numerous completed goshawk monitoring forms dating from to.finally,the forest service relied upon information and data received from an goshawk conservation strategy group which concluded that the current goshawk population is viable in the state of utah.ar at.
in finding that the nfma does not necessarily require context data,the district court reasoned that because the nfma requires that the forest service maintain viable populations of mis,if the forest service is able to determine viability on the basis of the data gathered in the monroe project area,then it is not required to gather data.we conclude that data is not required if the forest service can determine the viability of the mis at issue without a survey.we also conclude,based on the data in the administrative record,that the forest service monitoring of the goshawk fulfilled its obligations under.
as to the bonneville cutthroat trout,the forest service relied on a biological opinion which indicates that the trout were cursor ily check ed ar at in after being reintroduced to manning creek in.uec argues that this biological opinion data is insufficient for two reasons first,because the check was cursory and second,because b requires population trends of the mis be monitored and trends can not be determined based upon an isolated data point.the district court rejected these arguments,reasoning that monitoring requirements can not be read to require the forest service to sample the manning creek bonneville cutthroat trout population because the sampling may harm the reintroduction of the trout in that stream.
the forest service also contends that quantitative data on the bonneville cutthroat trout had been collected annually at manning meadow reservoir also in the monroe project area because the reservoir operates as bonneville cutthroat trout brood stock habitat for utah sportfishing stock program.six years following the reintroduction of bonneville cutthroat trout to the reservoir,the sportfishing stock program collected over eggs from the brood stock.manning creek is stocked from eggs taken from manning reservoir.even though this data is somewhat limited,on balance,we agree with the district court that the forest service has collected adequate,appropriate quantitative population data in regards to the bonneville cutthroat trout in support of its decision to approve the monroe project.
turning to the southwest or southwestern willow flycatcher,a small bird on the endangered species list located within the proposed project area,the monroe project biological assessment concludes that the project would create no direct adverse effects on southwest willow flycatcher or their habitat.ar at.however,no quantitative data on the southwestern willow flycatcher,either within the project area,or within the fishlake national forest,appears in the biological assessment.although the forest service states,in the feis,that a nnual monitoring for presence,abundance,and nesting of the southwestern willow flycatcher are sic conducted by the forest service and the utah division of wildlife resources,ar doc.at,we were unable to locate quantitative data from either the forest service or the utah division of wildlife resources in the record.
despite the absence of actual data in the record,the effects analysis in the feis concludes that the current management of the monroe project area could harm the southwestern willow flycatcher habitat.while annual monitoring of the southwestern willow flycatcher presence,abundance,and nesting is sufficient to meet the forest service obligations under the fishlake forest plan and,because we find no such data in the record,we are unable to conclude that the forest service fulfilled its obligations under in monitoring this mis.
our review of the record regarding sage grouse and sage nesters leads to a similar conclusion.in its brief,the forest service acknowledges that s age grouse are potentially present,unconfirmed sightings of sage grouse have been made,and habitat suitable for the sage grouse is present in the monroe proj
