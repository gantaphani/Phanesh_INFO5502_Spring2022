trisha pritikin appeals the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of the department of energy doe.pritikin sued doe to compel it to budget for the medical monitoring program that the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr was required to institute at the hanford nuclear reservation hanford.the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction on two grounds pritikin failed to meet the requirements for instituting a citizen suit under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act,a and cercla and there was no final agency action to challenge under the administrative procedure act,et apa.we agree that we lack jurisdiction to entertain this action,but rely on a third ground pritikin lacks constitutional standing to compel doe to make budget requests and to reprogram existing funds for the medical monitoring program because she can not show that its failure to do so is the cause of the injury she seeks to redress or that requiring doe to do so will result in atsdr implementation of the medical monitoring program.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
factual background 
the hanford nuclear reservation in richland,washington,is owned by doe and was established in as part of the manhattan project to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons.for three decades,radioactive,toxic and hazardous substances were released from hanford as of the plutonium production process.from to,it is estimated that to over million curies of radioactive were emitted into the air through exhaust stacks,and more that million curies of radioactive material were released into the columbia river during the cooling process.these releases exposed thousands of persons living and working downwind and downstream from the site to radioactive iodine.the most damaging exposure to radioactive occurred through the consumption of contaminated milk,produced by cows grazing in contaminated fields.human exposure to radioactive often results in thyroid disease,as the toxic chemical is usually stored in the thyroid gland.
in,the environmental protection agency epa placed the hanford site on its national priorities list npl,which ranks the most serious hazardous waste sites in the united states,and since that time,hanford has been the subject of an environmental cleanup.to expedite the,atsdr and doe entered into a memorandum of understanding mou and a series of interagency agreements iags to delineate the responsibilities of the respective agencies as well as to provide funding for the atsdr statutorily required health assessment activities at the hanford site for fiscal years fy.in,as part of a negotiation during the pendency of the appeal of hanford downwinders coalition dowdle,aff,cir atsdr initiated a formal review of the health effects of hazardous substances at hanford.in,atsdr concluded that there was a significant increased risk of adverse health effects in humans from exposure to hazardous substances due to toxic waste exposure.once this significant risk determination was made,i required atsdr to implement a medical monitoring program to screen the population for those diseases for which the risk had been significantly increased and to refer affected individuals to treatment.i.
in february of that same year,doe transferred the hanford funding responsibility from its headquarters to a field office in richland following the transfer,in a letter dated october,john wagoner,manager of the operations office,informed atsdr that doe could not accept the funding burden specified in the august,draft iag.explaining that the regional office could not accept unfunded mandates from doe headquarters and its belief that it is unacceptable for doe to fund management activities with environmental management funds,wagoner specifically requested that atsdr help doe engage the administration on the issue of funding.as an interim measure,wagoner requested that atsdr identify the minimum funding levels it needed to begin work in fy.atsdr and never reached an agreement,and as a result,no iags were established after fy.in early march,pritikin served her notice of intent to sue,dated january.approximately one week later,on march,doe announced its intent to transfer million from another appropriation toward funding the medical monitoring program.doe did not include funding for atsdr medical monitoring program in its budget proposal for fy,and atsdr has yet to begin the statutorily required medical monitoring program.
trisha pritikin was born in richland,washington,near the hanford facility,in,and she lived there for the first ten years of her life.as a result of in utero and childhood exposure,pritikin thyroid gland and endocrine system were severely damaged.thus,she is qualified to participate in atsdr medical monitoring program.she initiated this suit to force atsdr to implement the statutorily required program.pritikin believes that if doe were to first request and then provide the funding,atsdr would begin the medical monitoring program,and her medical needs would then be addressed.
ii.statutory history 
to understand why pritikin does not have standing to bring this cause of action against doe,it is necessary to understand the statutory framework of and,in particular the responsibilities it imposes on the different agencies involved in the of a toxic waste site.cercla was enacted to protect and preserve public health and the environment by facilitating the expeditious and efficient cleanup of hazardous waste sites.dowdle,at quoting wilshire westwood atlantic richfield,cir.cercla establishes a procedure to facilitate hazardous waste site and insures that whoever undertakes the can recover those costs from potentially responsible parties prps,and.here,doe qualifies as a prp under a because,as the owner of the hanford site,it accepted hazardous substances for transport.
the superfund amendments and reauthorization act sara established atsdr within the department of health and human services to assess and study the health effects of hazardous substances and to institute medical programs when needed.i.the prps are liable for,among other things,the costs of any health assessment or health effects study carried out under section i,and liability attaches even if the prp was unaware of the toxic waste at the time in question.a d.thus,doe is liable for the cost of any medical monitoring program that atsdr carried out at hanford.cercla also allows superfund money to be used to finance the and provides a cause of action for its reimbursement from prps.a and a.section waives the federal government sovereign immunity and makes those federal departments and agencies which qualify as prps subject to liability.section also requires the head of the each responsible federal department to enter into an iag with the epa administrator to expedite the completion of all necessary remedial action submit a review of alternative agency funding for the remedial action in its annual budget to congress and submit an annual progress report.
iii.prior proceedings 
pritikin brought this action against doe pursuant to the citizen suit provisions of cercla,a and,and the apa,et.she seeks a declaration that doe is liable for funding atsdr medical monitoring program and an injunction compelling doe to i include in its budget requests the amounts necessary to fully fund the hanford medical monitoring program and disease registry program for fy and beyond ii reprogram budget items committed to it for other programs or by special appropriation in its fy budget to cover the full amounts planned by atsdr for its hanford program and iii to comply with cercla reporting requirements and disclose to congress its failures to fund atsdr mandatory programs and to reach iags with atsdr.doe moved for dismissal pursuant to.b,or in the alternative,for summary judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
neither party raised the issue of standing in the district court.as a result,the district court granted doe motion for summary judgment without addressing whether pritikin had constitutional standing to initiate her suit against doe.it rejected citizen jurisdiction on the ground that pritikin could not establish a a requirement or a a duty which doe had either violated or failed to perform.alternatively,the district court determined that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction under the apa because there was neither final agency action nor a definitive statement of an agency position for which judicial review is authorized under 
iv.standing 
we review an order granting summary judgment de novo,auvil cbs minutes,cir,and we may affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record,franklin terr,cir.although the issue of standing was not raised in the district court,because it is one of jurisdiction,we may consider it for the first time on appeal,city of dallas,d alameda newspapers,city of oakland,cir.
standing is a doctrine an essential and unchanging part of the requirement of article iii.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.no principle is more fundamental to the judiciary proper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.simon eastern.welfare rights,d.standing,unlike other jurisdictional doctrines,focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before a federal court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated.id.at.quoting flast cohen,d.to demonstrate standing,a plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not th e result of the independent action of some third party not before the court and it must be likely as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.defenders of wildlife,at.citations omitted alterations in original.
doe does not challenge the first prong of the standing requirements and rightfully inability to receive medical screening due to atsdr failure to implement the hanford medical monitoring program establishes a cognizable injury.doe argues,however,that because pritikin fails to show how including funding for atsdr medical monitoring program in its budget request would result in the program actually being carried out,she has demonstrated neither causation nor redressability,and therefore,she lacks standing.we agree that pritikin has failed to demonstrate the second and third prongs of the constitutional standing requirements and that we therefore lack jurisdiction over her claims.
to meet the causation requirement,pritikin inability to receive medical be fairly traceable to doe failure to include funding for the hanford medical monitoring program in its budget requests.it can not be the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.defenders of wildlife,at.quoting simon,at.alterations omitted.by claiming that doe failure to fulfill its obligation to fund the medical monitoring program and the exposure subregistry program has deprived her of needed medical surveillance,pritikin claim presupposes that a budget request for funding would necessarily result in the funding and that if the funding were provided the program would necessarily begin.thus,even at first blush,pritikin standing appears weak,as her theory omits a necessary step in the causation independent decision of atsdr,a third party not before the court,to begin the medical monitoring program.
pritikin argues that by failing to include the medical monitoring program in its budget request,doe did not take such steps as may be necessary to eliminate or substantially mitigate the significant risk to human health.i according to pritikin,this provision imposes an affirmative duty on doe to provide atsdr with the funding it needs to initiate the medical monitoring program before any costs have been incurred.although this duty is without support in the text of cercla,pritikin argues that her inability to obtain medical screening is directly traceable to doe failure to perform it.we disagree.
in simon,indigents and organizations of indigents claimed the secretary of the treasury and the commissioner of the internal revenue service issued revenue ruling,which extended tax benefits to nonprofit hospitals that offered treatment to indigents on an emergency basis only,in violation of the internal revenue code of and the apa.they argued that the ruling encouraged hospitals to deny service to the individual indigents and members of the indigent organizations.simon,at.the supreme court disagreed,concluding that it was pure speculation as to whether the denials of service specified in the complaint fairly can be traced to petitioners encouragement or instead result from decisions made by the hospitals without regard to the tax implications.id.at.the court found it equally speculative whether the desired exercise of the court remedial powers in this suit would result in the availability to the indigents of such services.id.at.because there was no evidence suggesting that the issuance of the ruling caused the hospitals to deny indigents treatment,id.at,and because unadorned speculation will not suffice to invoke the federal judicial power,the court held that respondents lacked standing,id.at.
the need to speculate as to the causal link between the actions of the party being sued and the alleged injury arose because,like pritikin,the simon plaintiffs sued the wrong party rather than suing the hospitals refusing indigents care,they sued the people responsible for promulgating the revenue ruling.although the plaintiffs successfully alleged an injury,the court reasoned an injury at the hands of a hospital is insufficient by itself to establish a case or controversy in the context of this suit,for no hospital is a defendant.id.at.here,pritikin has not sued a party with the clear ability to act.rather than suing the atsdr,the party with the statutory power and duty to act,pritikin has sued doe,the party liable for the costs of any health assessment or health effects study carried out a d.although she has sufficiently alleged that she was injured by the failure to implement a medical monitoring program at hanford,an injury at the hands of atsdr is insufficient by itself to establish a case or controversy in the context of this suit,for atsdr is not a defendant.see simon,at.
similarly,in duquesne light united states environmental protection agency,cir,the independent actions of a third party,not before the court,were at issue.the third circuit concluded that the duquesne light company lacked standing to judicially challenge the epa approval of pennsylvania state implementation of the clean air act.the utility company claimed that it lost emission reduction credits ercs and faced higher operation costs as a result of epa approval.duquesne,at.the third circuit held that duquesne injury was manifestly the product of the independent action of a third department of environmental protection,which redefined the state implementation plan in such a way that duquesne may not receive ercs for its dormant plant.id.at.this,in turn,reduced the number of ercs duquesne claimed it would have received had the less stringent requirements of federal law been applied.because the clean air act required the epa to approve any state plan that met the minimum federal requirements,which pennsylvania plan did,the epa did not have the power to change its decision or to order pennsylvania to relax its clean air requirements.id.thus,the third circuit concluded that the epa approval of the pennsylvania plan was not fairly traceable to duquesne injury.id.
as in duquesne,pritikin injury is manifestly the product of the independent action of a third party.id.although doe is liable for the costs of any health assessment or health effects study carried out under section i of this title,a d,atsdr is responsible for implementing the program once it has determined that there is a significant increased risk of adverse health effects in humans from exposure to hazardous substances based on the results of a health assessment conducted und
