and then the dry years would come,and sometimes there would be only seven or eight inches of rain.the land dried up and the grasses headed out miserably a few inches high and great bare scabby places appeared in the valley.the live oaks got a crusty look and the was gray.the land cracked and the sprigs dried up and the cattle listlessly nibbled dry twigs.then the farmers and the ranchers would be filled with disgust for the salinas valley.the cows would grow thin and sometimes starve to death.people would have to haul water in barrels to their farms just for drinking.
john steinbeck,east of eden penguin books.
although john steinbeck wrote about california salinas valley,the same can be said for california central valley.like the salinas valley,the central valley is rich and fertile.it is home to some of california most productive agriculture,and food grown in the valley sits on the tables in most american homes.but the central valley is also naturally dry.the valley floor receives an average of five to sixteen inches of rainfall per year the united states geological service considers it to be arid or.in its natural state,the valley could not sustain the level of agriculture that the country demands from it.
to remedy this problem,the federal and state governments have invested enormous sums of money developing infrastructure to pump water out of the rivers that crisscross the valley floor,store it,and deliver it to agricultural and domestic consumers in california.this water is essential to the continuing vitality of agriculture in the central valley,and some million californians depend on it for daily living.but that water is also an important habitat for thousands of river and anadromous fish,many of which are endangered.
and therein lies the conflict if the governments did not extract water from the central valley rivers,the valley could not support the farms that feed,the dams that power,and the canals that hydrate millions of americans.but by extracting the water,people dramatically alter the rivers natural state and threaten the viability of the species that depend on them.people need water,but so do fish.
this case is about the competing demands for these limited water resources.in the department of interior bureau of reclamation reclamation,the federal agency that oversees water resources in the west,asked the commerce department national marine fisheries service nmfs to evaluate under the endangered species act esa the impact of continuing water extraction in the central valley on certain threatened and endangered salmonid species that live there.in response,nmfs developed a biological opinion biop in which it determined that reclamation proposed project would jeopardize some of the delta endangered salmonids.see generally salmonid biop at.to remedy this problem,nmfs required reclamation to change the way it pumps water out of the valley rivers.see id.at ch.a number of groups that depend on the central valley water sued to halt this change.on summary judgment,the district court found that nmfs had violated the administrative procedure act apa arbitrary or capricious standard when developing much of the biop.see generally in re consolidated salmonid cases,d,a.defendants joined by environmental groups appealed,and once again we enter the fray 
we hold that the district court did not give nmfs the substantial deference it is due under the apa.on independent record review,we find that the components of the biop invalidated by the district court are reasonable and supported by the record.as a result,we uphold the biop in its entirety.we,therefore,reverse and remand for entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants.
facts and proceedings below 
factual background the sacramento san joaquin deltaa.the central valley and the river systems 
the central valley is a basin covering square miles in inland california.the walls of the basin are created by several mountain ranges the sierra nevada and cascade mountains to the east,the klamath mountains to the north,the coast range to the west,and the tehachapi mountains to the south.see infra,fig.a.the valley is long and narrow.it stretches from bakersfield in the south to redding in the north about miles and is between and miles wide from east to west.
the central valley contains several major river systems.those systems are comprised of the san joaquin river which flows west from the cathedral range of the sierra nevada mountains,turns north around fresno,and enters the san francisco bay north of berkeley,the sacramento river which flows south from the salmon and trinity mountains around redding and passes through sacramento before joining the san joaquin river,and their tributaries.the sacramento and san joaquin rivers converge around antioch,about thirty miles northeast of oakland,where they form the san joaquin river delta.the water from the delta flows past chipps island,into the suisun bay,through bulls head channel,and into the san francisco bay.the water passes the city of san francisco and flows under the golden gate bridge where it finally enters the pacific ocean.see infra,fig.a.the brackish body of water through which the rivers flow on their way to the pacific ocean is called the bay delta.the river delta is called simply the delta.

b.the state water project and the central valley project 
since the early part of the twentieth century,land owners,local irrigation districts,and the federal and california state governments have pumped fresh water out of the san joaquin and sacramento rivers and their tributaries to irrigate the agricultural lands of the central valley and to provide drinking water to the people of california.see cent.delta water agency.united states,cir.california governs this pumping through the state water project swp and the federal government does so through the central valley project cvp collectively,the projects.
the swp is the largest water project in the united states.delta smelt,at.it consists of dams and reservoirs,five power plants,pumping plants,and miles of aqueduct.id.internal citations omitted.the california department of water resources dwr plaintiff in intervention here oversees operations of the swp.id.
the cvp is the largest federal water management project in the united states.cent.delta water agency,at.congress initially authorized it in the rivers and harbors act of.id.it comprises a series of dams,reservoirs,hydropower plants,and miles of canals and aqueducts.delta smelt,at.reclamation oversees operations of the cvp.the cvp is partially governed by the central valley project improvement act cvpia,id.at,which congress passed in to achieve a reasonable balance among competing demands for use of central valley project water,including the requirements of fish and wildlife,agricultural,municipal and industrial and power contractors.central valley project improvement act,pub,stat.
together,the projects provide water to more than million agricultural and domestic consumers in central and southern california.they do so,in part,by pumping fresh water out of the delta using the harvey banks pumping plant banks pumping plant and the bill jones pumping plant jones pumping plant,both of which are located near tracy,california the banks pumping plant is capable of pumping water at the rate of cubic feet per second cfs,but it generally operates closer to cfs.see ocap ba at.the jones pumping plant has a maximum pumping capability of cfs.see id.the plants operate by lifting water from the delta using pumps they pump the water into pipes that deliver it into the california aqueduct or the delta mendota canal,respectively.see jones banks pumping facilities.from there,the projects deliver the water to agricultural users in the central valley and domestic users in central and southern california.see see also fig.
the projects also control the volume of water flowing through the central valley rivers by prescribing releases from upstream reservoirs,which operate as water storage facilities.releases from reservoirs cool water temperatures,reduce the salinity of the delta,provide flood control,improve volume for fish habitat and migration,and supply additional water for agricultural use.see ocap ba at.
fig.cvp and swp map 
threatened and endangered species in the delta 
although the projects provide substantial benefits to people and to state agriculture,they arguably harm species native to the delta by modifying those species natural habitats.five such species are at issue in this case the endangered sacramento river chinook salmon chinook the threatened central valley chinook salmon chinook the threatened central valley steelhead cv steelhead the threatened southern distinct population segment of north american green sturgeon green sturgeon and the endangered southern resident orca whale southern resident orca.see salmonid biop at.
the four salmonid species the first four listed are anadromous fish,and southern resident orca are marine mammals.anadromous fish live most of their lives in salt water nevertheless,they are born,mature,lay eggs,and often die in inland freshwater lakes and rivers.after they grow from fry baby fish to smolts juvenile fish in fresh water,anadromous salmon outmigrate through rivers and deltas into the oceans and seas where they will spend most of their adult lives.when it is time to reproduce,these salmon migrate back through the deltas to the rivers and lakes in which they were born to lay eggs.during this migration,salmon must pass impediments in inland rivers such as locks,dams,channels,and pumps.
the san francisco bay delta is an essential conduit for anadromous fish that return to california inland rivers and lakes to reproduce.nevertheless,human interactions with the delta and california inland rivers over the past century have significantly altered them,threatening their ability to serve as salmonid habitats.swp and cvp operations increase pollution,encourage the growth of species,and create water shortages in the delta that harm salmon by exposing them to unnatural stressors.see salmonid biop at.migrating salmon can also be caught in,and killed by,the large water pumps that serve the projects.finally,operations that limit cold water releases from dams upstream of traditional spawning sites potentially impact critical spawning habitat by making the rivers less conducive to reproduction.
legal background the endangered species act 
we must review nmfs formal opinion as to how reclamation and dwr should operate the projects to avoid jeopardizing endangered salmonid species.before further discussing the relationship between the projects and the species,we briefly review the legal framework for that opinion.
the federal government protects listed and threatened species,such as the five at issue here,primarily through the esa.see endangered species act.when congress passed the esa in,it sought to bring about the better safeguarding,for the benefit of all citizens,of the nation heritage in fish,wildlife,and plants.id.a.
section of the esa addresses the obligations of federal agencies with respect to conservation and protection of species listed as either endangered or threatened under the esa.lawrence liebesman rafe petersen,endangered species deskbook ed.esa section prohibits a federal agency from taking any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of those species critical habitat.a.
section requires an agency proposing a project that might harm listed or threatened species to consult with either nmfs or the interior department fish and wildlife service fws about the proposed action.a.as part of this consultation,the action agency prepares an initial assessment of the project in which it evaluates the project impact on any listed or endangered species.this is called a biological assessment ba.the appropriate consultation agency reviews the action agency ba and uses it to prepare a biological opinion biop in which it ultimately determines whether the proposed agency action is likely to adversely impact endangered or listed species,or negatively modify their critical habitats.see a 
if the agency concludes that the proposed action will jeopardize species or critical habitats,the biological opinion must outline any reasonable and prudent alternatives that the agency believes will avoid that consequence.bennett spear,u,quoting b a.reasonable and prudent alternatives rpas are 
alternative actions identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action,that can be implemented consistent with the scope of the federal agency legal authority and jurisdiction,that is sic economically and technologically feasible,and that the director believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.
the consulting agency may also issue with the biop an incidental take statement its that permits the action agency to harm listed species when implementing the rpas without violating the esa.see id.
proceedings leading to the current controversy 
the salmonid biological opiniona.the consultation request 
in,reclamation asked nmfs to prepare a biop assessing the impact of continued and future operations on delta salmonid species this request was motivated by the listing of new endangered species and the designation of new critical habitats.salmonid biop at.in it,reclamation asked nmfs to evaluate the effect of reclamation and dwr proposal to continue to operate the projects to divert,store,and convey project water,ocap ba at,on chinook,chinook,cv steelhead,ccc steelhead a fish not at issue here,green sturgeon,and southern resident orca,see salmonid biop at.
reclamation developed a ba that could provide the basis for such a consultation in the fall of.id.at.using the data reclamation provided in the ba,supplementing it with its own research,nmfs developed a draft salmonid biop that it released to reclamation and dwr for comment in the winter of.id.at.reclamation and dwr reviewed and commented on the document.nmfs also requested and received peer review from the calfed bay delta program and the center for independent experts.see id.based on the comments received,nmfs published a final page biop on june.reclamation provisionally accepted the biop that same day.
plaintiffs contest the legality of the biop here,arguing for various reasons that parts of it are arbitrary or capricious in violation of the apa.before discussing plaintiffs specific challenges and the issues on appeal,we briefly review the portions of the biop that are relevant.
b.the jeopardy opinion 
in the first part of the biop,nmfs concludes that the operations of the cvp and swp are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the chinook,the chinook,the cv steelhead,the green sturgeon,and the southern resident orca.id.at.similarly,t he operations of the cvp and swp are likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat for chinook,chinook,cv steelhead,and green sturgeon.id.
c.the reasonable and prudent alternatives 
because nmfs concludes that ongoing operations would threaten listed species,it issued over seventy rpas that reclamation is supposed to implement to avoid jeopardy.see generally id.at.the proposed rpas fall into five operational categories i sacramento river division,ii american river division,iii east side division,iv delta division,and v fish passage program.see id.at.on appeal,the parties challenge provisions of the rpas falling into categories iii and iv.
actions in category iii relate to operations on the stanislaus river,which provides critical spawning and smolting grounds for the cv steelhead.see id.at.prior to the construction of the new melones dam on the stanislaus river,cv steelhead spawned in the cold tributaries upstream of where the new melones reservoir is now located.see id.at.now,t he steelhead population on the stanislaus river is precariously small and limited to habitat areas below the goodwin and new melones dams that historically were unsuitable owing to high summer temperatures.id.at.in rpa category iii,nmfs prescribes certain volumes of releases from the goodwin and new melones dams that,according to nmfs,will cool the rivers enough to facilitate steelhead spawning.see id.at.the flows will also rejuvenate the gravel that is essential to steelhead spawning habitat and provide migratory cues to adult and juvenile fish.
actions in category iv relate to operations in the delta.see id.at describing delta division action.nmfs concludes that the proposed actions for the projects,which include continued diversion of water from the delta at the project export facilities,with increased export levels,will increase the level of stressors in the delta,further degrading it as a habitat.id.at.the category iv rpa actions address this jeopardy finding by imposing ratios for the old and middle rivers,see id.at,prescribing maximum negative flow rates for the old and middle rivers,id.at,and requiring a certain salvage efficiency at major fish salvage stations,id.at.
the present case 
on june,plaintiffs san luis delta mendota water authority and westlands water district challenged the legality of the biop by filing suit against the department of commerce,the national oceanic and atmospheric administration,and nmfs collectively federal defendants in the eastern district of california.see compl.at,ecf.the district court consolidated that case with several other cases in which state water districts challenged the biop dwr intervened as a plaintiff.see joinder by.dep t of water,ecf.and several environmental and fishing groups intervened as defendants see in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at.
on august,several plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on their claim that the biop violates the esa and the apa.id.the stanislaus river plaintiffs and dwr filed separate motions for summary judgment.id.the federal defendants and defendant intervenors responded with for summary judgment.id.these,which included over pages of briefing and thousands of pages of supporting declarations and exhibits,came on for hearing on december and.id.on september,the district court filed a page opinion granting in part and denying in part plaintiffs claims,and granting in part and denying in part defendants claims.id.at.
the district court made dozens of conclusions relating to almost every component of the biop when rendering this complex and lengthy opinion.we briefly review the conclusions at issue in this appeal.
the defendants ask us to overturn the following of the district court holdings in which it struck down components of the biop 
nmfs acted unlawfully by relying on raw salvage data to set negative flow thresholds for the old and middle rivers.basic scientific principles require the agency to use data scaled to population to determine the impact of exports on fish survival.id.at.
nmfs erred by failing to provide sufficient support for its classification of the chinook as high risk rather than the less serious classification of not viable.id.at.
nmfs erred by failing to reconcile the salmonid biop jeopardy determination relating to the southern resident orca with an apparently contradictory conclusion in a different biop orca biop.id.at.
nmfs failed to adequately explain how continued operation of the projects will adversely modify the cv steelhead critical habitat by reducing spawnable area and degrading gravel quality and quantity.id.at.
although nmfs sufficiently established that delta hydrologic conditions as altered in part by the projects are favorable to invasive species,the biop does not support the conclusion that continued operations promote invasive species,which in turn threaten listed species.id.at.nor does the biop sufficiently explain how the projects influence contaminants or cause food limitations.id.
nmfs provided no support for its decision to use maximum steelhead habitat as a benchmark for evaluating the effect of east side division operations on listed species in the stanislaus river.because the modeling related to the new melones dam flows are based on the maximum habitat benchmark,the new melones dam flow limits violate the apa.id.at.
nmfs modeling assumptions relating to the stanislaus river are flawed because nmfs set its goal as doubling cv steelhead habitat.id.at.
nmfs failed to establish how each rpa action complies with factors.specifically,nmfs did not establish how each rpa action complies with the many purposes of the cvpia,id.at,nor did it consider how each action is feasible,id.at.nmfs erred particularly by failing to show how delta action iv is feasible.
nmfs erred by failing to explain how certain rpa actions are essential to avoid jeopardy of the listed species or adverse modification of their habitats.id.at.those actions are delta division rpas iv,iv,and iv and east side division rpas iii,iii,and iii.
plaintiffs ask us to overturn the following of the district court holdings that were favorable to the biop 
reclamation did not violate its obligations under section of the esa when it accepted the salmonid biop.id.at.
nmfs did not need to segregate discretionary and agency activities when constituting the environmental baseline.id.at.
nmfs did not err by classifying indirect mortality factors as a direct effect of the continuing projects.id.at.
the district court entered its final judgment on december.see final judgment,ecf.the parties timely.this court has jurisdiction under.
ii.standards of review 
we review the district court summary judgment rulings de novo.mcfarland kempthorne,cir internal citations omitted.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings and record demonstrate that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.this court also reviews de novo the district court evaluations of an agency actions.sierra club babbit,cir de novo review of a district court judgment concerning a decision of an administrative agency means we view the case from the same position as the district court.we evaluate a district court decision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion.lands council powell,cir.
this is a record review case,so we will conduct our own review of the administrative record and,if necessary,direct that summary judgment be granted to either party id.at.
iii.the record on review 
before reviewing the merits of the salmonid biop,we must resolve an initial evidentiary question did the district court err in its own record review by supplementing the administrative record with dozens of declarations the district court relied on declarations comprising thousands of pages of scientific opinion,to evaluate and in some circumstances call into question the biop.see in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at describing how the parties cross motions for summary judgment included thousands of pages of supporting declarations and exhibits.it did so under our holding in lands council,at,which permits district courts to supplement an administrative record in a few limited circumstances.see tr.of proceeding mot.to admit expert test.vol,at,ecf hereinafter expert tr.vol.id.at describing the lands council exceptions.the question here is whether the district court properly applied lands council,or whether it went beyond lands council to improperly question nmfs scientific determinations.we hold,based in part on our opinion in delta smelt,at,that the district court went beyond the lands council exceptions when it admitted declarations and substituted the analysis in those declarations for that provided by nmfs.
in general,a court reviewing agency action under the apa must limit its review to the administrative record.see camp pitts.we have applied this rule many times,in many different contexts.see,delta smelt,at stating the rule and applying it to strike declarations admitted by the district court fence creek cattle,cir generally,judicial review of an agency decision is limited to the administrative record on which the agency based the challenged decision.sw.ctr.for biological diversity,cir judicial review of an agency decision typically focuses on the administrative record in existence at the time of the decision and does not encompass any part of the record that is made initially in the reviewing court.asarco,cir a gency action must be examined by scrutinizing the administrative record at the time the agency made its decision.
this rule ensures that the reviewing court affords sufficient deference to the agency action.the apa gives an agency substantial discretion to rely on the reasonable opinions of its own qualified experts even if,as an original matter,a court might find contrary views more persuasive.marsh or.natural res.def.council.when a reviewing court considers evidence that was not before the agency,it inevitably leads the reviewing court to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.asarco,at.in so imposing its judgment,the reviewing court effectively conducts a de novo review of the agency action rather than limiting itself to the deferential procedural review that the apa arbitrary or capricious standard permits.see river runners for wilderness martin,cir per curiam.
but we have also recognized several exceptions to this rule.under lands council,a reviewing court may consider evidence where admission of that evidence is necessary to determine whether the agency has considered all relevant factors and has explained its decision,is necessary to determine whether the agency has relied on documents not in the record,when supplementing the record is necessary to explain technical terms or complex subject matter,or when plaintiffs make a showing of agency bad faith.at quoting sw.ctr.for biological diversity,at.these exceptions are to be narrowly construed,and the party seeking to admit evidence initially bears the burden of demonstrating that a relevant exception applies.see fence creek,at.
the first lands council exception the relevant factors exception is the most difficult to apply,so we pause here to further examine it.although the relevant factors exception permits a district court to consider evidence to develop a background against which it can evaluate the integrity of the agency analysis,the exception does not permit district courts to use evidence to judge the wisdom of the agency action.asarco,at.this distinction is a fine,but important,one.reviewing courts may admit evidence under this exception only to help the court understand whether the agency complied with the apa requirement that the agency decision be neither arbitrary nor capricious.see id.at see also motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto ins.further describing the apa standards.but reviewing courts may not look to this evidence as a basis for questioning the agency scientific analyses or conclusions.asarco,at.
we most recently considered the scope of the lands council exceptions in delta smelt.see delta smelt,at.there,like here,the district court admitted multiple declarations from multiple experts to augment the administrative record.id.at.we held that,in doing so,the district court violated the apa for two reasons.first,the court admitted more than forty expert declarations under lands council in addition to certifying four expert declarations under federal rule of evidence.id.at citing.we questioned whether technical language in the biop or provide background material because the rule experts served those purposes.see id.at.thus,we were critical of the district court opening the administrative record as a forum for the experts to debate the merits of the biop.id.at.
second,we held in delta smelt that the district court erred when it used the declarations as a basis for judging the wisdom of the agency scientific analysis.at.even if a reviewing court properly admits evidence under lands council,it may not use the admitted evidence to determine the correctness or wisdom of the agency decision.asarco,at.such use is never permitted.
here too,the district court violated delta smelt holding when it used several declarations to question nmfs scientific judgments.as in delta smelt,the district court here relied on the declarations of the parties as the basis for rejecting the biop.at.in this way,the district court overstepped the bounds of lands council by opening the administrative record as a forum for the experts to debate the merits of the biop.the district court employed declarations at the following points for this impermissible purpose in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at,deriso,ecf id.at,burnham,ecf id.at,hilborn reply,ecf id.at cramer,ecf id.at cummings,ecf id.at,cavallo,ecf id.at dotan,ecf.by admitting these declarations and relying on them to question the wisdom of nmfs judgments,the district court abused its discretion under lands council.
iv.the legal framework 
the esa does not provide its own standard of judicial review,so we evaluate the biop under the apa arbitrary or capricious standard.see bennett,at delta smelt,at.section a of the apa requires a reviewing court to uphold agency action unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.under this standard,we will sustain an agency action if the agency has articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the conclusions made.pac.coast fed of fishermen ass ns bureau of reclamation,cir.
the arbitrary or capricious standard is a deferential standard of review under which the agency action carries a presumption of regularity.see citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,abrogated in part on other grounds as recognized in califano sanders.kern cnty.farm bureau allen,cir.although the court inquiry must be searching and careful,the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one.marsh,at internal citations omitted.thus,e ven when an agency explains its decision with less than ideal clarity,a reviewing court will not upset the decision on that account if the agency path may be reasonably discerned.dep t of envt l conservation.quoting bowman transp.freight.it is not the reviewing court task to make its own judgment about the appropriate outcome.river runners for wilderness,at.congress has delegated that responsibility to the agency.id.the court responsibility is narrower to determine whether the agency complied with the procedural requirements of the apa.id.
this traditional deference to the agency is at its highest where a court is reviewing an agency action that required a high level of technical expertise.marsh,at see also baltimore gas natural res.def.council.when examining this kind of scientific determination a reviewing court must generally be at its most deferential.as part of this deference,we afford the agency discretion to choose among scientific models we reject an agency choice of a scientific model only when the model bears no rational relationship to the characteristics of the data to which it is applied.delta smelt,at internal citations omitted.
nevertheless,the deference we owe an agency is not unlimited.we may not automatically defer to an agency conclusions,even when those conclusions are scientific.see marsh,at.rather,our review must be sufficiently probing to ensure that the agency has not 
relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.
state farm,at.a different approach would not simply render judicial review generally meaningless,but would be contrary to the demand that courts ensure that agency decisions are founded on a reasoned evaluation of the relevant factors.marsh,at internal citations omitted.
the esa requires an agency to use the best scientific and commercial data available when formulating a biop.a g.an agency failure to do so violates the apa.see a pac.coast fed.gutierrez,d.
the purpose of the best available science standard is to prevent an agency from basing its action on speculation and surmise.bennett,at.under this standard,an agency must not disregard available scientific evidence that is in some way better than the evidence it relies on.kern,at quoting sw.ctr.for biological diversity babbitt.the standard does not,however,require an agency to conduct new tests or make decisions on data that does not yet exist.see am.wildlands kempthorne,holding that an agency use of available data and test methods was reasonable even though better test methods existed because those test methods had not yet been used on the species in question.moreover,if the only available data is weak,and thus not dispositive,an agency reliance on such data does not render the agency determination arbitrary and capricious.greenpeace action franklin,cir quoting stop h ass dole,cir.an agency complies with the best available science standard so long as it does not ignore available studies,even if it disagrees with or discredits them.see kern,at rejecting kern argument that fws violated the best available science standard when it cited but allegedly misinterpreted three studies.
finally,what constitutes the best scientific and commercial data available is itself a scientific determination deserving of deference.miccosukee tribe of indians of united states,cir citing marsh,at.for that reason a court should be especially wary of overturning such a determination on review.in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at.
v.the merits of the biological opinion 
with these standards in mind,we evaluate each biop component that is challenged on appeal.
plaintiffs originally challenged dozens of specific components of the salmonid biop.at summary judgment,the district court upheld as valid many of them,and determined that several others were arbitrary or capricious.see id.at.defendants appeal each part of the district court opinion in which the court found the biop unlawful.plaintiffs several portions of the opinion in which the district court upheld the biop.
we discuss each challenge to the biop in turn.first,we address the district court objections to nmfs use of raw salvage data.second,we discuss the challenges to nmfs jeopardy opinions,including the portion of the biop dealing with indirect mortality factors.third,we review the challenges to nmfs rpas,clarifying what the esa and its implementing regulations require from the agency when it is developing and defining rpas.we then evaluate the challenged actions in light of those requirements.finally,we discuss the three issues.
as our record review will show,the district court in many instances did not afford the agency proper deference under the apa.rather than evaluating the agency process and deferring to the agency scientific conclusions when those conclusions are fairly traceable to the record,the district court engaged in an substantive review of the science supporting the biop and substituted its own opinions,and those of the parties experts,for the opinions of nmfs.as a result,the district court invalidated much of the biop under a quasi de novo review.but the apa does not permit such an review,particularly where,like here,the conclusions implicate agency expertise.see marsh,at.
we correct the district court errors in our own review and as a result,we uphold the biop in its entirety.after reviewing the record as a whole,we are satisfied that,when developing each component of the biop,nmfs relied on the factors that congress intended it to consider,considered all important aspects of the problem,and offered explanations for its decisions that are in line with the evidence.see state farm,at.we are also satisfied that,in doing so,nmfs used the best scientific data available,even if that science was not always perfect.greenpeace action,at.
a.we defer to the agency choice to use raw salvage figures 
the projects pump fresh water out of the old and middle rivers in volumes sufficient to reverse the rivers traditional flow.delta smelt,at.absent pumping,the rivers would flow north into the delta.under pumping operations,the rivers flow south to the jones and banks pumping plants.listed species particularly juveniles are caught in the negative current and drawn towards the pumping facilities.see salmonid biop at.some of these fish are salvaged at the pumps,meaning they are diverted from the fatal pumping plants to fish salvage facilities and into tanks where they are counted,measured,loaded into trucks,driven north,and dumped back into the delta but even if salvaged,fish that are drawn towards the pumps in the rivers negative flow have a lower likelihood of surviving outmigration than their counterpoints that are lucky enough to avoid entrainment 
nmfs concluded in the biop that as negative flow of the old and middle rivers increases,fish are more likely to be diverted out of the main delta and towards the pumping facilities.salmonid biop at.to counter this effect and enhance the likelihood of salmonids successfully exiting the delta,several of the rpa actions regulate negative flows and limit exports when fish numbers are high or are likely to be high.nmfs developed these rpa actions,in part,by considering the raw number of fish salvaged at certain volumes of negative flow.see id.at.
plaintiffs argue that nmfs violated the esa by using raw salvage data instead of data scaled to fish population.they assert that the number of fish salvaged every month could be related to the number of fish in the delta rather than to the volume of negative flows in the old and middle rivers.the district court agreed,concluding that it goes against the grain of traditional science to use raw instead of scaled salvage numbers.in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at.and because t he agency is required to apply generally recognized and accepted biostatistical principles,which constitute the best available science,in reaching its decisions,nmfs use of raw salvage data was arbitrary or capricious.id.defendants appeal that holding here.
this issue is almost entirely controlled by our holding in delta smelt.there,the consulting agency fws also used raw salvage data to set maximum negative flows for the old and middle rivers.see delta smelt,at delta smelt biop at.we determined that the choice to use raw salvage data was appropriate for three reasons.first,the agency has substantial discretion to choose between available scientific models,provided that it explains its choice.see delta smelt,at citing nw.coal.for alts.to pesticides,cir.second,other studies helped inform the specific flow requirements imposed.finally,the flow limits work in tandem with the incidental take statement its,which accounts for impacts.id.at.
all three factors are present here.first,the agency adequately explained why the loss data,although to population,usefully assisted nmfs in identifying whether and how fish loss relates to negative flow velocity.see salmonid biop at ocap ba at.
second,nmfs like fws did not base its maximum negative flow prescriptions on raw salvage data alone.rather,it used the same particle tracking models fws used in the delta smelt biop to evaluate the effect of heightened exports on naturally buoyant particles.salmonid biop at.it also relied on studies,such as a study by wim kimmerer,to support its conclusion that there exists a positive relationship between the volume of water exported from project pumping plants and juvenile salmonid entrainment at those plants.see,id.at delta smelt,at describing how fws used the same study.
finally,here like in the delta smelt biop the its uses population data to scale incidental take,and the rpa uses data generated from incidental take to introduce more restrictive flows in the old and middle rivers.like the delta smelt biop,the salmonid biop sets a range of acceptable negative flow in the old and middle rivers and requires the action agency to use data generated from incidental take to scale in more permissive or restrictive flows,with a minimum flow of cfs.salmonid biop at.
for these three reasons,the agency acted within its substantial discretion when it used a data model to set flows in the old and middle rivers.
b.the challenged jeopardy opinion components are not arbitrary or capricious 
nmfs determined that the proposed continuing operations of the projects are likely to jeopardize the viability and essential habitat of the listed species.id.at.the district court invalidated several specific components of this provision as arbitrary or capricious.see in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at.defendants appeal the district court holdings,so we review them here.
winter run chinook 
according to the district court,nmfs based its finding that ongoing operations jeopardize chinook in part on its determination that chinook is at a high risk of extinction.id.at.the court concluded that nmfs high risk designation was completely unsupported by the record.id.as a result,the district court determined that this aspect of the biop must be remanded and fixed.
the district court was incorrect in so concluding.nmfs did not characterize chinook as being at high risk of extinction instead of characterizing the species as being not viable.see id.at.rather,nmfs informed its designation of chinook as not viable by considering lindley study,in which he suggests that chinook is at a high risk of extinction in several categories.see salmonid biop at.nmfs discussed the limitations of lindley categories and explained how it made up for these limitations by relying on other studies.see id.citing mcelhany et,liermann and hilborn,and others.in doing so,nmfs adequately explained how its various descriptions of chinook as high risk influenced its ultimate jeopardy opinion.such an explanation is sufficient to satisfy state farm requirement that the agency consider all relevant factors and offer an explanation for its conclusion that is grounded in the evidence.see at.thus,this part of the biop need not be remanded and fixed.
southern resident orca 
nmfs concludes in the biop that continued operations are likely to jeopardize the viability of the southern resident orca.salmonid biop at.the logic supporting this conclusion is relatively simple.the orca population at issue has fewer than ninety members,and so nmfs felt compelled to scrutinize even small effects on the fitness of individuals that increase the risk of mortality or decrease the chances of successful reproduction.id.at.and chinook are a critical prey base for the southern resident orca.id.according to nmfs,reduction in populations of this jeopardize the southern resident orca because,for example,less food requires whales to spend too much energy foraging and insufficient prey could cause whales to rely upon their fat stores,which contain high contaminant levels.id.nmfs concluded that continued operations threaten the viability of and chinook.id.at.this determination led it to also conclude that these operations jeopardize the southern resident orca.id.
the district court reversed and remanded this conclusion.it held that nmfs did not consider all relevant factors of the problem because it failed to discuss a seemingly contrary finding it made,in a biop issued on may,that commercial ocean harvest of salmon would not jeopardize the southern resident killer whales.see in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at.
the district court conclusion is incorrect because nmfs did discuss the orca biop in the salmonid biop,showing that it did not entirely fail to consider an aspect of the problem.see state farm,at.nmfs discussed the orca biop as part of its baseline analysis.see salmonid biop at.nmfs clarified that the orca biop unlike the salmonid biop does not consider the health of chinook on the continued viability of the southern resident orca,but rather analyzes the impact of commercial harvest on the whales food supply.id.at.in this way,nmfs distinguished the two biops as dealing with different time frames.nmfs discussion of how findings in the orca biop relate to findings in the salmonid biop,although brief,is sufficient to show that nmfs considered the orca biop when developing the salmonid biop.this consideration satisfies nmfs obligations under state farm.see at.
steelhead critical habitat 
the biop makes two relevant conclusions regarding how the proposed action will adversely modify cv steelhead critical habitat in the stanislaus river.first,nmfs concludes that cv steelhead prefer to spawn when water is flowing at cfs proposed deviations from that flow could reduce spawnable habitat as much as percent in some years.salmonid biop at.second,nmfs concludes that continued operations,specifically those that dictate flows from the new melones and goodwin dams,will degrade spawning gravel below the goodwin dam,thereby undermining replenishment efforts.id.
the district court found these conclusions to be arbitrary or capricious.specifically,with regard to spawnable area,the district court found that nmfs used maximum habitat as a benchmark for evaluating the projects impacts.that benchmark was improper because maximizing habitat is not a goal of the esa.in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at.the district court also found that no record evidence supported nmfs conclusion that the operations cause the recorded gravel loss.id.at.
we side with the agency on both issues.first,nmfs did not misapply the esa by relying on a study that sets a goal of maximizing habitat the record shows that nmfs looked to aceituno and other studies to determine the point at which the projects restriction of flows in the stanislaus river would appreciabl y reduce habitat,see salmonid biop at citing.the record does not show that nmfs abandoned the esa prescription to avoid jeopardy in favor of aceiunto goal of maximizing habitat,see id.discussing jeopardy requirement.rather,nmfs explained why aceiunto study provided an adequate baseline for developing minimum and pulse flows in the stanislaus river in providing this explanation,nmfs satisfied its obligations under the esa and state farm.at.
second,the record provides adequate support grounded in best available science for nmfs conclusion that operations negatively impact spawning gravel quantity and quality.before construction of dams,channel forming flows of cfs and mobilizing flows of to cfs created channels outside of traditional gravel spawning grounds in which the river deposited fine sediment.salmonid biop at citing mesick kondolf et.but operations have all but halted these flows in recent years.id.thus,fine sediment collects in cv steelhead gravel spawning ground,degrading the quality of spawning areas.id.according to kondolf study upon which nmfs bases much of this part of the jeopardy opinion,poor quality of spawning gravels due to deposition of sand and fine sediment is one of four primary factors limiting salmon survival in the stanislaus river the specific component of the biop challenged here essentially adopts this conclusion.see salmonid biop at citing kondolf et.although nmfs could have done a better job making the connection between operations and the quantity of gravel suitable for cv steelhead rearing,that connection is fairly discernable from a review of the whole record.see bowman,at.the conclusion is,thus,not arbitrary or capricious.
indirect mortality factors 
the biop evaluates the impact of both direct and indirect mortality factors on listed species.direct mortality factors,such as entrainment,are those project components that directly harm or kill listed species.see.indirect mortality factors are those caused by continued operations that do not directly cause the death of listed species,but lead to it.those indirect mortality factors include predation,harm inflicted on native species by species,pollution,and food limitations.see salmonid biop at.nmfs concludes that operations cause indirect mortality for listed species by creating conditions in the delta that favor species,species that prey on listed salmonids.operations also negatively influence the listed species by lengthening the time members remain in the interior delta where they are exposed to pollution and other indirect mortality factors before outmigrating to the ocean.see id.
plaintiffs challenged this finding at summary judgment.see in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at.the district court mostly agreed with them,holding that although nmfs sufficiently established that delta hydrologic conditions as altered in part by the projects are favorable to invasive species,nmfs failed to articulate the connection among continuing projects operations,invasive species,and harm to listed species.see id.at posing the following questions what effect do these exotics have on the listed species to what extent does the contribution of the projects to the continued presence of these exotics contribute to the jeopardy finding.that failure,according to the district court,rendered the indirect mortality analysis arbitrary and capricious.id.at.
we disagree.nmfs adequately connected indirect mortality factors to operations,thus satisfying its obligations under the apa and esa.nmfs conclusion that the projects operations exacerbate salmonid indirect mortality proceeds in three steps.first,nmfs explains how,over the past half century,the projects operations have worked to degrade the environment in the interior delta,converting a thriving river system into an unnatural inland habitat to many native species.this statement is uncontested.see id.at plaintiffs do not directly contest the conclusion that the altered hydrologic conditions are favorable for invasive species.nor do plaintiffs challenge the biop conclusion that cvp and swp operations contribute to this ecosystem alteration.second,nmfs concludes that continued operations specifically pumping from the jones and banks facilities cause fish outmigrating through the main channels of the delta to divert into intersecting channels that split off from the main rivers and lead towards the inner delta.salmonid biop at.the projects operations cause this diversion by,among other things,reversing the flows of the old and middle rivers.id.at citing vogel to support the conclusion that fish chose channels leading south more frequently when exports were elevated,than when exports were lower.third,fish that are drawn through intersecting channels and into the inner delta have a lower survival rate than fish that remain in the main delta.id.at.not all of these fish are killed in pumping plants many are eaten by predators,trapped by plants,or fall prey to pollution in the inner delta.id.at.
the second step provides the critical causal link between the projects operations and indirect mortality factors that the district court found lacking.we find that nmfs cited enough scientific evidence to support its conclusions that high levels of pumping from the jones and banks facilities influence fish to swim towards the inner delta where they fall prey to indirect mortality factors.see id.at citing vogel,sjrga,sjrga,sjrga.although the agency analysis is not perfect,it may reasonably be discerned,see bowman,at,and is thus not arbitrary or capricious 
c.the challenged rpa actions are not arbitrary or capricious 
we now consider the rpa actions invalidated by the district court.before wading into the specific actions,we clarify what the esa and its implementing regulations require from an agency when the agency is developing rpas as part of a biop.
the legal requirements for an rpa action 
esa section provides that i f jeopardy or adverse modification is found during consultation,the secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not,b a,jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or result in adverse modification of critical habitat,id.a.reasonable and prudent alternatives are alternative actions identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action,can be implemented consistent with the scope of the federal agency legal authority and jurisdiction,are economically and technologically feasible,and the director believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.the first three of these factors are the factors developed by the agency.the final is the jeopardy factor,and it is taken from esa section.see delta smelt,at.
under these provisions,the district court reversed and remanded several rpa actions because the agency did not explain how each rpa action is essential to avoid jeopardy,in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at see also id.at,or explain how each rpa action complies with three factors.we recently held in delta smelt that these are not the correct legal standards under which to evaluate an rpa action.as we further clarify below,neither section nor require nmfs to explain why each action is essential or to fully elucidate the factors.
a.the esa does not require nmfs to explain how each rpa action is essential to avoid jeopardy 
the district court held that requires nmfs to show how each rpa action is essential to avoid jeopardy the effect of this holding was to impose an onerous,highly precise standard on nmfs under which the district court invalidated rpa actions anytime nmfs did not explain why the action was necessary,over all others,to preserve the species.see,in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at.
as we explained in delta smelt,neither the esa nor its implementing regulations require this level of precision from the agency.the esa requires only that the agency impose rpas that are not likely to jeopardize the species or its habitat.see a,b b.the regulations interpret this section as requiring the agency to develop rpas that the director believes would avoid jeopardy.this moderate and deferential language is a far cry from that which would impose a strictly essential requirement.rather,this language imposes a flexible standard for the consulting agency that does not require the secretary to explain why he chose one rpa over another delta smelt,at citing sw.ctr.for biological diversity bureau of reclamation,cir.under this deferential standard,the agency need not pick the best rpa or the one most likely to avoid jeopardy.id.rather,we give the agency flexibility to choose among several appropriate alternatives.we will uphold that choice so long as it is reasonably supported based on a review of the record as a whole.see sw.ctr.for biological diversity bureau of reclamation,at.
b.the esa does not require nmfs to articulate compliance with the non jeopardy factors 
the district court also held that agency regulations require nmfs to describe how each rpa action meets factors.see in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at.it invalidated several rpa actions,including action iv,for failing to establish compliance with these factors.we hold that the district court erred in interpreting.
again,this issue is largely controlled by delta smelt.we said in delta smelt that,n othing in obligates the consultation agency to address the non jeopardy factors when it proposes rpas.section is a definitional section it is defining what constitutes an rpa,not setting out hoops that the consultation agency must jump through.at.thus,while a thorough documentation of modification in the biop is always required,documentation of the non jeopardy factors is only required when the rpa fails to meet a non jeopardy factor.id.at.based on this conclusion,we rejected the district court finding that the agency acted arbitrarily or capriciously by failing to include some exposition in the record of why the agency concluded if it did so at all that all four regulatory requirements for a valid rpa were satisfied.san luis delta mendota water auth.salazar,d,aff in part rev in part by delta smelt.
this holding applies with equal force here.nmfs is not required to document its compliance with factors.rather,it needed only to fairly conclude based on the record that the proposed rpas do not further jeopardize the listed species or adversely affect critical habitats.see delta smelt,at.we evaluate whether it did so below.
challenged rpa actions 
the district court invalidated several rpa actions related to the san joaquin delta.the first,action iv,prescribes san joaquin river inflow to export ratios between april and may.salmonid biop at.after a brief adjustment period,action iv requires reclamation and dwr to implement specific flow to combined export ratios on the san joaquin river measured at vernalis,california.id.at.those ratios are 
salmonid biop at.
the district court invalidated the ratio as arbitrary and capricious.although it concluded that record evidence provided support for some ratio,the district court determined that the agency did not provide sufficient support for the specific ratio.see generally in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at.
we disagree with the district court and hold that the record supports nmfs decision to impose the ratio.nmfs bases its decision to impose a ratio primarily on vernalis adaptive management plan vamp studies of chinook salmon smolts salmonid biop at.vamp has tested salmonid survival based on a ratio,but not a ratio.drawing on vamp and other data showing a positive correlation between a ratio and successful salmonid outmigration nmfs concluded that flow to export ratios should be at least and preferably higher to increase survival and abundance.stuart,supra,at.nmfs settled on the ratio as a high ratio appropriate in precipitation years by studying historic monthly average flows at vernalis.id.at.this data shows that approximately cfs of flow is available at vernalis in percent of the wet and above normal water years.id.at.being that the minimum export level to maintain health and safety is cfs,id.at,a export ratio in wet and above normal years although maximally protective of fish is traceable to the record.it is within the agency discretion to choose a conservative threshold that will afford maximum protection to the species so long as that threshold is fairly supported,which it is.valley auth.hill.
action iv and action iv 
actions iv and iv specify river flow management strategies for the old and middle rivers.although the old and middle rivers typically flow north,cvp and swp pumping reverses that flow,drawing the water south to the jones and banks pumping plants.see delta smelt,at.according to particle tracking model ptm and fish tagging studies cited by nmfs,listed fish outmigrating through the san joaquin river are vulnerable to diversion into the channels that lead to the export facilities when pumping is high and the flow of the old and middle rivers is very negative.salmonid biop at.these diverted fish have a lower rate of survival than their counterparts that bypass the inner delta and migrate directly through the outer delta to the san francisco bay.
actions iv and iv seek to mitigate these effects by imposing negative flow restrictions on the old and middle rivers.action iv requires the projects to reduce exports from the jones and banks pumping plants between january and june such that the negative flow of the old and middle rivers is limited to to cfs,depending on the presence of salmonids.id.at.action iv requires the projects to reduce exports between november and december when fish salvage numbers the numbers of fish caught at the pumps meet certain triggers.id.at.
the district court invalidated both actions.it held,with regard to action iv,that the agency did not adequately explain how imposition of the specific flow requirements in the action are essential to avoid jeopardy.in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at citation omitted.it invalidated action iv because nmfs based the specific triggers on raw salvage data and failed to provide any record explanation for why the specific triggers were chosen.id.at.
we again reverse the district court and find that the record supports nmfs decision to impose both actions.the record fairly supports nmfs imposition of the particular flow restrictions in action iv.ptm modeling cited by nmfs supports the conclusion that risk of fish entrainment at pumping facilities increases substantially between and cfs.salmonid biop at.that same data shows that the risk of entrainment increases at an even greater rate with flow restrictions more negative than cfs.id.thus,it is reasonable for nmfs to impose the to cfs range as a minimum negative flow during times when salmonids are likely to pass channel openings.the raw data salvage numbers bolster this conclusion.according to that data,l oss of older juveniles at the cvp and swp fish collection facilities increases sharply at old and middle river flows of approximately cfs id.at.nmfs explained its rationale for imposing the specific flow restrictions in action iv,and supports that rationale with what it has determined is the best available science ptm studies and raw salvage data it has,thus,satisfied its procedural and substantive obligations under the apa and esa.
action iv is also fairly traceable to the salmonid biop and accompanying studies.nmfs explains that the triggers imposed by action iv are developed from previous work done by dwr,reclamation,nmfs,and fws the specific triggers in action iv eight acre feet or fifteen acre feet come from data compiled by nmfs tending to show that when salvage exceeds those levels,there is a pulse of fish in the system.see stuart ptm,supra,at.the agency decision to set these as particular triggers is based on its own data generated over nine years,data that is well documented in the biop and supporting memoranda.see id.for that reason,these particular triggers are not arbitrary or capricious.
action iv requires dwr to implement specific measures to reduce fish loss and improve salvage efficiency.salmonid biop at.to reduce loss,the action requires dwr to commence studies to develop predator control methods for clifton court forebay,the body of water the fish cross before reaching the tracy and skinner fish collection facilities.id.at.the action also sets a specific benchmark for salvage efficiency at the facilities,requiring dwr to achieve a minimum percent salvage efficiency for cv salmon,steelhead,and green sturgeon at the skinner fish collection facility.id.at.
plaintiffs argued that this action is not technologically or economically feasible and that the agency thus violated by requiring it.the district court agreed.it concluded that nmfs failed to cite any record evidence indicating that the efficiency improvement,albeit a minor one,is economically or technologically feasible.in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at.
delta smelt made clear that the esa does not require nmfs to cite record evidence showing that each rpa action is economically and technologically feasible.delta smelt,at.thus,nmfs failure to cite such evidence here was not arbitrary or capricious.
action iii 
the remaining actions challenged by plaintiffs,invalidated by the district court,and challenged here,relate to operations on the stanislaus river,in the east side of the central valley.
action iii pertains to the temperature of the stanislaus river.according to nmfs,increased temperature in the stanislaus river threatens the critical habitat of the cv steelhead.salmonid biop at.to remedy this problem and achieve desired temperatures,action iii requires reclamation to make cold water releases from new melones reservoir to provide suitable temperatures for cv steelhead rearing,spawning,egg incubation smoltification,and adult migration in the stanislaus river downstream of goodwin dam id.at.action iii includes an exception to this requirement when the projected temperatures can not be achieved.id.at describing the process that reclamation should use to apply for an exception to the temperature requirements.
the district court remanded this action to the agency after determining that the agency did not sufficiently document the extent to which this rpa is essential to avoiding jeopardy in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at.more specifically,the court determined that because the action includes an exception with no limitations it necessarily does not avoid jeopardy.id.at.
the record does not support the district court conclusion that the federal defendants describe an exception that has no limitations.id.at.nmfs will consider granting an exception to the temperature requirements only when reclamation demonstrates that after taking all actions within its authorities,it is unlikely to meet the temperature requirements.salmonid biop at.if that happens,reclamation must convene the stanislaus operations group sog to obtain recommendations on how to proceed.see id.at.if the sog can not come to a consensus,nmfs will make recommendations.reclamation must satisfy several procedural requirements before nmfs will grant an exception under action iii,leading us to conclude that application of the exception is limited.for this reason,the record supports nmfs conclusion that imposition of action iii,notwithstanding its exception,is likely to avoid jeopardy.
action iii 
action iii also relates to how operations on the stanislaus river impact the cv steelhead.cv steelhead adults respond to certain flows in the stanislaus river as a natural cue for fall migration.juveniles depend on a particular volume of spring flows to assist them in migrating out of the river to the delta and eventually to the pacific ocean.id.at.pulse flows in the stanislaus river also benefit cv steelhead habitat by maintaining gravel quality,promoting channel formation,and enhancing access to varied rearing habitats.id.at.to better provide these essential cues and to sustain cv steelhead habitat,action iii requires reclamation to operate releases from the east side division reservoir to achieve a minimum flow schedule as prescribed in the rpa.id.at.the minimum flow schedule incorporates short periods of high volume flows in october fall attraction flows,several times in march and april outmigration cue flows,and in may outmigration flows.id.
the district court invalidated this action because nmfs failed to explain why the pulse flows would maintain gravel quality in the stanislaus river.in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at.it remanded for further explanation on this point,noting that p articularly in light of the potentially high water costs of these pulse flows,the rationale for action iii must be lawfully explained and justified on remand.id.
we hold that the district court erred by failing to defer to the agency interpretation of a scientific study.nmfs based action iii flow numbers on a study conducted by kondolf,et.in that study,kondolf,et conclude that flows around to cfs are necessary to mobilize the channel bed material.kondolf et,supra,at.nmfs determined,after weighing the relevant interests,that implementing pulse flows at the of kondolf flow range would achieve the appropriate balance between habitat protection and maintaining water reserves in the east side division reservoir.see reed,supra,at.in doing so,nmfs balanced kondolf pulse flow suggestions against reclamation conclusion that prolonged flows exceeding cfs would cause flooding.see id.congress delegated this type of balancing to administrative agencies when it passed the apa and esa.see river runners for wilderness,at.as long as the agency decision is properly documented,as it is here,we will not overturn it.see state farm,at 
action iii 
finally,the district court invalidated rpa action iii,which relates to floodplain restoration and innundation flows in the stanislaus river.prior to the construction of the new melones dam in the late,snow melt from the sierra nevada mountains created pulse flows in the stanislaus river that formed new and scoured existing channels in the riverbed and surrounding floodplains.salmonid biop at.cv steelhead juveniles used and continue to use these channels as a rearing habitat.id.however,the floodplain habitats that were inundated before operation of the new melones dam have become fossilized with fine material and thick riparian vegetation that is never rejuvenated by scouring,because pulse flows from new melones dam are infrequent.thus f loodplain juvenile rearing habitat and connectivity will continue to be degraded by new melones operations,as proposed.id.to remedy this impact,action iii requires reclamation to seek advice from sog to develop an operational strategy to achieve floodplain innundation flows that inundate cv steelhead juvenile rearing habitat on a one to return schedule.id.the district court found this action arbitrary or capricious,holding that because it defines no action per se,nmfs did not and in fact could not perform a feasibility analysis as required by.in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at.
the district court erred in invaliding this action.we held in delta smelt that does not require the consultation agency to explain how each action is feasible.and neither plaintiffs nor the district court provide any reason why the sog would recommend an action that reclamation and dwr could not adopt.see sw.ctr.for biological diversity bureau of reclamation,at noting that feasibility is examined from the perspective of the agency.thus,this court has no reason to declare that action iii violates feasibility factor.
vi.cross appeal 
plaintiffs several components of the district court opinion in which the district court upheld the biop.we affirm the district court on all three issues.
nmfs need not distinguish discretionary and non discretionary actions 
esa section provides that,after an agency seeks consultation on a potential project,the agency providing consultation shall write a biop detailing how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.b a.to determine how agency action affects listed species,the consulting agency must analyze the action in relation to the environmental baseline.this baseline is intended to form a basic snapshot of the status of the species at a particular moment in time before the action is taken.liebesman petersen,supra,at.
plaintiffs argue that nmfs must separate discretionary aspects of the projects from aspects of the projects to define the environmental baseline.the district court disagreed,holding that n othing in the law requires nmfs to segregate discretionary aspects of coordinated project operations from ones in the manner export plaintiffs demand.in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at.
plaintiffs argument is the same argument that we entertained and rejected in delta smelt.see at.we again reject these arguments and affirm the district court on this point.
b.the biological opinion indirect mortality factors are direct effects under the esa 
for the purposes of esa section consultation,the effect of a proposed action includes both direct and indirect effects.to show that something is an indirect effect of the proposed action,an agency must demonstrate that it is caused by the action,that it is later in time than the action,and that it is reasonably likely to occur.handbook,supra,at citing.whether nmfs needed to make these findings with regard to indirect mortality factors identified in the biop,see salmonid biop at,is a key issue on.
nmfs concludes in the biop that operations subject listed species to indirect mortality factors such as predation and exposure to toxins in the inner delta.see generally id.at.the district court determined that the indirect mortality findings challenged by plaintiffs do not constitute indirect effects within the meaning of because they are caused by the action subject to consultation,not by some other action in re consolidated salmonid cases,d at citing handbook,supra.
we agree with the district court.indirect effects are typically more attenuated than those described in the biop.national wildlife federation coleman provides a clear,example of an indirect effect,cir.there,the fifth circuit held that the department of transportation must consider the residential and commercial development that can be expected to result from the construction of the highway as an indirect effect of highway construction.id.nmfs and fws provide another example of an indirect effect in the consultation handbook.see handbook,supra,at.this example is a little bit closer to home 
a very complex example of indirect effects arose in determining effects of renewing water services contracts in the san joaquin basin upon checking with other federal and state agencies,the fws determined that the distribution of water for agricultural use on the higher east side of the valley provided a hydrologic head maintaining the groundwater table on the west side of the valley at a level making it economical to pump.
id.as a result,residents could use the pumped water to convert the land to agriculture.but the conversion of the land to agriculture destroyed the habitat of several listed species.id.fws considered this an indirect effect of renewing the water services contracts.id.these two examples show that an indirect effect as envisioned by is one that the action makes possible or indeed,more probable,but does not directly cause.
the indirect mortality factors described in the biop are direct effects.according to nmfs,operations draw listed fish into the inner delta by reversing the flows of the old and middle river
