the appellants,consisting of south carolina department of health and environmental control,chemical llc,and certain businesses involved in the manufacture and transportation of fertilizer production materials,seek reinstatement of their civil action against four liability insurers for cost recovery,contribution,restitution,and declaratory relief.by its judgment order of february,the district court for south carolina dismissed the lawsuit two direct action claims against the insurers,one seeking cost recovery and one seeking contribution,for failure to state claims upon which relief can be granted.see.b.the court also dismissed the appellants common law claim for restitution,and it declined to exercise jurisdiction over two declaratory judgment claims.dep t of health envtl.control commerce indus.ins.
this appeal concerns the application and interplay of two major federal environmental protection statutes.the first is the resource conservation and recovery act rcra,which authorizes the pursuit of civil actions directly against who have provided evidence of financial responsibility to owners and operators of hazardous waste facilities.et.the second is the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,commonly known as superfund,which in proper circumstances authorizes the pursuit of claims for cost recovery and contribution against parties potentially responsible for contaminating facilities.et.in their complaint,the appellants rely on the direct action provision of rcra t to seek cost recovery and contribution under cercla.the primary issue in this appeal is whether rcra direct action provision may be utilized to pursue these cercla claims.the appellants contend that it can be so utilized and that the district court,in dismissing their complaint,misconstrued the rcra direct action provision.as explained below,we affirm.
a.the resource conservation and recovery act 
rcra was enacted in october,and it is codified as chapter entitled solid waste disposal of title of the united states code.rcra mandates the environmental protection agency the epa to develop permitting requirements for hazardous waste facilities rcra a a.one of those requirements is that,in seeking a permit,an owner or operator of such a hazardous waste facility must provide financial assurance to the epa for liability relating to closure,postclosure,or corrective activities at the facility et establishing standards regarding applicability of financial requirements for owners and operators of hazardous waste facilities et establishing interim status standards regarding applicability of financial requirements for owners and operators of hazardous waste facilities.in demonstrating to the epa that they possess financial responsibility for the closure and postclosure care of such facilities,such owners and operators are obliged to provide for the compensation of third parties for certain injuries or damages resulting from spills and accidental occurrences.id.the financial responsibility mandate is designated in the regulations as financial assurance,id,and,according to rcra,it may be established by any one,or any combination,of the following insurance,guarantee,surety bond,letter of credit,or qualification as a.t.
in november,the scope and requirements of rcra chapter of title were amended by the hazardous and solid waste amendments,and a right of direct action was included in rcra.see.pursuant to rcra direct action provision the rcra provision 
in any case where the owner or operator is in bankruptcy,any claim arising from conduct for which evidence of financial responsibility must be provided under rcra financial responsibility provision may be asserted directly against the guarantor providing such evidence of financial responsibility.
b.the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act 
cercla was enacted in december,and it is codified as chapter entitled comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability of title.et.cercla was a congressional response to public concern over the improper disposal of hazardous waste,and its two primary goals have been recognized as the promotion of prompt and effective cleanup of hazardous waste sites,and the sharing of financial responsibility among those parties who created the hazards.aviall,cooper,cir.in order to attain these goals,cercla generally imposes strict liability on owners and operators of facilities from which hazardous substances were released,and it authorizes civil actions against certain responsible parties to recover the costs incurred in cleaning up hazardous waste disposal sites.stevens creek assocs.barclays bank,cir.significantly,any party incurring response costs consistent with the and national contingency plan ncp is authorized to seek recovery of those costs from other potentially responsible parties by way of a cercla claim.a.
a claim may be asserted under section of cercla by a government or private entity seeking to recover from a responsible party any response costs incurred in remediating a hazardous waste facility.hall,et,superfund manual legal and management strategies,gov t.under cercla,the term potentially responsible party prp is deemed by the epa to be t he person or persons who may be held liable for hazardous substance contamination under cercla.prps may include the owners and operators,generators,transporters,and disposers of the hazardous substances.orientation manual,app.d.in october,cercla was amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act,which was also codified in chapter of title.as a result,chapter now expressly authorizes a cercla cause of action for contribution.f.pursuant thereto,any party incurring response costs consistent with the ncp may seek its cleanup costs from other prps by way of a cercla contribution claim.id.
furthermore,cercla chapter of title,like rcra chapter of title,contains a direct action provision.the cercla direct action provision authorizes a party to assert any claim authorized by or directly against any guarantor providing evidence of financial responsibility under cercla c.although the epa has promulgated regulations giving effect to the rcra provision by establishing financial responsibility requirements thereunder,see et establishing rcra financial responsibility requirements,no financial responsibility regulations have been promulgated by the epa to implement the cercla direct action provision with respect to onshore cercla facilities such as the facility at issue here.cercla required the promulgation of regulations establishing minimum levels of financial responsibility for the operation of hazardous waste facilities under cercla.b.although the executive was mandated to promulgate those regulations not earlier than five years after december,no such regulations have been promulgated.
factual background 
from to,stoller chemical company operated a fertilizer manufacturing facility the facility in jericho,south carolina.pursuant to rcra subsection b,the epa may authorize a state to administer and enforce its own hazardous waste program,so long as the state program is equivalent to and consistent with the epa program.b.in november,south carolina became an state and assumed primary responsibility,primacy,for implementing its hazardous waste program.although the state hazardous waste regulations applied to the facility,the epa retained its full enforcement authority under rcra in south carolina.see.power light epa,discussing cooperative federalism and state authorization under rcra.both the epa and the department of health and environmental control dhec classified the facility,pursuant to rcra and the south carolina hazardous waste management act,as a hazardous waste treatment,storage,and disposal facility.because of this classification,the facility operations were regulated under both federal and state law.
in the early,stoller was granted several operating permits by dhec under which it was authorized to operate the facility as a hazardous waste facility.in order to secure these permits,stoller provided to dhec the financial assurance that it could protect third parties from damages or injuries caused by operation of the facility.t c.in their amended complaint the complaint the appellants allege,inter alia,that the defendant insurers the insurers had filed certificates of liability insurance with dhec,certifying that they provided insurance coverage to stoller satisfying rcra financial assurance requirements complaint.the complaint also alleges that the policies cover the costs incurred by dhec and the other appellants,as required by federal and south carolina law,complaint that the claims arise from conduct for which insurance was obtained from the insurers,complaint and that the policies satisfy the applicable south carolina law and regulations,which implement the requirements of rcra and its regulations.complaint.additionally,the appellants admit that the insurers did not provide insurance coverage to stoller pursuant to cercla financial assurance requirements.see appellants reply br.at acknowledging cercla financial assurance provision not applicable to facility.
in march,stoller ceased operations at the facility and filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in texas.shortly thereafter,the epa investigated the facility and determined that its real property was contaminated.because stoller had filed for bankruptcy and was insolvent,the epa and dhec initiated cercla enforcement proceedings in the district of south carolina against,which owned the facility from to,and against certain of the appellants who had been involved in the manufacture and transportation of fertilizer production materials used at the facility the corporate claimants in those cercla enforcement proceedings,the epa and dhec sought is,the environmental the facility complaint.
in,as a result of these enforcement proceedings,the corporate claimants,the epa,and dhec entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement,by which they resolved each prp cercla liability for costs associated with remediating the facility.by order of june,the district court approved the settlement agreement.of health envtl.control atl.steel,june.pursuant thereto,the corporate claimants are in the process of remediating the facility,and they have agreed to complete it.the corporate claimants have also agreed to reimburse dhec for its remediation expenses and for all costs associated with its administration of the remediation process.complaint.
procedural history 
by their complaint,the appellants seek to recover from the insurers their past remediation costs and the costs they have agreed to pay for future remediation of the facility.complaint.in count one,the appellants seek to recover their remediation costs directly from the insurers,pursuant to section of cercla.count two,initiated on behalf of the corporate claimants only,seeks contribution directly from the insurers,pursuant to section of cercla.id.in count three,the appellants seek common law restitution directly from the insurers.in count four,the corporate claimants seek a declaration that each insurer is obliged to pay for all future damages,losses,and costs incurred in remediating the facility.finally,in count five,dhec seeks a declaration that the insurers must pay all future costs resulting from the facility remediation.
on january,the insurers moved to dismiss the complaint.with respect to counts one and two,they maintained that the appellants could not proceed directly against them to recover costs already expended in remediating the facility because 
the appellants claims for the recovery of remediation costs arise under cercla,rather than rcra 
rcra and cercla contain separate and distinct direct action provisions 
in order to initiate a cercla cause of action directly against an insurer,a claimant must rely on cercla direct action provision,rather than on the rcra provision 
cercla direct action provision authorizes suit directly against an insurer to recover cleanup costs only if the insurer provided evidence of financial responsibility pursuant to cercla and 
the insurers provided financial assurance to stoller pursuant to rcra,not cercla.
in sum,the insurers maintained that counts one and two failed to state claims upon which relief can be granted,see.b,because the rcra provision can not be utilized to pursue a remedy under cercla.the court agreed with the insurers and dismissed those claims,ruling that the rcra provision may not be used to pursue a cercla claim against insurers of hazardous waste facilities.
in seeking the dismissal of count three,the insurers contended that it was a cercla claim mischaracterized as a claim for common law restitution.they maintained that count three is indistinguishable from the claims asserted in counts one and two and that it was subject to dismissal on the same basis.the insurers also contended that count three was defective because,under south carolina law,a direct action may not be pursued on a restitution claim.the court agreed with the insurers,deciding that count three is a cercla claim in disguise and that south carolina law does not authorize a restitution claim to be asserted directly against an insurer.
finally,the court declined to exercise jurisdiction over counts four and five.first,it determined that it could not resolve the declaratory judgment claims without declaring stoller rights under the policies.and it concluded that,because stoller was not a party to the proceedings,the court could not declare those rights.second,the court decided that interests of judicial economy required it to decline jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment claims.on february,it entered an order dismissing the complaint dep t of health envtl.control commerce indus.ins.the appellants have timely appealed,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.

in counts one and two,the appellants assert cercla and contribution claims directly against the insurers.cost recovery id.contribution.on appeal,they maintain that the district court erred in concluding that they could not meld the procedural direct action right authorized by rcra,id.t,with substantive rights of recovery authorized under cercla.the appellants contend that nothing in the rcra provision precludes their pursuing cercla claims,on the basis of the rcra provision,directly against the insurers.the appellants also maintain that the national policy underlying the adoption of rcra supports their use of the rcra provision.we reject these contentions for the following reasons first,by its plain language,the rcra provision applies only to claims concerning present and future threats to human health and the environment second,the appellants reliance on the rcra provision is an effort to circumvent cercla more specific direct action provision and third,the national policy underlying rcra indicates that congress intended to limit the rcra provision to claims concerning present and future threats to human health and the environment.we discuss in turn each of these bases for our conclusion.
first,the plain language of the rcra provision convinces us that it applies only to claims concerning present and future threats to human health and the environment,as opposed to claims seeking to recover the costs of environmental cleanup activities.in resolving issues of statutory construction,we are obliged to begin with the language of a statute.if the statute is clear,judicial inquiry into the statute meaning,in all but the most extraordinary circumstances,is finished.estate of cowart nicklos drilling,d.we decide whether statutory language is plain by assessing the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil,d.as explained below,the rcra provision,viewed in its broader context,precludes its being used to pursue counts one and two.
in order to evaluate the rcra provision in its broader context,we must understand the distinct goals of rcra and cercla.although the aims of rcra and cercla are related,each serves a separate and unique purpose westfarm assocs.suburban sanitary comm n,cir rcra is preventative cercla is curative.quoting goodrich murtha,cir.according to congress,rcra established this nation basic hazardous waste management system,and provided complementary authority to encourage the conservation and recovery of valuable materials and energy,pt,at,reprinted in.as a result,rcra is preventative in nature i t attempts to deal with hazardous waste before it becomes a problem by establishing minimum federal standards for the generation,treatment,storage,transportation,and disposal of hazardous waste,and the permitting of facilities to treat hazardous waste.envtl.tech.council sierra club,cir.indeed,as the supreme court has observed,rcra is not principally designed to compensate those who have attended to the remediation of environmental hazards.meghrig kfc,d.
cercla,on the other hand,serves goals that are remedial and curative rather than preventative.westfarm,at.as we have observed,cercla establishes a cleanup program for hazardous waste which has already been disposed of improperly.envtl.tech.council,at.although rcra serves cercla remedial purpose by preventing the creation of future sites,see,pt,at,reprinted in,observing that in the absence of enforcement of rcra,little more will be done than to contribute to future burdens on the superfund program,which is the remedial program charged to epa under cercla,rcra does not authorize the prosecution of civil actions seeking the recovery of cleanup costs.meghrig,at.we recognize that both rcra and cercla address issues relating to the management of hazardous wastes.each statute serves discrete and unique purposes,however,and we are constrained to assess the rcra provision within this broader context.
rather than analyzing the rcra provision in its broader context,the appellants inappropriately focus on the term any claim,as contained therein.relying on this term,they maintain that nothing in the rcra provision restricts its use to claims arising under rcra.in so contending,however,they misapprehend the context in which the term any claim is used.read in context,the term any claim refers to any claim arising from conduct for which the insurer provided evidence of financial responsibility.t providing that any claim arising from conduct for which evidence of financial responsibility must be provided under this section may be asserted directly against the guarantor providing such evidence of financial responsibility.
the breadth of the rcra provision necessarily relates to the extent to which insurance coverage is mandated by rcra financial responsibility requirement.under the appellants interpretation of the rcra provision,an injured party could pursue any claim arising from the operation of a facility directly against an insurer providing coverage to the facility.if this position were valid,then congress has also authorized the rcra provision to be used,inter alia,to pursue negligence claims arising from auto accidents resulting from the operation of such facilities.and because such negligence claims would be maintained under rcra,they could be pursued in federal court.see.there is nothing in the text of rcra,however,or in its legislative history,indicating that congress intended such an absurd result.in these circumstances,we can only conclude that the rcra provision authorizes a direct action against an insurer only to the extent that the insurer was required by rcra to provide financial assurance.
as to counts one and two,therefore,we must assess whether those claims arise from conduct for which the insurers were required,pursuant to rcra,to provide evidence of financial responsibility.in rcra,congress mandated the epa to promulgate regulations requiring owners and operators of hazardous waste facilities to provide evidence of their financial responsibility,provide financial assurance.a.because the epa has granted primacy to south carolina with respect to its rcra hazardous waste management program,the hazardous waste facilities in that state must comply with south carolina financial responsibility provision the provision.south carolina decision on final authorization of state hazardous waste management program.therefore,we must decide whether the insurance coverage required by the provision included stoller conduct giving rise to the claims asserted in counts one and two.two parts of the provision define the ambit of the financial assurance required for an owner or operator to obtain a rcra permit from dhec.first,subsection c provides that dhec may not issue a permit to an owner or operator of a hazardous waste facility unless such owner or operator has provided dhec with 
e vidence of financial assurance in the form and amount as dhec may determine to be necessary to ensure that,upon abandonment,cessation,or interruption of the operation of a facility or site,all appropriate measures are taken to prevent present and future damage to the public health and safety and to the environment.
c emphasis added.thus,the coverage mandated by this part of the provision is expressly limited to claims for present and future damage to public health,safety,and the environment.
a separate subsection of the provision requires that,before issuing a permit to an owner or operator of a hazardous waste facility,dhec shall require e vidence of other financial assurance in such forms and amounts as dhec determines to be necessary to ensure the adequate availability of funds for costs and restoration of environmental impairment arising from the facility.c.although the scope of coverage required by this part of the provision is not expressly limited to present and future damage,the scope of such coverage is identical to that mandated by the federal requirements.south carolina final authorization of state hazardous waste management program revision,observing that south carolina hazardous waste program has no requirements more stringent or broader in scope than those required by federal law.the insurance coverage mandated by the provision is therefore restricted to present and future threats to human health and the environment insurance coverage for and contribution is not mandated by the provision.see supra part.infra part.
in this dispute,counts one and two seek reimbursement for costs the appellants incurred in remediating past environmental harms,cleaning up the facility.see complaint,alleging that appellants are entitled to reimbursement for costs they incurred in addressing environmental contamination at facility.the provision,however,requires financial assurance only to ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to prevent present and future damage to the public health and safety and to the environment.a emphasis added.thus,on the basis of the rcra provision,analyzed in concert with the provision,the district court properly ruled that counts one and two fail to satisfy rule b.the appellants are thus unable to rely on the rcra provision to pursue their cercla and contribution claims directly against the insurers.
in seeking to use the rcra provision to assert their cercla claims directly against the insurers,the appellants are undertaking to circumvent cercla direct action provision pursuant to elementary principles of statutory construction,unless the legislature has indicated that it intends otherwise,a specific statutory provision controls a more general one.see guidry sheet metal workers pension fund,d it is an elementary tenet of statutory construction that w here there is no clear intention otherwise,a specific statute will not be controlled or nullified by a general one quoting morton mancari,d see also warren dep t of human,cir it is an elementary principle of statutory construction that a specific statutory provision controls a more general one.importantly,the cercla provision limits the circumstances under which it may be used to assert cercla claims directly against a liable party insurer.
on appeal,the appellants acknowledge that the l
