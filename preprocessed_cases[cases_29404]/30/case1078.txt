the issue before us presents a question of statutory interpretation under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla,when does the limitations period for suing to collect remedial action costs from a party responsible for hazardous substances begin one would expect a fairly straightforward answer to that question in the statute.potential plaintiffs need to know when to file suit,and potential defendants would surely prefer clear notice as to when their legal liability,if any,lapses.true,in the maze like structure and baffling language of cercla,clarity is rare.carson harbor vill.unocal,cir en banc.the provision we grapple with today appears at first blush to be no exception.but as one works one way through the statute as a whole,a fairly definite answer emerges.as will appear,we conclude that the limitations period for bringing an initial suit for recovery of remedial action costs under cercla can not accrue until after the final adoption of the remedial action plan required by the statute.
factual background 
for years,neville chemical company neville manufactured at its industrial facility in santa fe springs,california,various chemical compounds for use in insecticides,solvents,metal working lubricants,and flame retardants.these activities contaminated the groundwater and soil at the facility.in,the california department of toxic substances control the department issued a remedial action order,directing neville to begin the process of cleaning the site conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study submit a draft remedial action plan rap and,once the draft rap was finalized,implement the plan.
the department sent neville a letter on september,informing neville of its obligation to pay an activity fee to the department.the letter explained that the activity fee to partially cover the department cost of overseeing neville actions to characterize and satisfactorily remediate this site.at that time,the department had a formal policy of only collect ing direct program expenditures generally laboratory or contract expenditures beyond activity fees in cases where the responsible parties are being cooperative.in,the department rescinded this policy in favor of pursuing the full cost recovery of overseeing a,regardless of whether the responsible party was recalcitrant or cooperative.
in august,neville presented the department with preliminary findings from the remedial investigation.in october,the department directed neville to prepare a groundwater removal action proposal the proposal,in which neville was to propose an expedited response to the contamination.the department stated that the proposal should be consistent with a final cleanup strategy for groundwater as it may ultimately become the final remedy presented in the remedial action plan.neville submitted its proposal on september.it included three major components an extraction system,a temporary treatment system,and an effluent disposal system.
the department reviewed the proposal and,in january,directed neville to implement the extraction and treatment system.in a letter to neville,the department stated the proposed system will potentially become part of the final remedial alternative for the site,and t he ground water extraction and treatment system is envisioned as part of the final remedial alternative h owever,the department may order the discontinuation of its use in the event it is not effective or if it enhances the migration of contaminants from the site.
neville submitted a feasibility study technical memorandum in august,listing alternative possible remedies.in response to this memorandum,the department stated that it 
has not gathered sufficient information and public comment to require any of the alternatives to be implemented as of yet.part of this remediation process requires that all feasible alternatives be scrutinized carefully and thoroughly prior to actual selection of the remedial alternative.the feasibility study is the tool that allows the department to weigh the technical and substantial issues for all possible alternatives in order to make a sound and fair decision in protecting the public health and the environment.
additionally,the letter stated 
the department reviewed and approved of the groundwater removal action as an interim measure to prevent further migration and to protect the public health and the environment.the groundwater removal action is not a final remedial action,and can not be construed to be such.the groundwater removal action,may be included as part of the final remedial action depending on the results and conclusions of the health risk assessment and the remedial action itself,which has yet to be prepared.therefore,whether the groundwater removal action constitutes the groundwater portion of the final remedial action can not be determined at this point.
neville began to excavate three extraction wells at the site in april.a month later,neville submitted a draft feasibility study,again proposing several alternative remedies.the department responded with comments to this draft in june of,including the following the department has never stated that the ground water removal activity is the final ground water remedy,but has to be tested to determine the efficiency of the system.in october of the same year,the department sent neville a letter expressing concern because neville had not started construction of the groundwater removal system.the department also noted,neville will need to compare several sample results to determine the effectiveness of the system.neville will use the information to determine whether this or a modified system will be incorporated into the draft remedial action plan.
neville submitted a final feasibility study,discussing seven alternative groundwater remedial options,in december of.later that month the department approved it.
neville then submitted a draft remedial action plan.on may,after having circulated the draft for public review and comment and holding a public meeting to discuss the plan,the department approved the final remedial action plan.the groundwater containment and treatment system originally designed as an interim removal action remained part of the final rap.
accrual of cause of action 
neville first argues that the district court erred in denying neville summary judgment motion because the statute of limitations for bringing a cost recovery action under cercla barred california suit.a party may appeal a denial of summary judgment once a final judgment has been entered in the suit.comsource indep.foodservice union pac,cir.we review a denial of summary judgment de novo.id.citing warren city of carlsbad,cir,and pomerantz county of los angeles,cir.
california brought suit on behalf of the department under of cercla.this statute provides that the owner and operator of a facility shall be held liable for a all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by a state not inconsistent with the national contingency plan an initial action for recovery of costs must be commenced for a remedial action,within years after initiation of physical construction of the remedial action.g.the present suit was brought on september.therefore,the suit is if and only if the initiation of physical construction of the remedial action occurred on or before september.
the facts of the case are not in dispute.the only question is which of the enumerated events constitutes the initiation of physical construction of the remedial action,thereby triggering the limitations period.neville maintains that the statute of limitations began to run in april,when it started excavating the extraction wells.california argues that no remedial action could have occurred until the final remedial action plan was approved by the department on may.this court has yet to decide when an action is remedial for the purpose of triggering the statute of limitations in cost recovery suits under g.
statutory interpretation 
the purpose of a limitations period is to clearly define the time period in which suit must be commenced.united states colvin,cir.here,the statute of limitations is invoked to bar the government from collecting the costs it expended in cleaning up a hazardous waste site,a situation in which we have been specially instructed by the supreme court to construe limitations periods in favor of the government.see badaracco comm r,d statutes of limitation sought to be applied to bar rights of the government,must receive a strict construction in favor of the government.citing dupont de nemours davis.additionally,if at all possible,the statute should be interpreted to provide a clear accrual date,so that each especially the state as when the time to bring suit runs out.the text of the statute,read as a whole rather than in pieces,specifies that ascertainable date.
title g provides that the initiation of physical construction of the remedial action triggers the statute of limitations.cercla defines remedial action in section 
the terms remedy or remedial action means sic those actions consistent with permanent remedy taken instead of or in addition to removal actions in the event of a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment,to prevent or minimize the release of hazardous substances so that they do not migrate to cause substantial danger to present or future public health or welfare or the environment.the term includes,but is not limited to,such actions at the location of the release as storage,confinement,perimeter protection using dikes,trenches,or ditches,clay cover,neutralization,cleanup of released hazardous substances and associated contaminated materials,recycling or reuse,diversion,destruction,segregation of reactive wastes,dredging or excavations,repair or replacement of leaking containers,collection of leachate and runoff,onsite treatment or incineration,provision of alternative water supplies,and any monitoring reasonably required to assure that such actions protect the public health and welfare and the environment.
emphasis added.removal,in turn,is defined thus 
the terms remove or removal means sic the cleanup or removal of released hazardous substances from the environment,such actions as may be necessary sic taken in the event of the threat of release of hazardous substances into the environment,such actions as may be necessary to monitor,assess,and evaluate the release or threat of release of hazardous substances,the disposal of removed material,or the taking of such other actions as may be necessary to prevent,minimize,or mitigate damage to the public health or welfare or to the environment,which may otherwise result from a release or threat of release.the term includes,in addition,without being limited to,security fencing or other measures to limit access,provision of alternative water supplies,and temporary evacuation and housing of threatened individuals not otherwise provided for 
the plain meaning of the definition of remedial,read together with the statute of limitations in g and the use of that same term in the rest of the statute,supports the conclusion that the initiation of physical construction of the remedial action can only occur after the final remedial action plan is adopted.
the first half of the definition of remedial action provides a general description of how such an action fits into the entire scheme of the required by the statute.remedial actions,the statute provides,must be consistent with permanent remedy taken instead of or in addition to removal actions.the second half of the definition lists some activities that could constitute remedial actions.these examples,however,must be read in light of the more general description of the first half.
for example,the provision of alternative water supplies is listed as both a type of remedial action and as a type of removal.the provision of alternative water supplies will only be remedial,therefore,if it is done consistent ly with permanent remedy on the other hand,if alternative water supplies are provided on a more temporary basis,the very same activity would be a removal action.that is,removal actions generally are immediate or interim responses,and remedial actions generally are permanent responses.geraghty miller,conoco,cir.in this case,therefore,even if the completed extraction wells do fall under one of the types of activities listed in the second half of the definition of remedial action,onsite treatment,the excavation of those wells must still be consistent with permanent remedy to have triggered the statute of limitations.
for an action to be consistent with permanent remedy,a permanent remedy must already have been adopted.neither party can know for sure whether a given action is consistent with permanent remedy until that permanent remedy is determined.the first point at which both parties can be certain that any construction is consistent with a permanent remedy is when the permanent remedy is actually selected.in this case,as in most cases the permanent remedy was selected when the final rap was approved.
until after the adoption of the rap,then,california could not have brought suit to recover remedial costs.the standard rule is that the limitations period commences when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.bay area laundry dry cleaning pension trust fund ferbar of,d quoting rawlings ray.internal quotation marks omitted.u ntil the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief,a limitations period ordinarily does not commence.bay area laundry,at.see also reiter cooper,d while it is theoretically possible for a statute to create a cause of action that accrues at one time for the purpose of calculating when the statute of limitations begins to run,but at another time for the purpose of bringing suit,we will not infer such an odd result in the absence of any such indication in the statute.
the department could not have brought suit for costs of remedial action at the time neville began excavating the extraction wells at that time,neither party could have known if the wells would eventually be consistent with permanent remedy,because no final remedial action plan had been decided upon at that point.as we must assume that the limitations period did not begin to run until at least the time california could have brought suit to recover remedial costs,that period could not have been triggered by the excavation of the wells.to rule otherwise would be to hold,as a practical matter,that california was required to bring suit before april,less than five years after its action for recovery of remedial costs first accrued,even though the statute specifies a limitations period 
in the case at hand,neither party could have known before the final rap was approved whether any particular construction projects would be consistent with the final remedy before the final remedial action plan was approved,the letters from the department emphasized and that it did not know whether any of the measures already taken by neville would or would not be consistent with the final remedial plan.see letter from the department to neville,january stating that the department may discontinue the use of the groundwater extraction and treatment system in the event it is not effective or if it enhances the migration of contaminants from the site letter from the department to neville,august stating that the department has not gathered sufficient information and public comment to require any of the alternatives to be implemented as of yet id.stating that the department reviewed and approved of the groundwater removal action as an interim measure but that the groundwater removal action is not a final remedial action,and can not be construed as such therefore,whether the groundwater removal action constitutes the groundwater portion of the final remedial action can not be determined at this point.
section of cercla,which provides for public participation in selection by the president or a state of a remedial action plan,reinforces our interpretation of remedial action as action taken after the final remedial action plan has been approved.after mandating a public notice and comment period and a public meeting regarding the proposed remedial action plan,a,the statute provides notice of the final remedial action plan adopted shall be published and the plan shall be made available to the public before commencement of any remedial action.b emphasis added.so,under the statute,remedial action may not therefore,the initiation of physical construction of the remedial action can not after a final remedial action plan is adopted.
the statutory provision limiting the time in which a party may commence a suit for natural resource damages also supports this interpretation of remedial action.title g states,in no event may an action for damages under this chapter with respect to a facility at which a remedial action is scheduled be commenced before selection of the remedial action if the president is diligently proceeding with a remedial investigation and feasibility study the reason for this limitation was illuminated in the house report issued by the committee on the judiciary congress sought to integrate cost recovery and damages actions.iii,reprinted in.the premise behind the report reasoning is clear natural resource damages actions and cost recovery actions could not be integrated if damages actions were brought before a remedy was selected,because cost recovery suits could not be brought before that point.
some courts have raised the concern that if one reads the statute,as we do,to provide that initiation of physical construction of the remedial action can only take place after the final remedial action plan is approved,much of the definition of remedial action would become superfluous.see,united states navistar int l transp,cir california hyampom lumber,advanced micro devices,semiconductor,d,citing hyampom.at.this concern is unwarranted.first,the definition of remedial action has roles in the statute other than defining the onset of one limitations period.the functional aspects of the definition are critical,for example,in apportioning the percentage of the costs of any between states and the fund.see see also requiring that certain standards be met when implementing remedial actions.
second,even though an action can only be remedial if it is taken after the final remedial action plan is approved,that does not mean that all actions taken after the final remedial action plan is approved are remedial in colorado sunoco,cir,for example,the tenth circuit was faced with the task of classifying certain actions,all of which took place after the epa chose its permanent remedy,as either remedial or removal actions.after discussing the character of the various actions in light of the definitions of remedial and removal,the court determined that two of the actions were,in fact,removal actions,both because they were interim rather than permanent measures,taken in response to the threat of release of contaminated water,and because similar activities had been denominated removal action by the epa in previous.id.at.thus,as sunoco illustrates,our interpretation of the statute of limitations does not render any part of the definition of remedial superfluous.
decisions of other circuits 
our conclusion that no action can be remedial until a final remedial action plan is in place is consistent with the results reached by every court of appeals that has considered the onset of the limitations period for recovery of remedial action costs under cercla,if not with all the reasoning of those cases.
in geraghty,the fifth circuit held that the installation of monitoring wells could not have triggered the statute of limitations because it occurred before the government agency overseeing the had issued its final approval of the remedial plan.see geraghty,at.the seventh circuit also reached the same result as we do,although some of its reasoning differed from ours.see navistar,at.in navistar,although the final remedial design was not approved until,the final remedial action plan selecting a permanent clay cap as part of the permanent remedy,was apparently approved before that.id.at at the conclusion of this process,which ended before february,the epa determined that,among other things,the landfill needed to be covered with a permanent clay cap to isolate the hazardous materials from the rest of the environment.thus,although the seventh circuit rejected a rule in which the final remedial design had to be formally approved before an action could be considered remedial,the action that it found to be the clay after the final remedial action plan was chosen.because our holding finds the pivotal event for defining the initiation of remedial action is the adoption of a remedial action a final remedial facts in navistar would have led us to find the suit barred by the limitations period as well.
finally,the tenth circuit,while not expressly rejecting a rule,has distinguished remedial actions from removal actions based solely on the more descriptive parts of their definitions.see sunoco,at see also pub.serv.of gates rubber,cir distinguishing remedial actions from removal actions in a context other than the triggering of the statute of limitations.in both the tenth circuit cases,however,it appears that the actions in question took place after a remedial action plan was in place.see sunoco,at,pub.serv,at.were we faced with the same facts,we,too,would have to turn to the descriptive aspects of the definitions to determine whether the actions at issue in sunoco and public service were remedial or removal.for the same reasons the result in navistar is not in conflict with our holding,then,these tenth circuit cases do not conflict,either.
in sum,we conclude that the initiation of physical construction of the remedial action can only occur after the final remedial action plan is adopted,and that,in this case,the statute of limitations,therefore,could not have begun to run until the final remedial action was approved on may.the department suit was brought within six years of the approval of the remedial action plan and is not,thus,barred by the statute of limitations.
ii.neville defenses on the merits 
neville raised an affirmative and the district court.the argument was that neville can not be liable under cercla for the costs of overseeing the incurred by the department because the department had promised that it would not sue neville for full recovery costs if neville conducted the research,planning,and of the site.the district court ruled that neville could not assert equitable defenses to a cercla recovery action.we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.united states chapman,cir.
cercla section a and b,a and b,allow for only three defenses to cercla liability.a covered person is liable under the statute subject only to the defenses set forth in subsection b of this section.a.subsection b lists three defenses an act of god an act of war and an act or omission of a third party b.in levin metals terminal,cir,we suggested that these defenses were exclusive.
congress imposed strict,but not absolute,liability under cercla.it provided defenses to liability for causation solely by an act of god,an act of war,or acts or omissions of a third party consequently,in order to state a claim for declaration of nonliability,the declaratory judgment plaintiff must base its claim of nonliability on one or more of the statutory affirmative defenses.
id.emphasis added internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
every court of appeals that has considered the precise question whether permits equitable defenses has concluded that it does not,as the statutory defenses are exclusive.see litton indus.automation,cir holding that cercla does not provide an unclean hands defense questioned on other grounds in key tronic united states,d see also blasland,bouck lee,city of north miami,cir holding that cercla bars equitable defenses velsicol chem.enenco,cir same town of munster,cir same.following the implication of levin metals and the express holdings of these cases from other circuits,we conclude that the three statutory defenses are the only ones available,and that traditional equitable defenses are not.the district court was correct,therefore,in holding that neville could not raise equitable defenses to liability under cercla.
neville argues separately that equitable defenses are at least relevant to the amount of recovery that the d
