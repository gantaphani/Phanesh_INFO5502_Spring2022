martha vigil,andy blackledge and robin silver petition for review of a final rule approved by the environmental protection agency epa under the clean air act.on july,epa approved arizona serious area state implementation plan for airborne particulate matter in the metropolitan phoenix maricopa county area and granted arizona request for an extension of the statutory attainment deadline from december,to december,
petitioners,who are interested phoenix residents,assert that epa actions are arbitrary and capricious or otherwise not in accordance with the act because epa approved arizona general permit rule for controlling agricultural emissions without requiring all feasible measures and,specifically,controls currently implemented in the south coast region of california.petitioners also argue that epa approved the plan without requiring arizona to mandate the use of carb diesel,a fuel standard adopted by the california air resources board.finally,petitioners argue that it was arbitrary and capricious for epa to grant an extension of the statutory deadline to december.we grant the petition in part,vacate portions of epa final approval of arizona state implementation plan for maricopa county,and remand to epa.
facts and proceedings below 
regulatory background 
the clean air act sets forth a cooperative scheme for improving the nation air quality.under the act,the epa publishes a list of air pollutants and then establishes national ambient air quality standards naaqs for each pollutant that it has identified.a,a.epa has identified airborne particulate matter of diameter micrometers or less as an air pollutant that affects the respiratory system and can cause damage to lung tissue and premature death.the elderly,children,and people with chronic lung disease,influenza,or asthma are especially sensitive to high levels of particulate matter.promulgation of federal implementation plan for moderate area disapproval of state implementation plan for moderate area.epa has established two national air quality standards for,a standard and an annual standard.a,b see sierra club epa,cir,amended by cir ober epa,cir ober i.
under the clean air act amendments of,congress designated certain areas as nonattainment for the standards.see,a,stat,codified at d b.congress further required that these nonattainment areas be classified by law as m oderate a rea s.a.moderate nonattainment areas may be reclassified as serious nonattainment areas under specified circumstances among other things,any area that fails to reach attainment by the applicable date shall be reclassified by operation of law as a serious area.b a.
each state has primary responsibility for assuring air quality within the region comprising such state,a,and each state must submit a state implementation plan sip proposing the manner in which the state will satisfy the naaqs,see id.a.in the event that a state does not submit a sip or does not submit a satisfactory plan within the specified time,the epa administrator shall promulgate a federal implementation plan fip.see id.c.
the act specifies different standards that sips in particulate matter nonattainment areas must satisfy,depending on whether an area is designated as moderate or serious.a sip for a moderate area must,among other things,include assurances that reasonably available control measures racm will be implemented by the specified implementation deadlines.a c emphasis added see also id.c.all moderate areas were to reach attainment by december.c.by contrast,a state implementation plan for a serious area must satisfy the requirements for a moderate area and must further demonstrate that the best available control measures bacm will be implemented within four years after the area is classified as serious.b b emphasis added.all serious areas were to reach attainment by december.c.
finally,the administrator may extend the attainment date for a serious area under various conditions and after various procedures are satisfied.e.these include that attainment by the specified date would be impracticable,that the state has complied with all requirements and commitments pertaining to that area in the implementation plan,and that the state demonstrates to the satisfaction of the administrator that the plan for that area includes the most stringent measures that are included in the implementation plan of any state or are achieved in practice in any state,and can feasibly be implemented in the area.id.the last of those three standards is referred to as most stringent measures msm.

the proceedings below are both numerous and complex.this is the fourth petition for review filed before us concerning implementation of the particulate matter naaqs in the phoenix metropolitan area.we issued published opinions in the first two petitions and dismissed the third petition as moot.ober i,ober whitman,cir ober ii ober browner,cir,order dismissing petition as moot see also delaney epa,cir decided prior to the clean air act amendments of,abrogation recognized by ober i,at.
under the act as amended in,phoenix was designated by law as a moderate nonattainment area for.a.in november,arizona submitted its moderate area state implementation plan,which epa rejected as incomplete.see approval and promulgation of implementation plans nonattainment area,july.arizona submitted a revised plan in,which epa approved.approval and promulgation of implementation plans nonattainment area.phoenix residents petitioned this court for review of epa action.we granted the petition on the grounds that epa failed to address reasonably available control measures and other aspects of the implementation plan for the standard.we held that the act required arizona to reduce violations of the standard irrespective of whether such measures would contribute to attaining the annual standard.ober i,at.
contemporaneously with our decision,epa found that arizona had not attained either the standard or the annual standard for by the statutory deadline,december.clean air act reclassification nonattainment area,may.as a result of this finding,arizona was reclassified as a serious nonattainment area by operation of law.b a.under the act,arizona had to submit a new state implementation plan within eighteen months.id.b.
following our decision in ober i and arizona reclassification as a serious nonattainment area,epa and arizona agreed that arizona should divide its planning efforts into two stages the state would address the moderate area and serious area requirements for the standard first,and then would address the requirements for the annual standard.in may,arizona submitted its plan for attainment of the county nonattainment area,known as the microscale plan,which epa approved in part and disapproved in part.approval and promulgation of implementation plans county nonattainment area.

standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to review epa approval of the sip under b.this section does not specify a standard of review,so we apply the general standard of review for agency actions in the administrative procedure act whether epa actions were arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.see alaska dep t of envtl.conservation epa,d arizona thomas,cir.we have stated that this standard requires the agency to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.sierra club,at quoting.cattle growers ass united states fish wildlife,cir.we have recently repeated that 
c ourts must carefully review the record to ensure that agency decisions are founded on a reasoned evaluation of the relevant factors,and may not rubber stamp administrative decisions that they deem inconsistent with a statutory mandate or that frustrate the congressional policy underlying a statute nevertheless,we may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency 
friends of yosemite valley norton,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.in particular,where,as here,a court reviews an agency action involv ing primarily issues of fact,and where analysis of the relevant documents requires a high level of technical expertise,we must defer to the informed discretion of the responsible federal agencies.sierra club,at quoting marsh or.natural res.council,d.even when an agency explains its decision with less than ideal clarity,we will not upset the decision on that account if the agency path may reasonably be discerned.alaska dep t of envtl.conservation.at quoting bowman,freight,d.
when the court reviews epa construction of a statute and the statute is either ambiguous or silent,the question is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron natural res.def.council,d.because there is some question whether epa has in fact construed the provisions at issue here,we discuss the legal standards set forth in the clean air act and epa efforts to construe them.
under b b,each state classified as a serious area for shall submit an implementation plan including p rovisions to assure that the best available control measures for the control of shall be implemented no later than four years after the area is classified as serious.this requirement is in addition to the statutory mandate for moderate area plans to include p rovisions to assure that reasonably available control measures for the control of shall be implemented by a specified deadline.a c.the terms reasonably available control measures and best available control measures are not defined by the act.
congress has given epa general rulemaking authority,a,which,when exercised,requires our deference in accordance with chevron.chevron,at.ober i,at see also requiring the administrator to issue technical guidance on racm and bacm for urban fugitive dust and other emissions by a specified date.epa has not,in fact,exercised its general rulemaking authority to define these terms.instead,shortly after the enactment of the clean air act amendments of,epa provided its preliminary views on racm and bacm in the form of advance notice of how epa generally intends to take action on sip submissions and to interpret various related title i provisions.state implementation plans for serious nonattainment areas,and attainment date waivers for nonattainment areas generally addendum to the general preamble for the implementation of title i of the clean air act amendments of,addendum state implementation plans general preamble for the implementation of title i of the clean air act amendments of,general preamble.epa advised that the views expressed in the addendum were epa preliminary interpretations,and thus do not bind the states and the public as a matter of law.addendum.at see also general preamble.at.indeed,epa announced that its rules would be developed later,through rulemaking on state sip revisions or through subsequent rulemakings on clean air act provisions.general preamble.at.the general preamble and addendum were simply advance notice of how epa generally intend ed,in those subsequent rulemakings,to take action.id.epa has never undertaken the rulemakings to which it adverted.furthermore,in the addendum,epa indicated that it would issue future guidance on what constituted most stringent measures for granting an extension of the attainment date.at.epa has never issued such guidance.thus,the only guidance we have from epa is its preliminary interpretations that do not bind the states and the public as a matter of law,and epa ruling in this matter,which binds arizona.
under the familiar analysis in chevron,if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,then the matter is capable of but one interpretation by which the court and the agency must abide.chevron,at.by contrast,where we determine that a statute is not clear,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.the principal statutory terms at issue here reasonably available control measures,best available control measures,and most stringent control measures are not terms as to which there can be but one view of the law.indeed,they fairly exude ambiguity and invite debate.congress has left it to epa to fill the gaps in meaning in these provisions.
chevron deference,however,does not apply to the general preamble and addendum,as they specifically recite that they constitute epa preliminary guidance and do not have the force of law.interpretations such as those contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines,all of which lack the force of not warrant deference.christensen harris county,d see hall epa,cir.such views,however,even if not authoritative for purposes of chevron,are entitled to skidmore deference insofar as they constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.skidmore swift.cogent administrative interpretations not the products of formal rulemaking nevertheless warrant respect.alaska dep t of envtl.conservation.at citation,internal quotation marks,and brackets omitted see also united states mead,d wilderness soc y united states fish wildlife,cir en banc,amended by cir en banc pronsolino nastri,cir,cert.denied,d.epa interpretations of the act,as expressed previously in the general preamble and addendum,are entitled to respect.we need not resolve the question whether the epa interpretation of the act in the course of approving arizona sip is entitled to chevron deference,because the result in the present case would be the same under any standard of deference.
petitioners challenge three aspects of epa final rule.first,petitioners claim that arizona general permit rule for agricultural emissions does not constitute either bacm or msm.second,petitioners argue that arizona controls of diesel emissions do not constitute bacm or msm.consequently,petitioners argue,epa approval of arizona plan was arbitrary and capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law.third,petitioners claim that the administrator abused his discretion when he extended the attainment date for arizona to.we consider each of these arguments in turn.
arizona general permit rule for agriculture 
in may,the arizona legislature enacted legislation creating an agricultural best management practices bmp committee.stat.a.the consisted of a representative of the arizona department of environmental quality,representatives of state and federal agricultural agencies,agriculture experts from the university of arizona,and farmers,id.b was required to adopt an agricultural general permit specifying best management practices for regulated agricultural activities to reduce particulate emissions,id.h.the committee considered management practices and evaluated them using available information on technological feasibility,costs,and energy and environmental impacts.see.at.after an analysis of the limited information available and numerous public discussions,the committee decided to include of the practices in the general permit rule and divided them among three categories of farm activities tillage and harvest,noncropland,and cropland specified in the statute.id.at.in may,the arizona department of environmental quality adopted the rule as.admin.code.the regulation establishes the three categories of farm activities,sets out the bmps dividing them among the three categories,and requires commercial farmers to implement at least one bmp per category.id.the only exception is that a person may develop reduction practices not listed in the rule,but such practices must be proven effective through demonstration trials and submitted to the committee for review.id.h.
in october,epa approved arizona general permit rule as racm and observed that the rule in fact far exceed ed the racm requirements.at.petitioners did not challenge epa final rule.
petitioners now challenge the general permit rule on two grounds.first,petitioners argue that,because bacm requires a stricter showing than racm and racm requires implementation of all reasonably available control measures,c emphasis added,but the general permit rule mandates only one bmp in each category,the rule can not satisfy bacm.second,petitioners argue that the general permit rule can not satisfy the msm requirement because it fails to adopt practices implemented in california south coast region.
arizona general permit rule as bacm 
petitioners do not challenge any particular practice adopted as bacm rather,petitioners contend that there is no reason why arizona could not require farmers to implement more than one control measure in each category.petitioners point out that because,in one sense,arizona has already found these measures to be feasible,more than one measure must be implemented.as a matter of theory,petitioners are,of course,correct.intuitively,it seems obvious to say that if one measure per category is good,two or more would be better.petitioners argument proves too much,however.by petitioners logic,if two are better than one,three are better than two,and so forth.we have little doubt that if arizona required all of these measures,it would achieve greater reductions than under its present plan.
petitioners argument would be compelling if the act required a state to reduce its emissions to the maximum extent possible,regardless of cost.epa,however,has concluded that best available control measures means 
the maximum degree of emissions reduction of and precursors from a source which is determined on a basis,taking into account energy,environmental,and economic impacts and other costs,to be achievable for such source through application of production processes and available methods,systems,and techniques for control of each such pollutant.
addendum.at.petitioners do not challenge this longstanding interpretation of the act,and we can not say that the interpretation is impermissible.see alaska dep t of envtl.conservation.at similarly defining the term best available control technology for purposes of the prevention of significant deterioration program.our task,therefore,is to determine whether epa has properly concluded that arizona has provided for the maximum degree of emissions reduction,all things considered.
in its state implementation plan,arizona explained why it listed bmps in three categories,yet required farmers to implement only three bmps one bmp in each category.arizona reported that an effective agricultural control strategy is highly dependent on specific local factors,such as regional climate,wind strength and direction,soil types,g rowing season,crop types,cropping systems,moisture conditions,water availability,and relation to urban centers.air quality.dep t of envtl.quality,maricopa county serious area state implementation plan revision agricultural best management practices,enclosure at june,bmp plan.thus,each pm agricultural strategy must be based on local circumstances and a single bmp will not work equally well for all growers.id.at.arizona plan stated that farmers were encouraged to implement more than one bmp,but it is not reasonable to require more than one bmp because in some instances one may be enough for a particular farm.id.at emphasis added.the committee could not determine that requiring more than one bmp would be reasonable given the cost and emission reduction uncertainties.id.at.
epa concluded that the committee review was thorough and found that the general permit rule met bacm.at see also.at envtl.prot.agency,final technical support document,tsd based on the bmp committee findings regarding technological feasibility and economic effects of requiring more than one bmp per category,we believe that the bmp rule provides the maximum degree of emission reductions achievable from the agriculture source category in the phoenix area and,therefore,meets the bacm requirement.at tsd at.epa found that listing options was an acceptable form for the implementation of bacm,as it accounts for the variable nature of farming and the varying economic circumstances of farmers.tsd at.allowing an individual source to select the control method is a 
common and accepted practice for the control of dust allowing sources the discretion to choose from a range of specified options is particularly important for the agricultural sector because of the variable nature of farming.as a technical matter,neither we nor the state is in a position to dictate what precise control method is appropriate for a given farm activity at a given time in a given locale moreover,the economic circumstances of farmers vary considerably.as a result,it is imperative that flexibility be built into any control measure for the agricultural source category.
at see also tsd at epa concluded that the general permit rule represents a comprehensive,sensible approach and satisfied bacm with respect to both the and the annual standards.tsd at.
in developing the bmps for the general permit rule,the arizona committee considered agricultural controls adopted by the south coast region of california.bmp plan at.it noted,however,that the south coast was the only other area in the united states to require the implementation of bmps to reduce agricultural and that information concerning the effectiveness and cost of these bmps was therefore limited.id.at.epa accepted arizona conclusions that agricultural production differs from farm to farm and that it was not possible to compare directly arizona agriculture and california agriculture.a gricultural strategies must be based on local factors because of the variety,complexity,and uniqueness of farming operations and because agricultural sources vary by factors such as regional climate,soil type,growing season,crop type,water availability,and relation to urban centers.at see also.at.agricultural sources are unlike other stationary sources and are unlike sources such as automobiles that have common design features and may be subjected to a common or uniform control measure.epa also acknowledged that the bmp committee had very limited information regarding the technological feasibility,costs,and energy and environmental impacts of the potential bmps.id.indeed,epa found that arizona could not evaluate the south coast practices because the south coast did not attempt to estimate the reductions and cost from each conservation practice.tsd at.epa reported that,in developing the fip in,it considered the south coast rules but because the two areas differ in a number of key characteristics,epa decided not to propose the south coast rules for arizona because the agency could not reasonably conclude that their implementation would in fact result in air quality benefits for the maricopa nonattainment area.at.
epa not only examined arizona final rule and rationale,it looked closely at the process by which arizona arrived at its bmp plan.arizona assembled representatives from agriculture,state and federal agencies,and the university of arizona a endeavor involving an array of agricultural experts familiar with maricopa county agriculture.at see also tsd at.at.the bmp committee held public hearings and received public comments.it thoroughly reviewed the south coast rules and found that certain aspects of them were not adapted to arizona conditions.
taking into account the uncertainties involved in prescribing agricultural rules,the measures that arizona adopted,and the process by which arizona arrived at its bmps,we can not conclude that epa approval of arizona general permit rule as bacm was arbitrary and capricious.even as epa approved the general permit rule as racm in,epa concluded that the rule far exceed ed the racm standard.at.epa approval of the general permit rule as bacm is thus consistent with its view that bacm suggests a generally higher standard of performance than racm.addendum.at.arizona has offered a reasoned explanation for the choices it made,and epa was within the bounds of its judgment and expertise to approve it.
arizona general permit rule as msm 
petitioners argue that arizona plan does not implement msm because arizona has not adopted certain measures that california implemented in the south coast air quality management district district.the district includes the south coast air basin basin encompassing orange county and portions of los angeles,riverside,and san bernardino counties,the coachella valley,and other territory.specifically,petitioners claim that the district requires growers to cease tilling on high wind days and to adopt more bmps.
in contrast to bacm,msm requires a comparative inquiry.the act does not define msm,but refers to it as the most stringent measures that are included in the implementation plan of any state or are achieved in practice in any state,and can feasibly be implemented in the area.e emphasis added.the act also explicitly permits the epa administrator,in determining whether to grant an extension and how long it should be,to consider,among other things,the technological and economic feasibility of various control measures.id.e.epa has defined msm as the maximum degree of emission reduction that has been required or achieved from a source or source category in other sips or in practice in other states and can be feasibly implemented in the area.at.epa interprets msm to not require any measure that is infeasible on technological or economic grounds,any measure for insignificant source categories,and any measure or group of measures that would not contribute to expeditious attainment.at.
as noted above,petitioners argue that arizona general permit rule fails to adopt msm in two respects it requires producers to implement fewer bmps than the district handbook requires,and it does not mandate cessation of tilling on days as the district does.as a preliminary matter,petitioners district requirements,as epa explained.id.at.the true comparative baseline for msm would take into account the many exceptions and exemptions to the district requirements.see,rule h a exempting all farms outside the basin and all small farms within the basin from the bmps handbook at,detailing various exceptions.yet,even with a more realistic understanding of the substance of the district requirements,two questions remain are the district requirements more stringent than arizona if so,must arizona adopt the district requirements in order to satisfy the msm standard 
epa found that,even without petitioners exaggerations,the district requirements are likely to be more stringent than arizona general permit rule.at.given the exemptions and alternatives available in the district,it is not clear what basis epa had for this assumption.for example,the district handbook exempts entirely harvesting,orchards,vine crops,nurseries,range land,and irrigated pasture.arizona general permit rule does not exempt any agricultural activities.in this regard,arizona rule is stricter than the handbook.nevertheless,we will accept epa assumption that the handbook is likely to be more stringent.
once the district requirements are determined to be more stringent,arizona must adopt those of the district requirements that can feasibly be implemented in arizona,taking into consideration the technological and economic feasibility of various control measures.e.epa concluded that the district requirements were not feasible for arizona and,therefore,that arizona need not adopt the requirements to satisfy msm.as we explain below,this conclusion was not arbitrary or capricious.
epa agreed with the state assessment that the south coast requirements are infeasible for the phoenix area and that the general permit rule represents the most stringent economically and technologically feasible agricultural control program for the area.at.arizona pointed out that agriculture is bound by conditions specific to each locale and that generalizations in this area are not helpful.id.arizona topography,soil conditions,crops,and irrigation methods differ substantially from california.id.for example,the three biggest crops in maricopa county are upland cotton,durum wheat,and alfalfa,with cotton comprising more than the combined acreage of wheat and alfalfa.tsd at.by contrast,no cotton is grown in the south coast air basin.id.at.arizona farmers irrigate by flooding their fields,whereas farmers in the south coast region dry farm,irrigate,or use sprinkler irrigation.at bmp plan at.as arizona found,t he actual amount of irrigation water and frequency of irrigation can effect sic wind erosion estimates and the effectiveness of different control measures under different conditions.at quoting bmp plan at.the application of more than one bmp at a time for a particular category would only provide incremental reductions,sometimes at an uneconomical cost.id.implicitly,the same objection applies to imposing a mandatory rule plus other bmps.the declining trend in the number of farms operating in maricopa county and uncertainty about the continued viability of agriculture in maricopa county added to epa concerns about the economic feasibility of requiring more bmps.id.finally,as in the bacm analysis,epa noted that the process by which arizona developed the general permit rule was a endeavor involving an array of agricultural experts familiar with maricopa county agriculture.id.epa concluded that the handbook requirements are neither technologically nor economically feasible for maricopa county.id.
this conclusion was not arbitrary or capricious.as noted above,e specifically limits msm to measures that can feasibly be implemented in the area,and specifically allows the administrator to consider the technological and economic feasibility of proposed measures.here,epa did precisely that,and its conclusion was reasonable.
regarding cessation of tilling during conditions,arizona explained,and epa agreed,that wind conditions in arizona are quite different from those in the coachella valley which is subject to rule,the district most stringent rule.at.arizona studies determined that it was not the active tilling of a field that primarily contributed windblown dust,but instead it was dust from an already tilled field.id.a rule would not address the source of fugitive dust unless it forbade tilling altogether.the studies showed that the coachella valley experiences winds of greater duration and speed than arizona.the coachella valley reports high winds over mph on days per year.id.by contrast,arizona estimated that in maricopa county had only days of winds over mph.id.arizona further found that only percent of the tilling takes place during the area high wind season march through september,and only percent of the days during that time experience high winds over mph.id.arizona concluded that any benefits from a rule would be minimal and such a rule would be no more effective than other bmps.tsd at.m ore reductions will be achieved by implementing practices which control emissions throughout the year or during critical erosions periods.bmp plan at.according to arizona,epa observed,a rule on high wind days would not be reasonable since it would impact a small number of growers and provide minimal reductions.at.epa concluded that this justification was sufficient because the rule was not necessary for expeditious attainment and arizona had determined that the requirement for one bmp per category is the most effective economically and technologically feasible control measure for agricultural sources in the phoenix area.see also tsd at.in other words,epa declined to require arizona to adopt the coachella valley rule based on attainment and feasibility considerations.as noted above,the act explicitly allows epa to take technological and economic feasibility into account in determining whether a state has satisfied the msm standard,and epa properly did so here.
arizona rejection of carb diesel 
carb diesel as bacm 
petitioners do not challenge the bulk of arizona plan for addressing and emissions.instead,they have confined their challenge to one aspect of arizona plan,its rejection of carb diesel,a reformulated diesel fuel required by the california air resources board since.petitioners offer two points.first,they argue that diesel emissions,considered alone,constitute a significant source of emissions.petitioners contend that epa allowed arizona to reject carb diesel as bacm because epa considered diesel emissions to be a de minimis source.second,petitioners argue that epa has not offered an adequate explanation for rejecting carb diesel as bacm.
epa generally requires state implementation plans to address all significant source categories and permits states to ignore de minimis source categories.see.at epa interprets the clean air act to not require a state to apply bacm to any source or source category that it has demonstrated to be de minimis epa has stated it will not consider a source category or groups of source categories to be de minimis if applying bacm to it or them would make the difference between attainment and nonattainment by december,in areas requesting an extension.id.at.but epa does not require that each significant source be addressed as a separate category.in theory,a state might define its source categories so narrowly that all of its categories would be de minimis.see ober ii,at.conversely,a state might define its source categories so broadly that a single source category might include several significant sources.
in its state implementation plan,arizona identified eight significant source road travel,unpaved road travel,industrial paved road travel,construction site preparation,agricultural tilling,residential wood combustion,and motor vehicle exhaust,and secondary ammonium twelve categories of de minimis sources mag plan,table at.at.although arizona determined that motor vehicle exhaust was a significant source of,it also found that exhaust was a relatively small source of.arizona found,for example,that engine exhaust contributed only percent of total regional emissions in,and vehicle exhaust just percent,compared with moving dust,construction trackout,paved road dust,unpaved road dust,and disturbed vacant land and agricultural dust,which contributed,and percent,respectively.mag plan,figure.epa found that no significant source categories were excluded,and even that arizona may have included more source categories in its significant source list than are strictly needed.at.arizona proposed a series of controls to address each source category.
arizona and motor vehicle exhaust category included vehicles powered by gasoline,diesel,and other sources.epa observed that gasoline and diesel vehicles could be considered distinct categories,and it suggested that the category identified by arizona constitute d at least four if not more distinct categories of emissions gasoline,diesel,gasoline nonroad,and diesel nonroad.tsd at.epa also acknowledged that e ach of these individual categories may or may not be significant itself.id.epa noted,nonetheless,that it would 
treat gasoline and vehicles together here to preserve to the extent practicable the significant source groupings in the mag plan however,we believe they are in fact distinct categories.almost percent of diesel emissions come from diesel trucks while percent of gasoline comes from the family car,that is,light duty cars and trucks there is almost no overlap in the controls for the family car and those for heavy duty diesel trucks,key evidence that they are in fact distinct source categories.
at.in the end,epa chose to analyze arizona and motor vehicle exhaust category as two categories exhaust and exhaust.
with respect to petitioners first diesel emissions are a significant did treat diesel emissions as significant not de minimis for purposes of the bacm analysis.epa analyzed whether arizona plan adequately controlled emissions from two source categories,exhaust and exhaust.each of those categories included diesel engine exhaust.
petitioners would prefer that epa have treated both and diesel emissions as a single source,separate from all other and exhaust.under epa guidelines,arizona had to address all significant source categories,and diesel emissions were included in the emissions category,which arizona properly treated as a significant source category.it might have been possible for arizona to classify diesel emissions as its own source epa suggested would have been it was not arbitrary and capricious for epa to approve arizona listing of the broader categories.that arizona might have done something different does not render its plan violative of the act,nor epa approval arbitrary and capricious.even if arizona had classified diesel emissions alone as a significant source category,the mere classification would not tell us whether arizona had to adopt carb diesel.
what petitioners argument fairly questions is whether arizona has adequately addressed diesel emissions as bacm.arizona evaluated approximately suggested measures for emissions and for emissions,most of which it adopted in whole or in part.tsd,table at,table at.the arizona plan adopted several programs to address and diesel emissions in particular.for example,the state requires certain,vehicles to meet federal emission standards it establishes a voluntary vehicle repair and retrofit program for older diesel vehicles it requires public agencies to install oxidation catalysts on the diesel vehicles in their fleets if the agencies receive a waiver to opt out of alternative fuel requirements it increases the waiver repair amounts for diesel vehicles that fail to meet emission standards it requires diesel vehicles to take an annual snap acceleration test and authorizes random roadside emission tests for diesel vehicles it limits sulfur content of diesel oil to ppm and it adopts emission standards for certain diesel engines.id.thus,arizona has addressed diesel emissions with numerous measures for reducing them.
despite the
