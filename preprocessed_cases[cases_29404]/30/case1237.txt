background 
the parties have submitted briefs delineating in detail the facts and arguments supporting their positions on the grasslands ecosystem involved in their litigation,including the perceived environmental consequences of fluid mineral leases on the public lands at issue.nevertheless,following briefing and oral argument on appeal,we have determined only the following undisputed facts are relevant to the disposition of this appeal on the issue of mootness.
on november,the blm issued a notice of competitive lease sale lease sale covering multiple federal oil and gas leases for a primary term of ten years,including the two leases at issue in this and referenced as lease and lease.together,leases and encompass acres of federal public lands in the part of the nutt grasslands located in luna county,new mexico.the nutt grasslands are managed by the blm through the mimbres resource management plan,which covers approximately three million surface acres of public land and million subsurface acres in the mimbres resource area.the mimbres resource management plan is based on an environmental impact statement eis prepared by the blm in october.in november,prior to issuance of its lease sale notice,the blm prepared a documentation of plan conformance and nepa adequacy dna in order to determine whether nepa required a supplemental eis based on any changed circumstances or new information.the dna concluded the lease sale was in conformance with the mimbres resource management plan and that the mimbres eis satisfied the blm nepa duties.
on january,appellant new mexico wilderness alliance filed an administrative protest against the proposed lease sale,principally on grounds the blm had violated nepa by failing to conduct the appropriate nepa analysis or otherwise consider a multiple use concept as part of the hard look it was required to take of the agency action.as a result,it contended,the lease sale posed negative environmental implications to the nutt grasslands,including its wilderness values,and,in support,submitted documentation concerning the wilderness values of the nutt grasslands wilderness complex and the robledo de las uvas wilderness complex.it further requested the affected lease parcels be withdrawn from the proposed lease sale on january,the blm sold the leases at issue in this appeal to imperial oil properties imperial of wichita,kansas,but did not formally issue the leases at that time.in a letter dated february,the blm notified appellant new mexico wilderness alliance of receipt of its protest and stated its intent to suspend lease issuance until resolution of the protest.
thereafter,on april,the blm rejected appellant new mexico wilderness alliance protest on grounds the eis prepared for the mimbres resource management plan satisfied its nepa requirements,but that it would continue to withhold the protested parcels from lease issuance until an evaluation of the new mexico wilderness alliance wilderness proposals had been completed for those proposed wilderness areas in which the protested parcels lie,doc.at.on april,new mexico wilderness alliance provided the blm with additional documentation for the nutt grasslands.
on july,the blm notified new mexico wilderness alliance of its completed review of its proposal on the robledo de las uvas wilderness complex and the blm conclusion the proposal did not provide any significant new information regarding the wilderness characteristics of the area protested on july,the blm formally issued the contested leases to imperial.
thereafter,on october,appellants filed their complaint,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,commencing the instant litigation.in count of the complaint they alleged the blm violated nepa by proceeding with the lease sale without completing an environmental assessment ea or eis.in the remaining three counts,they alleged the blm failed to assess the direct,indirect,and cumulative environmental consequences of the lease sale count the blm failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives for oil and gas leasing and development in the nutt grasslands in conjunction with the lease sale count and appellees failed to involve the public in the lease sale count,all of which they claim was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,and not in accordance with the law or procedures required by law.as a remedy,they requested declaratory and injunctive relief predicated on the lease sale,and asked the district court to void and enjoin the lease sale and the leases issued in conjunction with it.
over the course of the resulting litigation,a number of parcels for lease were either never acquired or terminated for of rent,resulting in the parties stipulating that only four parcels of land were at issue at the time the district court issued its decision.on june,following the filing of multiple pleadings by the parties and oral argument,the district court issued a decision on the merits,holding in favor of the blm and the other appellees and denying appellants request for declaratory and injunctive relief.chihuahuan grasslands alliance norton,d on appeal,appellants acknowledge that only lease and lease are now in contention.they frame the issues presented on appeal as follows 
whether blm sale and issuance of federal mineral leases violated nepa where 
the leases surrendered surface use rights 
blm did not prepare a nepa analysis addressing site specific environmental concerns or reasonably foreseeable impacts 
blm instead relied upon a programmatic nepa analysis prepared for a resource management plan 
blm did not consider alternatives,in particular a no leasing alternative 
blm conceded the need for nepa analysis but asserts that such analysis can be prepared at the drilling stage and 
blm rejected appellants information and proposal concerning the wilderness values of the lands in contention by looking at the wrong information and the wrong proposal.
apt.br.at italics added.in response,appellees set forth their arguments in support of the district court decision and in opposition to appellants appeal.
ii.motion to dismiss 
appellees have now filed a motion to dismiss the appeal as moot because the leases in dispute,lease and lease,have been terminated for nonpayment.in support,appellees submit the declaration of lourdes blm land law examiner and member of the lease adjudication team in new mexico according to ortiz declaration,on september,minerals management service mms electronically sent her office a spreadsheet as notification of the federal oil and gas leases it believed were terminated due to or for other reasons,which included leases and,referred to as nmnm and nmnm.the spreadsheet showed these leases,which were issued in july,were deemed terminated on august,for nonpayment,which ortiz explains relates back to the anniversary of the date of the lease.ortiz represents her office sent certified letters to the lessee,imperial,on november,notifying it rent was due and giving it sixty days from receipt of the letters,as required by statute and regulation,to petition for reinstatement of the leases.she also represents the united states postal service returned the certified letters,and her office,as standard practice,then resent the letters to the lessee via regular mail on january,giving the lessee sixty days from receipt of those letters before finalizing termination of the leases.she states that on march,after receiving no response to either the november,certified letters or january,regular mail letters,her office closed the two lease cases at issue based on termination of the instant leases,appellees argue no case or controversy or meaningful remedy now exists and this appeal should be dismissed as moot because appellants underlying claims and appeal are premised on the lease sale and the blm failure to comply with nepa in conjunction with the contested lease sale,under which no leases now exist.
in response,appellants contend their claims are not moot.despite the fact the blm terminated these last two leases,they suggest a controversy still exists because nothing has mooted their claims the blm failed to comply with nepa and consider their wilderness values information and the blm has not terminated or withdrawn a the november dna concerning the proposed lease sale b its wilderness evaluation contained in its april,letter in response to their protest or c its decision rejecting their wilderness proposal contained in its july,letter.they now suggest these are the final agency actions they contested,rather than the proposed lease sale and subsequent leases issued,and claim these final agency actions solidify and finalize the blm efforts to comply with nepa and should be declared unlawful and set aside.
in arguing against mootness,they contend nothing establishes the blm nepa violations will not recur,so that the blm should be enjoined from relying on these flawed final agency actions or the same flawed process in the future should it leases for oil and gas development in the same area.in essence,they are invoking an exception to mootness when a case is capable of repetition,yet evading review.appellants also suggest appellees voluntary cessation of a challenged action will not moot this case unless it is absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior can not reasonably be expected to recur and claim the blm has failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that lease sales will not continue.thus,they appear to be invoking another exception to mootness based on voluntary cessation of illegal conduct to avoid review.alternatively,in the event their appeal is deemed moot,they request vacatur of the district court june,decision to prevent preclusion from any underlying nepa and flpma claims.
in response,appellees argue the dna and the blm review and rejection of appellants wilderness information was done in the context of the lease sale and issuance of the leases,which appellants challenged in the district court.because the blm has terminated the last two leases,appellees contend nothing is left of the lease sale so that a remand to comply with nepa would be a futile exercise.should the blm rely on the dna or its evaluation and rejection of appellants wilderness information in the context of any future final agency action,appellees suggest that final agency action may be the subject of a lawsuit alleging the agency failed to comply with nepa.finally,appellees do not object to appellants alternative request for this court to vacate the district court decision.
iii.discussion 
article iii limits a federal court jurisdiction to cases and controversies.see const.art iii,cl.mootness is a threshold issue because the existence of a live case or controversy is a constitutional prerequisite to federal court jurisdiction.see disability law ctr.millcreek health,cir quotation marks and citations omitted.as a result,f ederal courts may adjudicate only actual controversies.id.relying on lewis,at.because a federal court has no power to give opinions upon moot questions or declare principles of law which can not affect the matter in issue in the case before it,a controversy must exist during all stages of appellate review.lane,at quotation marks and citation omitted.

one exception to a claim of mootness is a defendant voluntary cessation of an alleged illegal practice which the defendant is free to resume at any time.see riley ins,cir.this exception is based on the principle that a party should not be able to evade judicial review,or to defeat a judgment,by temporarily altering questionable behavior.see city news novelty,city of waukesha,d.in other words,this exception exists to counteract the possibility of a defendant ceasing illegal action long enough to render a lawsuit moot and then resuming the illegal conduct.another exception to the mootness doctrine exists when cases are capable of repetition,yet evading review.see disability law,at quoting murphy hunt,d.this exception is only to be used in exceptional situations,white colorado,cir,and arises when the duration of the challenged action is too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subjected to the same action again.disability law,at quoting united states seminole nation of,cir.
in applying these principles to this appeal,it is clear appellants framed the issues in their complaint and appeal briefs squarely on the lease sale and leases issued in conjunction with it.for example,in the complaint,they alleged the blm violated nepa by proceeding with the lease sale without completing an ea or eis,failed to assess the environmental consequences of the lease sale,failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives in proposing the lease sale,and failed,along with the other appellees,to involve the public in the lease sale.under these circumstances,it is not difficult to determine their claims rest directly with the lease sale and its issued leases.
correspondingly,in their appeal,appellants prefaced all of the issues presented on whether
