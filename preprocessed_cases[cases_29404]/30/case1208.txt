this would have remained a profoundly insignificant case to all except its immediate parties had it not been so tried as to raise questions both fundamental and in federal criminal law morissette united states.and we might add,no one may be required at peril of life,liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes.all are entitled to be informed as to what the state commands or forbids.lanzatta new jersey.
this case requires us to consider the scope of the migratory bird treaty act mbta or act.the act declares it a misdemeanor to pursue,hunt,take,capture,or kill birds protected by several international treaties.the mbta also specifies a maximum penalty of and six months in prison for a misdemeanor violation,but does not require any particular mental state or mens rea to violate the statute.see a.the question this case presents is whether the mbta constitutionally can make it a crime to violate its provisions absent knowledge or the intent to do so.
appellants are two kansas oil drilling operators who were charged with violating the act after dead migratory birds were discovered lodged in a piece of their oil drilling equipment called a.after a trial before a magistrate judge,both apollo energies and dale walker doing business as red cedar oil were convicted of taking or possessing migratory birds,each misdemeanor violations.apollo was fined for one violation,and walker was fined for each of his two violations.the federal district court affirmed the convictions,concluding that violations of of the mbta are strict liability offenses,which do not require that defendants knowingly or intentionally violate the law.
on appeal,apollo and walker renew their challenges to the mbta,claiming it is not a strict liability crime to take or possess a protected bird,or,if it is a strict liability crime,the act is unconstitutional as applied to their conduct.we conclude the district court correctly held that violations of the mbta are strict liability crimes.but we hold that a strict liability interpretation of the mbta for the conduct charged here satisfies due process only if defendants proximately caused the harm to protected birds.after carefully examining the trial record,we agree apollo proximately caused the taking of protected birds,but with respect to one of his two convictions,walker did not.due process requires criminal defendants have adequate notice that their conduct is a violation of the act.
consequently,exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court decision.
background 
apollo and walker own many,a device commonly used in oil drilling operations.are cylindrical equipment up to feet high and more than three feet wide that separate oil from water when the mixture is pumped from the ground.the at issue in this case have vertical exhaust pipes that are approximately nine inches in diameter,and walker included movable louvers that can be opened to access heating equipment at the base.birds can crawl into the exhaust pipes or through the louvers to form nests.once inside the,escape can be difficult for some birds.
acting on an anonymous tip,an agent with the fish and wildlife service fish and wildlife,or service inspected more than a dozen of apollo in december.he found bird remains in about half of the he inspected.in february,fish and wildlife officers expanded their investigation in the region southeast kansas,finding more than dead birds in,of which were identified as protected species under the mbta 
as a result of the investigation,fish and wildlife embarked on a public education campaign to alert oil producers to the problem.the service sent letters to of the oil companies involved in the february inspections,including apollo.the record does not disclose,however,that walker company,red cedar,received the notice.fish and wildlife also created a poster describing the problem,which it distributed to oil equipment supply companies.service representatives made presentations to the kansas independent oil and gas association and at a kansas corporation commission oil and gas meeting.finally,a kansas television station and the associated press news service each ran a story about threat to protected birds.fish and wildlife chose not to recommend prosecution for mbta violations related to through the end of,while the education campaign was ongoing 
in april,after fish and wildlife grace period ended,agents searched belonging to apollo and walker.the search of apollo yielded the carcass of a northern flicker,an species.agents found four protected birds in walker,as well.when confronted with the dead birds,walker is reported to have said that not good.a year later,in april,the service again conducted a search of walker.although walker had placed metal caps on the exhaust birds previously had been fish and wildlife agent retrieved a protected bird that he found lodged in a louvers.
apollo was convicted of one violation of the mbta based on the april bird death.walker also was convicted of two violations based on the april and april deaths.
ii.discussion 
appellants make one statutory and several due process arguments.their statutory argument is that the mbta does not create a strict liability crime to take or possess migratory birds,and,under that statutory construction,they lacked the necessary imputed mental state to commit an mbta violation.our precedent forecloses appellants statutory construction,and consequently we are obliged to address appellants broader arguments about the mbta constitutionality.
as to their constitutional due process claims,appellants argue the mbta is unconstitutionally vague because it provides inadequate notice of what conduct is criminal,due process requires that they caused an mbta violation to be guilty of a crime,and the district court erred in applying the law to the facts in this case.

statutory construction the mbta creates a strict liability crime 
appellants first contend is not a strict liability offense,but contains a scienter requirement.
section makes it a crime to take protected birds 
i t shall be unlawful at any time,by any means or in any manner,to take or attempt to take any migratory bird,any part,nest,or egg of any such bird,or any product,whether or not manufactured,which consists,or is composed in whole or part,of any such bird or any part,nest,or egg thereof,included in the terms of various treaties between the united states and great britain,mexico,japan,and the.emphasis added.
regulations implementing the statute explain that the term take means to pursue,hunt,shoot,wound,kill,trap,capture,or collect.under a,any person,association,partnership,or corporation is guilty of a misdemeanor if they violate any provisions of the act.the statute does not supply a mens rea requirement.
appellants contention is foreclosed by our holding in united states corrow,cir,which squarely addressed mens rea requirement.in corrow,we considered and resolved the mens rea requirement of a,and concluded that misdemeanor violations under are strict liability crimes.id.at.in that case,the defendant was charged with illegal possession of protected golden eagle and owl feathers.we upheld the conviction,finding it persuasive that a plain reading of text it shall be unlawful to possess protected not require any particular state of mind or scienter.id.we relied on the fact that l ike other regulatory acts where the penalties are small and there is no grave harm to an offender reputation,the supreme court has long recognized a different standard applies to those federal criminal statutes that are essentially regulatory.id.citing united states engler,cir relying on morissette united states.simply stated,then,it is not necessary to prove that a defendant violated the migratory bird treaty act with specific intent or guilty knowledge.id.at quoting united states manning,cir emphasis added.
our holding in corrow fell in line with those of other circuits at the time of that case.at least seven other circuits either had held that mbta misdemeanors are strict liability crimes or noted the mbta lack of mens rea in passing.see,united states pitrone,cir united states hogan,cir united states boynton,cir united states engler,cir united states catlett,cir per curiam united states fmc,cir rogers united states,cir.see also united states morgan,cir citing corrow and holding misdemeanor mbta violations are strict liability crimes.but see newton county wildlife ass n,cir strict liability may be appropriate when dealing with hunters and poachers.but it would stretch this statute far beyond the bounds of reason to construe it as an absolute criminal prohibition on conduct,such as timber harvesting,that indirectly results in the death of migratory birds.mahler forest,questioning the mbta application to bird deaths caused indirectly by logging.
despite this applicable precedent,appellants challenge the extension of corrow to the conduct alleged here.they reason our holding in corrow was limited to the mbta violations at issue and selling protected bird feathers.for support,they point to fish and wildlife regulations that define possession as detention and control,and to take as to capture,or collect.they say the linguistic differences imply an active state of mind to violate the act,and the conduct here was merely failed to the.
we see no express or implied limitation to our holding in corrow.in fact,that decision broadly held misdemeanor violations under are strict liability crimes.corrow,at emphasis added.nothing in the structure or logic of the opinion lends itself to carving out an exception for different types of conduct,and therefore a scienter requirement for the takings here.nor is there any reason to find that capturing or collecting birds implies a higher mens rea than detaining or controlling them.see also webster third new international dictionary defining collect as to regain control of similar to the regulations definition of possession.in short,the conduct alleged here has the same mental state requirement as the sale and possession of protected birds we considered in corrow.
appellants also point to supreme court case law on the books at the time we decided corrow as fatally undermining its holding.they contend three years before corrow,the supreme court in staples united states,cast doubt on the presumption of strict liability when a statute omits a mens rea requirement.id.at.the court in staples held that strict liability crimes generally are disfavored,and suggested some indicia of congressional intent,express or implied,is necessary before courts can dispense with the traditional mens rea requirement.id.at.
while we did not cite to staples in corrow,our reasoning was that although the mbta was silent as to mens rea,its plain language an indicia of legislative a strict liability interpretation.congress,moreover,in added the word knowingly to create the felony offense of selling migratory birds,while leaving intact the language of the misdemeanor provision without an explicit mens rea requirement.this is further evidence the legislative scheme invokes a lesser mental state for misdemeanor violations.see,at,reprinted in,nothing in this amendment to create the mbta felony offense is intended to alter the strict liability standard for misdemeanor prosecutions under a,a standard which has been upheld in many federal court decisions.finally,the court in staples took pains to reaffirm the basic proposition that public welfare or regulatory offenses can impose a form of strict criminal liability.staples,at.
appellants also point to cases outside our circuit to argue that corrow logic does not apply to the facts here.in particular,they cite newton county wildlife ass forest service,cir,to suggest does not apply to activities beyond purposeful hunting or possession of migratory birds.see also citizens interested in bull run,edrington.united states rollins.but all of those cases involved logging or pesticide application that modified bird habitat in some way.while the mbta scope,like any statute,can test the far reaches in application,we do not have that case before us.the question here is whether unprotected oil field equipment can take or kill migratory birds.it is obvious the oil equipment can.simply put,the take and kill provisions of the act are not outside the holding of corrow.
in sum,corrow squarely addressed the mens rea requirement for an mbta violation,and we are bound by its holding.see in re smith,cir per curiam we are bound by the precedent of prior panels absent en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary decision by the supreme court.as a matter of statutory construction,the take provision of the act does not contain a scienter requirement.
due process notice and causation 
having concluded the mbta applies a strict liability standard to the taking or killing of migratory birds,we must address appellants additional arguments that the act is unconstitutional facially and as applied to the conduct in this case.appellants broader argument is that the mbta violates their due process rights because of its scope and application to their conduct.
by way of background,although is a strict liability crime,a few historical elements are worth remembering.at common law,crime was a compound concept consisting of both an mind and an evildoing hand.morissette united states.a traditional element of criminal violations thus was that the perpetrator committed the prohibited act with intent or,at minimum,knowledge.see wayne lafave,substantive criminal law ed.for several centuries at least since the different common law crimes have been so defined as to require,for guilt,that the defendant acts or omissions be accompanied by one or more of the various types of fault.the supreme court has characterized the scienter requirement as foundational the contention that an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted by intention is no provincial or transient notion.it is as universal and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal individual to choose between good and evil.morissette,at.
yet by the middle of the twentieth century,the supreme court was confronted with a new category of crimes for which no mens rea was required.in morissette united states,for example,the supreme court gave a stamp of approval to regulatory crimes that lacked or had a minimal mens rea element.see id.at.but the court did not do so in unequivocal terms.the court reasoned that while the strict liability crimes at that time technically did not require mens rea,the accused,if he d id not will the violation,usually wa s in a position to prevent it with no more care than society might reasonably expect and no more exertion than it might reasonably exact from one who assumed his responsibilities.id.at.moreover,the penalties commonly we re relatively small,and did not cause grave damage to an offender reputation.id.the court relied on these principles as recently as its decision in staples united states,considering whether possession of an unregistered firearm required a scienter element which it did.
a line of subsequent cases suggest several important limiting principles to strict liability crimes.two due process limitations are especially relevant here.
first,due process requires citizens be given fair notice of what conduct is criminal.a criminal statute can not be so vague that ordinary people are uncertain of its meaning.see kolender lawson.however,even when a statute is specific about which acts are criminal,our due process analysis is not complete.when,as here,predicate acts which result in criminal violations are commonly and ordinarily not criminal,we must ask the fair notice question once again.in the context of laws criminalizing the possession of dangerous items such as drugs or explosives,the supreme court
