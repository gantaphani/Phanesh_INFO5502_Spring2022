florida owns in trust for the public the land permanently submerged beneath navigable waters and the foreshore.the mean line is the ordinary boundary between private beachfront,or littoral property,and land.littoral owners have,inter alia,rights to have access to the water,to use the water for certain purposes,to have an unobstructed view of the water,and to receive accretions and relictions collectively,accretions to the littoral property.an accretion occurs gradually and imperceptibly,while a sudden change is an avulsion.the littoral owner automatically takes title to dry land added to his property by accretion.with avulsion,however,the seaward boundary of littoral property remains what it was the mean line before the event.thus,when an avulsion has added new land,the littoral owner has no right to subsequent accretions,because the property abutting the water belongs to the owner of the seabed ordinarily the state.
florida beach and shore preservation act establishes procedures for depositing sand on eroded beaches restoration and maintaining the deposited sand nourishment.when such a project is undertaken,the state entity that holds title to the seabed sets a fixed erosion control line to replace the fluctuating mean line as the boundary between littoral and state property.once the new line is recorded,the common law ceases to apply.thereafter,when accretion moves the mean line seaward,the littoral property remains bounded by the permanent line.
respondents the city of destin and walton county sought permits to restore miles of beach eroded by several hurricanes,adding about feet of dry sand seaward of the mean line to be denominated the line.petitioner,a nonprofit corporation formed by owners of beachfront property bordering the project hereinafter members brought an unsuccessful administrative challenge.respondent the florida department of environmental protection approved the permits,and this suit followed.the state court of appeal concluded that the department order had eliminated the members littoral rights to receive accretions to their property and to have their property contact with the water remain intact.concluding that this would be an unconstitutional taking and would require an additional administrative requirement to be met,it set aside the order,remanded the proceeding,and certified to the florida supreme court the question whether the act unconstitutionally deprived the members of littoral rights without just compensation.the state supreme court answered no and quashed the remand,concluding that the members did not own the property supposedly taken.petitioner sought rehearing on the ground that the florida supreme court decision effected a taking of the members littoral rights contrary to the fifth and fourteenth amendments rehearing was denied.
held the judgment is affirmed.
so,affirmed.
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court with respect to parts i,iv,and v,concluding that the florida supreme court did not take property without just compensation in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.
a respondents arguments that petitioner does not own the property and that the case is not ripe were not raised in the briefs in opposition and thus are deemed waived.
b there can be no taking unless petitioner can show that,before the florida supreme court decision,littoral property owners had rights to future accretions and to contact with the water superior to the state right to fill in its submerged land.that showing can not be made.two core florida principles intersect here.first,the state as owner of the submerged land adjacent to littoral property has the right to fill that land,so long as it does not interfere with the rights of the public and of littoral landowners.second,if an avulsion exposes land seaward of littoral property that had previously been submerged,that land belongs to the state even if it interrupts the littoral owner contact with the water.prior florida law suggests that there is no exception to this rule when the state causes the avulsion.thus,florida law as it stood before the decision below allowed the state to fill in its own seabed,and the resulting sudden exposure of previously submerged land was treated like an avulsion for ownership purposes.the right to accretions was therefore subordinate to the state right to fill.
c the decision below is consistent with these principles.lucas south carolina coastal council.it did not abolish the members right to future accretions,but merely held that the right was not implicated by the project because of the doctrine of avulsion.relying on dicta in the florida supreme court sand key decision,petitioner contends that the state took the members littoral right to have the boundary always be the mean line.but petitioner interpretation of that dictum contradicts the clear law governing avulsion.one can not say the florida supreme court contravened established property law by rejecting it.
justice scalia,joined by the chief justice,justice thomas,and justice alito,concluded in parts ii and iii that if a court declares that what was once an established right of private property no longer exists,it has taken that property in violation of the takings clause.
a though the classic taking is a transfer of property by eminent domain,the clause applies to other state actions that achieve the same thing,including those that recharacterize as public property what was previously private property,see webb fabulous pharmacies,beckwith.the clause is not addressed to the action of a specific branch or branches.it is concerned simply with the act,not with the governmental actor.this court precedents provide no support for the proposition that takings effected by the judicial branch are entitled to special treatment,and in fact suggest the contrary.see pruneyard shopping center robins,webb fabulous pharmacies,supra.
b for a judicial taking,respondents would add to the normal takings inquiry the requirement that the court decision have no fair and substantial basis.this test is not obviously appropriate,but it is no different in this context from the requirement that the property owner prove an established property right.respondents additional arguments that federal courts lack the knowledge of state law required to decide whether a state judicial decision purporting to clarify property rights has instead taken them that judging should not be deprived of needed flexibility and that applying the takings clause to judicial decisions would force lower federal courts to review final judgments,in violation of the doctrine,see rooker fidelity trust,district of columbia court of appeals feldman,are unpersuasive.and petitioner proposed unpredictability test that a judicial taking consists of a decision that constitutes a sudden change in state law,unpredictable in terms of relevant precedents,hughes washington,stewart,concurring is misdirected.what counts is not whether there is precedent for the allegedly confiscatory decision,but whether the property right allegedly taken was well established.
justice kennedy,joined by justice sotomayor,agreed that the florida supreme court did not take property without just compensation,but concluded that this case does not require the court to determine whether,or when,a judicial decision determining property owners rights can violate the takings clause.if and when future cases show that the usual principles,including constitutional ones that constrain the judiciary like due process,are inadequate to protect property owners,then the question whether a judicial decision can effect a taking would be properly presented.
justice breyer,joined by justice ginsburg,agreed that no unconstitutional taking occurred here,but concluded that it is unnecessary to decide more than that to resolve this case.difficult questions of constitutional law,whether federal courts may review a state court decision to determine if it unconstitutionally takes private property without compensation,and what the proper test is for evaluating whether a property decision enacts an unconstitutional taking need not be addressed in order to dispose of the immediate case.whitehouse illinois central.such questions are better left for another day.

justice scalia announced the judgment of the court and delivered the opinion of the court with respect to parts i,iv,and v,and an opinion with respect to parts ii and iii,in which the chief justice,justice thomas,and justice alito join.
we consider a claim that the decision of a state court of last resort took property without just compensation in violation of the takings clause of the fifth amendment,as applied against the states through the fourteenth,see dolan city of tigard.
generally speaking,state law defines property interests,phillips washington legal foundation,including property rights in navigable waters and the lands underneath them,see united states cress,anthony falls water power paul water comm rs.in florida,the state owns in trust for the public the land permanently submerged beneath navigable waters and the foreshore the land between the line and the mean line,art.x,broward mabry,so.thus,the mean line the average reach of high tide over the preceding years is the ordinary boundary between private beachfront,or property,and land.see miller,so,per curiam.stat.
littoral owners have,in addition to the rights of the public,certain special rights with regard to the water and the foreshore,broward,at,at,rights which florida considers to be property,generally akin to easements,see thiesen gulf,florida alabama,so,on rehearing.these include the right of access to the water,the right to use the water for certain purposes,the right to an unobstructed view of the water,and the right to receive accretions and relictions to the littoral property,at,at board of trustees of internal improvement trust fund sand key,so.this is generally in accord with common law,although the precise property rights vary among jurisdictions.compare broward,supra,at,at,with lewis,law of eminent domain ed.farnham,law of waters and water rights,hereinafter farnham.
at the center of this case is the right to accretions and relictions.accretions are additions of alluvion sand,sediment,or other deposits to waterfront land relictions are lands once covered by water that become dry when the water recedes.maloney,plager,baldwin,water law and administration the florida experience,hereinafter maloney farnham,at.for simplicity sake,we shall refer to accretions and relictions collectively as accretions,and the process whereby they occur as accretion.in order for an addition to dry land to qualify as an accretion,it must have occurred gradually and imperceptibly that is,so slowly that one could not see the change occurring,though over time the difference became apparent.sand key,supra,at county of clair lovingston,wall.when,on the other hand,there is a sudden or perceptible loss of or addition to land by the action of the water or a sudden change in the bed of a lake or the course of a stream,the change is called an avulsion.sand key,supra,at see also farnham,at.
in florida,as at common law,the littoral owner automatically takes title to dry land added to his property by accretion but formerly submerged land that has become dry land by avulsion continues to belong to the owner of the seabed usually the state.see,sand key,supra,at maloney,at blackstone,commentaries on the laws of england hereinafter blackstone.thus,regardless of whether an avulsive event exposes land previously submerged or submerges land previously exposed,the boundary between littoral property and sovereign land does not change it remains ordinarily what was the mean line before the event.see bryant peppe,so,gould,law of waters.it follows from this that,when a new strip of land has been added to the shore by avulsion,the littoral owner has no right to subsequent accretions.those accretions no longer add to his property,since the property abutting the water belongs not to him but to the state.see maloney,at farnham,at.
in,florida legislature passed the beach and shore preservation act.laws ch,as amended.stat.the act establishes procedures for beach restoration and nourishment projects,designed to deposit sand on eroded beaches restoration and to maintain the deposited sand nourishment.a local government may apply to the department of environmental protection for the funds and the necessary permits to restore a beach,see.when the project involves placing fill on the state submerged lands,authorization is required from the board of trustees of the internal improvement trust fund,see,which holds title to those lands.
once a beach restoration is determined to be undertaken,the board sets what is called an erosion control line.it must be set by reference to the existing mean line,though in theory it can be located seaward or landward of that see.much of the project work occurs seaward of the line,as sand is dumped on what was once submerged land.see app.the fixed line replaces the fluctuating mean line as the boundary between privately owned littoral property and state property.once the line is recorded,the common law ceases to increase upland property by accretion or decrease it by erosion.thus,when accretion to the shore moves the mean line seaward,the property of beachfront landowners is not extended to that line as the prior law provided,but remains bounded by the permanent line.those landowners continue to be entitled,however,to all riparian rights other than the right to accretions.if the beach erodes back landward of the line over a substantial portion of the shoreline covered by the project,the board may,on its own initiative,or must,if asked by the owners or lessees of a majority of the property affected,direct the agency responsible for maintaining the beach to return the beach to the condition contemplated by the project.if that is not done within a year,the project is canceled and the line is null and void.finally,by regulation,if the use of submerged land would unreasonably infringe on riparian rights,the project can not proceed unless the local governments show that they own or have a property interest in the upland property adjacent to the project site.admin.code rule b.
in,the city of destin and walton county applied for the necessary permits to restore miles of beach within their jurisdictions that had been eroded by several hurricanes.the project envisioned depositing along that shore sand dredged from further out.see walton cty.stop the beach renourishment,so.it would add about feet of dry sand seaward of the mean line to be denominated the line.the department issued a notice of intent to award the permits,app,and the board approved the line,at.
the petitioner here,stop the beach renourishment,is a nonprofit corporation formed by people who own beachfront property bordering the project area we shall refer to them as the members.it brought an administrative challenge to the proposed project,see,at,which was unsuccessful the department approved the permits.petitioner then challenged that action in state court under the florida administrative procedure act.stat.the district court of appeal for the first district concluded that,contrary to the act preservation of all riparian rights,the order had eliminated two of the members littoral rights the right to receive accretions to their property and the right to have the contact of their property with the water remain intact.save our beaches,florida of environmental protection,so.this,it believed,would be an unconstitutional taking,which would unreasonably infringe on riparian rights,and therefore require the showing under.admin.code rule b that the local governments owned or had a property interest in the upland property.it set aside the department final order approving the permits and remanded for that showing to be made.so,at.it also certified to the florida supreme court the following question as rephrased by the latter court 
on its face,does the beach and shore preservation act unconstitutionally deprive upland owners of littoral rights without just compensation so,at footnotes omitted.
the florida supreme court answered the certified question in the negative,and quashed the first district remand,at.it faulted the court of appeal for not considering the doctrine of avulsion,which it concluded permitted the state to reclaim the restored beach on behalf of the public,at.it described the right to accretions as a future contingent interest,not a vested property right,and held that there is no littoral right to contact with the water independent of the littoral right of access,which the act does not infringe,at.petitioner sought rehearing on the ground that the florida supreme court decision itself effected a taking of the members littoral rights contrary to the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution the request for rehearing was denied.we granted certiorari.
before coming to the parties arguments in the present case,we discuss some general principles of our takings jurisprudence.the takings clause nor shall private property be taken for public use,without just compensation,amdt.applies as fully to the taking of a landowner riparian rights as it does to the taking of an estate in land see yates milwaukee,wall.moreover,though the classic taking is a transfer of property to the state or to another private party by eminent domain,the takings clause applies to other state actions that achieve the same thing.thus,when the government uses its own property in such a way that it destroys private property,it has taken that property.see united states causby,pumpelly green bay,wall.similarly,our doctrine of regulatory takings aims to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the classic taking.lingle chevron.thus,it is a taking when a state regulation forces a property owner to submit to a permanent physical occupation,loretto teleprompter manhattan catv,or deprives him of all economically beneficial use of his property,lucas south carolina coastal council.finally and here we approach the situation before us,states effect a taking if they recharacterize as public property what was previously private property.see webb fabulous pharmacies,beckwith.
the takings clause unlike,for instance,the ex post facto clauses,see art.i,cl,cl.is not addressed to the action of a specific branch or branches.it is concerned simply with the act,and not with the governmental actor nor shall private property be taken emphasis added.there is no textual justification for saying that the existence or the scope of a state power to expropriate private property without just compensation varies according to the branch of government effecting the expropriation.nor does common sense recommend such a principle.it would be absurd to allow a state to do by judicial decree what the takings clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat.see stevens cannon beach,scalia,dissenting from denial of certiorari.
our precedents provide no support for the proposition that takings effected by the judicial branch are entitled to special treatment,and in fact suggest the contrary.pruneyard shopping center robins,involved a decision of the california supreme court overruling one of its prior decisions which had held that the california constitution guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press,and of the right to petition the government,did not require the owner of private property to accord those rights on his premises.the appellants,owners of a shopping center,contended that their private property rights could not be denied by invocation of a state constitutional provision or by judicial reconstruction of a state laws of private property,at emphasis added.we held that there had been no taking,citing cases involving legislative and executive takings,and applying standard takings clause analysis.see,at.we treated the california supreme court application of the constitutional provisions as a regulation of the use of private property,and evaluated whether that regulation violated the property owners right to exclude others,at internal quotation marks omitted.our opinion addressed only the claimed taking by the constitutional provision.its failure to speak separately to the claimed taking by judicial reconstruction of a state laws of private property certainly does not suggest that a taking by judicial action can not occur,and arguably suggests that the same analysis applicable to taking by constitutional provision would apply.
webb fabulous pharmacies,supra,is even closer in point.there the purchaser of an insolvent corporation had interpleaded the corporation creditors,placing the purchase price in an account in the registry of the circuit court of seminole county,to be distributed in satisfaction of claims approved by a receiver.the florida supreme court construed an applicable statute to mean that the interest on the account belonged to the county,because the account was considered public money,beckwith webb fabulous pharmacies,so,per curiam.we held this to be a taking.we noted that t he usual and general rule is that any interest on an interpleaded and deposited fund follows the principal and is to be allocated to those who are ultimately to be the owners of that principal,at.neither the florida legislature by statute,nor the florida courts by judicial decree,we said,may accomplish the result the county seeks simply by recharacterizing the principal as public money.at.
in sum,the takings clause bars the state from taking private property without paying for it,no matter which branch is the instrument of the taking.to be sure,the manner of state action may matter condemnation by eminent domain,for example,is always a taking,while a legislative,executive,or judicial restriction of property use may or may not be,depending on its nature and extent.but the particular state actor is irrelevant.if a legislature or a court declares that what was once an established right of private property no longer exists,it has taken that property,no less than if the state had physically appropriated it or destroyed its value by regulation.a state,by ipse dixit,may not transform private property into public property without compensation.ibid.
justice breyer concurrence says that we need neither to decide whether the judiciary can ever effect a taking,nor to establish the standard for determining whether it has done so.see post,at opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment.the second part of this is surely incompatible with justice breyer conclusion that the florida supreme court decision in this case did not amount to a judicial taking.post,at.one can not know whether a takings claim is invalid without knowing what standard it has failed to meet which means that justice breyer must either a grapple with the artificial question of what would constitute a judicial taking if there were such a thing as a judicial taking reminiscent of the perplexing question how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood,or b answer in the negative what he considers to be the unnecessary constitutional question whether there is such a thing as a judicial taking.
it is not true that deciding the constitutional question in this case contradicts our settled practice.to the contrary,we have often recognized the existence of a constitutional right,or established the test for violation of such a right or both,and then gone on to find that the claim at issue fails.see,new jersey,holding that the fourth amendment applies to searches and seizures conducted by officials,establishing the standard for finding a violation,but concluding that the claim at issue failed strickland washington,recognizing a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel,establishing the test for its violation,but holding that the claim at issue failed hill lockhart,holding that a strickland claim can be brought to challenge a guilty plea,but rejecting the claim at issue jackson virginia,recognizing a due process claim based on insufficiency of evidence,establishing the governing test,but concluding that the claim at issue failed village of euclid ambler realty,recognizing that block zoning ordinances could constitute a taking,but holding that the challenged ordinance did not do so chicago,chicago,holding that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment prohibits uncompensated takings,but concluding that the court below made no errors of law in assessing just compensation.in suits against public officials,we have found the defendants entitled to immunity only after holding that their action violated the constitution.see,wilson layne.indeed,up until last term,we required federal courts to address the constitutional question before the immunity question.see saucier katz,overruled by pearson callahan,slip,at.
assuming without deciding would be less appropriate here than it was in many of those earlier cases,which established constitutional rights quite separate from any that had previously been acknowledged.compared to strickland proclamation of a right to effective assistance of counsel,for example,proclaiming that a taking can occur through judicial action addresses a point of relative detail.
in sum,justice breyer can not decide that petitioner claim fails without first deciding what a valid claim would consist of.his agreement with part iv of our opinion necessarily implies agreement with the test for a judicial taking elaborated in part which part iv applies whether the state court has declare d that what was once an established right of private property no longer exists,supra,at.justice breyer must either agree with that standard or craft one of his own.and agreeing to or crafting a hypothetical standard for a hypothetical constitutional right is sufficiently unappealing we have eschewed that course many times in the past that justice breyer might as well acknowledge the right as well.or he could avoid the need to agree with or craft a hypothetical standard by denying the right.but embracing a standard while being coy about the right is,well,odd and deciding this case while addressing neither the standard nor the right is quite impossible.
justice breyer responds that he simply advocates resolving this case without establishing the precise standard under which a party wins or loses.post,at emphasis added.but he relies upon no standard at all,precise or imprecise.he simply pronounces that this is not a judicial taking if there is such a thing as a judicial taking.the cases he cites to support this approach provide no precedent.in each of them the existence of the right in question was settled and we faced a choice between competing standards that had been applied by the courts we simply held that the right in question had not been infringed under any of them.there is no established right here,and no competing standards.
like justice breyer concurrence,justice kennedy concludes that the florida supreme court action here does not meet the standard for a judicial taking,while purporting not to determine what is the standard for a judicial taking,or indeed whether such a thing as a judicial taking even exists.that approach is invalid for the reasons we have discussed.
justice kennedy says that we need not take what he considers the bold and risky step of holding that the takings clause applies to judicial action,because the due process clause would likely prevent a state from doing by judicial decree what the takings clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat,post,at opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment internal quotation marks omitted.he invokes the due process clause in both its substantive and procedural aspects,post,at,not specifying which of his arguments relates to which.
the first respect in which justice kennedy thinks the due process clause can do the job seems to sound in procedural due process.because,he says,c ourts,unlike the executive or legislature,are not designed to make policy decisions about expropriation,t he court would be on strong footing in ruling that a judicial decision that eliminates or substantially changes established property rights violates the due process clause.post,at.let us be clear what is being proposed here.this court has held that the principles that the constitution imposes upon the federal government do not apply against the states.see dreyer illinois.but in order to avoid the bold and risky step of saying that the takings clause applies to all government takings,justice kennedy would have us use procedural due process to impose judicially crafted limitations upon the states courts can not be used to perform the governmental function of expropriation.the asserted reasons for the limitation are that the legislative and executive branches are accountable in their political capacity for takings,post,at,and c ourts are not designed to make policy decisions about takings,post,at.these reasons may have a lot to do with sound principles that ought to govern a democratic society,but they have nothing whatever to do with the protection of individual rights that is the object of the due process clause.
of course even taking those reasons at face value,it is strange to proclaim a democracy deficit and lack of special competence for the judicial taking of an individual property right,when this court has had no trouble deciding matters of much greater moment,contrary to congressional desire or the legislated desires of most of the states,with no special competence except the authority we possess to enforce the constitution.in any case,our opinion does not trust judges with the relatively small power justice kennedy now objects to.it is we who propose setting aside judicial decisions that take private property it is he who insists that judges can not be so limited.under his regime,the citizen whose property has been judicially redefined to belong to the state would presumably be given the orwellian explanation the court did not take your property.because it is neither politically accountable nor competent to make such a decision,it can not take property.
justice kennedy injection of principles into the due process clause would also have the ironic effect of preventing the assignment of the expropriation function to the branch of government whose procedures are,by far,the most protective of individual rights.so perhaps even this first respect in which justice kennedy would have the due process clause do the work of the takings clause pertains to substantive,rather than procedural,due process.his other arguments undoubtedly pertain to that,as evidenced by his assertion that i t is natural to read the due process clause as limiting the power of courts to eliminate or change established property rights,post,at,his endorsement of the proposition that the due process clause imposes limits on government ability to diminish property values by regulation,and his contention that the due process clause would likely prevent a state from doing by judicial decree what the takings clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat,post,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the first problem with using substantive due process to do the work of the takings clause is that we have held it can not be done.where a particular amendment provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of government behavior,that amendment,not the more generalized notion of substantive due process,must be the guide for analyzing these claims.albright oliver,plurality opinion quoting graham connor,see also,at kennedy,concurring in judgment i agree with the plurality that an allegation of arrest without probable cause must be analyzed under the fourth amendment without reference to more general considerations of due process the second problem is that we have held for many years logically or not that the liberties protected by substantive due process do not include economic liberties.see,lincoln fed.labor union northwestern iron metal.justice kennedy language if a judicial decision eliminates an established property right,the judgment could be set aside as a deprivation of property without due process of law,post,at propels us back to what is referred to usually deprecatingly as the lochner era.see lochner new york,s.that is a step of much greater novelty,and much more unpredictable effect,than merely applying the takings clause to judicial action.and the third and last problem with using substantive due process is that either it will not do all that the takings clause does,or if it does all that the takings clause does,it will encounter the same supposed difficulties that justice kennedy finds troublesome.
we do not grasp the relevance of justice kennedy speculation,post,at,that the framers did not envision the takings clause would apply to judicial action.they doubtless did not,since the constitution was adopted in an era when courts had no power to change the common law.see blackstone rogers tennessee,scalia,dissenting.where the text they adopted is clear,however nor shall private property be taken for public use what counts is not what they envisioned but what they wrote.of course even after courts,in the century,did assume the power to change the common law,it is not true that the new tradition allows for incremental modifications to property law,post,at,so that owners may reasonably expect or anticipate courts to make certain changes in property law,post,at.in the only sense in which this could be relevant to what we are discussing,that is an astounding statement.we are talking here about judicial elimination of established private property rights.if that is indeed a tradition,justice kennedy ought to be able to provide a more solid example for it than the only one he cites,post,at,a change from noxious to harmful of the test for determining whether a neighbor vegetation is a tortious nuisance.fancher fagella.but perhaps he does not really mean that it is a tradition to eliminate property rights,since he immediately follows his statement that owners may reasonably expect or anticipate courts to make certain changes in property law with the contradictory statement that courts can not abandon settled principles,post,at.if no settled principl e has been abandoned,it is hard to see how property law could have been change d,rather than merely clarified.
justice kennedy has added two additional practical considerations that the court would need to address before recognizing judicial takings,post,at.one of them is simple and simply answered the assertion that it is unclear what remedy a reviewing court could enter after finding a judicial taking,post,at.justice kennedy worries that we may only be able to mandate compensation.that remedy is even rare for a legislative or executive taking,and we see no reason why it would be the exclusive remedy for a judicial taking.if we were to hold that the florida supreme court had effected an uncompensated taking in the present case,we would simply reverse the florida supreme court judgment that the beach and shore preservation act can be applied to the property in question.justice kennedy other point,post,at that we will have to decide when the claim of a judicial taking must be asserted hardly presents an prospect.these,and all the other difficulties,post,at,difficult questions,post,at,and practical considerations post,at,that justice kennedy worries may perhaps stand in the way of recognizing a judicial taking,are either nonexistent or insignificant.
finally,we can not avoid comment upon justice kennedy donning of the mantle of judicial restraint his assertion that it is we,and not he,who would empower the courts and encourage their expropriation of private property.he warns that if judges know that their action is covered by the takings clause,they will issue sweeping new rule s to adjust the rights of property owners,comfortable in the knowledge that their innovations will be preserved upon payment by the state.post,at.that is quite impossible.as we have said,if we were to hold that the florida supreme court had effected an uncompensated taking in this case,we would not validate the taking by ordering florida to pay compensation.we would simply reverse the florida supreme court judgment that the beach and shore preservation act can be applied to the members property.the power to effect a compensated taking would then reside,where it has always resided,not in the florida supreme court but in the florida legislature which could either provide compensation or acquiesce in the invalidity of the offending features of the act.davis michigan of treasury.the only realistic incentive that subjection to the takings clause might provide to any court would be the incentive to get reversed,which in our experience few judges value.
justice kennedy,however,while dismissive of the takings clause,places no other constraints on judicial action.he puts forward some extremely vague applications of substantive due process,and does not even say that they whatever they are will for sure apply.it is thus natural to read the due process clause as limiting the power of courts to eliminate or change established property rights,post,at courts may not have the power to eliminate established property rights by judicial decision,post,at the due process clause would likely prevent a state from doing by judicial decree what the takings clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat,post,at internal quotation marks omitted we must defer applying the takings clause until i f and when future cases show that the usual principles,including constitutional principles that constrain the judiciary like due process,are somehow inadequate to protect property owners,post,at.
moreover,and more importantly,justice kennedy places no constraints whatever upon this court.not only does his concurrence only think about applying substantive due process but because substantive due process is such a wonderfully malleable concept,see,lawrence texas,referring to liberty of the person both in its spatial and in its more transcendent dimensions even a firm commitment to apply it would be a firm commitment to nothing in particular.justice kennedy desire to substitute substantive due process for the takings clause suggests,and the rest of what he writes confirms,that what holds him back from giving the takings clause its natural meaning is not the intrusiveness of applying it to judicial action,but the definiteness of doing so not a concern to preserve the powers of the states political branches,but a concern to preserve this court discretion to say that property may be taken,or may not be taken,as in the court view the circumstances suggest.we must not say that we are bound by the constitution never to sanction judicial elimination of clearly established property rights.where the power of this court is concerned,one must never say never.see,vieth jubelirer,plurality opinion sosa,scalia,concurring in part and concurring in judgment.the great attraction of substantive due process as a substitute for more specific constitutional guarantees is that it never means never because it never means anything precise.
respondents put forward a number of arguments which contradict,to a greater or lesser degree,the principle discussed above,that the existence of a taking does not depend upon the branch of government that effects it.first,in a case claiming a judicial taking they would add to our normal takings inquiry a requirement that the court decision have no fair and substantial basis.this is taken from our jurisprudence dealing with the question whether a decision rests upon adequate and independent state grounds,placing it beyond our jurisdiction to review.see gressman,geller,shapiro,bishop,hartnett,supreme court practice,ch,ed.to assure that there is no evasion of our authority to review federal questions,we insist that the nonfederal ground of decision have fair support.broad river power south carolina ex rel.daniel,see also ward board of comm rs of love.a test designed to determine whether there has been an evasion is not obviously appropriate for determining whether there has been a taking of property.but if it is to be extended there it must mean in the present context that there is a fair and substantial basis for believing that petitioner members did not have a property right to future accretions which the act would take away.this is no different,we think,from our requirement that petitioners members must prove the elimination of an established property right 
next,respondents argue that federal courts lack the knowledge of state law required to decide whether a judicial decision that purports merely to clarify property rights has instead taken them.but federal courts must often decide what state property rights exist in nontakings contexts,see,board of regents of state colleges roth,due process clause.and indeed they must decide it to resolve claims that legislative or executive action has effected a taking.for example,a regulation that deprives a property owner of all economically beneficial use of his property is not a taking if the restriction inhere s in the title itself,in the restrictions that background principles of the state law of property and nuisance already place upon land ownership.lucas,at.a constitutional provision that forbids the uncompensated taking of property is quite simply insusceptible of enforcement by federal courts unless they have the power to decide what property rights exist under state law.
respondents also warn us against depriving judging of needed flexibility.that argument has little appeal when directed against the enforcement of a constitutional guarantee adopted in an era when,as we said supra,at,courts had no power to change the common law.but in any case,courts have no peculiar need of flexibility.it is no more essential that judges be free to overrule prior cases that establish property entitlements than that state legislators be free to revise statutes that confer property entitlements,or regulations that do so.and insofar as courts merely clarify and elaborate property entitlements that were previously unclear,they can not be said to have taken an established property right.
finally,the city and county argue that applying the takings clause to judicial decisions would force lower federal courts to review final judgments,in violation of the doctrine.see rooker fidelity trust,district of columbia court of appeals feldman.that does not necessarily follow.the finality principles that we regularly apply to takings claims,see williamson county regional planning comm hamilton bank of johnson city,would require the claimant to appeal a claimed taking by a lower court to the state supreme court,whence certiorari would come to this court.if certiorari were denied,the claimant would no more be able to launch a federal suit against the taking effected by the state opinion than he would be able to launch such a suit against a legislative or executive taking approved by the state opinion the matter would be res judicata.and where the claimant was not a party to the original suit,he would be able to challenge in federal court the taking effected by the state opinion to the same extent that he would be able to challenge in federal court a legislative or executive taking previously approved by a state opinion.
for its part,petitioner proposes an unpredictability test.quoting justice stewart concurrence in hughes washington,petitioner argues that a judicial taking consists of a decision that constitutes a sudden change in state law,unpredictable in terms of relevant precedents.see brief for petitioner.the focus of petitioner test is misdirected.what counts is not whether there is precedent for the allegedly confiscatory decision,but whether the property right allegedly taken was established.a predictability of change test would cover both too much and too little.too much,because a judicial property decision need not be predictable,so long as it does not declare that what had been private property under established law no longer is.a decision that clarifies property entitlements or the lack thereof that were previously unclear might be difficult to predict,but it does not eliminate established property rights.and the predictability test covers too little,because a judicial elimination of established rights that is foreshadowed by dicta or even by holdings years in advance is nonetheless a taking.if,for example,a state court held in one case,to which the complaining property owner was not a party,that it had the power to limit the acreage of privately owned real estate to acres,and then,in a second case,applied that principle to declare the complainant acre to be public property,the state would have taken an acre from the complainant even though the decision was predictable.
we come at last to petitioner takings attack on the decision below.at the outset,respondents raise two preliminary points which need not detain us long.the city and the county argue that petitioner can not state a cause of action for a taking because,though the members own private property,petitioner itself does not and that the claim is unripe because petitioner has not sought just compensation.neither objection appeared in the briefs in opposition to the petition for writ of certiorari,and since neither is jurisdictional we deem both waived.see this court rule oklahoma city tuttle.
petitioner argues that the florida supreme court took two of the property rights of the members by declaring that those rights did not exist the right to accretions,and the right to have littoral property touch the water which petitioner distinguishes from the mere right of access to the water under petitioner theory,because no prior florida decision had said that the state filling of submerged tidal lands could have the effect of depriving a littoral owner of contact with the water and denying him future accretions,the florida supreme court judgment in the present case abolished those two easements to which littoral property owners had been entitled.this puts the burden on the wrong party.there is no taking unless petitioner can show that,before the florida supreme court decision,owners had rights to future accretions and contact with the water superior to the state right to fill in its submerged land.though some may think the question close,in our view the showing can not be made.
two core principles of florida property law intersect in this case.first,the state as owner of the submerged land adjacent to littoral property has the right to fill that land,so long as it does not interfere with the rights of the public and the rights of littoral landowners.see hayes bowman,so,right to fill conveyed by state to private party state ex rel.buford tampa,so,same.second,as we described supra,at,if an avulsion exposes land seaward of littoral property that had previously been submerged,that land belongs to the state even if it interrupts the littoral owner contact with the water.see bryant,so,at.the issue here is whether there is an exception to this rule when the state is the cause of the avulsion.prior law suggests there is not.in martin busch,so,the florida supreme court held that when the state drained water from a lakebed belonging to the state,causing land that was formerly below the mean line to become dry land,that land continued to belong to the state,at,at see also bryant,supra,at analogizing the situation in martin to an avulsion.the riparian rights doctrine of accretion and reliction,the florida supreme court later explained,does not apply to such lands.bryant,supra,at quoting martin,supra,at,at brown,concurring.this is not surprising,as there can be no accretions to land that no longer abuts the water.
thus,florida law as it stood before the decision below allowed the state to fill in its own seabed,and the resulting sudden exposure of previously submerged land was treated like an avulsion for purposes of ownership.the right to accretions was therefore subordinate to the state right to fill.thiesen gulf,florida alabama suggests the same result.that case involved a claim by a riparian landowner that a railroad filling of submerged land and construction of tracks upon it interfered with the riparian landowners rights to access and to wharf out to a shipping channel.the florida supreme court determined that the claimed right to wharf out did not exist in florida,and that therefore only the right of access was compensable,at,at.significantly,although the court recognized that the owners had rights to accretion,see,at,at,the only rights it even suggested would be infringed by the railroad were the right of access which the plaintiff had claimed and the rights of view and use of the water which it seems the plaintiff had not claimed,see,at,at.
the florida supreme court decision before us is consistent with these background principles of state property law.lucas,at scranton wheeler.it did not abolish the members right to future accretions,but merely held that the right was not implicated by the project,because the doctrine of avulsion applied.see so,at.the florida supreme court opinion describes beach restoration as the reclamation by the state of the public land,just as martin had described the lake drainage in that case.although the opinion does not cite martin and is not always clear on this point,it suffices that its characterization of the littoral right to accretion is consistent with martin and the other relevant principles of florida law we have discussed.
what we have said shows that the rule of sand key,which petitioner repeatedly invokes,is inapposite.there the florida supreme court held that an artificial accretion does not change the right of a owner to claim the accreted land as his own as long as the owner did not cause the accretion himself.so,at.the reason martin did not apply,sand key explained,is that the drainage that had occurred in martin did not lower the water level by imperceptible degrees,and so did not qualify as an accretion.so,at.
the result under florida law may seem.after all,the members property has been deprived of its character and value as oceanfront property by the state artificial creation of an avulsion.perhaps avulsions ought to be treated differently from other avulsions insofar as the property right to accretion is concerned.but nothing in prior florida law makes such a distinction,and martin suggests,if it does not indeed hold,the contrary.even if there might be different interpretations of martin and other florida cases that would prevent this arguably odd result,we are not free to adopt them.the takings clause only protects property rights as they are established under state law,not as they might have been established or ought to have been established.we can not say that the florida supreme court decision eliminated a right of accretion established under florida law.
petitioner also contends that the state took the members littoral right to have their property continually maintain contact with the water.to be clear,petitioner does not allege that the state relocated the property line,as would have happened if the line were landward of the old mean line instead of identical to it.petitioner argues instead that the members have a separate right for the boundary of their property to be always the mean line.petitioner points to dicta in sand key that refers to the right to have the property contact with the water remain intact,so,at.even there,the right was included in the definition of the right to access,which is consistent with the florida supreme court later description that there is no independent right of contact with the water but it exists to preserve the upland owner core littoral right of access to the water,so,at.petitioner expansive interpretation of the dictum in sand key would cause it to contradict the clear florida law governing avulsion.one can not say that the florida supreme court contravened established property law by rejecting it 
because the florida supreme court decision did not contravene the established property rights of petitioner members,florida has not violated the fifth and fourteenth amendments.the judgment of the florida supreme court is therefore affirmed.
it is so ordered.

the court analysis of the principles that control ownership of the land in question,and of the rights of petitioner members as adjacent owners,is correct in my view,leading to my joining parts i,iv,and v of the court opinion.as justice breyer observes,however,this case does not require the court to determine whether,or when,a judicial decision determining the rights of property owners can violate the takings clause of the fifth amendment of the united states constitution.this separate opinion notes certain difficulties that should be considered before accepting the theory that a judicial decision that eliminates an established property right,ante,at,constitutes a violation of the takings clause.
the takings clause is an essential part of the constitutional structure,for it protects private property from expropriation without just compensation and the right to own and hold property is necessary to the exercise and preservation of freedom.the right to retain property without the fact or even the threat of that sort of expropriation is,of course,applicable to the states under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.chicago,chicago.
the right of the property owner is subject,however,to the rule that the government does have power to take property for a public use,provided that it pays just compensation.see first english evangelical lutheran church of glendale county of los angeles.this is a vast governmental power.and typically,legislative bodies grant substantial discretion to executive officers to decide what property can be taken for authorized projects and uses.as a result,if an authorized executive agency or official decides that blackacre is the right place for a fire station or greenacre is the best spot for a freeway interchange,then the weight and authority of the state are used to take the property,even against the wishes of the owner,who must be satisfied with just compensation.
in the exercise of their duty to protect the fisc,both the legislative and executive branches monitor,or should monitor,the exercise of this substantial power.those branches are accountable in their political capacity for the proper discharge of this obligation.
to enable officials to better exercise this great power in a responsible way,some states allow their officials to take a second look after property has been condemned and a jury returns a verdict setting the amount of just compensation.see,cal.civ.proc.code ann.if the condemning authority,usually acting through the executive,deems the compensation too high to pay for the project,it can decide not to take the property at all.the landowner is reimbursed for certain costs and expenses of litigation and the property remains in his or her hands.see,a.
this is just one aspect of the exercise of the power to select what property to condemn and the responsibility to ensure that the taking makes financial sense from the state point of view.and,as a matter of custom and practice,these are matters for the political branches the legislature and the executive not the courts.see first english,supra,at t he decision to exercise the power of eminent domain is a legislative function 
if a judicial decision,as opposed to an act of the executive or the legislature,eliminates an established property right,the judgment could be set aside as a deprivation of property without due process of law.the due process clause,in both its substantive and procedural aspects,is a central limitation upon the exercise of judicial power.and this court has long recognized that property regulations can be invalidated under the due process clause.see,lingle chevron,goldblatt hempstead,demorest city bank farmers trust,broad river power south carolina ex rel.daniel,washington ex rel.seattle title trust roberge,nectow cambridge,village of euclid ambler realty,see also pennsylvania coal mahon,there must be limits on government ability to diminish property values by regulation or the contract and due process clauses are gone it is thus natural to read the due process clause as limiting the power of courts to eliminate or change established property rights.
the takings clause also protects property rights,and it operates as a conditional limitation,permitting the government to do what it wants so long as it pays the charge.eastern enterprises apfel,kennedy,concurring in judgment and dissenting in part.unlike the due process clause,therefore,the takings clause implicitly recognizes a governmental power while placing limits upon that power.thus,if the court were to hold that a judicial taking exists,it would presuppose that a judicial decision eliminating established property rights is otherwise constitutional so long as the state compensates the aggrieved property owners.ibid.there is no clear authority for this proposition.
when courts act without direction from the executive or legislature,they may not have the power to eliminate established property rights by judicial decision.given that the constitutionality of a judicial decision altering property rights appears to turn on the legitimacy of whether the court judgment eliminates or changes established property rights rather than on the availability of compensation,the more appropriate constitutional analysis arises under general due process principles rather than under the takings clause.ibid.courts,unlike the executive or legislature,are not designed to make policy decisions about the need for,and likely effectiveness of,regulatory actions.lingle,supra,at.state courts generally operate under a tradition that allows for incremental modifications to property law,but this tradition can not justify a carte blanch judicial authority to change property definitions wholly free of constitutional limitations.walston,the constitution and property due process,regulatory takings,and judicial takings,utah.
the court would be on strong footing in ruling that a judicial decision that eliminates or substantially changes established property rights,which are a legitimate expectation of the owner,is arbitrary or irrational under the due process clause.lingle,at see,at kennedy,concurring see also perry sindermann,p roperty interests protected by the due process clauses are those that are secured by existing rules or understandings quoting board of regents of state colleges roth.thus,without a judicial takings doctrine,the due process clause would likely prevent a state from doing by judicial decree what the takings clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat.ante,at.the objection that a due process claim might involve close questions concerning whether a judicial decree extends beyond what owners might have expected is not a sound argument for the same close questions would arise with respect to whether a judicial decision is a taking.see apfel,supra,at opinion of kennedy,cases attempting to decide when a regulation becomes a taking are among the most litigated and perplexing in current law penn central transp.new york city,the question of what constitutes a taking for purposes of the fifth amendment has proved to be a problem of considerable difficulty 
to announce that courts too can effect a taking when they decide cases involving property rights,would raise certain difficult questions.since this case does not require those questions to be addressed,in my respectful view,the court should not reach beyond the necessities of the case to announce a sweeping rule that court decisions can be takings,as that phrase is used in the takings clause.the evident reason for recognizing a judicial takings doctrine would be to constrain the power of the judicial branch.of course,the judiciary must respect private ownership.but were this court to say that judicial decisions become takings when they overreach,this might give more power to courts,not less.
consider the instance of litigation between two property owners to determine which one bears the liability and costs when a tree that stands on one property extends its roots in a way that damages adjacent property.see,fancher fagella.if a court deems that,in light of increasing urbanization,the former rule for allocation of these costs should be changed,thus shifting the rights of the owners,it may well increase the value of one property and decrease the value of the other.this might be the type of incremental modification under state common law that does not violate due process,as owners may reasonably expect or anticipate courts to make certain changes in property law.the usual due process constraint is that courts can not abandon settled principles.see,rogers tennessee,citing bouie city of columbia,apfel,at opinion of kennedy,see also perry,supra,at roth,supra,at.
but if the state court were deemed to be exercising the power to take property,that constraint would be removed.because the state would be bound to pay owners for takings caused by a judicial decision,it is conceivable that some judges might decide that enacting a sweeping new rule to adjust the rights of property owners in the context of changing social needs is a good idea.knowing that the resulting ruling would be a taking,the courts could go ahead with their project,free from constraints that would otherwise confine their power.the resulting judgment as between the property owners likely could not be set aside by some later enactment.see plaut spendthrift farm,leaving open whether legislation reopening final judgments violates due process clause.and if the litigation were a class action to decide,for instance,whether there are public rights of access that diminish the rights of private ownership,a state might find itself obligated to pay a substantial judgment for the judicial ruling.even if the legislature were to subsequently rescind the judicial decision by statute,the state would still have to pay just compensation for the temporary taking that occurred from the time of the judicial decision to the time of the statutory fix.see first english,at.
the idea,then,that a judicial takings doctrine would constrain judges might just well have the opposite effect.it would give judges new power and new assurance that changes in property rights that are beneficial,or thought to be so,are fair and proper because just compensation will be paid.the judiciary historically has not had the right or responsibility to say what property should or should not be taken.
indeed,it is unclear whether the takings clause was understood,as a historical matter,to apply to judicial decisions.the framers most likely viewed this clause as applying only to physical appropriation pursuant to the power of eminent domain.see lucas south carolina coastal council.and it appears these physical appropriations were traditionally made by legislatures.see story,commentaries on the constitution of the united states.courts,on the other hand,lacked the power of eminent domain.see blackstone,commentaries lewis ed.the court takings clause jurisprudence has expanded beyond the framers understanding,as it now applies to certain regulations that are not physical appropriations.see lucas,supra,at citing mahon.but the court should consider with care the decision to extend the takings clause in a manner that might be inconsistent with historical practice.
there are two additional practical considerations that the court would need to address before recognizing judicial takings.first,it may be unclear in certain situations how a party should properly raise a judicial takings claim.i t is important to separate out two judicial actions the decision to change current property rules in a way that would constitute a taking,and the decision to require compensation.thompson,judicial takings.in some contexts,these issues could arise separately.for instance,assume that a opinion explicitly holds that it is changing state property law,or that it asserts that is not changing the law but there is no fair or substantial basis for this statement.broad river,at.most of these cases may arise in the latter posture,like inverse condemnati
