the national marine fisheries service nmfs used climate projections to determine that the loss of sea ice over shallow waters in the arctic would leave the pacific bearded seal subspecies erignathus barbatus nauticus endangered by the year.this case turns on one issue when nmfs determines that a species that is not presently endangered will lose its habitat due to climate change by the end of the century,may nmfs list that species as threatened under the endangered species act the district court answered in the negative,ruling that nmfs listing decision was arbitrary and capricious.we hold that on the basis of the administrative record,nmfs listing decision is reasonable.accordingly,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs.

in october,nmfs established a biological review team of eight marine mammal biologists,a fishery biologist,a marine chemist,and a climate scientist to review the status of the best scientific and commercial data available regarding bearded seals listing rule,fed.reg.at.nmfs solicited four scientists to conduct independent peer reviews of the review team report.id.at.based on the review team assessment and the peer reviewers comments,nmfs published a proposed rule listing the beringia and okhotsk bearded seal dpss as threatened under the esa.see also proposed rule,fed.reg.
the status and peer review reports found that the bearded seal erignathus barbatus lives throughout the arctic and northern atlantic oceans,including in the chukchi,beaufort,and bering seas sea of okhotsk sea of japan and waters of arctic canada hudson and baffin bays,svalbard norway,and russia.because bearded seals are widespread,have low population densities,and spend significant time under water,it is difficult to obtain a reliable estimate of their current population.listing rule,fed.reg.at.the bearded seal is commonly divided into two subspecies barbatus,which primarily inhabits the atlantic,and nauticus,which inhabits the pacific.noting that there were regions of intergrading between the atlantic and pacific subspecies,nmfs identified two distinct pacific population segments.proposed rule,fed.reg.at.one group lived exclusively in the sea of okhotsk the okhotsk dps,and the remaining seals were found throughout the bering and chukchi seas the beringia dps,with very little mixing between the two groups.id.at.
the review concluded that bearded seals generally prefer to hunt organisms found on the ocean floor.as a result,the seals prefer to congregate where sea ice floes appear over shallow water between to meters deep,and the seals avoid unbroken,heavy,drifting ice or large areas of ice located over deeper waters.id.at.the seals use ice floes to give birth whelp and to nurse their pups to allow mothers close access to food sources while nursing to enable their pups to gain experience with diving,swimming,and hunting away from their predators to provide a location for males to attempt to attract females and to provide a platform where male seals can rest while molting.listing rule,fed.reg.at,bearded seals require access to shallow waters,where the seals have access to more productive sea floors with a higher availability of food.
using observational and predictive data from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fourth assessment report,nmfs used six climate models to determine when the beringia dps sea ice habitat would degrade to such an extent that it would render the beringia dps endangered,and it made available for public review its methodology and data.proposed rule,fed.reg.at.all independent peer reviewers agreed that the beringia dps continued viability depended on the availability of sea ice in the bering and barents seas during crucial life stages.
after considering thousands of comments to the proposed rule,nmfs extended the review period and sought additional independent peer reviews of the sections of the status review report that generated the greatest disagreement among peer reviewers the timing and magnitude of climate change effects on the availability of sea ice in the bering sea.listing rule,fed.reg.at.nmfs additionally updated its climate predictions to include studies published after the proposed listing rule.id.at.nmfs also held public hearings in anchorage,barrow,and nome to solicit comments.id.at.
nmfs determined that lack of access to sea ice in shallow waters would require bearded seals to make significant adaptations to survive.id.at.it reasoned that lack of access to sea ice over shallow waters likely would encourage seals in the beringia dps to whelp and nurse on shore,increasing their risk of exposure to their primary predators polar bears and walruses.id.at.because lack of sea ice in shallow water would require seals to forage in deeper waters that lacked the ocean floor productivity of shallow waters,nmfs concluded that as seals moved to deeper waters,they faced a greater risk of being unable to meet their subsistence needs.id.and although bearded seals did not require access to sea ice floes in shallow waters,most observational studies and peer reviewers opined that lack of access to sea ice during periods of significant life functions birthing,nursing,molting would likely have a negative effect on the beringia dps.id.
having concluded that the availability of sea ice in shallow water was crucial to the beringia dps viability,nmfs evaluated several climate models to determine the magnitude and timing of climate change impact on the availability of sea ice in areas inhabited by the beringia dps.id.at.those projections indicated that by,sea ice in several regions where the beringia dps whelps will have disappeared entirely during the mating,nursing,and birthing season april through june.id.nmfs also concluded that any periodic gains in sea ice as a result of climate change were not really gains for the beringia dps.instead,independent peer reviewers cautioned that gains in sea ice were illusory seals would simply be able to access areas they already used in earlier months,but not during the times when critical life activities occurred.id.the majority of peer reviewers commented that increased sea ice formation over deep waters would not offset sea ice losses in shallow waters in the bering,chukchi,and beaufort seas.nmfs and its peer reviewers also noted that although climate change had caused sea ice patterns to shift during the year,there would be a net decrease in the total number of days in which sea ice would be available to the seals.id.at.
nmfs published its final rule designating the bearded seal beringia dps as threatened in december.id.at.after providing days notice under esa section,g a i,aoga filed suit challenging nmfs listing decision.
the endangered species act seeks to recover endangered and threatened species and to reverse the trend towards species extinction,whatever the cost.jewell,at quoting.valley auth.hill,d b.to achieve that purpose,the esa requires the secretary of commerce,or her designee,to identify and list endangered or threatened species.see a see also nw.ecosys,at.when determining whether to list a species,the reviewing agency must make its decision solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available.b a.
because cbd petition cited global warming as the primary threat to bearded seals,nmfs focused its status review on the impact of warmer temperatures on the beringia dps.proposed rule,fed.reg.at.to determine the magnitude of climate change effect on sea ice,nmfs utilized the ipcc predictive models,and it attempted to apply those models to observational data that the department of the interior collected annually regarding sea ice in the bering and chukchi seas.id.at listing rule fed.reg.at.the ipcc climate predictions through were based on data about emissions its climate projections for to,however,used contemporary data to predict potential climate trends under multiple scenarios.proposed rule,fed.reg.at.those models showed greater volatility,and thus less reliable predictive value,in the arctic.id.because modeling for the second half of the century involved unknown variables technological improvement,changes in climate policy,the ipcc used models with slightly differing assumptions to obtain simulations of the upper and for the increase in global temperatures from to.id.
to account for uncertainty in the ipcc to predictions,nmfs used two models considered to be particularly reliable with respect to arctic sea ice,and it used medium and high emissions scenarios to project monthly sea ice concentrations between march and july for each decade,beginning in and ending in.id.at.nmfs then compared the results of those projections to its observational data regarding sea ice to determine if the ipcc models performed reliably when applied to the arctic.id.at.six models performed reliably in the chukchi and east siberian seas,four performed reliably in the beaufort and east bering seas,and one model performed reliably in the western bering sea.id.nmfs disclosed its methodology,as well as the limits of the ipcc models,in the proposed listing rule and in a notice of availability of special independent peer review reports.
after confirming the models accuracy,nmfs applied each to the areas occupied by the beringia dps to determine the range of temperatures per month from to,and used those temperature projections to determine the impact of local warming on sea ice melt.id.nmfs projections demonstrated that by may and june,there would be no sea ice in the bering strait,the east siberian shelf,or the barents or bering seas.id.by july,sea ice would recede to less than of the mean or disappear entirely from the beaufort,chukchi,and east siberian seas.id.most dramatically,by the time nmfs sought a second round of public comment on its climate projections,sea ice scientists published research indicating that the ipcc climate models understated the speed at which temperatures were rising at the poles.id.at.using observational data,those studies predicted that temperatures at the arctic were years ahead of schedule and that there would be a nearly sea ice free summer arctic by.id.at.
plaintiffs contend that nmfs used climate models that can not reliably predict the degree of global warming beyond or the effect of that warming on a subregion,such as the arctic.although plaintiffs frame their arguments as challenging climate projections,they seek to undermine nmfs use of climate change projections as the basis for esa listings.plaintiffs contention is unavailing in alaska oil and gas association jewell,we adopted the circuit holding that the ipcc climate models constituted the best available science and reasonably supported the determination that a species reliant on sea ice likely would become endangered in the foreseeable future.at in re polar bear,at.
we have stressed that we must defer to the agency interpretation of complex scientific data so long as the agency provides a reasonable explanation for adopting its approach and discloses the limitations of that approach.nw.ecosys,at see also san luis delta mendota water auth.jewell,cir.the determination of what constitutes the best scientific data available belongs to the agency special expertise and w hen examining this kind of scientific determination a reviewing court must generally be at its most deferential.internal quotation marks omitted.nmfs provided ample evidence of significant sea ice loss from to,a period in which specific data supports the ipcc climate projections.proposed rule,fed.reg.at.those projections indicate that during months in which bearded seals used that ice for critical life events such as mating,birthing,and nursing,most beringia dps habitats will have lost most,if not all,of their sea ice.id.at.by september,observational data confirmed that the amount of summer sea ice in the areas populated by the beringia dps was below the average.id.at.nmfs has provided a reasonable explanation,based on the best available scientific and commercial data,for relying on those projections in its listing decision.
nmfs projections for the of the century are also reasonable,scientifically sound,and supported by evidence.there is no debate that temperatures will continue to increase over the remainder of the century and that the effects will be particularly acute in the arctic.the current scientific consensus is that arctic sea ice will continue to recede through,and nmfs considered the best available research to reach that conclusion.one independent peer reviewer noted that nothing in existing data would change the general picture that sea ice habitats important to bearded seals are disappearing and will continue to disappear,especially in the bering and chukchi seas.excerpts of at,ecf.a second peer reviewer opined that it was more likely than not that the uncertainty attaching to year predictions of how changing climate will affect bearded seals and their habitat has been,is being,and will be greatly underestimated.excerpts of at,ecf.all parties agree that there will be sea ice melt the only uncertainty is the magnitude of warming,the speed with which warming will take place,and the severity of its effect.
the fact that climate projections for through may be volatile does not deprive those projections of value in the rulemaking process.the esa does not require nmfs to make listing decisions only if underlying research is ironclad and absolute.see san luis delta mendota water,at w here the information is not readily available,we can not insist on perfection t he best scientific data available,does not mean the best scientific data possible.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.the esa directs nmfs to make its determinations solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available after conducting a review of the status of the species.b a.after conducting that assessment,if nmfs finds it likely that a species will become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range,it must list that species as threatened,b b ii.nmfs provided a reasonable and scientifically supported methodology for addressing volatility in its climate projections,and it represented fairly the shortcomings of those projections that is all the esa requires.see jewell,at to the extent that plaintiffs demand greater scientific specificity than available data could provide,they echo the district court error in demanding too high a standard of scientific proof.
the majority of independent peer reviewers agreed that nmfs climate projections were based on the best scientific and commercial data available,that there was scientific consensus regarding the direction and effect of climate change,that there would be significant sea ice loss in the beringia dps habitat,and that such a significant loss of habitat would almost certainly have a negative effect on the bearded seal survival.moreover,under nmfs to climate projections,even if global warming plateaued in the of the century,devastating sea ice losses would still result during months that are currently critical to the bearded seal propagation proposed rule,fed.reg.at.
further,climate studies released and noticed for public comment after the publication of the proposed listing rule indicated that the arctic was warming at a much faster rate than anticipated by the ipcc projections.those studies,which are included in the administrative record,advised that observational data regarding current temperature increases indicated that arctic sea ice may disappear as early as approximately years earlier than nmfs predicted when it suggested the beringia dps would lose its sea ice habitat by.see jewell,at fws also noted in in re polar bear litigation that the observational record of current sea ice losses indicates that losses seem to be about years ahead of the modeled values,which suggests a seasonally arctic may come a lot sooner than expected.the administrative record demonstrates that nmfs provided a reasonable and justification for its and sea ice projections.
the esa does not require nmfs to base its decision on ironclad evidence when it determines that a species is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future it simply requires the agency to consider the best and most reliable scientific and commercial data and to identify the limits of that data when making a listing determination.in light of the data available to it during the rulemaking process,nmfs reasonably concluded that there would be continued sea ice loss over shallow waters,resulting in habitat loss that would almost certainly threaten the beringia dps survival.nmfs has provided a rational and reasonable basis for evaluating the bearded seal viability over and years,and it has candidly disclosed the limitations of the available data and its analysis.the esa does not require more,and nmfs did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in concluding that the effects of global climate change on sea ice would endanger the beringia dps in the foreseeable future.
plaintiffs advance three principal arguments to challenge nmfs listing decision.first,plaintiffs contend that nmfs use of climate projections diverges from its previous practice of setting the year as the outer boundary of its foreseeable future analysis.nmfs has argued,and several federal courts have agreed,that the agency may determine the timeframe for its foreseeable future analysis based upon the best data available for a particular species and its habitat.in re polar bear,at,allowing nmfs to determine the timeline for foreseeable future threats of extinction based on the specific species,habitat,and best available science at the time of listing see also watersheds project ashe,d,idaho the agency assessment of the foreseeable future is typically based on the timeframes over which the best available scientific data allow the agency to reliably assess threats and the species response to those threats internal quotation marks omitted ctr.for biological diversity lubchenco,d,cal.observing that the length of time that constitutes the foreseeable future for listing purposes may vary depending on the species and the threats it faces.
