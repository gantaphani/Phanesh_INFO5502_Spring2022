multiple environmental groups challenged management plans approved by the forest service authorizing two commercial timber sales in the norbeck wildlife preserve in the black hills of south dakota.after exhausting their administrative remedies,the plaintiffs brought suit in federal district court alleging that the forest service failed to comply with both administrative law and the national environmental policy act nepa,and,additionally,that the harvest plans violate the norbeck organic act.the district court ruled against them and dismissed plaintiffs complaint with prejudice.this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction over the final decisions of district courts under.
originally named the custer state park game sanctuary,the norbeck wildlife preserve was created by congress in.the forest service currently manages approximately of the preserve acres the diverse geography ranges in elevation from to feet,providing habitat to multiple game animals,such as elk,deer,and mountain goats over fifty bird species,including species of nuthatch and woodpeckers,the northern goshawk,ruffed grouse and merriam turkey brook trout and other fish species and to various animals.
the forest service endeavors to manage habitat for breeding,feeding,hiding,and resting for this myriad of animal species,while also optimizing vegetative diversity.habitat management is a delicate venture.successful management necessitates a precarious balancing of the environmental impacts occasioned by geographical features such as meadows,undergrowth,timber stands,roads,and waterflow.for example,some species are sustained by mature to timber stands,while others need early successional forest stages.after considering many countervailing factors,the forest service approved the timber harvest plans now at issue for the needles and grizzly areas of the norbeck preserve.
this is not the first time that timber harvests have been planned for the norbeck preserve.in,the forest service developed a master plan for managing the preserve,and regulated timber harvests were included.see aplee.at.that master plan specified that timber cutting would be without material interference with the game and expressly reinforced that wildlife preservation remained the primary purpose and dominant activity of preserve management.id.at.in,congress authorized mining within the preserve and acknowledged that timber clearing was incidental to that use.a.substantial commercial timber harvests were proposed in and,but,after lengthy administrative and court proceedings,neither proposal reached fruition.the course of those proceedings yielded a final supplemental environmental impact statement fseis that forms the evidentiary basis for the current harvest plans.
the forest service does not assert that the master plan nor the mining exemption authorize the proposed timber sales from the needles and grizzly areas.instead,the service asserts that the comprehensive black hills national forest land and resource master plan,approved in,authorizes the current management plans,of which the timber sales are a part.the service enacted the plan pursuant to the national forest management act nfma.see et accordingly,the plan overtly effectuates the nfma mandate to optimize overall wildlife,fish,and vegetative habitat diversity.see g b g.consequently,under the plan,the management emphasis for the norbeck preserve became the optimization of overall habitat capability,thus extending management decisions beyond the parameters of the norbeck organic act.see aplee.at plan.
apart from the nfma and its mandate to optimize overall diversity,the norbeck organic act specifically designates the norbeck wildlife preserve more narrowly for the protection of game animals and birds and as a breeding place thereof.under the norbeck act,timber harvests are permitted in limited situations e xcept where clearing is necessary in connection with mining operations,no use of the surface of the claim or the resources therefrom shall be allowed except under the rules and regulations a.in this case,the district court upheld the agency management plans after finding them in compliance with the rules and regulations of the national environmental policy act nepa.et.
the record reveals that the proposed harvest plans will yield approximately million board feet of timber from over acres of the preserve.to facilitate those harvests,there will be an accompanying miles of road construction.it is not disputed that,besides other environmental impacts,the harvests and road construction will significantly reduce the percentage of hiding cover to as low as percent of the project area the record reveals that the agency is aware the harvests and accompanying road construction will cause wildlife disturbance,but the agency justifies the plans by relying on mitigation measures oriented toward overall habitat diversity.at record of decision.furthermore,the agency recognizes that the balancing of all interests may be detrimental to the continued presence of some habitat specialists,especially species requiring larger tracts of forest or interior habitat conditions.aplee.at fseis.notably,habitat specialists include bird species dependent on pine stands in mature and forest.see id.at.that grouping encompasses woodpeckers and goshawks,both of which have been classified as sensitive species based on their population statuses.see supra note.again,the agency relies on the nfma interest of overall plant and animal diversity to justify the fact that certain species might be compromised,including some already jeopardized.
appellees argue that the forest service has reasonably interpreted the norbeck act as permitting it to manage the preserve for overall habitat and vegetative diversity,recognizing a special emphasis on game animals and birds,but creating favorable habitat conditions for wildlife generally.aplee.br.at.in other words,appellees have interpreted the norbeck act to be supplemental or subordinate to the nfma.appellees assert that we should defer to the agency interpretation of its management mandate and in doing so imply that agency discretion extends to the determination of which among various statutes govern agency action.
indeed,we defer to agency interpretation of congressionally delegated mandates.see chevron natural res.def.council,d see also marsh oregon natural res.council,d emphasizing that deference is particularly appropriate when an interpretation implicates scientific and technical judgments within the scope of agency expertise.deferring to an interpretation of a known but ambiguous mandate,however,is strikingly different than deferring to the determination of which among various statutes constitutes the mandate of congress.we do not pay deference to an agency interpretation of what law is applicable in this case,that means we do not defer to the agency interpretation of how one act nfma affects the scope of another norbeck act.see cascade natural gas,cir reiterating that court is under no obligation to defer to the agency legal conclusions.in this case,we must first decide whether and how other congressional acts,namely the nfma and the nepa,affect the norbeck act special mandate.
appellees assert that this court need not decide the relationship between the nfma and the norbeck act because the sierra club arguments in this case can be rejected based solely on the norbeck act.aplee.br.at.we disagree.the agency consistent recitation and reliance upon overall diversity and other terms extraneous to the norbeck act make clear that the agency itself did not rely solely on the norbeck act in approving the commercial timber harvest plans.appellees remark that t his is not a case in which the forest service is balancing competing habitat needs of game animals and birds on the one hand,against habitat needs of other wildlife species on the other.id.again,we disagree.the agency record leaves no doubt that this is precisely that kind of balancing case.in the agency words 
managing the norbeck wildlife preserve to create this habitat diversity means balancing the conflicts between creating more edge and minimizing fragmentation.on the one hand,edges promote habitat and species richness,and favor many game and species.on the other hand,those same edges and the habitat fragmentation they create may be detrimental to the continued presence of some habitat specialists 
aplee.at.indeed,we must determine whether the norbeck act allows that kind of overall interest balancing.
our research confirms appellants assertion that no court has interpreted the norbeck act,making this case one of first impression.however,we clarify that we are not wholly without guidance because similar statutes have been reviewed.reviewing the mining law of the grand canyon game preserve and making an explicit comparison to the norbeck preserve,one court reasoned that activities like mining or timber harvesting are not permitted in these special preserves unless they are expressly allowed by statute.see pathfinder mines clark.in cases more recent and more directly on point,environmental groups have litigated proposed timber sales in the ozark national forest.see kuff united states forest,d gregson united states forestry,d.although these cases do not resolve the final question we address in this appeal,they are instructive to the extent that they explain the connections between the nepa,the nfma,and the management of preserves governed by special mandates.
without further discussion,we agree with these previous cases that the nepa itself does not mandate particular results but simply prescribes the necessary process.kuff,d at citing inland empire public lands council united states forest,cir,and simmons united states army corps of eng rs,cir.we also agree that the forest service may treat the nfma as a substantive statute under which the forest service is acting even in the management of specially designated preserves.kuff,d at.it is conceivable that in many cases,and hopefully most cases,the nfma mandate to preserve overall diversity will work in concert with the more specific mandate of a special preserve.the question we must address,however,is which statute controls when the intersection of two or more mandates results in compromising a specifically applicable statute.in particular,we must resolve whether the broad overall diversity standards of the nfma can be interpreted to overbalance and thereby effectively negate the specific game animal and bird duty imposed by the norbeck act.
it is a fundamental tenet of statutory construction that a court should not construe a general statute to eviscerate a statute of specific effect.state bank of utah gledhill in re gledhill,cir citing morales trans world airlines,d.the provisions of the nfma apply generally to the million acres of national forest system,but there are a collection of special preserves with specific management mandates extraneous to the nfma.see.these preserves comprise less than percent of the national forest system.in this limited context,we can not apply the nfma mandate in a way that effectively abolishes the specific statutory mandates congress has established.that is the law even if reason and equity support a different conclusion.see tennessee valley auth.hill,d.accordingly,we hold that the norbeck organic act governs the management of the norbeck preserve,and management plans must comply with its specific mandate.
given the record before us,the end result of overall diversity does not allow us to assume that the timber harvest plans will protect game animals and birds.there are scattered concessions throughout the record that,although overall diversity will be enhanced,the harvests and road construction will in fact create wildlife disturbances and will have deleterious effects on certain species.content that proposed harvest plans optimize overall diversity including vegetative,fish and life,the agency did not specify what it meant by disturbance and deleterious.see.at and aplee.at.it is significant that some of these overbalanced species birds have populations already classified as sensitive.wyoming farm bureau fed babbitt,cir holding that the endangered species act does not countenance a management plan that undermines the recovery of threatened and endangered species.we might eventually confront the question of whether it is acceptable management practice to favor overall vegetative and animal diversity even at the expense of rare species of plants or animals.at present,however,as a matter of statutory interpretation,we hold that the anticipated deleterious effects can not be answered by general reliance on the nfma broader mandate to protect overall diversity because the norbeck act specially designated species game animals and birds might drop out in such a balancing of collective interests.in light of the norbeck act,we can not sustain harvest plans that favor vegetative,fish and animal life if they fail to protect game animals and birds,even if optimal diversity is served.the law requires a more specific analysis.
the plain language of the norbeck act requires the protection of game animals and birds,not the overall protection of all plant and animal species.see sundance,reno,cir holding that,notwithstanding other ambiguities,plain language of statute established a group possibly subject to its requirements.appellees counter that protection is an ambiguous term requiring agency interpretation.we note that the agency did not address whether there are other available habitats for the rare birds,and we would normally require that type of specific finding with respect to the protection of a rare species.in any event,we agree that there is ambiguity about what protection ultimately entails,but hold here that the ambiguity does not extend to the object of protection.on that specific point,game animals and birds are the specially designated species and must be protected not a balancing of interests 
we restate that we are not impinging agency discretion by directing the forest service to reconsider its harvest plans in light of the narrow parameters established by the norbeck act.our holding is premised simply on the fact that the norbeck act,unless modified by congress,contains a special mandate that must be given full force.that is true even if the norbeck act narrow mandate to protect game animals and birds prevents maximization of other mandates,namely,the nfma mandate to preserve overall diversity.sierra club espy,cir recognizing that required substantive decisions may constrain the ability to maximize the mandate of nfma.the forest service can continue to establish management plans under both the norbeck act and the nfma,but the nfma mandate must be supplemental and may not diminish through balancing the more specific mandate of the norbeck act.
during our careful review of the record,we have observed that because the agency paid special attention to game animals and birds,there is room to argue that the harvest plans might,in fact,satisfy the demands of the norbeck act.conversely,as we have pointed out,the record also gives reason to believe that the timber harvest plans fail to satisfy that directive.in any event,we recognize that the actual effect of harvest plans on specified habitats is the kind of scientific determination for which we should not substitute our judgment in the place of a clear determination by an agency with specialized expertise.see baltimore gas natural res.def.council,d.when the agency record is inadequate,the proper course,except in rare circumstances,is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.florida power light lorion,d.we find this record inadequate because the agency justified its plans against a standard that authorizes management practices that would not be authorized by the controlling norbeck act.contrary to appellees assertion,we hold that as a matter of law the nfma is supplemental or subordinate to the specific mandate of the norbeck act.
it is clear to us that the agency approved the harvest plan because it fulfilled the nfma goal of overall diversity.certain bird species,some of them already rare,might have dropped out in that analysis.for the harvest plans to be consistent with law,they must,nonetheless,satisfy the norbeck mandate.we can not assume that to be true simply because overall diversity has been optimized.on remand,the agency must justify the proposed timber harvests not by showing that optimal diversity is served generally,but by showing specifically that game animals and birds are protected.
accordingly,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
for over a century,humans have suppressed fires and other natural,destructive forces in the norbeck wildlife preserve.see aplee.at.as a result of this artificial,human interference,the preserve has been transformed from a wilderness area with a variety of habitats and wildlife to a place dominated by mature to ponderosa pine.see id.whereas before,an abundant diversity of aspen,spruce,and pine flourished amidst meadows,streams,and rock formations,now the preserve harbors a monoculture of older ponderosa pine.see id.at ponderosa pine is the dominant species in norbeck wildlife preserve,constituting percent of habitat.in,percent of the ponderosa pine in norbeck was in a mature condition.id.at national forest land in norbeck lacks habitat diversity.the dominant vegetative type is mature ponderosa pine growing in dense,homogenous stands of acres or more.there is little diversity in either tree species or the ages and sizes of the existing trees.prior to human interference,seedlings,saplings,and mature trees of various species provided a tapestry of canopies which in turn allowed for an assortment of different plants and shrubs to grow beneath the trees.see id.at.the unbroken,closed,canopy of mature ponderosa pine forests blocks sunlight and is steadily choking off the grasses,flowers,and bushes which used to grow on the forest floor of norbeck.see id.
the natural diversity of plants,shrubs,and trees supported a diversity of wildlife.as the majority acknowledges,different wildlife species require different,often conflicting types of habitat s ome species are sustained by mature to timber stands,while others need early successional forest stages.op.at.compare aplee.at stating that elk and deer need open areas and young pine stands with id.at indicating that northern goshawks and northern woodpeckers need older tree stands.consequently,the decades of artificial suppression of the natural growth and decay in norbeck have transformed it from a wilderness that used to support an abundant variety of animals,birds,and fish to a place suited to the few species that can survive in mature to ponderosa pine forests 
modern forest management science has recognized that humans can alter the delicate balance of an area like norbeck both by cutting all the trees,turning a diverse wilderness into a meadow,and by suppressing all the fires or vegetative diseases,turning a wilderness into an unbroken forest.here,the forest service,employing this modern understanding,is attempting to restore wildlife diversity to the preserve by restoring habitat diversity.
as laudable as this goal may be,the majority is correct to insist that the forest service decisions with regard to the needles and grizzly areas must comply with the norbeck act the majority disapproves of these decisions because it believes that the forest service has failed to develop an adequate record to show that the norbeck act mandate to protect game animals and birds has been satisfied.see op.at.the majority two overriding concerns are that the forest service subordinated the norbeck act to the nfma,see op.at,and the proposed plans patently contradict the norbeck act mandate,see id.at.
i do not share the majority concerns.i respectfully dissent because i believe the forest service has demonstrated compliance with all the statutes that apply,including the nepa,the nfma,and the norbeck act.unlike the majority,i find the act rife with ambiguity and the forest service decisions reasonable interpretations of it.therefore,i believe chevron deference requires us to affirm the district court approval of these decisions.
overlapping statutes 
the norbeck preserve is governed by several overlapping statutes,the nepa,the nfma,and the norbeck act,each of which must be complied with before any decision affecting the preserve may be implemented legally at times the majority acknowledges this.see op.at stating that the nepa applies to norbeck id.at same for the nfma id.at holding that management plans must comply with the specific mandate of the norbeck act.at other times,however,the majority seems to set up an proposition either the nfma or the norbeck act applies,but if the former does then the latter can not.see op.at discussing which among various statutes govern agency action id.at disagreeing with the forest service assertion that its decisions comply with all the overlapping statutes,including the norbeck act,and chiding the service for not rely ing solely on the norbeck act id.at asking whether the nfma can overbalance and thereby effectively negate the norbeck act.i believe this is a false dichotomy.there is no inherent reason to think that the forest service reliance on the nfma necessarily violates the norbeck act.
these instances of characterizing the case in terms brings to light the majority fundamental concern,and the question at the heart of this case whether the forest service goal of optimiz ing overall wildlife,fish,and vegetative habitat diversity,op.at citing the nfma,is permissible given the norbeck act mandate of preserving norbeck for the protection of game animals and birds,and as a breeding place therefor,id.quoting the norbeck act.the majority concludes that the goal is patently contradictory to the act mandate.see op.at.i disagree given the act ambiguity.
ambiguities in the norbeck act 
i agree with the majority conclusion that,as the most specific of the overlapping statutes that apply to the preserve,the proposed management plans must comply with the specific mandate of the norbeck act.see op.at.i disagree,though,with the majority further conclusion that the act language contain s and limit s the forest service discretion in such a way as to disallow the proposed plans for norbeck.see id.at.my reason,again,is that i find the act ambiguous on numerous levels.the surrounding statutory context eliminates some of the ambiguity,but it does so in favor of the forest service interpretation.
to begin with,protection of game animals and birds is ambiguous in that it may mean either protecting individual animals or protecting populations of animals the latter reading seems more plausible because permits the secretary of agriculture to issue regulations to govern hunting,trapping,killing,or capturing of game animals and birds on the preserve.see.indeed,protecting populations of animals may in fact require injuring or killing individual animals.for example,the forest service would protect a herd of deer living in the preserve if it killed one,sick member of that herd before it was able to spread a contagious disease to the others.
second,the ambiguity the majority notes in the term protection,see op.at,is drained of some of its,again,in favor of the forest service plans to allow,which,as the majority mentions,expressly permits timber harvests in limited situations,see op.at.thus,the term protection must permit some harm to some animals,it allows some amount of wildlife disturbances and deleterious effects on certain species.see op.at.how much harm is too much is a judgment call best left to wildlife experts,not this court.see marsh or.natural res.council,d explaining that courts must defer to the informed discretion of the responsible federal agencies on questions requiring a high level of technical expertise.these the forest service and the broader scientific in the process leading up to the adoption of the management plans at issue.see infra at.
consequently,the phrase the protection of game animals and birds is best read as directed at game animal and bird populations,not at individual animals or birds,and as permitting,not forbidding,some wildlife disturbances.
the third,and most telling,ambiguity of phrase protection of game animals and birds,however,resides in the object of protection,in discerning what exactly is to be protected.if the phrase game animals and birds means game animals and game birds,then the forest
