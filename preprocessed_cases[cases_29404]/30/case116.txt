we agree.although cercla strict liability scheme casts a wide net,an act of war defense avoids ensnarement of persons who bear no responsibility for the release of harmful substances.the attacks come within this defense.as the act of war defense shows,cercla was not intended to create liability for the dispersal of debris and wreckage from a catastrophe that was indistinguishable from military attack in purpose,scale,means,and effect.both the president and congress responded to the september attacks by labeling them acts of war,and this classification warrants notice,and perhaps some deference,in the cercla context.the decisive point is that the attacks directly and immediately caused the release,and were the sole cause of the release because the attacks overwhelm ed and swamp ed the contributions of the defendant s.in re september litigation,d,quoting william rodgers,environmental law hazardous wastes and substances.
background 
after the september,attacks that leveled the world trade center september attacks,real estate developer cedar washington began renovating its leased story downtown office building into a story business hotel.in late,the new york state department of environmental conservation and the united states environmental protection agency notified cedar washington that the interstitial spaces of the building might contain substances from the world trade center,including concrete,asbestos,silicon,fiberglass,benzene,lead,and mercury wtc dust.to permit renovation to continue,the government agencies required cedar washington to perform costly remediation.in this suit,cedar washington seeks to recover those costs from the owner of the world trade center site,lessees of world trade center buildings,and the companies that owned the two aircraft that were crashed into the towers.
the claims are premised on cercla and indemnification.the district court initially dismissed the complaint on statute of limitations grounds and alternatively on the ground that cedar washington failed to allege a necessary element of a cercla cost recovery claim either a release or a disposal of hazardous substances.in re september litigation,akh,wl,citing a.on appeal,we declined to resolve these thorny questions of statutory interpretation instead,we remanded under united states jacobson,cir,for the district court to determine,in the first instance,whether the defendants could invoke cercla act of war defense.in re september litigation,app x cir.this affirmative defense requires the alleged polluter to prove by a preponderance of evidence that the release of a hazardous substance was caused solely by an act of war.b.
pursuant to our mandate,the district court ordered briefing and heard argument,and then held,in a march,opinion,that cedar washington claim could be dismissed on this alternative ground in addition to those identified in its earlier opinion.in re september litigation,d.the district court emphasized that 
the attacks were unique in our history,id.at

once the district court issued its opinion,cedar washington promptly notified this court to restore jurisdiction,and the appeal was reinstated.
discussion 
the district court decision that the september attacks constitute an act of war under cercla,and that those attacks were the sole cause of the release of wtc dust,is reviewed de novo.hayden paterson,cir grant of a motion for judgment on the pleading accorded de novo review.we accept as true all allegations and draw all reasonable inferences in cedar washington favor.burnette carothers,cir in deciding a rule c motion,we apply the same standard as under rule b,accepting the allegations contained in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.
cercla imposes strict liability for hazardous waste cleanup on owners and facility operators,on certain persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous waste,and on certain persons who transport hazardous waste.a.three affirmative defenses are made available when cercla liability would not be linked to responsibility for contamination.these defenses are listed in section b 
there shall be no liability under cercla for a person otherwise liable who can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance and the damages resulting therefrom were caused solely by

an act or omission of a n unrelated third party or 
any combination of the foregoing paragraphs.

act of war is undefined in the statutory text,and the legislative history is silent on the intended meaning of the term.united states shell oil,cir.to construe it,we consider not only the bare meaning of the phrase but also its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.united states robinson,cir quoting holloway united states,internal quotation marks omitted.
there is no doubt that cerlca commands a broad reading,and that,accordingly,its several exceptions including act of war are generally read narrowly.see aamco transmissions,cir it was congress intent that cercla be construed liberally see also shell oil,at denying act of war defense to oil companies who released hazardous substances during wartime at the government direction westfarm assocs.washington suburban sanitary comm n,cir noting cercla rnarrow defenses for damages caused solely by act of god,war,or third parties.
