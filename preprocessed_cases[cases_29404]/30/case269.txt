opinion of the court 
eagle environmental,eagle,a landfill developer,brought both facial and challenges against a federal statute regulating the placement of waste disposal facilities near airports.the district court struck down the law as facially unconstitutional,holding that it was so irrationally under inclusive as to violate equal protection.
while this appeal was pending,congress repealed the challenged statute and replaced it with a substantially broader regulatory scheme.we believe that this action has mooted eagle claims regarding the old statute facial constitutionality,and accordingly vacate that portion of the district court judgment.as to eagle challenges,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants.
a.the happy landing landfill 
the pertinent facts of this case are not in dispute.khodara environmental,is the general partner of eagle,a limited partnership based in englewood cliffs,new jersey.eagle owns approximately acres in jefferson county,pennsylvania,on which it planned to develop a solid waste disposal facility to be called the happy landing landfill.happy landing was intended to accept municipal waste from primarily producers.the happy landing site is located approximately miles from the county airport.
in,eagle began applying for the necessary landfill permits from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection pdep the pdep initially issued all four of the permits necessary for the construction and operation of happy landing.after obtaining these permits,eagle began by conducting engineering surveys and installing monitoring wells.
in september,however,the pennsylvania fish and boat commission designated three streams near the happy landing site as wild trout streams.based on this designation,the pdep determined that the landfill site contained wetlands of exceptional value and that it consequently should not have issued to eagle the water obstruction and encroachment permit to fill these wetland areas.accordingly,on september,steven beckman,the regional director of the northwest regional office of the pdep,entered an administrative order modifying eagle water obstruction and encroachment permit by revoking its authorization to fill certain wetland areas.the order also suspended the remainder of that permit,as well as all of eagle other permits.eagle appealed the revocation and suspension order to the pennsylvania environmental hearing board.the board denied eagle appeal,and the pennsylvania commonwealth court,in an order filed on february,affirmed.see khodara environmental,department of environmental protection.eagle appeal of the commonwealth court order is currently pending,and construction of happy landing has been suspended until this controversy is resolved.
b.the amendment 
on october,congress enacted the federal aviation re authorization act of,stat.section of the act the amendment was drafted by representatives bud schuster and william pennsylvania districts encompass jefferson county and neighboring was inserted into the act during a conference committee convened to debate an unrelated amendment.the amendment provided 
a landfills section is amended by adding at the end the following 
d landfills for the purpose of enhancing aviation safety,in a case in which landfills have been proposed to be constructed or established within miles of a commercial service airport with fewer than enplanements per year,no person shall construct or establish either landfill if an official of the federal aviation administration has stated in writing within the period ending on the date of the enactment that of the landfills would be incompatible with aircraft operations at the airport,unless the landfill is already active on the such date of enactment or the airport operator agrees to the construction or establishment of the landfill.
b civil penalties section is amended by inserting d after,in each of subsections a a,d,and f a i.
pub,a,stat.eagle proposed landfill fell within the statutory criteria.both happy landing and a second proposed waste disposal facility,the leatherwood landfill were located within six miles of the county airport,a commercial airport with fewer than enplanements per year.moreover,the faa had issued a written determination within the preceding three years that the leatherwood facility would be incompatible with aircraft operations at the airport in fact,as the faa has admitted on appeal,the amendment extremely narrow criteria affected only happy landing,out of all the landfills in the country 
on october,pdep regional director beckman sent a letter to eagle informing it that the amendment impacts the two proposed landfills in jefferson county,eagle environmental happy landing landfill and leatherwood,jefferson landfill.app.the letter went on to explain that all of the permits previously issued for the leatherwood landfill had been suspended in light of the new law.the letter further advised that 
t he department further action regarding reinstatement modification of eagle environmental currently suspended permits will be governed by the same criteria applicable to leatherwood.thus,if eagle seeks reinstatement or modification pursuant to the department september order,eagle environmental should also indicate to the department how it intends to comply with section a of the federal aviation reauthorization act of.
on november,eagle,acting pursuant to the new statutory scheme,formally sought permission from the counties regional airport authority the airport authority to construct and operate the landfill.on november,the authority responded with a letter notifying eagle that it would accept written documentation supporting eagle request for a period of days.the authority also informed eagle that it would accept documentation from other interested parties over the same period and that all the submissions it received would be made public.on december,eagle provided the authority with exhibits in support of its request.at a public meeting held on january,the authority board of directors unanimously denied eagle request.
c.the district court litigation 
on april,eagle filed the present action in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania.eagle first three claims,which involved facial constitutional challenges to the amendment,were asserted against the faa,as well as against barry valentine the acting administrator of the faa and steven beckman the regional director of the pdep in their official capacities count i of the complaint alleged that the amendment worked an unconstitutional delegation of federal authority to the local airport authority count ii attacked the amendment as an unconstitutional bill of attainder and count iii challenged the law on the ground that it violated eagle rights to equal protection and due process under the fifth and fourteenth amendments.count iv of the complaint was directed against the airport authority and its in their individual and official capacities.this count asserted that defendants application of the amendment violated eagle constitutional rights to equal protection,procedural and substantive due process,and freedom from the taking of property without just compensation.finally,count v,which eagle asserted against all defendants,claimed that the amendment did not apply to happy landing as a matter of statutory construction.eagle sought declaratory judgment on all counts,as well as prospective injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages.in addition to the previously mentioned parties,the district court granted jefferson county and pine creek township permission to participate as intervenors in the case.
on may,defendant beckman filed a motion to dismiss the case,arguing that eagle lacked standing and that the case was not ripe.specifically,beckman argued that eagle could not demonstrate any injury arising from the pdep letter of october,because,when the letter was issued,happy landing construction had already been forestalled by the suspension of eagle state permits.on september,the district court denied beckman motion,holding that a ruling on the constitutionality of the amendment would permit eagle to make an informed decision on whether to expend additional effort to pursue its appeal on the state permits.moreover,the court held that the pdep had not foresworn its intention to enforce the amendment should eagle permits be restored in its state court litigation.
eagle subsequently filed a motion for partial summary judgment as to counts i,ii,and iii of its facial constitutional challenges.the faa and the intervenors for summary judgment on the same counts.the airport authority and its board members moved for summary judgment as to counts iv and beckman filed a motion in which he renewed his previous arguments concerning standing and ripeness,and further argued that he was entitled to summary judgment on the basis of eleventh amendment immunity.the intervenors also moved to dismiss on the grounds of mootness and lack of ripeness.
on april,the district court entered its final judgment and order.see khodara environmental,beckman,d.at the outset,the court rejected the jurisdictional defenses raised by beckman and the intervenors and held that the amendment,as a matter of statutory construction,applied to happy landing.turning to eagle constitutional challenges,the court held that the amendment was facially unconstitutional because it violated eagle right to equal protection.although the court found that the government had a legitimate interest in preventing aircraft bird strikes,it found several aspects of the statute so grossly as to render the statutory classification irrational.in particular,the court saw no rational justification for the provisions that limited the ban to cases where exactly two landfills had been proposed restricted the provision to airports with less than annual emplanements covered only commercial,and not commuter,airports and limited the statute to purely retrospective effect.in short,the court found it irrational to single out the leatherwood and happy landing landfills for regulation,while permitting the operation of other similarly situated landfills across the country.because it held the amendment unconstitutional on equal protection grounds,the court did not find it necessary to address eagle bill of attainder or challenges.finally,the court granted summary judgment in favor of the airport authority and its directors with respect to eagle as applied constitutional claims count iv.
the faa and beckman appealed the court determination that the amendment was facially unconstitutional.eagle the grant of summary judgment in favor of the airport authority defendants on count iv.
d.the amendment 
this court took up the appeals and heard oral argument.after oral argument,but before we had issued a judgment,congress enacted legislation substantially modifying the amendment.on april,the president signed into law the wendell ford aviation investment and reform act for the century,pub,stat.section of the act the amendment amended s d to read as follows 
d limitation on construction of landfills.
in person shall construct or establish a municipal solid waste landfill as defined in section of title,code of federal regulations,as in effect on the date of the enactment of this subsection that receives putrescible waste as defined in section of such title within miles of a public airport that has received grants under chapter and is primarily served by general aviation aircraft and regularly scheduled flights of aircraft designed for passengers or less unless the state aviation agency of the state in which the airport is located requests that the administrator of the federal aviation administration exempt the landfill from the application of this subsection and the administrator determines that such exemption would have no adverse impact on aviation safety.
limitation on shall not apply in the state of alaska and shall not apply to the construction,establishment,expansion,or modification of,or to any other activity undertaken with respect to,a municipal solid waste landfill if the construction or establishment of the landfill was commenced on or before the date of the enactment of this subsection.
pub,s,stat.
the amendment significantly broadened the scope of the statute,thus resolving many of the district court equal protection concerns.unlike the challenged law,the new statutory scheme does not work to single out the happy landing site for exceptional treatment.in essence,the amended statute creates a purely prospective safety zone around all airports with regularly scheduled flights of passengers or less.the amended statute also alleviates the and concerns raised by the old law.before the district court,eagle argued that the amendment grant of exemption power to local airport authorities violated article i requirement of unitary executive power.the amended statute,in contrast,grants no statutory power to local authorities.rather,the final power to make exceptions is granted to the administrator of the faa,who is an agent of the federal executive.
in light of the amendment,the faa has filed a motion pursuant to local appellate rule to vacate the district court judgment as moot and remand.
we turn first to the faa claim of mootness.article iii of the constitution grants the federal courts the power to adjudicate only actual,ongoing cases or controversies.this requirement subsists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings,trial and appellate.lewis continental bank,d see also bancorp mortgage bonner mall partnership,d ivy club edwards,cir.our mootness determination therefore turns on whether there remains,in light of congress action,a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of conclusive character.new rock asset partners,preferred entity advancements,cir quoting national iranian oil mapco int l,cir.
we agree that the passage of the amendment has mooted eagle facial constitutional challenges to the amendment.under the circumstances present here,we must review the judgment of the district court in light of the the law as it now stands,not as it stood when the judgment below was entered.diffenderfer central baptist church,d see also princeton schmid,d per curiam naturist soc y,fillyaw,cir black united fund of new jersey,kean,cir.black united fund is instructive.in that case,the plaintiff charity challenged a new jersey statute permitting the united not other charitable deduct voluntary contributions from the salaries of government workers.the district court found the statute unconstitutionally discriminatory and enjoined its operation.pending appeal,the state repealed the challenged law and replaced it with a new statute that permitted voluntary payroll deductions for other charities that met specified criteria.we held that the statutory amendment mooted plaintiff claims 
we conclude,therefore,that the repeal of the statute and the enactment of new legislation make it inappropriate for us to affirm the district court order based on alleged deficiencies in the old act.the raison for the injunction no longer exists.
black united fund,at.moreover,we found that the new legislation had substantially resolved the constitutional questions raised by the predecessor law 
w e note that the new act has enlarged the group of charitable organizations which may have access to state facilities and establishes criteria which govern eligibility.the legislation thus meets at least two of the objections cited by the district exclusivity granted the united way and the lack of standards for determining which other groups may participate to that extent,the new act will give plaintiff substantially the relief it sought in the district court.
similar concerns inform our mootness decision here.the scope of the amendment is substantially broader than that of the challenged law.the restrictive criteria and purely retrospective nature of the old the district court found irrationally limited its application only to the happy landing and leatherwood landfills.the new provision,however,applies prospectively to a wide variety of landfills.accordingly,we believe that the amendment is far less susceptible to attack on equal protection or grounds.moreover,the new law places the power to make exemptions in the hands of the faa rather than the local airport authority,thereby assuaging eagle unitary executive concerns.
simply put,a declaration of unconstitutionality or injunction directed against the objectionable features of the amendment would serve no purpose today.where a law is amended so as to remove its challenged features,the claim becomes moot as to those features.naturist soc y,at see also,city of dallas,d.
nor do eagle facial challenges fall within any recognized exception to the mootness doctrine.in city of mesquite aladdin castle,d,the supreme court held that a defendant voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.such cases may fall within the mootness exception of injuries that are capable of repetition,yet evading review.southern pacific terminal icc.we do not believe that this circumstance is present here,however.as the fourth circuit has recently noted,statutory changes that discontinue a challenged practice are usually enough to render a case moot,even if the legislature possesses the power to reenact the statute after the lawsuit is dismissed.valero terrestrial paige,cir quoting native village of noatak blatchford,cir see also national black police ass district of columbia,the mere power to reenact a challenged law is not a sufficient basis on which a court can conclude that a reasonable expectation of recurrence exists.in this case,w e have no grounds for suspecting that congress would attempt to reenact the prior law.thomas fiedler,cir.accordingly,we hold that counts i,ii and iii of eagle facial attacks on the constitutionality of the moot in light of that law repeal and replacement by the amendment.
we next address whether the district court holding that the amendment was facially unconstitutional is subject to vacatur.pursuant to,we have the power to vacate the judgment of a district court on appeal.in arguing for vacatur,the faa cites cases following united states munsingwear,which held that t he established practice in dealing with a civil case from a court in the federal system which has become moot while on its way here or pending our decision on the merits is to reverse or vacate the judgment below and remand with a direction to dismiss.
the supreme court,however,has explained that munsingwear does not set forth a categorical rule.in bancorp mortgage bonner mall partnership,d,the court clarified that vacatur is an equitable remedy rather than an automatic right.see,national black police,at humphreys drug enforcement administration,cir munsingwear should not be applied blindly,but only after a consideration of the equities and the underlying reasons for mootness.in particular,bancorp emphasized that when mootness results from the voluntary action of the party seeking relief from the judgment below,vacatur should not be granted unless doing so would serve the public interest.see bancorp,at.in such cases,the court explained,the public interest in a robust corpus of judicial precedent normally outweighs the party interest in relief from the judgment,the losing party having voluntarily forfeited his legal remedy by the ordinary processes of appeal or certiorari,thereby surrendering his claim to the equitable remedy of vacatur.id.at.thus,absent unusual circumstances,the appellate vacatur decision under bancorp is informed almost entirely,if not entirely,by the twin considerations of fault and public interest.valero terrestrial,at.
bancorp refused vacatur in a case in which the losing party below mooted the action by settling pending appeal.today,we must decide whether this same presumption against vacatur is appropriate when a governmental appeal is mooted by legislative amendment.the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit recently addressed this same question,and we find its reasoning persuasive 
clearly,the passage of new legislation represents voluntary action,and thus on its face the bancorp presumption might seem to govern.we believe,however,that application of the bancorp presumption in this context is not required by the bancorp opinion rationale and would be inappropriate,at least if there is no evidence indicating that the legislation was enacted in order to overturn an unfavorable precedent.the rationale underlying the bancorp presumption is that litigants should not be able to manipulate the judicial system by roll ing the dice in the district court and then wash ing away any unfavorable outcome through use of settlement and vacatur.the mere fact that a legislature has enacted legislation that moots an appeal,without more,provides no grounds for assuming that the legislature was motivated by such a manipulative purpose.the legislature may act out of reasons totally independent of the pending lawsuit,or because the lawsuit has convinced it that the existing law is flawed.
national black police,at see also valero terrestrial,at bancorp counsels vacatur where challenge is rendered moot by state amendment of challenged statute.
eagle nevertheless argues that the record in this case militates against vacatur,because the faa is a knowing beneficiary of a legislative change backed by an illegitimate,to frustrate an unfavorable judgment.we can not agree.mindful of the fact that legislative actions are presumptively legitimate,we are wary of impugning the motivations that underlie a legislature actions.national black police,at.eagle claim of persistent misuse of the legislative process rings hollow.there is no suggestion that congress failed to follow constitutionally prescribed procedures in passing the amendment.and,although eagle argues that congress actions represent an attempt to frustrate an adverse judgment,the new legislation could just as credibly be viewed as a commendable effort to repair what may have been a constitutionally defective statute.american library ass barr.in short,eagle has presented no evidence to indicate that the amendment represents manipulation of the legislative process rather than responsible lawmaking.id.
accordingly,we believe that equity would best be served by vacating the district court judgment as to the facial unconstitutionality of the amendment 
eagle constitutional claims against the airport authority and its directors,however,require a different analysis.pursuant to the amendment,eagle requested that the authority approve construction and operation of happy landing.count iv of eagle complaint alleged that the authority and its directors,in denying that request,violated eagle rights to procedural and substantive due process,equal protection,and freedom from taking without just compensation.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on these claims,and on appeal,eagle contests that district court decision with respect to the procedural and substantive due process claims.
we do not believe that the passage of the amendment has mooted these claims.unlike eagle facial constitutional challenges,which sought only prospective declaratory and injunctive relief the due process claims set out in count iv sought damages against the authority and its members.a case is saved from mootness if a viable claim for damages exists.national iranian,at.in phillips borough of keyport,cir en banc,we held that the substitution of a new,less restrictive adult bookstore ordinance for the previous,more restrictive one did not moot plaintiffs damages claim arising out of the application of the prior ordinance.similarly,in ransom marrazzo,cir,where plaintiffs challenged municipal sewer and water service regulations,we held 
the plaintiffs further attempt to avoid the mooting of their procedural due process claims by asserting that the publication of new regulations,even if they now satisfy the due process notice requirements,does not answer their claim of damages due to a deprivation of notice prior to their publication and resulting from the imperfection of liens.the plaintiffs are correct in their contention that the issuance of the new regulations does not moot this damage claim based on the alleged constitutional notice defect prior to their publication.
