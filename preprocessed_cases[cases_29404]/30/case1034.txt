this litigation is about the environmental protection agency registration of pesticide active ingredients that the plaintiff environmental coalitions fear may harm endangered or threatened salmon and steelhead in the waters of the pacific northwest.the plaintiffs,washington toxics coalition et,wtc,contend that epa violated the endangered species act,a,by failing to consult with the national marine fisheries service before approving the pesticides.
epa admittedly did not do any such consultation,and it agrees that the endangered species act requires consultation with the national marine fisheries service for action affecting these endangered or threatened fish.epa contends,however,that because in registering the pesticides,it complied with the requirements of the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act fifra,et,it was not bound by the consultation requirements of the endangered species act esa.epa therefore appeals the district court orders requiring epa to engage in consultation and suspending epa authorization of the pesticides pending the consultation.
plaintiffs washington toxics coalition and northwest coalition for alternatives to pesticides are organizations that promote alternatives to toxic pesticides and seek to protect the environment from the harmful effects of pesticides.plaintiff pacific coast federation of fishermen associations,is an organization of commercial fishermen that works to ensure the survival of commercial fishing as a way of life.plaintiff institute for fisheries resources is a public interest marine resources protection and conservation organization.
a number of parties intervened in the action on the side of defendant epa.the are croplife america cla,washington state farm bureau,and other groups representing pesticide manufacturers,formulators,distributors,sellers,and applicators.the intervenors contend that the case is governed by the principles of judicial review and injunctive standards of the administrative procedure act apa,et,rather than by the esa.according to the intervenors,the district court lacked jurisdiction to examine the effect of pesticides apart from reviewing the administrative record pursuant to a cause of action established by the apa.intervenors so contend despite the provision of the esa creating individual causes of action to challenge its violations.see g.the intervenors also contend that the injunctive relief granted by the district court was excessive.they challenge various aspects of the district court injunctive orders requiring buffer zones around endangered salmon and steelhead habitat.
the district court granted the plaintiffs requests for injunctive relief in a series of orders,after allowing all parties,including the intervenors,to introduce evidence on the effects of the use of the challenged pesticides.although the complaint originally disputed registration of hundreds of pesticides,the district court held epa violated the esa consultation requirement with respect to only pesticide active ingredients.the district court ordered epa to initiate and complete consultation regarding the effects of those pesticide registrations on threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead according to a schedule set out in the opinion.because it viewed the procedural violation of the esa to have been a substantial violation authorizing extraordinary relief,the district court also enjoined epa authorization of any use of the pesticides within proscribed distances of waters in california,oregon,and washington,pending epa fulfillment of its consultation obligations.
we affirm the district court orders in their entirety.
factual and procedural background 
the national marine fisheries service nmfs since has classified approximately species of salmon and steelheads,collectively known as salmonids,as endangered or threatened throughout the pacific northwest.the nmfs has determined that pesticides may kill or injure salmonids,and may affect future salmonid behavior and reproductive success.see.the district court found that scientific or competent declaratory evidence in the record demonstrated a causal link between the pesticide active ingredients at issue in this case and direct or indirect adverse effects on salmonid populations.this is not disputed on appeal.
what is disputed is the applicability of esa section a 
each agency shall,in consultation with and with the assistance of the secretary,insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species 
a.plaintiff wtc claims that epa violated this section when epa failed to consult with the applicable agency,the nmfs,about the registration of pesticide active ingredients potentially harmful to endangered or threatened salmonids.epa maintains that it is not bound by the provision.
wtc filed this suit in under an esa provision known as the esa citizen suit provision and frequently used to compel agency action.it allows individuals to bring suit to enjoin any person,including the united states and any other governmental instrumentality or agency who is alleged to be in violation of any provision of this chapter or regulation issued under authority thereof.g.see bennett spear,d envtl.prot.info.ctr.simpson timber,cir.wtc complaint alleges that epa is violating a of the esa,a,and its implementing regulations,part,by failing to consult with nmfs regarding the effects of pesticide use under epa pesticide registrations that may affect endangered and threatened salmon and steelhead their critical habitat.
epa regulates pesticides under fifra,et.we have observed that fifra sets forth a comprehensive regulatory scheme for controlling the use,sale,and labeling of pesticides.nathan kimmel,dowelanco,cir.it bars any person in any state from distributing a pesticide epa has not registered or exempted pursuant to fifra.a.fifra establishes the procedures through which epa registers pesticides,labels pesticides,and cancels the registration of pesticides.see.epa took the position that only fifra,and not the esa,governs the rescission of pesticide registrations.
both sides moved for summary judgment.the parties submitted voluminous filings on the effect of the various pesticides on endangered or threatened salmonids.the district court ruled that wtc had standing only to challenge the pesticides for which it offered competent declaratory evidence demonstrating a causal link between epa registration and harm to salmonid.that ruling is not at issue before us.
the district court also ruled that epa was required to comply with the esa,as well as with fifra.the district court rejected epa contention that wtc could challenge only epa compliance with the pesticide registration provisions of fifra.the district court thus concluded that the esa applies to agency actions taken pursuant to fifra,and that where endangered species may be affected,wtc could maintain a challenge to epa failure to consult under the esa.
the district court held that as a matter of law,epa violated section a with respect to the disputed pesticide active ingredients.section a consultation requirements apply to each federal agency and to any action authorized,funded,or carried out by that agency.a.the district court held that this comprehensive language includes epa,and that epa,having provided no evidence of formal or informal consultation as required by section a,violated the esa.the district court ordered epa to initiate and complete section a consultation according to a prescribed schedule.
the district court also rejected the intervenors arguments that the case could arise only under the apa.the intervenors argued that the proceeding contravened apa standards because the district court conducted its review outside an administrative record,without identifying any final agency actions or inactions under review,and without applying the apa deferential standard of judicial review.the district court held that because the esa independently authorized a right of action,the apa was inapplicable.see g.
