wilderness watch,sierra club north star chapter,and northeastern minnesotans for wilderness collectively wilderness watch brought suit against abigail kimbell,chief of the united states forest service,and ed schafer,secretary of the united states department of agriculture collectively forest service,alleging that the forest service decision to construct a certain snowmobile trail between mcfarland lake and south fowl lake in northeastern minnesota violated the boundary waters canoe area wilderness bwcaw act.wilderness watch based its challenge on congress inclusion of south fowl lake and of north fowl lake,to which it is connected in the wilderness under the bwcaw act.according to wilderness watch,the bwcaw act prohibits snowmobiling on the fowl lakes count i and requires the forest service to implement motorboat quotas on them count ii.
the district court granted summary judgment to the forest service on counts i and ii,finding that the north and south fowl lakes are not wilderness under the bwcaw act and therefore are not subject to snowmobiling and motorboat restrictions.but the district court also found that the environmental assessment ea prepared by the forest service for the plan to construct the snowmobile trail connecting the fowl lakes adjacent to the bwcaw failed to properly analyze the noise impact resulting from snowmobile use on the trail,as required by the national environmental policy act nepa.as a result,the district court remanded to the forest service,instructing it to prepare an environmental impact statement eis assessing the sound impact of the proposed trail routes on the adjoining wilderness area,and also enjoined the forest service from conducting any further activity on the proposed trail pending its completion of the eis.wilderness watch appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment to the forest service on counts i and ii,and cook county,a political subdivision of the state of minnesota,conservationists with common sense,and arrowhead coalition for multiple use collectively intervenors appeal from the district court nepa ruling.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
background 
the wilderness act of,governs the process by which the president recommends,and congress designates,wilderness areas and establishes requirements for the management of such areas.section of the act requires congress to approve the creation of a wilderness area or the modification of a wilderness boundary.c,e.the bwcaw superior national forest,minnesota,was among the initial wilderness areas designated in the act.
in,congress enacted the bwcaw act 
to provide for the protection,enhancement,and preservation of the natural values of the lakes,waterways,and associated forested areas known as the boundary waters canoe area,and for the orderly management of public use and enjoyment of that area as wilderness,and of certain contiguous lands and waters,while at the same time protecting the special qualities of the area as a natural wilderness ecosystem of major esthetic,cultural,scientific,recreational and educational value to the nation.
section of the bwcaw act,entitled boundary waters canoe area wilderness designation and map states as follows 
the areas generally depicted as wilderness on the map entitled boundary waters canoe area wilderness and boundary waters canoe area mining protection area dated september comprising approximately one million and thousand five hundred acres,are hereby designated as the boundary waters canoe area wilderness hereinafter referred to as the wilderness.such designation shall supersede the designation of the boundary waters canoe area under section a of the wilderness act stat.and such map shall supersede the map on file pursuant to such section.the map of the wilderness shall be on file and available for public inspection in the offices of the supervisor of the superior national forest and of the chief,united states forest service.the secretary of agriculture,hereinafter referred to as the secretary,shall,as soon as practicable but in no event later than one year after the date of enactment of this act,publish a detailed legal description and map showing the boundaries of the wilderness in the federal register.such map and description shall be filed with the committee on interior and insular affairs of the house of representatives and the committee on energy and natural resources of the united states senate.such map and description shall have the same force and effect as if included in this act.correction of clerical and typographical errors in such legal description and map may be made.
emphasis added.accordingly,establishes the boundaries of the wilderness by reference to the map congress had before it and directs the secretary to publish a legal description and more practical map in the federal register.ass of prop.owners united states.it also authorizes the secretary to make clerical and typographical corrections with regard to any errors in the description and the map.id.section does not delegate any authority to the secretary it merely directs the secretary to publish a map of the boundaries already established by reference in the act.congress has determined the boundaries the secretary only duty outlined in is to publish the map of boundaries.id.at.section states that congress had reference to a map of september,the act was enacted the act denominates the areas on that map as the boundary waters canoe area wilderness.id.at.
section of the bwcaw act sets forth guidelines for the act implementation,providing,in relevant part 
a the secretary shall administer the wilderness under the provisions of this act,the act of january,stat note,the wilderness act of stat,and in accordance with other laws,rules and regulations generally applicable to areas designated as wilderness.
c effective on january,the use of motorboats is prohibited within the wilderness designated by this act,and that portion within the wilderness of all lakes which are partly within the wilderness,except for the following 
on the following lakes and river,motorboats with motors no greater than ten horsepower shall be permitted clearwater,cook county north fowl,cook county south fowl,cook county island river east of lake isabella,lake county sea gull,that portion generally east of threemile island,cook county alder,cook county canoe,cook county.
e for the purposes of this act,a snowmobile is defined as any motorized vehicle which is designed to operate on snow or ice.the use of snowmobiles in the wilderness designated by this act is not permitted except that the secretary may permit snowmobiles,not exceeding forty inches in width,on the overland portages from crane lake to little vermilion lake in canada,from sea gull river along the eastern portion of saganaga lake to canada,and on the following routes until january,
vermilion lake portage to and including trout lake moose lake to and including saganaga lake via ensign,vera and knife lakes,east bearskin lake to and including pine lake via alder lake and canoe lake.
f the secretary is directed to develop and implement,as soon as practical,entry point quotas for use of motorboats within the wilderness portions of the lakes listed in subsection c,the quota levels to be based on such criteria as the size and configuration of each lake,and the amount of use on that lake provided,that the quota established for any one year shall not exceed the average actual annual motorboat use of the calendar years,and for each lake,and shall take into account the fluctuation in use during different times of the year provided further,that on each lake homeowners and their guests and resort owners and their guests on that particular lake shall have access to that particular lake and their entry shall not be counted in determining such use.
emphasis added.
on october,the forest service prepared the legal description and map as required by of the bwcaw act.on february,the forest service published in the federal register a notice of the availability of the legal description and map.on april,the forest service published the legal description of the wilderness boundaries and a map of the wilderness in sheets in the federal register.the legend on the map of the wilderness indicates that the bwcaw boundary is designated by black dots on top of a dark black line.on sheet of the map,the north and south fowl lakes are located to the right of the boundary falling outside of the bwcaw are shaded in orange to indicate that they are subject to a horsepower limit.
the proposed south fowl snowmobile trail south fowl trail is at the center of this litigation.in,the forest service identified an unlawful snowmobile in the superior national forest,which connected mcfarland lake in the west to south fowl lake.south fowl lake,along with north fowl lake,is the easternmost lake in a chain of lakes along the border between northeast minnesota and canada.the forest service closed tilbury trail because it encroached on royal lake and royal river,located within the bwcaw along the northern edge of the trail.following the trail closure,the only available snowmobile access route to south fowl lake was cook county road,which required snowmobiles to share a steep and potentially dangerous road with cars and trucks.seeking to develop a safe alternative route that would provide public snowmobile access to south fowl lake,the forest service proposed construction of south fowl trail,connecting mcfarland lake to south fowl lake along the same general route as tilbury trail.
thereafter,the forest service began public discussions and field research on the proposed trail,culminating in a draft proposal for south fowl trail that identified several alternative snowmobile routes.in november,the forest service released an ea for the proposed south fowl trail.the ea identified four potential trail routes between mcfarland lake and south fowl lake.the second alternative trail route was the northernmost route of the proposed trails it would involve the construction of miles of new snowmobile trail,a segment of which would ascend to a bench along a steep ridge that is immediately adjacent to the bwcaw and that overlooks both royal river and royal lake.
the ea considered the potential impact of each of the proposed alternatives on the surrounding area relevant to this appeal,the ea considered the potential visual and sound impact resulting from each proposed trail.the ea found that the sound of snowmobile traffic from the second alternative route would carry directly into the adjoining wilderness and that intervening deciduous trees would do little to reduce the sound.while noting that sound measurements could be calculated at various locations within the wilderness,the ea stated that such detailed data appears to be moot.thus,because wilderness visitors would consider any sight or sound from snowmobiles to be negative,the ea dispensed with any quantitative measurements of the sound impact in the wilderness.
based on the analysis set forth in the ea,the forest service issued a decision notice dn and finding of no significant impact fonsi on february,approving the selection of the second alternative trail for the south fowl trail.the forest service determined that a more complete analysis of the environmental effects in an eis was unnecessary.the forest service concluded that construction of the south fowl trail along the second alternative route was not a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment under nepa.c.regarding sound impact,the fonsi stated that the decibel level of a snowmobile in the adjoining wilderness,at a distance of to feet from the proposed route,would be approximately decibels.the fonsi concluded that this decibel level was not significant.
various environmental groups appealed the.on may,a forest service appeal reviewing officer recommended affirmance of the selection of the second alternative trail as set forth in the.the forest supervisor subsequently adopted the recommendation.
wilderness watch filed suit against the forest service,alleging,inter alia that the forest service had allowed snowmobiles on south fowl lake in violation of the bwcaw act count i that the forest service has failed to implement motorboat quotas on north and south fowl lakes in violation of f of the bwcaw act count ii and that the forest service violated nepa by failing to prepare an eis for the proposed trail count v the forest service did not dispute that,since the enactment of the bwcaw act in,it had never refused to allow snowmobiles to use the fowl lakes or developed motorboat quotas for the fowl lakes.the intervenors joined the litigation and opposed wilderness watch claims.wilderness watch,the forest service,and the intervenors filed for summary judgment on each of wilderness watch claims.
because resolution of wilderness watch claims turned,in part,on whether the fowl lakes were designated as wilderness area under the bwcaw act,the district court issued a memorandum opinion resolving this threshold issue.the district court found that the fowl lakes were not located within the wilderness area prescribed under the bwcaw.in a subsequent opinion,the district court,inter alia,granted the forest services motion for summary judgment on counts i and ii of the complaint but denied the motion as to count v.the district court held that the forest service decisions to construct a snowmobile trail connecting lakes adjacent to the bwcaw and not to set motorboat quotas on the fowl lakes were not arbitrary and capricious under the wilderness act and the bwcaw act.but the district court found that the ea prepared by the forest service for the plan to construct the snowmobile trail connecting the fowl lakes adjacent to the bwcaw failed to properly analyze the noise impact resulting from snowmobile use on the trail,as required under nepa.according to the court,the ea provided no quantitative evidence or analysis of decibel levels to be projected by the trail into the adjoining wilderness.finding the decision to issue a fonsi arbitrary and capricious,the district court remanded the matter to the forest service,ordering it to promptly prepare an eis to evaluate more thoroughly the sound impact in the bwcaw,and to suspend further activity on the south fowl trail pending completion of the eis.
ii.discussion 
both wilderness watch and the intervenors appeal from the district court judgment.first,wilderness watch argues that the district court erroneously granted the forest service summary judgment on wilderness watch claims that the forest service must administer the north and south fowl lakes as wilderness by implementing motorboat quotas for them and enforcing the snowmobile ban on them.according to wilderness watch,the only plausible reading of of the bwcaw act is that congress specifically included these lakes in the bwcaw and intended the restrictions specified in to apply to those lakes.
in response,the forest service and the intervenors argue that wilderness watch claims in counts i and ii of the complaint are barred by the statute of limitations in a because all of the harms of which wilderness watch complains are the result of congress exclusion of the fowl lakes from the bwcaw.this exclusion was evident no later than april,when the forest service published the maps and legal description showing the boundaries of the bwcaw in the federal register.furthermore,the forest service and intervenors point out that the forest service has never enforced a ban on snowmobiles on the fowl lakes,nor has it ever set motorboat quotas for these lakes.as a result,because the forest service determination of the boundaries of the bwcaw and its treatment of the fowl lakes have been public knowledge for years,wilderness watch failure to bring suit in a timely manner means that this court must dismiss such claims.as to the merits,the forest service and the intervenors assert that the map that congress provided to the forest service when it passed the bwcaw act plainly shows that the fowl lakes are outside of the bwcaw.the congressional map shows the fowl lakes as being subject only to the horsepower restrictions mentioned in c of the act,and the forest service has consistently enforced those restrictions.
second,as to wilderness watch claim that the forest service violated nepa,the intervenors argue that the district court erroneously found that the issuance of a fonsi and the failure to complete an eis were arbitrary and capricious regarding the consideration of the potential sound impact from the fowl lake project.
in response,the forest service and wilderness watch contend that this court lacks jurisdiction over the intervenors challenging the district court nepa ruling because only a federal agency can pursue an appeal of an order remanding a matter to an agency.
statute of limitations 
before we can reach the merits of wilderness watch claims,we must first determine whether such claims are barred by the statute of limitations.
because neither the wilderness act nor the bwcaw act create a private right of action,wilderness watch brought its claims under the administrative procedure act apa.the statute of limitations set forth in a therefore applies.see sierra club army corps of eng rs,cir neither the stafford act,nepa,nor the statutes governing the corps expressly provide for judicial review of the agency actions at issue.therefore,jurisdiction is limited to judicial review under the apa,which provides for review of final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.quoting jersey heights neighborhood ass glendening,cir stating that because the apa does not include its own statute of limitations,the general statute of limitations set forth in a applies.
section a of is a general statute of limitations for suits against the government,which provides that every civil action commenced against the united states shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.a claim against the united states first accrues on the date when all the events have occurred which fix the liability of the government and entitle the claimant to institute an action.chandler air force,cir quoting kinsey united states,see also victor foods,crossroads econ.dev.of charles county,cir per curiam a cause of action accrues when there are facts enabling one party to maintain an action against another.thus,a plaintiff claim accrues for purposes of a when the plaintiff either knew,or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known,that he or she had a claim.loudner united states,cir see also glickman,cir this court has held that a right first accrues when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury complained of.
in the present case,the district court rejected the forest service defense,stating that wilderness watch claim was not by the statute of limitations in a to the extent wilderness watch argue s that the usfs failure to implement motorboat quotas is a continuing violation.under the theory,each overt act that is part of the violation and that injures the plaintiff starts the statutory period running again,regardless of the plaintiff knowledge of the alleged illegality at much earlier times.midwestern mach.northwest airlines,cir internal quotations,alterations,and citations omitted.a cts that are merely unabated inertial consequences of a single act do not restart the statute of limitations.id.at internal quotations and citations omitted.thus,to apply the continuing violation theory,new overt acts must be more than the unabated inertial consequences of the initial violation.id.
we have not addressed application of a in relation to a continuing violation theory.the sixth circuit has done so and rejected the application of the continuing violation theory in a similar case,at.in,property owners holding certain riparian rights to the use of a lake located in a national forest sought a declaration that the lake was not part of the federal wilderness area and therefore was not within the regulatory authority of the forest service.id.at.congress had enacted the michigan wilderness act mwa in,thereby creating the wilderness area.id.this area fell under the authority of the forest service,which began the process of amending the management plan to include regulation of the wilderness area.id.on april,the forest service announced an amendment to the management plan,which dramatically restricted certain activities on the portion of the lake lying within the wilderness area.id.thereafter,in,the forest service adopted another amendment,imposing more restrictions on the portion of the lake lying within the wilderness area.id.in may,the property owners filed suit,seeking a declaration that the lake was not part of the wilderness area.id.at.the district court determined that the property owners claim first accrued when the mwa was passed,as congress specifically designated a certain area,as referenced on a map,as the wilderness area.id.the map included about of the lake at issue.id.ultimately,the district court decided that the latest possible accrual date was april,when the first amendment was issued.id.
on appeal,in an apparent attempt to avoid a problem with the statute of limitations,the property owners argued that the lake was not part of the wilderness and that the forest service failed to complete the official map and legal description of the wilderness area as required by the mwa.id.at.the property owners maintained that the cause of action contesting the inclusion of the lake within the wilderness area did not accrue until the spring of,when they learned that the forest service had not yet issued the official map of the wilderness,as required by the mwa.id.at.according to the property owners,they could not have been on notice that the lake was part of the wilderness because the official map,which would provide them with that information,had yet to be published.id.the court rejected this argument,finding that the property owners fail ed to make any meaningful connection between the forest service failure to file a map,and the lake inclusion in the wilderness area,as the mwa did not predicate the existence of the wilderness area on the promulgation of a map.rather,it impose d a duty to complete a map as soon as practicable.id.
the court agreed with the district court that the latest possible accrual date was april,when the amendment was issued,stating,this amendment was issued under the standard procedure,including public notice and a public comment period.accordingly,the plaintiffs were on notice that the federal government claimed jurisdiction over the lake at the time the forest service issued amendment.id.because the property owners did not file their complaint for declaratory relief until may,the court held that the action was by the statute of limitations set forth in a.furthermore,the court concluded that e ven if the accrual date might somehow be tied to the issuance of the map,the property owners claim was still because they 
were clearly aware of the forest service promulgation of amendment,and of the forest service intention to exercise dominion over the lake by promulgating that amendment.the plaintiffs were likewise on notice,through the mwa and the public notice and comment period,that a map was to be filed and that the forest service intended to include the lake in any officially issued version of the wilderness area map.
other circuits have also declined to apply the continuing violation analysis in similar contexts.see,preminger sec y of veterans affairs,holding that statute of limitations on county political party chairman suit against secretary of veterans affairs,which alleged that regulation prohibiting demonstrations by visitors to department of veterans affairs va property was unconstitutional,accrued at time of final agency action,which was at the time the regulation was last amended notwithstanding contention that va failure to engage in notice and comment rulemaking was continual,the regulation was in full force and effect and was operative at time of amendment,thus commencing statute of limitations ctr.for biological diversity hamilton,cir holding that the failure of the secretary of the department of the interior to perform the nondiscretionary duty to designate a critical habitat for a threatened species,as required by the endangered species act,was not a continuing violation that permitted extension of the applica
