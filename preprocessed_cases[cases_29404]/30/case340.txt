plaintiffs franks,cofield,and the easton acres residents association the plaintiffs appeal from the district court october decision dismissing their complaint.the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief against the wake county board of commissioners and wake county collectively,wake county or the county,as well as from officials of the north carolina department of environment and natural resources the denr defendants,to halt the construction of a landfill in holly springs,north carolina.the complaint alleged that the actions of wake county and the denr defendants in connection with the landfill violated title vi of the civil rights act of,title viii of the civil rights act of,and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.in addition,the plaintiffs asserted a public policy challenge against the county,pursuant to.the state claim.
the district court dismissed as untimely the plaintiffs title vi,and equal protection claims against wake county.the court also dismissed the state claim and the title viii challenge for failure to state claims upon which relief could be granted.finally,the court relied on eleventh amendment sovereign immunity to dismiss the plaintiffs claims against the denr defendants.in disposing of the case,the court also denied the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint for a second time.franks ross,order,the dismissal order.as explained below,we affirm the court dismissal of the state claim against wake county.however,we reverse its dismissal of the title vi,and equal protection claims against the county further,we conclude the court erred in refusing to authorize an amendment of the complaint and in determining that the denr defendants are entitled to immunity.
this proceeding arises from the efforts of wake county to construct and operate a landfill in holly springs,north carolina.these efforts have followed a tortured path,and they implicate issues of racial discrimination,conflicts of interest,administrative procedure,and the timeliness and ripeness of claims.
the small town of holly springs is home to the largest percentage of of any municipality in wake county despite having less than two percent of the county population,this community has long borne a disproportionate share of wake county landfills.in,wake county sited a solid waste landfill in feltonsville,a neighborhood adjoining holly springs.this landfill the feltonsville landfill operated for over twenty years.holly springs itself is presently home to three other landfills.
in the early,wake county decided to pursue the creation of a new landfill in holly springs,designated as the south wake landfill.in february,the denr issued the county a permit authorizing construction of the south wake landfill the south wake permit or the permit.the plaintiffs promptly challenged the issuance of the permit in state administrative proceedings.thereafter,in december,they instituted this proceeding in the eastern district of north carolina,seeking injunctive relief against the county and the denr to halt construction of the south wake landfill.when their claims were dismissed,the plaintiffs filed this appeal.in our review of the dismissal,we are obliged to accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint those facts are further reviewed in relevant part below.
the plaintiffs allege that wake county has long engaged in a pattern of intentional discrimination in the siting of undesirable landfills near predominantly communities.they also assert that the denr,by approving and permitting sites for landfills near black neighborhoods and communities,has engaged in a similar pattern of discrimination.the denr has permitted at least four other landfills in and around holly springs,near areas primarily occupied by minorities,the feltonsville landfill,the industries landfill,the cary landfill,and the holly springs landfill.
the siting and permitting of the landfill at issue here began in october,when the wake county board of commissioners decided to purchase additional property in order to expand the feltonsville landfill.one of the commissioners,a adcock,voted in favor of the land purchase,despite the fact that he owned acres of the land involved.on september,the holly springs board of commissioners adopted a resolution granting permission to the county to expand the feltonsville landfill.once the county received that permission,it sought approval from the denr.prior to securing the denr approval,however,new state and federal environmental regulations came into effect.these regulations required all unlined landfills,such as the feltonsville landfill,to close by january.upon learning that the feltonsville landfill would be forced to close,the county altered its proposed landfill project,abandoning the expansion plan for the feltonsville landfill in favor of the construction of an entirely new landfill.in december,it submitted a site application plan to the denr for the construction of the south wake landfill.if completed,the south wake landfill will spread across acres,at a height of feet.
on march,in the course of acquiring property on which to build the south wake landfill,the county condemned the acre tract of land owned by commissioner adcock.on march,the denr issued,pursuant to its regulations,a site suitability letter for the landfill.this letter notified the county that the site was considered appropriate,and it authorized the county to apply to the denr for a permit to construct the south wake landfill.on december,wake county submitted to the denr its application for a permit.
the plaintiffs assert that the defendants pursued every route possible in order to prevent the plaintiffs from receiving adequate notice and participating in discussions regarding the landfill at a meaningful point in the process.indeed,there was no public participation in the process until may,when the denr,before ruling on the county permit application,conducted a public hearing on the proposed south wake landfill.three days after the hearing,the holly springs board of commissioners revoked its october resolution authorizing the county to expand the feltonsville landfill thereafter,in september,the denr inquired of the county whether its construction of the south wake landfill would disparately impact minority communities.the county responded that there would be no such disparate impact.on february,the denr issued the south wake permit,authorizing the county to construct the south wake landfill.
the plaintiffs challenges to the construction of the south wake landfill have travelled a complicated path they are ongoing both in this court and in the court of appeals of north carolina.in march,plaintiff franks filed a contested case petition with north carolina office of administrative hearings,seeking both to set aside the denr issuance of the south wake permit and to enjoin wake county from taking any action with regard to the south wake landfill an administrative law judge the alj,ruling on a summary judgment motion,concluded that wake county had violated north carolina law in the permitting process by,inter alia,failing to procure holly springs permission to construct the new landfill and failing to comply with the mandate of.c.this statutory provision requires that a county board of commissioners,prior to selecting a new landfill site,consider alternative sites as well as socioeconomic and demographic data,and conduct a public hearing franks dep t of env t natural,ehr,recommended decision,the recommended decision.the recommended decision required the denr to withdraw the south wake permit until all procedural requirements are met.id.at.in november,the alj transferred the case to the denr for a final agency decision,pursuant to.after the denr failed to render its decision within the period mandated by the statute,franks requested the wake county superior court to declare the recommended decision to be the denr final agency decision.the superior court agreed with franks and,on october,it concluded that the recommended decision constituted the denr final agency decision.franks dep t of env t natural,cvs,order wake county super.
wake county then initiated a separate proceeding in wake county superior court,pursuant to,appealing the denr final agency decision,which revoked the south wake permit.that court,on march,reversed the denr final agency decision,and it ordered the denr to reissue the permit.county of wake dep t of env t natural,cvs,petitioner proposed order entered by wake county super,the permit reissuance decision.franks then appealed the permit reissuance decision to the court of appeals of north carolina,where it is presently pending.the appeal was heard by the court of appeals on april,and the issues before the court include,inter alia,the applicability of c to the south wake landfill dispute,as well as whether holly springs was entitled to withdraw its approval of the expansion of the feltonsville landfill.
on december,after the south wake permit had been revoked and while the superior court review of the denr final agency decision was pending,the plaintiffs filed suit against the county and the denr in the eastern district of north carolina,seeking to enjoin the entire south wake landfill process.in their initial complaint,the plaintiffs maintained that the siting of the south wake landfill violated title vi title viii and the equal protection clause.in addition,the complaint asserted the state claim,maintaining that commissioner adcock had violated north carolina public policy,specifically,by participating in the siting of the south wake landfill on his own land,rendering the condemnation transaction void.by their complaint,the plaintiffs requested the court to declare the siting,approval,and funding of the south wake landfill to be illegal,and they further requested that the court e njoin defendants from constructing,operating,maintaining the south wake landfill.after wake county and the denr separately moved to dismiss the complaint for want of jurisdiction and for failure to assert any claims upon which relief could be granted,the plaintiffs amended their complaint,dismissing their claims against the denr itself and naming instead the denr defendants the first amended complaint on may,the plaintiffs requested leave to amend a second time,seeking to file their second amended complaint,in order to respond to the permit reissuance decision and to assert a claim under.the court,however,by its order of october,denied the motion to amend,concluding that the amendment would clearly prejudice the denr defendants.dismissal order at.
the dismissal order also granted the motions of wake county and the denr defendants to dismiss the first amended complaint.the court concluded that the title vi,and equal protection claims against wake county were barred by north carolina three year statute of limitations.id.at.in addition,the court ruled that both the state claim and the title viii challenge against the county failed to pass muster under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.id.at.the court further determined that the denr defendants were entitled to sovereign immunity,and it dismissed the claims asserted against them.id.at.the plaintiffs appeal,contending that the court erred in dismissing their claims and that it abused its discretion in declining to grant them leave to file their second amended complaint.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
the plaintiffs raise three primary contentions in their appeal.first,they assert that the court abused its discretion in refusing to grant them leave to amend.second,they maintain that the district court improperly dismissed their claims against wake county.and third,they contend that the denr defendants are not entitled to sovereign immunity.we begin our analysis of the issues by explaining the applicable standards of review.

we address each of the plaintiffs contentions in turn.
we first consider the plaintiffs assertion that the district court erred in refusing to permit the filing of their second amended complaint.although we review the denial of a motion to amend for abuse of discretion,a court abuses its discretion by resting its decision on a clearly erroneous finding of a material fact.quince orchard valley citizens ass hodel,cir internal quotation and citation omitted.as explained below,the court conclusion that the defendants would be clearly prejudiced was based on an error of material fact.
on may,the plaintiffs sought leave to file their second amended complaint,in order to respond to the superior court permit reissuance decision and to add a claim.in their proposed second amended complaint,the plaintiffs sought to request the district court to order the denr defendants to revoke and withdraw the permit for the south wake landfill.the court declined to grant leave to amend,however,on the ground that the amendment would clearly prejudice the denr defendants.dismissal order at.the court based this conclusion on its mistaken belief that the plaintiffs had not sought leave to amend until nearly seven months after the permit reissuance decision.id.specifically,the court believed that the superior court had issued its decision on october,and that the plaintiffs had not sought leave to amend until april,id.in fact,however,the superior court had issued its permit reissuance decision on march,rather than on october,and the plaintiffs had filed their motion to amend on may.thus,contrary to the district court understanding,the plaintiffs had not waited seven months to seek to amend their complaint,but they had instead sought such leave less than three months after the permit reissuance decision.
under the applicable rule,leave to amend a complaint shall be freely given when justice so requires.a.in fact,such leave should be denied only when the amendment would be prejudicial to the opposing party,there has been bad faith on the part of the moving party,or the amendment would be futile.edwards city of goldsboro,cir emphasis in original internal quotation and citation omitted.in these circumstances,the filing of the second amended complaint,less than three months after entry of the permit reissuance decision,could hardly have prejudiced the defendants.and in light of the significance of the permit reissuance decision,the filing of the second amended complaint should have been authorized.as judge ervin properly observed in quince orchard,supra,a decision premised on a clearly erroneous finding of material fact constitutes an abuse of discretion at.
in dismissing the plaintiffs claims against wake county,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs title vi,and equal protection claims the federal claims were filed in an untimely manner.it then decided that the state claim failed to pass muster under rule b.in determining the propriety of the court dismissal of these claims against wake county,we first assess the statute of limitations issue.
in december,the plaintiffs filed their initial complaint against wake county.the court concluded that north carolina statute of limitations,found in,applied to the federal claims,and that the limitations period began to run in either or,when the county made the decision to site the landfill and began to purchase property.dismissal order at.because the plaintiffs filed their federal claims more than eight years later,the court found those claims to be untimely.while the court correctly identified the applicable limitations period,it erred in concluding that the period started to run in or.
first of all,the predicate bases for the federal claims do not contain an explicit limitations period.the federal claims are accordingly governed by the limitations period of the most analogous state statutes.as chief judge wilkinson explained in jersey heights neighborhood association glendening,cir,the personal nature of the right against discrimination justifies applying the state personal injury limitations period.in this instance,the district court correctly concluded that the applicable statute of limitations for personal injury actions in north carolina is three years.
the question of when a statute of limitations is triggered is one of federal law.as the third circuit has observed,a cause of action accrues for purposes of the statute of limitations when it is sufficiently ripe that one can maintain suit on it.whittle local,int l of teamsters,cir see also bell aerodex,cir a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff could first have successfully maintained a suit based on that cause of action.skyberg united food commercial workers int l union,cir same ghartey john queens,cir same.wake county contends that the limitations period began to run at the latest by the time wake county submitted its site plan application to the denr in december.the plaintiffs,by contrast,maintain that the period was not triggered until the denr issued the south wake permit on february,which authorized the construction of the south wake landfill.
put simply,the applicable statute of limitations could not have been triggered in either or,because the plaintiffs claims would not then have been ripe for determination.see whittle,at.in evaluating the ripeness of claims for judicial review,courts must balance the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.ohio forestry ass n,sierra club,d quoting abbott labs.gardner,d.as our judge russell properly explained,a case is fit for judicial decision where the agency rule or action giving rise to the controversy is final and not dependent upon future uncertainties or intervening agency rulings.charter fed.sav.bank office of thrift supervision,cir citing abbott,at.therefore,in assessing when the limitations period was triggered in this dispute,we must first ascertain when the final agency action occurred that gave rise to this controversy.
the permitting process for the south wake landfill involved two essential steps the actions of the county in siting the landfill and acquiring property and the approval of the denr,in the form of its site suitability letter and its issuance of the permit on february.as we have discussed,supra at,wake county and the denr had an interwoven involvement in the permitting process over an extended period.as such,the participation of the county and the denr are properly viewed as two parts of a single permitting process.this controversy was not ripe for judicial review until the completion of the final step of the process,the denr issuance of the south wake permit.see new hanover township army corps of eng rs,cir concluding that the challenge to defendant issuance of a general permit to landfill corporation was not ripe for review because corporation needed further approval from state agency prior to proceeding with landfill project.indeed,it would have been premature for the plaintiffs to file their complaint in the early,or at any time prior to the denr issuance of the south wake permit in.had the denr declined to issue the permit,the south wake landfill project could not have gone forward,and the district court would have been unnecessarily entangled in what the supreme court has aptly labeled an abstract disagreement.abbott,at.
the parties disagree on the significance to this appeal of our handling of a statute of limitations issue in jersey heights neighborhood association glendening,cir.in that situation,residents of maryland challenged the routing of a proposed highway bypass.the maryland state highway administration had studied alternate routes,and in may it issued its final environmental impact statement,recommending the challenged route.in august,the federal highway administration issued its record of decision rod approving the proposed routing.we concluded that the statute of limitations was triggered by the issuance of the rod,despite the fact that the bypass required additional permits,because on the fundamental question of where the highway would be located,the rod signaled the end of the decisionmaking process.id.at.further,we found ripeness as of the issuance of the rod because there was no obvious factual contingency that put construction seriously in doubt.id.at.
in this case,by contrast,the county siting of the landfill was a preliminary step there remained several obvious factual contingencies that put the landfill construction in serious doubt.before granting its approval for the landfill,the denr was required to follow additional procedural steps and to consider numerous relevant factors,including whether the landfill would disparately impact minority communities.the siting of the landfill did not conclude the decisionmaking process on the project.thus,a challenge to the landfill was not ripe for review,and the statute of limitations did not begin to run,until the denr issued the south wake permit on february,while the siting decisional process in jersey heights ended with the rod,this process carried through to the issuance of the south wake permit.thus,it is with the issuance of that permit that the statute of limitations began to run.see whittle,at concluding that limitations period commences to run when claim is sufficiently ripe to bring cause of action.
in sum,the federal claims against wake county became ripe for review on february,when the denr issued the south wake permit,and the plaintiffs were entitled to assert their claims within three years of that date.they filed their complaint less than three years later,on december,and hence it was timely.thus,the court erred in dismissing the federal claims against wake county on statute of limitations grounds.
the plaintiffs also contest the district court dismissal of the state claim,which charged wake county with contravening north carolina public policy.the plaintiffs alleged that,in wake county effort to acquire land to expand the feltonsville landfill,commissioner adcock participated in the discussion and seconded the purchase of property even though his wife and he owned acres that would be purchased for the landfill expansion.in march,the county condemned the acres owned by commissioner adcock for use in the south wake landfill,and adcock received a judgment against the county for over.the plaintiffs maintain that this transaction violated north carolina public policy,specifically,which prohibits county commissioners from receiving profits by entering into contracts with their county the district court dismissed the state claim,concluding that,while prohibits contracts between a commissioner and his county,commissioner adcock profit resulted not from a contract,but rather from a land condemnation.dismissal order at.
we agree with the district court that speaks of contracts,and that it does not specifically prohibit a commissioner from profiting from the condemnation of his land.while we are troubled by the allegations surrounding commissioner adcock conduct,the revision of north carolina public policy is not within our bailiwick.as such,the court did not err in dismissing the state claim.
finally,we turn to the plaintiffs claims against the denr defendants,which the dist
