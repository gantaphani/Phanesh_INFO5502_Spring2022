david hall,a civilian chemist for the united states army dugway proving ground dugway or army,filed a complaint with the united states department of labor on february,alleging violations of the employee protection provisions of several environmental statutes,which protect employees from being discriminated against for engaging in specified protected activity after investigating the allegations,on april,the occupational safety and health administration osha determined that there was no merit to hall complaint.hall requested a hearing before an administrative law judge alj,and effective june,he resigned his position at dugway.
on august,following an exhaustive hearing,the alj issued a recommended decision and order rd o finding that hall resignation was a constructive discharge due to a hostile work environment created by dugway in retaliation for hall protected activities under the environmental statutes.dugway petitioned the administrative review board arb or board for a review of the alj rd o.the arb rejected the alj conclusion,finding that hall failed to prove dugway acted with retaliatory motive in any of the alleged hostile acts taken against him.hall now asks this court to review the arb ruling.we exercise jurisdiction to review the secretary of labor final ruling pursuant to b and affirm.
background 
hall worked as a civilian chemist in the chemical laboratory division chem lab at dugway,a munitions test and evaluation range,from through june.his position as a chemist with access to hazardous chemicals required him to have a valid security clearance.between and,hall reported several perceived environmental and safety hazards to federal and state agencies,some of which resulted in investigations of and enforcement actions against dugway.
on february,hall filed a complaint with the united states department of labor alleging dugway violated the employee protection provisions of several environmental statutes.hall alleged that after he reported environmental and safety concerns to the army and outside agencies,dugway retaliated by creating a hostile work environment.for example,he alleged that the army retaliated against him by reinvestigating and recommending revocation of his security clearance,requiring him to undergo unnecessary mental health and exams,subjecting him to hostile comments and policies in the workplace,unfairly lowering his performance evaluations and threatening disciplinary action against him,and interfering with his work in an effort to stymie completion of his assignments.
upon the initial filing of hall complaint,osha investigated and concluded that it had no merit.hall then requested a hearing before an alj.he retired effective june,prior to the hearing consequently,the alj construed hall original complaint of retaliation to include a claim that he was constructively discharged.in a lengthy rd o,the alj concluded that hall had engaged in protected activity,and that dugway had indeed retaliated against hall because of his protected activities,in violation of the environmental statutes.the alj recommended order awarded substantial damages and attorney fees to hall.
dugway challenged the alj recommended order,and the case was submitted for review to the arb.see explaining that the arb has been delegated the authority to act for the secretary of labor and issue final decisions as to such discrimination claims.in its final decision and order,issued in december,the arb rejected the alj recommendations and dismissed hall complaint,finding under department of the navy egan,d,it had no authority to review the merits of dugway reinvestigation and revocation of hall security clearance and with respect to the remaining hostile actions alleged,hall failed in his burden to prove retaliatory motive.
on appeal,hall argues that the arb abused its discretion by misconstruing egan and failing to review the army security clearance decisions the arb decision is not supported by substantial evidence because the arb improperly evaluated direct and circumstantial evidence of retaliatory motive and the arb abused its discretion by misconstruing hall complaint and the law of constructive discharge.
ii.discussion 
we review the arb decision under the standard established by the administrative procedure act.see anderson dep t of labor,cir.thus,the court will reverse the final order only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.a.we review the factual findings of the board,not those of the alj,and the board findings are conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence.see id.e zoltanski,cir.our review under this substantial evidence standard is quite narrow.zoltanski,at.we review questions of law de novo.see anderson,at.
the various environmental statutes hall alleges dugway to have violated contain employee protection provisions that prohibit an employer from discharging or discriminating against an employee for reporting environmental violations.see,a swda employee protection provision see also a providing for implementation of the employee protection provisions of the swda and other environmental statutes to state a claim under the whistleblower provision of an environmental statute,the plaintiff must establish that his employer retaliated against him because he engaged in a protected activity.sasse dep t of labor,cir.specifically,hall must show he was an employee he engaged in protected activity dugway knew of the protected conduct the alleged discrimination is,the alleged hostile acts occurred and a nexus exists making it likely that the protected activity led to the alleged discrimination.see anderson,at.the plaintiff bears the burden of proving discrimination.see reeves sanderson plumbing,d.
hall alleges that dugway created a hostile work environment in retaliation for his environmental reporting activities that ultimately led to his constructive discharge.the arb found,and the parties do not contest,that hall engaged in protected activity and that dugway was aware of his activities.on appeal,the only challenge concerns the arb conclusion that there was no nexus between hall protected activity and dugway allegedly hostile acts.an employer creates a hostile work environment when the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult,that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.davis postal,cir quotations omitted hostile work environment claim brought under title vii.a constructive discharge claim based on a hostile work environment goes a step farther.an employee is constructively discharged when the employer by his illegal discriminatory acts makes working conditions so difficult that a reasonable person in the employee position would feel compelled to resign.sanchez denver pub,cir quotation omitted discrimination and retaliation action brought under age discrimination in employment act and title vii.thus,a constructive discharge can be regarded as an aggravated case of hostile work environment.state police suders,d.in either case,the plaintiff must show that he was targeted for harassment because of his protected activity.see sasse,at that is,there must be evidence that justifies an inference of retaliatory motive for dugway allegedly hostile actions.burrus united.of,cir.
authority to review security clearance decisions 
hall contends that dugway retaliated against him by reinvestigating,suspending,and recommending revocation of his security clearance.the arb declined to review these actions because it concluded that it lacked authority to do so.we agree with the board that it lacked authority to review the army determinations regarding hall security clearance.
as the supreme court explained in egan,security clearance decisions are made pursuant to constitutional authority vested in the executive branch.egan,at.allowing an individual access to national secrets involves a sensitive and inherently discretionary judgment call committed by law to the appropriate agency of the executive branch.id.this discretion stems from the president role as the executive authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to access secured information flows primarily from this constitutional investment of power in the president.id.because a determination to grant or revoke a clearance is based on a prediction of an individual potential to compromise sensitive information,it is not reasonably possible for an outside nonexpert body to review the substance of such a judgment and to decide whether the agency should have been able to make the necessary affirmative prediction with confidence.id.at.see also hill dep t of air force,cir explaining that the substance of security clearance judgments includes both the merits and motives of the executive decision and the nexus between those decisions and national security interests.ultimately,therefore,because of both the executive constitutional supremacy and expertise in this area and outside authorities lack of competence to evaluate these decisions,neither agencies nor courts have authority to review the merits of the denial of a security clearance absent a clear statutory directive from congress.id.at.holding merit systems protection board has no statutory authority to review the navy substantive decision to revoke a civilian employee security clearance see also beattie boeing,cir stating that egan application to the merit systems protection board of the rule that decisions are the province of the executive branch also applies to federal courts.
the army investigation,suspension,and recommended revocation of hall security clearance were all taken pursuant to this unique executive authority.determining whether there was a retaliatory motive behind the challenged actions would have required the board to examine the legitimacy of the army proffered reasons and the merits of the revocation decision.because egan held that such scrutiny is an impermissible intrusion by a body into the authority of the executive branch over matters of national security,we agree with the arb conclusion that hall claim of retaliatory revocation of his security clearance is unreviewable.
hall argues,however,that the holding in egan is confined to the specific statutory scheme at issue in that authority granted to the merit systems protection board under the civil service reform act,et that because he brought his claim under the employee protection provisions of various environmental statutes,egan is not controlling.we disagree.notwithstanding the factual incongruity,the principles underlying egan are equally applicable here.the whistleblower protection laws passed by congress do not alter the constitutional order,recognized in egan,that gives the executive branch the responsibility to make national security determinations.because of the discretionary nature of the decision to withhold a security clearance and the constitutional delegation of the obligation to protect national security to the executive branch,the board may inject itself into the sensitive issue of security clearance review only where congress expressly grants it authority to do so.see becerra dalton,cir holding that unless congress specifically has provided otherwise,courts may not subject the navy decision to revoke a plaintiff security clearance to judicial scrutiny.the environmental statutes upon which hall bases his claim do not provide this authority.
hall also seeks to distinguish egan by suggesting that we need not review the merits of the army ultimate revocation decision,as the petitioner requested in egan.rather,he argues that we need only consider the security clearance decisions to determine whether they constitute evidence of retaliatory motive or that they contributed to hall constructive discharge.hall argues for a distinction without a difference.to review the circumstances under which the army recommended revocation of hall security clearance for evidence of retaliation is to review the basis of the determination itself,regardless of how the issue is characterized.the inquiry goes to the very heart of the protection of classified information that must be committed to the broad discretion of the agency responsible.becerra,at quoting egan,at.alteration in original declining to review the reasons why the navy instigated an investigation into the plaintiff security clearance.this is precisely what egan prohibits.see hill,at explaining that egan prohibits review of merits and motives of agency decisions relating to clearance decisions.indeed,other courts have consistently applied egan to cases involving antidiscrimination legislation similar to the environmental whistleblower protections at issue here for the same reasons.see hill white,cir discrimination action brought under title vii and rehabilitation act hesse dep t of state,whistleblower discrimination brought under civil service reform act weber united states,whistleblower discrimination brought under civil service reform act perez,cir retaliation brought under title vii brazil dep t of navy,cir race discrimination brought under title vii becerra,at national origin discrimination brought under title vii guillot garrett,cir disability discrimination brought under rehabilitation act.in each case,the court held that absent express statutory authority to review security clearance decisions,it would violate the principles of egan to review the employee claim that the security clearance process or decision was discriminatory or retaliatory.
finally,hall asserts that the arb erred in failing to recognize that it has the power to review the agency decision for compliance with procedural requirements.it is true that courts are not precluded from reviewing a claim that an agency violated statutory or regulatory procedures when revoking or denying a security clearance.see duane dep t of defense,cir hill,at.to this end,hall argues that procedural deficiencies in dugway process give rise to an inference of retaliation.this argument fails for two reasons.first,hall makes no clear,substantiated allegation,nor provides any relevant record citations,indicating that the army failed to follow its own procedural rules in revoking the security clearance.furthermore,even if he did,what hall essentially asks this court to do is precisely what egan makes clear is prohibited to probe the legitimacy of the army motives to reach an outcome on the merits of dugway decision.
substantial evidence supports the arb resolution of hall constructive discharge claim 
hall contends that the arb failed to properly evaluate purported direct and circumstantial evidence of retaliation.as noted,we review the factual findings of the board,not those of the alj,and the board findings are conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence.see e zoltanski,at.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence a reasonable person would deem adequate to support the ultimate conclusion.grubb,cir.this standard requires more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance of the evidence,and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent the board findings from being supported by substantial evidence.zoltanski,at.in determining whether the board decision is supported by substantial evidence,the court must also consider that evidence which fairly detracts from the board decision.universal camera.this includes the alj evaluation of witness credibility.where the board rejects the alj findings concerning credibility of witnesses the board must have substantial justification apparent from the record.zoltanski,at quoting nephi rubber prods,cir.more specifically,when the board disagrees with the alj assessment of witnesses credibility,the board should fully articulate its reasons for so doing,and then,with heightened scrutiny,we must decide whether such reasons find support in the record.aylett sec y of hous.and urban,cir quoting fierro bowen,cir.also,we will reject the arb finding if it rests solely on testimony discredited by the alj.pogue dep t of labor,cir emphasis added.
direct evidence of retaliatory motive 
hall contends that he presented direct evidence of retaliation against him and that the board final decision must be reversed because it consequently failed to shift the burden of proof to dugway our review of the record reveals that hall did not,in fact,present direct evidence of retaliation,and therefore,the arb did not err in failing to shift the burden of proof.
direct evidence is evidence,which if believed,proves the existence of a fact in issue without inference or presumption.shorter icg holdings,cir alterations and quotations omitted,overruled on other grounds by desert palace,costa,d.direct evidence requires proof of an existing policy which itself constitutes discrimination,tomsic state farm mut.auto.ins,cir quotations omitted,or oral or written statements on the part of a defendant showing a discriminatory motivation,kendrick penske transp,cir.a statement that can plausibly be interpreted two different discriminatory and the other not directly reflect illegal animus,and,thus,does not constitute direct evidence.patten stores east,cir quotation omitted.statements of personal opinion,even when reflecting personal bias or prejudice,do not constitute direct evidence of discrimination,but at most,are only circumstantial evidence of discrimination because the trier of fact must infer discriminatory intent from such statements.see shorter,at.
none of the statements hall offers as direct evidence of retaliatory motive can be so characterized.first,hall claims that in a january meeting,dugway test center commander,lieutenant colonel william kiskowski,told hall that general george akin,the commanding general at the army test and evaluation command in aberdeen,maryland,had called hall a traitor in for reporting environmental violations.hall claims that this statement is direct evidence of discrimination.in fact,the arb to the hall failed to prove that lieutenant colonel kiskowski made this statement at all.the alj had determined that lieutenant colonel kiskowski made this statement based only on hall testimony and a similarly blatant statement that general akin allegedly published in a dugway newsletter in which the general said he had a deep concern with employees who reported concerns outside the chain of command.the alj also concluded that lieutenant colonel kiskowski,who testified that he never made such a statement,was not credible.the arb rejected this credibility determination for several reasons jerry steelman,hall supervisor at the time,and a witness who attended the january meeting,testified that he did not remember lieutenant colonel kiskowski making this comment to hall the record contains a note from hall after the january meeting expressing positive feelings about the meeting lieutenant colonel kiskowski testified that the meeting was productive the record contains a note from lieutenant colonel kiskowski to hall,written immediately after the meeting,indicating that the meeting was productive and the absence in the record of the dugway newsletter in which general akin allegedly expressed his concern that employees were reporting environmental issues outside the chain of command.it therefore concluded that hall failed to prove that he was called a traitor.the arb adequately stated its reasons for rejecting the alj credibility determinations as to this claim,and its conclusions find substantial support in the record.the arb went on to find that even if the statement was made,there was no evidence to suggest that hall subjectively perceived the comment as hostile,and there is substantial evidence to support this conclusion.see faragher city of boca raton,d stating that the objectionable environment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive,one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive,and one that the victim in fact did perceive to be so.
second,in the same january meeting discussed above,which was convened after hall reported safety concerns directly to the department of defense,lieutenant colonel kiskowski allegedly issued hall a gag order requiring hall to report his environmental and safety concerns internally through the chain of command as opposed to outside agencies.specifically,hall alleges that lieutenant colonel kiskowski told me i should even talk to dugway counsel without clearing it with him.this is not direct evidence of retaliation.even assuming that lieutenant colonel kiskowski admonished hall to report his concerns through the chain of command,this fact alone does not provide the nexus between hall reporting activity and the alleged discrimination.multiple inferences must be drawn from this statement to find that dugway alleged hostility was motivated by a desire to retaliate.furthermore,in context,the statement is ambiguous because several people testified that they understood lieutenant colonel kiskowski order not to prohibit hall from reporting his concerns to outside agencies,but to ensure that dugway first was aware of the issues so it could immediately address any safety or environmental problems 
third,colonel dean ertwine,the head of dugway material test command,which includes both the chem lab and the joint operations directorate jod,offered hall a temporary detail outside chem lab in the jod in.according to hall notes,colonel ertwine stated at the time that he was concerned that the transfer not appear as if it were in retaliation for hall reports to osha.hall notes read,ertwine does not want the appearance that i am being moved out in retaliation for having caused an osha inspection.he and i agreed that would be very counterproductive insofar as getting employees to take safety and hazardous waste matters seriously.one permissible inference to be drawn from the statement is that colonel ertwine wanted to prevent others from feeling inhibited in their ability to report safety concerns because of a belief that hall was transferred because he reported such concerns.as noted,statements susceptible to two different discriminatory,the other not direct evidence of illegal animus.
fourth,harvey,a fellow chemist at dugway,testified that in he was ordered to submit to a exam at the same time as another employee who harvey believed to be hall in order to avoid the appearance of disparate treatment with respect to the other employee exam.again,retaliatory motive must be inferred from this evidence because harvey testimony requires one to infer that the other employee was hall.moreover,the testimony provides no explicit nexus between dugway decision to require hall to submit to a exam and hall protected activity.see mccowan all star maint,cir when a plaintiff alleges that discriminatory comments constitute direct evidence of discrimination,the plaintiff must demonstrate a nexus exists between the allegedly discriminatory statements and the decision to terminate her.alteration and quotation omitted.as such,it does not constitute direct evidence.
fifth,gary resnick,a supervisor,instructed hall immediate supervisor at the time,lyman condie,to turkey farm hall.hall argues this statement is an expression of hostility,but the meaning of this statement is ambiguous.in context,the comment supports an inference that resnick intended hall to be placed on assignments due to hall lack of productivity,not due to his reporting of environmental and safety concerns.though retaliatory comments made by a manager responsible for the employment decision at issue during the process might constitute direct evidence of discrimination,the same does not hold true for ambiguous statements where the retaliatory motive is not apparent on its face.see danville reg l lab,cir when comment that plaintiff might not be around very long could have referred either to plaintiff age or to her tendency to change jobs frequently,the comment was only circumstantial evidence of discrimination.
finally,hall contends that statements appearing in an internal dugway memorandum regarding hall,composed after hall wrote to united states senator carl levin expressing concerns about safety at dugway,are direct evidence of retaliation.hall letter to senator levin resulted in a report to the secretary of the army by senator levin on behalf of the senate subcommittee on oversight of government management regarding concerns about safety at dugway.colonel cox,dugway commander,composed an internal memorandum to frank bagley,hall immediate supervisor at the time,explaining the actions he intended to take in response to the senate report to the secretary.these actions included briefing the under secretary of the army and advising employees that they must cooperate to resolve problems in the lab and must advise dugway in writing of any future safety concerns.the memo expresses anxiety that,in the context of declining defense spending,base closure is a serious concern if dugway has to explain to senators why we are not doing our job right.the memo further states that supervisors should discuss the gravity of the situation with hall and that he must understand that we can resolve his concerns here using dugway,then army assets,prior to raising issues with osha,epa,congress.
there is no indication of retaliatory intent here,and the arb could infer that colonel cox was merely appropriately concerned with resolving issues within the chain of command.moreover,none of these statements are connected to any hostile action taken against hall.as such,colonel cox memo,at best,constitutes circumstantial evidence of retaliatory motive,but it is not direct evidence under the law of this circuit 
the statements and evidence advanced by hall on appeal are not direct evidence of retaliation.instead,they are evidence from which a retaliatory purpose could arguably be inferred.because there is no direct evidence to satisfy hall burden to prove retaliatory motive,the arb did not abuse its discretion in refusing to shift the burden of proof to dugway.
circumstantial evidence of retaliatory motive 
hall argues the arb determination that he failed to prove a causal nexus between his protected activity and the alleged hostility against him is not supported by substantial evidence.as support for his contention that he was subjected to this hostility because he engaged in protected conduct,he cites the evidence we previously discussed and rejected as direct evidence of discrimination,as well as evidence that the army has a policy of retaliating against whistleblowers that dugway did not follow procedure in dealing with hall in different situations that the timing of certain alleged hostile acts is so close in time to his protected activity to justify finding retaliation that dugway subjected his work product to hostile editing and that the arb should have payed more credence to the alj positive credibility determination regarding hall.we have reviewed hall assertions on appeal,the arb decision,and the record on appeal,including the alj rd o,and find that substantial evidence supports the arb conclusions.in so finding,we acknowledge that a reasonable person may infer that the army alleged hostility against hall was related to his protected activity.our standard of review,however,is not de novo.we are charged only with determining whether the board decision to the contrary is supported by substantial evidence,which we have already described as more than a scintilla,but less than a preponderance of the evidence.see zoltanski,at.
first,the arb rejected hall contention that there was a clear army policy that treated employees who reported to outside agencies as disloyal and subject to discipline.as support for his contention that the arb erred in this determination,he points to a statement by general akin in a dugway newsletter that he had deep concern with employees who reported outside their chain of command a defense investigative services dis report that stated that one of hall supervisors said hall admitted to blowing the whistle in the past but that hall has improved in this respect and is more willing to work through proper channels dugway treatment of fellow dugway employee judy moran and hall testimony that a supervisor made reference to hall as one who can not be trusted not to report to the state environmental agency.
substantial evidence supports the arb conclusion that hall failed to prove that dugway had a policy of retaliation against whistleblowers.first,the alleged statement by general akin does not appear in the record nor did it appear in the record before the arb.second,the statements in the dis report regarding hall are evidence as to dugway knowledge of hall protected activities,but that fact is not contested.taken in its full context,the statement indicates legitimate employer concern with employee statement forms part of a discussion of a supervisor concerns with hall productivity and difficulty in handling work situations,evidenced by his tendency to go straight to supervisors without attempting to resolve problems on his own.third,substantial evidence supports the arb determination that dugway treatment of moran does not evidence a retaliation policy.hall relies upon the alj conclusion that moran credibly testified that dugway would not hesitate to conceal environmental violations to the state.as the arb points out,the testimony of one witness that dugway generally may conceal environmental violations does not conclusively prove that dugway has a policy of retaliation against whistleblowers,much less that hall supervisors took retaliatory action against him for reporting environmental violations.in rejecting the alj credibility determination of moran,the arb recognized conflicting evidence in the record showing that dugway did not retaliate against moran as hall alleged and noted the testimony of three other employees who engaged in activity but experienced no retaliation from dugway.the arb clearly and logically stated its reasons for finding against the alj determination that there was a policy of retaliation at dugway as alleged by moran.finally,that dugway managers believed hall could not be trusted does not require a conclusion that dugway had a policy of retaliating against whistleblowers because the record also contained evidence that other employees engaged in but suffered no disciplinary actions.
second,the arb also rejected hall contention that instances of irregular procedure proves that he was retaliated against.first,he argues that commander como recommendation to revoke hall security clearance without waiting for a response from hall showed inadequate investigation and irregular procedure,both of which prove retaliatory motive in that decision.we have already held that egan prohibits both the board and this court inquiry in the motives behind security clearance review.although egan does allow review of an agency compliance with its own procedures,hall does not provide us with the procedure that commander como should have but failed to follow 
also as an example of irregular procedure,hall argues that lieutenant colonel kiskowski failure in a february meeting to comply with procedure requiring advance notice to union officials of meetings with union employees is evidence of retaliatory motive.the arb concluded that although lieutenant colonel kiskowski did fail to follow procedure in this respect,hall failed to prove that this failure was in retaliation for his protected conduct.the arb martialed substantial evidence to support its finding that the meeting was called as a result of hall deficient work performance,and not evidence of retaliatory motive.
third,hall argues that the arb failed to take account of retaliatory actions that occurred so close in time to his protected activity as to justify an inference of retaliatory motive.a factfinder may infer retaliatory motive from the fact that a hostile action is taken shortly after an employee protected activity,see,weaver chavez,cir,but it is not required to do so.hall was reassigned to the jod shortly after he engaged in protected activity.the arb found,however,and the record supports,that hall temporary reassignment to the jod was motivated by supervisors desire to give hall an environment in which he had better opportunity for advancement and to separate quarreling employees in the chem lab.moreover,the arb found that the transfer could not even be characterized as a hostile act,and we find the record supports this conclusion for the reasons stated in the arb order.
fourth,the arb
