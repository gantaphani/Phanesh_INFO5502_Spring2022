these consolidated cases seek our review of a series of orders issued by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission,granting a conditional license to the city of tacoma tacoma to operate a hydroelectricproject on the skokomish river in the state of washington.we deny the petitions in part,grant the petitions in part,and remand for further proceedings,without vacating the license.
in,tacoma obtained a license from the federal power commission to flood acres of national forest land by damming the north fork of the skokomish river at lake cushman on the olympic peninsula.this license was designated a minor part license because it covered only a small part of tacoma much larger hydroelectric project the cushman project.at that time,the federal power commission interpreted its licensing authority narrowly,and therefore,the minor part license gave tacoma the authority it needed to proceed with the cushman project.in the ensuing years,tacoma built two dams across the north fork river.the first dam greatly increased the size of lake cushman,and the second dam created lake kokanee further downstream.tacoma also constructed two hydroelectric plants,one at the upper dam and a second near hood canal,which adjoins puget sound.between lake kokanee and hood canal,tacoma diverted virtually all the water from the north fork riverbed into a pipeline,thereby maximizing the generating power of the river.nevertheless,some distance downhill from lake kokanee,water continued to flow into the north fork riverbed from mctaggert creek,and recently tacoma has released into the riverbed an additional flow of sixty cubic feet per second cfs.
the reservation of the skokomish indian tribe tribe is located near the mouth of the skokomish river,with hood canal as its northeastern border and the skokomish river as its eastern,southeastern,and southern borders.the reservation was established in by the treaty of point no point,which guarantees certain rights to the tribe,including the right to take fish from the skokomish river.the cushman project second hydroelectric plant is situated within the boundary of the reservation,on property tacoma owns in fee,and an access road and transmission line run across reservation property.the cushman project did not remove all water from the section of the skokomish river that borders the tribe reservation the lower portion of the river continues to be fed by the south fork and also the small flow that remains in the north fork.nevertheless,the cushman project sharply reduced water levels,thereby affecting fish populations and increasing silt deposits.the tribe asserts that the historic mean annual in the north fork was cfs.if this figure is accurate,then even accounting for the sixty cfs that tacoma is now releasing into the north fork riverbed,tacoma is still diverting about percent of the north fork water.
in,the federal power commission determined that its hydroelectric licensing jurisdiction extends to whole projects,not just to the parts of those projects that occupy or use federal land.see pac.gas,fpc,wl pg e i.on that basis,the commission concluded certain minor part licenses under consideration in that proceeding had been improperly issued based on an erroneous conclusion of law.id.this holding cast a shadow of doubt over all projects that were then operating under minor part licenses,including the cushman project,but tacoma nevertheless continued to operate the project under the terms of its minor part license.
in,tacoma minor part license expired,and tacoma applied for a new license,expressly seeking a major project license that would cover all its facilities.pursuant to section of the federal power act fpa or the act,a,which is the section governing relicensing,the commission is required to issue annual renewals of the existing license during the application review period that precedes issuance of a new license.the commission therefore issued tacoma an annual license,and as a consequence of repeated delays,tacoma operated the project for the next years under these annual renewals.
the array of matters addressed during this lengthy review period included the state certification required under section a of the clean water act,a the state concurrence required under section c a of the coastal zone management act,c a the consultations with state and federal wildlife agencies required under section j of the fpa,id.j and the consultations with the advisory council on historic preservation required under section of the national historic preservation act,id.in addition,ferc the successor agency to the federal power commission prepared an environmental impact statement as required by the national environmental policy act,c,and the department of the interior interior,as the agency supervising the tribe reservation,prepared a list of conditions to be included in tacoma new license pursuant to section e of the fpa.see e.
the tribe also petitioned ferc in for an order declaring the proceeding to be an original license proceeding,not a relicensing.among other things,the tribe was seeking to establish environmental conditions as the baseline for ferc analysis of environmental impact,arguing that most of the project had never been the subject of any license proceeding.ferc rejected the tribe argument,stating,we conclude that the subsequent licensing of a major project with an expiring minor part license is not an original licensing proceeding,but is a relicensing proceeding which is governed by the relicensing provisions of section of the fpa.city of tacoma,ferc,at,wl.ferc also specifically rejected the use of environmental conditions as the baseline for measuring environmental impact.see id.at.
ferc finally completed the application review process in,and on july of that year,ferc issued a major license for the cushman project,imposing a number of conditions designed,among other things,to protect the environment,to remedy past environmental impacts,to restore fish populations,and otherwise to mitigate the effect of the project on the tribe reservation.see city of tacoma,ferc,at,wl.ferc rejected interior section e conditions,but article of the license requires tacoma to release a minimum flow of cfs or inflow,whichever is less into the north fork riverbed,below lake kokanee,and this requirement partially satisfies one of interior conditions.
several parties petitioned for rehearing.tacoma petition asserted that,under the terms of the license,the cushman project would cost more to operate than the value of the power it generated.the tribe petition asserted that the license did not adequately protect the environment or the tribe reservation and should have included all of interior section e conditions.the tribe also contested whether the requirements of the clean water act,the coastal zone management act,and the national historic preservation act had been satisfied.in a series of orders,ferc denied several petitions for rehearing clarified that tacoma could defer its final decision as to whether to accept or reject the new license until after completion of the appeal process and granted a stay of the new license pending judicial review,thereby permitting tacoma to continue operations without satisfying any of the license conditions.
several petitions for review were filed in this court,but we remanded without any decision on the merits because the listing of two salmon species as endangered pursuant to the endangered species act esa,see,necessitated consultations between ferc and the national marine fisheries service the fisheries service regarding the impact of the cushman project on these species,see id.a,and we anticipated that these consultations might result in significant license changes.after remand,ferc also entered into consultations with the fish and wildlife service regarding the impact the project would have on a third species,the bull trout.pursuant to section b of the esa,id.b,the fisheries service and the fish and wildlife service began preparing biological opinions biops detailing their expert findings regarding the impact ferc proposed action would have on the endangered species and specifying reasonable and prudent measures ferc needed to take to minimize any incidental taking of the species.id.b.
more delays followed,and in september,ferc ordered a nonadversarial factfinding hearing before an administrative law judge alj in an effort to move the matter forward.in december,the fisheries service and the fish and wildlife service issued draft versions of their biops,and the alj was able to take those draft biops into consideration.that same month,the alj issued a report emphasizing the critical importance of releasing a minimum flow of cfs into the north fork riverbed,even on an interim basis,to benefit endangered salmon.a few months later,in march,the fisheries service and the fish and wildlife service issued their final biops,and in june,ferc amended the license for the cushman project,adding specific protections for the endangered species,as recommended in the biops.in the same order,ferc partially lifted its stay,thereby requiring the cfs minimum flow the alj had recommended in his report.in february,ferc granted in part and denied in part requests for rehearing,making relatively minor additional amendments to the license,and in march,ferc denied rehearing of its february order.
several petitions challenging ferc orders are consolidated in this proceeding.on may,we granted a motion for a stay of the cfs requirement.tacoma thus continues to operate the cushman project without any significant license conditions,as it has done for approximately eighty years.it also continues to divert nearly all the water from the north fork river,as it has done for approximately eighty years.tacoma has consistently asserted that the cfs minimum flow will necessitate a shut down of the project.
the tribe petition argues that tacoma has reaped huge profits operating a largely unlicensed hydroelectric project for nearly eighty years,while ignoring the devastating impact its actions have had on the tribe traditional lifestyle.tacoma has almost completely removed the water from the north fork of the skokomish river,and it has sharply reduced water levels in the mainstem of the river.the result,the tribe asserts,has been a major alteration of the local environment,a devastating drop in the fish populations,and damage to natural resources of great economic and cultural significance to the tribe.all of these factors weigh against the license,argues the tribe,but in addition,the tribe relies on article of the treaty of point no point,which provides in relevant part the right of taking fish at usual and accustomed grounds and stations is secured to said indians while the tribe arguably still has the right to tak e fish at usual and accustomed grounds,that right is now of little value,because the water has disappeared,and with it,the fish.
the tribe already litigated most of these points before ferc in the early,and ferc gave persuasive reasons for rejecting the tribe arguments.as noted,the tribe filed a petition in asking ferc to treat tacoma application as an application for an original license,rather than a section relicensing proceeding.in the same petition,the tribe sought to establish environmental conditions as the baseline for measuring the environmental impact of the cushman project.as the tribe viewed the situation,most of the cushman project had never been the subject of a ferc licensing proceeding,but tacoma was nevertheless assuming the preferred status of a licensee seeking merely to renew a license for an approved project.according to the tribe,unless ferc treated tacoma application as an application for an original license,the severe impact of the cushman project on the tribe reservation and its way of life would escape regulatory review altogether.
two points put these arguments in context.first,the primary focus of the fpa in was on development of the nation natural resources,and the act did not include many of the environmental protection provisions on which the tribe now relies.therefore,even if the commission had licensed the entire cushman project back in,instead of only a minor part of that project,it is doubtful it would have imposed significantly different license conditions.the commission was certainly aware of the full scope of the cushman project when it issued the minor part license,and it could have withheld the minor part license if it had been opposed to the project.
second,in,tacoma obtained the regulatory approvals it was required to obtain as of that time,based on the commission interpretation of its licensing authority.therefore,the assertion that tacoma should be penalized,at the relicensing stage,for having only a minor part license is unfounded.
ferc made essentially these points in its declaratory order in which it found the instant proceeding to be a relicensing,not an original licensing.see ferc at.the tribe,however,argues that ferc had no statutory authority for conducting a relicensing proceeding,and therefore the license it issued in is invalid.the tribe points out that in pg e i the commission held that minor part licenses similar to tacoma license were improperly issued based on an erroneous conclusion of law.fpc at.on this basis,the tribe argues the cushman project has never operated under a valid license,and a relicensing proceeding only compounds this error by treating the license as if it were valid.
the commission addressed this question in a somewhat different context in pac.gas,fpc,wl pg e ii.in pg e ii,the commission granted an application for surrender of a minor part license and issuance of a new major license,and in the course of its decision,it discussed the appropriate effective date for the new license.id.at.the commission rejected the conclusion that its decision in pg e i effectively invalidated all minor part licenses and therefore the date of that decision should constitute the date of surrender 
while the commission stated in the decision that licenses were based on an erroneous conclusion of law and were improperly issued,we do not believe it is appropriate to accept the proposed surrender as of the date of the decision.we also do not establish the effective date of the new license as the date of the decision.the effective date of the surrender of the license and the effective date of the new license for the project works are the first day of the month in which this order is issued.
id.at.the commission added 
in view of the decision and our reconsideration of licenses herein,we are directing the secretary to serve this order on all licensees and to direct those licensees to file a schedule for submission of a license application covering all project works of a project as defined in section of the fpa.
id.at.in other words,the commission determined that projects operating under minor part licenses prior to the decision were operating under adequate licenses,though as of the decision,they were on notice that they needed to apply for major licenses.
we agree with the commission conclusion that minor part licenses issued prior to were adequate even if issued based on an erroneous conclusion as to the scope of the commission licensing authority.significantly,the commission issuance of a minor part license in was not an ultra vires act.the commission erred by construing its authority too narrowly,not in acting beyond the bounds of its mandate.therefore,even if the commission erred in issuing tacoma a minor part license in,the minor part license it issued was not inherently improper or lacking in legal force.when the commission later reinterpreted its licensing jurisdiction more broadly,we think the commission had discretion to recognize the legitimacy of existing minor part licenses and,on that basis,to apply the relicensing provision found in section of the fpa.
the tribe points out,however,that section nowhere expressly refers to minor part licenses or authorizes relicensing upon expiration of a minor part license.the tribe is correct that section is not specific in this regard.it provides simply that ferc can issue a new license to the licensee at the expiration of the existing license.a.nevertheless,we think this statutory language is broad enough to permit the interpretation ferc has given it,and because we find ferc interpretation to be reasonable,we defer to it.see chevron,natural resources defense council,d.
the tribe argues that chevron deference does not apply here because this case involves an indian tribe.in support of this argument,the tribe cites cobell norton,in which we found chevron deference inapplicable to the secretary of the interior interpretation of the indian trust fund management reform act,because the trust relationship between the united states and the native american people requires liberal construction of statutes in favor of indian tribes.this principle only applies,however,to provisions of the law that are for the benefit of indian tribes.id.at quoting bryan itasca county,d.the fpa includes at least one provision for the benefit of indian tribes section e,but the act relicensing provision section can not be characterized that way,and therefore the tribe argument fails.
in sum,we reject the tribe argument that ferc erred in conducting a relicensing proceeding rather than an original license proceeding.
the tribe asserts that ferc violated section e of the fpa by not including interior section e conditions in tacoma new license.section e of the fpa,e,provides 
t hat licenses shall be issued within any reservation only after a finding by the commission that the license will not interfere or be inconsistent with the purpose for which such reservation was created or acquired,and shall be subject to and contain such conditions as the secretary of the department under whose supervision such reservation falls shall deem necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of such reservation.
in this case,interior is the federal agency under whose supervision the skokomish indian reservation falls,and on august,the secretary of the interior submitted section e conditions to ferc.ferc rejected these conditions because they were not timely filed.city of tacoma,ferc at,order on reh g,ferc,at,wl.
the fpa does not indicate what,if any,time limitation applies in this context,but ferc has imposed a strict time limitation,now codified at title,b of the code of federal regulations,which provides in relevant part 
all comments including mandatory terms and conditions or prescriptions on an application for a license must be filed with the commission no later than days after issuance by the commission of public notice declaring that the application is ready for environmental analysis a commenter may obtain an extension of time from the commission only upon a showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances in accordance with of this chapter terms and conditions,or prescriptions will be considered by the commission under section a of the federal power act if such consideration would not delay or disrupt the proceeding.
b.the regulation also states 
i f ongoing agency proceedings to determine terms and conditions or prescriptions are not completed by the date specified,the agency must submit to the commission by the due date i preliminary terms and conditions or prescriptions and a schedule showing the status of the agency proceedings and when the terms and conditions or prescriptions are expected to become final or ii a statement waiving the agency right to file the terms and conditions or prescriptions or indicating the agency does not intend to file terms and conditions or prescriptions.
id.b paragraph breaks omitted.
in accordance with this regulation,interior section e conditions were due on october.interior,however,did not submit its conditions,or even preliminary conditions,by that date.instead,interior submitted a letter stating that,because of the complexity of the project,it would submit preliminary conditions within two years.in this letter,interior also questioned ferc authority to impose a time restriction on responsibilities the fpa expressly delegated to the secretary of the interior.interior complained that ferc short time restriction was unworkable,as a practical matter not possible,and in conflict with ferc trust responsibility to protect the lands and resources of indian tribes.two years later,interior submitted preliminary section e conditions,as it said it would do,and about nine months after that,it submitted its final conditions,which ferc rejected as untimely.see city of tacoma,ferc at,order on reh g,ferc at.
we conclude ferc exceeded its statutory authority by placing a strict time restriction on responsibilities congress delegated to other federal agencies.the fpa provides that licenses within any reservation shall be subject to and contain such conditions as the secretary of the department under whose supervision such reservation falls shall deem necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of such reservation.e.the fpa gives ferc no discretion in this regard.though ferc makes the final decision as to whether to issue a license,ferc shares its authority to impose license conditions with other federal agencies.see escondido mut.water la jolla band of mission indians,d.to the extent congress has delegated licensing authority to agencies other than ferc,those agencies,and not ferc,determine how to exercise that authority,subject of course to judicial review.ferc can no more dictate to interior when interior should complete its work than interior can dictate to ferc when ferc should do so.here,ferc took all the time it full issue a license to tacoma.interior,in contrast,produced its license conditions within about three years of receiving notice on august.
to be sure,interior and ferc should certainly make every effort to cooperate and to coordinate their efforts,because license conditions imposed by one agency may alter the conditions the other agency deems necessary.furthermore,when two or more federal agencies have shared authority to impose license conditions,they can certainly agree on an appropriate time frame to govern the process.ferc,however,has no authority to impose a short limitation unilaterally,thereby effectively stripping interior of its statutorily delegated authority.
a further question relates to the scope of interior statutorily delegated authority,which according to the express terms of section e extends only to licenses issued within any reservation.e.in fpc tuscarora indian nation,d,the supreme court held that only land actually owned by the united states qualifies as reservation land for purposes of the fpa.out of all the various facilities that constitute the cushman project,the lower of the two generating plants,an access road,and a transmission line are within the boundary of the reservation,but the generating plant is on land tacoma owns in fee.therefore,only the transmission line and the access road are within the reservation for purposes of the fpa,but this is sufficient.
ferc concluded that interior authority to impose section e conditions was limited to mitigating the relatively small impact the transmission line and access road had and would have on the reservation,and it did not extend to the much greater impact the dams and water diversion had and would have on the reservation.see city of tacoma,ferc at,order on reh g,ferc at.in reaching this conclusion,ferc relied on its prior decision in minnesota power light,ferc,at,in which it had rejected interior assertion of a broad right to impose license conditions based on the presence of any small part of a project on reservation land.in minnesota power,ferc stated 
interior theory could lead to any number of results that would be inconsistent with the letter and intent of section e.for example,if a project is located entirely on private land with the exception of a small segment of a power line that crossed the corner of a reservation,interior theory would allow it to set minimum instream flows and impose other conditions on aspects of the project that have absolutely no impact on the reservation we do not interpret section e to require such an outcome.
id.at.ferc cited escondido in support of this conclusion,but escondido actually suggests a different rule.
the supreme court in escondido considered whether interior could impose section e conditions any time a reservation is affected by a licensed project even if none of the licensed facilities is actually located on the reservation.at.the court rejected this argument,stating,congress intended the conditioning power of the secretary of the interior to apply only with respect to a reservation upon which any project works were to be located.id.at.significantly,the court referred to any project works,which would seem to include,contrary to ferc conclusion,even a small segment of a power line that crosse s the corner of a reservation.minnesota power,ferc at.later in its opinion,the court stated,i t is clear that congress concluded that reservations were not entitled to the added protection provided by the proviso of e unless some of the licensed works were actually within the reservation.escondido,at.emphasis added.s ome means some it does not mean all,or even a lot.the issue under consideration in escondido was whether interior can impose license conditions based on the indirect effects a project has on a reservation.therefore,the implication of the court statements is that interior can do so provided that at least some or any part of the licensed facilities is on reservation land.
this conclusion is consistent with the plain meaning of the statutory language.all the parties agree tacoma cushman project is within a reservation at least to the extent of the access road and transmission line,and section e provides that licenses issued within a reservation shall be subject to and contain such conditions as the secretary of the interior shall deem necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of such reservation.e emphasis added.this language nowhere limits interior regulatory authority to those portions of the project that are on the reservation.on the contrary,so long as some portion of the project is on the reservation,the secretary is authorized to impose any conditions that will protect the reservation,including utilization of the reservation in a manner consistent with its original purpose.
we conclude,therefore,that the secretary of the interior is not limited in this proceeding to mitigating the impact the access road and the transmission line will have on the reservation.instead,he may impose license conditions that are designed to mitigate the effect of the project on the skokomish river to the extent doing so is reasonably related to protecting the reservation and the tribe.moreover,the fpa gives ferc no discretion to reject interior section e conditions,escondido,at,though ferc is free to express its disagreement with the conditions in connection with the issuance of the license or on judicial review,and it also has the option of not issuing the license,id.at.here,because ferc rejected interior section e conditions as untimely,ferc did not argue against the conditions on the merits,which perhaps would have persuaded interior to change some of the conditions,and it did not rule on whether,with the conditions included,the license should nevertheless issue.for the same reason,the record before us might not include all of interior evidentiary support for the conditions,and no party has had an opportunity to challenge the validity of the conditions in a petition for review.therefore,our decision should not be read as foreclosing the commission from deciding not to issue the license as modified by the section e conditions,or if it does issue the license,foreclosing the petitioners from future litigation over the conditions.
the tribe argues that,in issuing the license,ferc violated its obligations under the clean water act.section of the clean water act requires a water quality certification from the appropriate state government agency before ferc can license a hydroelectric project like the cushman project.a.on april,the state of washington department of ecology ecology issued a conditional certification for the cushman project,and tacoma appealed that certification to the state pollution control hearings board.pursuant to a settlement between ecology and tacoma,ecology issued a new conditional certification on december.ecology,however,was unable to produce records showing that it gave public notice or held a hearing with respect to either certification.
in most cases,if a party seeks to challenge a state certification issued pursuant to section,it must do so through the state courts.the reason for this rule is plain enough.the clean water act gives a primary role to states to block local water projects by imposing and enforcing water quality standards that are more stringent than applicable federal standards.keating ferc.therefore,the decision whether to issue a section certification generally turns on questions of state law.ferc role is limited to awaiting,and then deferring to,the final decision of the state.otherwise,the state power to block the project would be meaningless.id.
the reason for this rule,however,also establishes its outer limits.if the question regarding the state section certification is not the application of state water quality standards but compliance with the terms of section,then ferc must address it.this conclusion is evident from the plain language of section no license or permit shall be granted until the certification required by this section has been obtained or has been waived a emphasis added.ferc,in other words,may not act based on any certification the state might submit rather,it has an obligation to determine that the specific certification required by section has been obtained,and without that certification,ferc lacks authority to issue a license.
this obligation does not require ferc to inquire into every nuance of the state law proceeding,especially to the extent doing so would place ferc in the position of applying state law standards,but it does require ferc at least to confirm that the state has facially satisfied the express requirements of section.for example,where a state claims to have revoked a certification pursuant to section a,ferc has an obligation to confirm that the state has done so in a way that satisfies the restrictions of that subsection.keating,at.likewise,when a state issues a water quality certification,ferc has an obligation to confirm,at least facially,that the state has complied with section a public notice requirements.
section a requires states to establish procedures for public notice in the case of all applications for certification.a.the state of washington has complied with this provision by adopting section of the washington administrative code,which provides whenever an application for section certification is filed public notice shall be performed as follows a by mailing notice of the application for certification to persons or organizations who have requested the same and to all others deemed appropriate.admin.code.in addition,section permits the state to publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation,if such additional notice is desirable in the public interest.id.b.we do not,however,think ferc obligation is limited to confirming that the state has enacted a public notice procedure.rather,we think that,by implication,section a also requires states to comply with their public notice procedures,and therefore it requires ferc to obtain some minimal confirmation of such compliance,at least in a case where compliance has been called into question.otherwise,ferc has no assurance that the certification the state has issued satisfies section,and in the absence of such an assurance,it has no authority to grant a license.
we do not mean to suggest that ferc should resolve disputes relating to whether the state public notice procedures have been satisfied,for doing so would require ferc to construe state law.however,some minimal form of public notice is an explicit requirement of section,which is federal law,and therefore in a case such as this one,where public notice has been called into question,we think ferc has a role to play in verifying compliance with state public notice procedures at least to the extent of obtaining an assertion of compliance from the relevant state agency.ferc argues that the state was no longer troubled by the issue,but this point is without legal significance,because section sets forth constraints upon ferc authority to act.
nevertheless,we do not think our conclusion requires us to vacate the license,especially because vacating the license would allow tacoma to operate under annual renewals of its minor part license and would likely have greater adverse impact on water quality than leaving the license in place.ferc should seek an affirmation from ecology that it complied with state law notice requirements when it issued its water quality certification or,if it did not,that it has done so in response to this decision.
the tribe asserts that ferc violated section of the national historic preservation act,which requires federal agencies to consider the effect of their actions on certain historic or culturally significant sites and properties expressly including those of indian tribes and to seek ways to mitigate those effects.ferc complied with its section obligation,and it expressly took into consideration the comments of the advisory council on historic preservation,adopting some of the council suggestions.city of tacoma,ferc at.the tribe argues,however,that ferc failed to take into consideration and mitigate the impact the original project had in on historic and culturally significant sites.blue,we need not decide whether section requires consideration of past impacts in the course of a relicensing proceeding,because ferc took the prior impact of the cushman project into account.in its july,order,ferc stated w e acknowledge that the cushman project has had adverse environmental effects because of its diversion of water out of the north fork skokomish river.to mitigate some of those effects,we are adopting many,but not all,of the agencies recommended terms and conditions for the cushman project license we believe these measures provide sufficient protection for historic properties.id.at.
as an aside,it is worth noting our conclusion that ferc must include interior section e conditions in the new license may alter the analysis of what impact the license will have on historic or culturally significant sites and properties,thereby requiring the commission to consider anew the effects of its actions.
the tribe argues ferc violated the coastal zone management act czma by issuing a license without a concurrence from ecology confirming compliance with washington coastal program.the czma requires an applicant for any federal license affecting land,water,or natural resources of a coastal zone to certify compliance with the relevant state coastal program,and the state must then concur in the applicant certification,though if no concurrence is forthcoming within six months,the state concurrence shall be conclusively presumed.c a.on june,tacoma certified compliance with washington coastal program,and on may,ecology issued a somewhat equivocal concurrence.ecology letter stated that tacoma proposal for operating the cushman project d id not comply with washington coastal zone program,but nevertheless the purposes of the coastal zone program will be better met by declining to object.the letter continued therefore,ecology hereby declines its right to take action under its coastal zone management authority ecology hopes that declining further czm review will allow ferc to proceed with licensing without further delay.this letter constitutes the formal agency action on czm related to this licensing proceeding.paragraph breaks omitted.
though ecology ultimate decision not to object was unambiguous,the element of reluctance in ecology letter cast some doubt over the matter.that doubt,however,was cleared away when the united states department of commerce commerce,which administers the czma,ruled that ecology letter constituted the state conclusive concurrence in tacoma certification.commerce ruling with respect to the letter satisfied ferc,which issued the new license to tacoma.city of tacoma,ferc at.
the tribe subsequently prevailed in state court litigation challenging the validity,under state law,of ecology concurrence.skokomish indian tribe fitzsimmons.the state court held that ecology had issued its concurrence in violation of state administrative law,id.at,though it expressly did not rule on the merits of whether the concurrence was warranted,id.at.when ferc issued the license,however,the question at issue before ferc was only the effect of ecology letter stating its concurrence,and commerce had ruled that the letter should be treated as a valid concurrence for federal law purposes.under the circumstances,ferc did not need to delay licensing until all challenges to ecology actions were complete.
moreover,after the state court invalidated ecology concurrence,ecology issued a new letter on february,stating the specific conditions that would satisfy its coastal program,and those conditions are generally consistent with the license ferc issued in.specifically,ecology stated that tacoma should release a minimum of cfs or inflow,whichever is less to the north fork riverbed and tacoma should participate in an adaptive management process with the goal of increasing flows in the river to more natural levels.ferc concluded that,because tacoma license met ecology conditions,reopening the czma certification process would serve no purpose.city of tacoma,ferc,at,wl,order on reh g,ferc,at,wl.we agree.
the tribe argues that,regardless of commerce ruling,tacoma should have sought a new czma certification due to the listing of three species as endangered under the esa.see a.ferc,however,took into account the recommendations of the biops with respect to these species,amending several articles of the license,and ecology never suggested to tacoma that the listing of these species altered its conclusion with respect to coastal program compliance.see id.b.under the circumstances,we think ferc reasonably concluded that a supplemental certification was unnecessary.
the tribe argues that tacoma lacks water rights for the water it uses in connection with the cushman project.on november,ecology sent a letter to ferc,describing in detail the ways in which tacoma had mischaracterize d the extent of its state water rights.ecology reiterated its position in two subsequent letters to ferc,one dated january,and the other dated october.the tribe then raised this issue in its request for reconsideration of the july,order granting the license.ferc rejected the tribe argument,noting that tacoma had applied for additional water rights and that section of the fpa,deprived ferc of authority to adjudicate issues related to state water rights.city of tacoma,ferc at.the tribe next brought a motion asking ferc to add two new articles to the license an article requiring tacoma compliance with its existing state water rights to the satisfaction of ecology or a court of competent jurisdiction,including if necessary tacoma restricting its water usage to match its authorized amount and an article reserving ferc authority to unilaterally modify the cushman project license as may be necessitated by action on tacoma water rights taken by ecology or a court of competent jurisdiction.
we agree with ferc that the articles the tribe proposed in this motion are unnecessary in light of section of the fpa.section provides 
nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as affecting or intending to affect or in any way to interfere with the laws of the respective states relating to the control,appropriation,use,or distribution of water used in irrigation or for municipal or other uses,or any vested right acquired therein.
if ferc lacks power to affect or interfere with state water rights,then the license ferc issued for the cushman project does not and can not exempt tacoma from meeting its water rights obligations under state law.incorporating those water rights obligations into the license would serve no purpose other than to interpose ferc,in its role as enforcer of the license,into a matter that is not its concern.the tribe argues that ferc,by issuing the license,has condone d tacoma blatant violation of state water rights law.it can not under section.
tacoma argues the license conditions ferc has imposed make the cushman project more costly to operate than the value of the power the project generates.on that account,tacoma asserts the license amounts to a de facto decommissioning of the project,in violation of sections and of the fpa.
under the fpa,any of several things can happen when a license to operate a hydroelectric facility expires the federal government can take over the project,ferc can issue a new license to the same licensee upon reasonable terms,id.a ferc can issue a license to a different licensee upon reasonable terms,ferc can license all or part of the project for nonpower use,id.f and ferc can decline to issue a new license.the last option is implicit in section e,which gives to ferc the authority to decide whether to issue any license under this subchapter.id.e emphasis added see also escondido,at.if the commission decides not to issue a new license,however,the act is silent with respect to the disposition of the project works and any other remedial measures that might be necessary to restore the environment.for example,on the one hand,failure to maintain a dam after a project ceases operations would lead to the gradual deterioration of the dam structural integrity followed by a possible catastrophe and huge liability for the landowner should the dam suddenly give way.on the other hand,the project former operator may not want to bear the cost of maintaining the dam when it no longer receives revenues from the project,and if the former operator removes the dam,homes and businesses that have come to rely on the presence of the dam may lose much of their value.ferc could,of course,address these issues at the time of licensing by imposing appropriate license conditions,but it is not clear whether,in the absence of express license conditions,ferc has the authority to impose obligations and costs on a former licensee.
when congress first enacted the fpa in,its general expectation may have been that ferc would renew hydroelectric project licenses in perpetuity,making disposition of project works unnecessary.at that time,the act included few provisions protecting the environment,and the general focus was on development of the nation resources.but with the later addition of various provisions protecting the environment,and also fish and wildlife,the possibility arose that existing projects would be inconsistent with the new values embodied in the law,and ferc might therefore decline to renew a license,or it might issue a renewal on terms the licensee found objectionable.aware of this possibility,ferc published a policy statement in the federal register in,claiming authority to decommission existing projects at the time of relicensing and to impose decommissioning costs on the former licensee.see project decommissioning at relicensing policy statement.ferc.the validity of this policy has never been tested in the courts.
tacoma argues that ferc has no authority to decommission a project unilaterally at the time of relicensing.rather,sections and of the fpa list several possibilities upon expiration of a license term,and ferc decommissioning policy is simply not on the list.tacoma suggests that if ferc does not want to renew tacoma license,and it can not find another party to take over the cushman project,then the federal government must itself take over the project.of course,ferc did not decommission the cushman project rather,it issued a new license to tacoma to operate the project.nevertheless,tacoma claims ferc loaded up the new license with so many conditions tacoma has no choice but to shut the project down.in that way,ferc effectively decommissioned the project by the ruse of offering an uneconomic license and saying,in effect,take it or leave it.tacoma argues ferc may not do indirectly that which it has no authority to do,in other words,de facto decommissioning.pet rs br.
in pressing this argument,tacoma emphasizes ferc concession that the new license is uneconomic.specifically,ferc own finding is that the net benefits of the cushman project are negative million per year.this concession has limited significance,however,in light of ferc decision in mead,publishing paper division,ferc,wl.in mead,ferc concluded it is institutionally unqualified to make business judgments about the economic viability of hydroelectric projects,especially in light of the new era of competition in the electric power industry and the unpredictability of market conditions over the course of a thirty or license term.id.at.in addition,ferc noted that the potentially high cost associated with decommissioning a project might prompt a licensee to continue operating a project though the project is only marginally viable economically.id.at.accordingly,ferc determined that it would cease the practice of projecting costs when assessing the economic benefits of a project.instead,it would focus for the most part on conditions,and it would leave to the prospective licensee the decision whether or not to accept the license.id.at.ferc expressly noted the possibility that,under this new approach,it might license projects that had negative economic benefits.id.at.
in light of mead,tacoma finds far too much significance in ferc concession that the cushman project is uneconomic under the new license.the project may offer advantages to tacoma that are not readily quantifiable,and market conditions may change significantly over the next forty years,making the project economically viable over the.tacoma more persuasive point is that the attitude ferc expressed in mead is inconsistent with ferc statutory obligation under the fpa.section of the fpa requires ferc to offer a new license on reasonable terms,or an annual renewal of the old license,and in tacoma view,an uneconomic license is per se an unreasonable license.ferc responds that its duty is to issue licenses that reflect the congressional mandate irrespective of whether those licenses make good business sense.
in some cases,a change in congressional priorities might cast doubt on a once viable project and lead to closure of the project when its license expires,either because ferc denies a new license outright or because ferc issues a new license that the licensee finds too costly or burdensome.in ferc decommissioning policy statement,ferc argues persuasively that it can not guarantee license renewal when congress has greatly altered the regulatory landscape during the course of the prior license term.at.moreover,the very fact that a license may not exceed fifty years,see e,indicates congress intent that projects be reevaluated from time to time in light of changing circumstances and national priorities,and this reevaluation necessarily implies that in some cases new licenses will not be issued.
one of the major shifts in national priorities since the has been from a focus on development to an increasing focus on environmental protection,and this shift is reflected in amendments to the fpa.in the,the fpa contained only two provisions aimed at protecting natural resources section e included a provision protecting reservations and authorizing the secretary of any federal agency overseeing a reservation to impose appropriate license conditions,e,and section gave the secretary of commerce and later the secretary of the interior the power to impose license conditions governing the construction of fishways,id.starting in the,however,environmental protection became an increasingly important concern,and ferc hydroelectric decisions reflected this shift in national values.
then,in,congress enacted the clean water act,under which state water protection agencies must give a water quality certification before ferc can license a hydroelectric project.a.in addition,section of the esa,first enacted in,requires ferc to impose license conditions that are necessary to protect any listed species.a.finally,in,congress amended the fpa to add the following provision to section e 
in deciding whether to issue any license under this part for any project,the commission,in addition to the power and development purposes for which licenses are issued,shall give equal consideration to the purposes of energy conservation,the protection,mitigation of damage to,and enhancement of,fish and wildlife including related spawning grou
