forest guardians appeal a district court decision finding that the united states forest service usfs complied with the relevant laws in approving the county line vegetation management project.they argue that usfs violated the national forest management act nfma,b,by failing to collect actual population data for management indicator species mis failed to provide substantial evidence for its conclusion that the relevant soil standard would be met and violated the national environmental policy act nepa,et,by failing to consider the impacts of logging trucks on neighboring landowners.we take the district court view of the matter and reject forest guardians first and third claims on the merits.we further conclude that forest guardians did not present their second claim in their administrative appeal and have thus forfeited it.accordingly,we affirm.
the rio grande national forest covers nearly two million acres in southern colorado,including the headwaters of the historic rio grande.spanning both sides of the continental divide,it encompasses a wide variety of breathtaking landscapes,from alpine desert to the organ pipes of the wheeler geologic area,long silenced after their deafening creation from the volcanic froth of the creede caldera.pursuant to the nfma,usfs management of the forest is guided by the rio grande national forest land and resource management plan the forest plan,which was comprehensively amended in to comply with the usfs regulations that were then in effect.see forest.land and res.mgmt.planning,formerly codified at the regulations.
following an administrative appeal brought by several environmental groups,usfs determined that additional amendments to the forest plan were necessary.under the plan,usfs failed to designate mis as was then required by a.mis,like canaries in coal mines,are used as proxies for environmental health problems in mis populations indicate larger ecosystem trouble.in,usfs again amended the forest plan to remedy its mis shortcoming.in the environmental assessment accompanying that amendment,usfs stated,the primary purpose of the mis amendment is to assure that species viability is measured and monitored as directed in.similarly,in its decision of no significant impact for the amendment,usfs concluded mis selection,monitoring,and assessment need to meet the intent of monitoring and evaluating mis as described in the planning regulations.
towards that end,usfs selected nine mis for the rio grande national forest the brown creeper,the hermit thrush,the pygmy nuthatch,lincoln sparrow,wilson warbler,the vesper sparrow,the mule deer,the rocky mountain elk,and the rio grande cutthroat trout.where rio grande cutthroat trout are not present,usfs designated several other trout species to be monitored in their stead.the amendment also included a chart establishing monitoring schedules and methods for mis rio grande cutthroat trout are to be evaluated every five years,using stream surveys.mis birds are subject to p oint counts,nest search,presence surveys,mcb surveys,to be conducted a nnually at the state and national forest level.a footnote to the mis birds discussion indicates that p monitoring will be incorporated into forest plan monitoring as applicable.finally,mule deer and rocky mountain elk are to be evaluated annually using dow surveys.the forest plan itself does not explicitly incorporate.
following adoption of the amendment,and the discovery of a significant spruce beetle infestation,usfs developed a logging project referred to as the county line vegetation management project.under that project,usfs authorized the harvest of to million board feet of timber from a acre area.in the southern section of that area,infested trees will be removed from acres.in the northern section,where infestation is minimal,acres will be thinned.approximately eighteen miles of roads will be constructed or reconstructed.two sections of the project area are considered landslide risks and will not be logged.in addition,usfs instituted a foot buffer zone on both sides of any creek.two waterways fall within the project rio de los pinos and wolf creek.
to assist it in developing an environmental impact statement eis for the project,usfs prepared a specialist report for mis,which details the agency mis monitoring activities.two mis,the pygmy nuthatch and the vesper sparrow,were not analyzed because no suitable habitat for those species exists in the project area.two others,wilson warbler and lincoln sparrow,were also excluded because the project area included only a very limited amount of habitat for those species.for the final two avian mis,the brown creeper and the hermit thrush,usfs estimated populations using potential population densities.point counts confirmed the presence of both species.because mis monitoring did not begin until,usfs did not yet have trend data.instead,it utilized trend data from the mcb program,the colorado land bird conservation plan,and the colorado breeding bird atlas project.the specialist report noted that the project could displace up to pairs of brown creeper and pairs of hermit thrush,but that such numbers represented a negligible portion of the populations of these species.
rocky mountain elk and mule deer population data were based on colorado dow surveys.however,given the range of these animals,it was not feasible to estimate populations for a relatively small acre site.the report predicted that the project would not significantly impact either species.rio grande cutthroat trout population trend data were based on colorado dow surveys.usfs also reported that core trout populations were found in rio de los pinos about one half mile upstream from the project,and in wolf creek one mile downstream from the project.both populations are cut off from the project area by the presence of large waterfalls.population data for these groups were based on and survey data.although it acknowledged the project could adversely impact the downstream population in the short term,usfs concluded that,with mitigation measures,the project would not seriously impact species density.
in response to a forest plan requirement that usfs m anage land treatments to limit the sum of severely burned and detrimentally compacted,eroded,and displaced land to no more than of any land unit,usfs reported the following existing soil impacts were estimated at less than of the project area,consisting of past logging roads and skid trails no recent logging projects were conducted in the southern section of the project area a number of mitigation techniques,including use of existing skid trails and the potential use of a winged subsoiler to till compacted lands,would keep the project within the limit based on the water erosion prediction program wepp model,the project would increase erosion rates,but would have little impact on overall erosion and continuous inspection by usfs soil experts would ensure project compliance.
these statements are supported by five documents in the administrative record.john rawinski,a forest soil scientist,provided reports for two investigations he conducted.the first discusses soil conditions on and around an existing road that could be used for the project.the second details his inspection of an area excluded from the project due to its landslide potential.the third document is a collection of notes and reports from prior projects discussing soil conditions in the project area.fourth,a report from geotechnical engineer michael burke discusses landslide potential in two areas that were subsequently excluded from the project.finally,a report also authored by rawinski provides erosion rate estimates using the wepp model.
many individuals and groups,including forest guardians,submitted comments to usfs with respect to the project.private abutting landowners randal mckown,and alice and gilbert duran submitted comments about noise,traffic,and dust that would be generated by logging trucks.responding to the private landowners in the final eis,usfs noted that the project would have temporary effects to recreation users and private land owners adjacent to the proposed treatment areas,especially during the active timber sales with heavy truck traffic on the roads leading into the sale areas.
on the same day it issued the final eis,usfs filed its record of decision.several environmental groups along with a number of private landowners,challenged the project in an administrative appeal.after usfs denied that appeal,forest guardians filed a suit in federal district court alleging usfs violated the nfma by failing to collect mis population data usfs violated the nfma by failing to meaningfully analyze whether the project meets the soil productivity standard usfs violated the nfma by deficiently analyzing the project impact on stream health and usfs violated nepa by failing to adequately analyze certain indirect and cumulative effects of the project.intermountain forest association,intermountain resources,llc,and mountain valley lumber,intervened on behalf of usfs.on december,the district court issued an order and judgment rejecting forest guardians claims and denying them relief.forest guardians now appeal the district court denial of relief on their first,second,and fourth claims.
when,as here,a district court decision is based on its review of the administrative record,we conduct our review de novo.utah envtl.cong.bosworth,cir uec iii.forest guardians challenge usfs approval of the project under the administrative procedures act apa,et.the apa mandates that agency action be set aside when it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.we must determine whether the challenged action was based on consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.marsh or.natural res.council,d quotation omitted.in doing so,we afford substantial deference to agencies interpretations of their own regulations.uec iii,at.
forest guardians initial claim is that usfs violated the nfma consistency provision by failing to collect actual mis population data before approving the county line project.nfma requires that all contracts for the use and occupancy of national forest system lands shall be consistent with the land management plans.i.in this case,the relevant land management plan is the rio grande national forest land and resource management plan,including the amendment.
forest guardians advance a argument.first,they contend,the forest plan amendment incorporated the regulations,specifically the version of.second,they cite utah envtl.cong.bosworth,cir,uec i for the proposition that the version of requires usfs to collect actual mis population data for activities,rather than relying on estimates.see id.at.thus,they claim that the forest plan requires the collection of actual population data prior to a project approval.
forest plans may require particular standards to be followed regardless of later changes in the regulations.ecology,forest,cir.if a forest plan adopts the language of a generally applicable regulation,that language remains binding on usfs regardless of subsequent regulatory amendments,until the forest plan itself is altered.plaintiffs in both ecology ctr.and uec iii advanced claims similar to forest guardians argument here however,in both prior cases we determined that the forest plans at issue did not adopt the regulations.uec iii,at.the same is true in this case.
forest guardians cite several documents that reference the regulations the environmental assessment for the amendment,the decision of no significant impact for that amendment,and the specialist report for mis compiled for the county line project.but the forest plan itself does not explicitly incorporate the regulations.nor do the forest plan requirements track the language of the regulations.rather,the forest plan mandates,periodic monitoring of mis.such monitoring may include direct observation,but reliance on dow or mcb surveys is also permitted.
the disconnect between the usfs planning documents,which specifically note that the purpose of the amendment was to adopt the version of,and the forest plan itself,which does not require actual population data at the project level,is easily explained.in,before we determined that usfs was required to collect actual population data at the,see uec i,at,usfs took the position that the regulations did not require actual counting.see utah envtl.cong.bosworth,cir uec ii prior to uec i,the forest service contended that it need not conduct of mis in a planning area because it had discretion to assess a project effects on mis using habitat data,population data,or both.at the time it drafted the amendment planning documents,usfs believed the mis monitoring requirements included in the forest plan,which do not mandate head counts,complied with the regulations.although we later held that usfs position on the regulations was incorrect in uec i,our holding in that case does not control our interpretation of the forest plan.
because the forest plan does not incorporate the regulations,we must look to the plan itself,not the code of federal regulations or our case law,to determine whether usfs complied with its duties.comparing the text of the forest plan with usfs actions,we conclude that it did.with respect to the rio grande cutthroat trout,usfs relied on colorado dow surveys for trend data,precisely as directed by the forest plan.for the trout populations closest to the project area,usfs considered prior survey data from and,both within the plan review cycle.mule deer and rocky mountain elk population data were also based on colorado dow surveys,as directed by the forest plan.finally,usfs relied on mcb surveys for mis bird data.the forest plan includes such surveys in its list of acceptable bird monitoring techniques.although the plan includes a footnote indicating that monitoring of mis birds will be conducted as applicable,forest guardians do not argue that this notation required monitoring in this case.accordingly,usfs complied with the forest plan directives.
forest guardians advances a second nfma consistency claim.they argue usfs failed to provide substantial evidence for its conclusion that the project would comply with the forest plan soil requirements.agency decisions must be based on substantial evidence,which is evidence sufficient to justify,if the trial were to a jury,a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion to be drawn is one of fact.olenhouse commodity credit,cir quotation omitted.evidence is not substantial if it constitutes mere conclusion.id.at.
usfs argues that forest guardians have forfeited this claim by failing to adequately present their objection during administrative proceedings.plaintiffs must exhaust administrative procedures before filing suit against usfs.see e parties generally must structure their participation so that it alerts the agency to the parties position and contentions,in order to allow the agency to give the issue meaningful consideration.dep t of transp.pub.citizen,d quoting.yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,d omission and alteration omitted.claims not properly raised before an agency are waived,unless the problems underlying the claim are obvious,id.at,or otherwise brought to the agency attention,see.lodging rest.ass dep t of the interior,d,holding that the presence of third party comments addressing an issue put an agency on notice.in order to satisfy exhaustion requirements,a plaintiff must present its claim to usfs in sufficient detail to allow the agency to rectify the alleged violation.see native ecosystems council dombeck,cir kleissler forest,cir.
in response to the draft eis for the county line project,forest guardians submitted a comment listing a number of complaints.with respect to the soil standard,they stated 
the water conservation practices handbook further requires that no more than of the soils in any watershed be detrimentally compacted,eroded,or displaced.yet the draft eis discloses that of the level watershed of concern rio de los pinos tributary will be affected under the selected alternative.further,the draft eis notes that more than of the total watershed disturbance will occur,flatly violating the watershed conservation practices handbook 
the draft eis notably calculates the total equivalent distur
