this matter involves the city of los angeles city attempt to install a sewer line outside of its territorial limits in an unincorporated area of los angeles county county.the county sought a writ of mandate and declaratory relief against the city to halt construction of the proposed sewer line.the trial court granted the county writ petition,enjoining the city from proceeding without first obtaining the county consent or a judicial determination of the terms and conditions and location for the use of the county street.we conclude the trial court misinterpreted the applicable statutory framework and employed the wrong standard of review.accordingly,we reverse and remand with directions.
sewage from coastal areas of the city are pumped to the hyperion treatment plant in playa del rey via the venice pumping plant.the venice pumping plant is the largest wastewater pumping plant in the city and its existing inch diameter force main sewer line can only handle about percent of the flows coming from the plant.the inch sewer pipe has been in continuous operation since it was built in because it is the only feasible way to convey sewage flows to the hyperion treatment plant.if flows into the venice pumping plant exceed flows out of the plant,there is a risk that wastewater will overflow directly into ballona lagoon.this nearly happened during heavy storms in and.
in an effort to address the maintenance needs of the existing inch pipeline and provide additional capacity,the city proposed to install a new inch diameter sewer pipe running under via marina from the venice pump plant via marina route.the via marina route would run primarily under city streets,but a small portion of it would run underneath public streets and a public parking lot located in an unincorporated area of the county.the city considered several routes for the new pipeline,including one that ran solely under city streets pacific avenue route and one that ran along the beach.due to environmental concerns relating to the beach route,the pacific avenue route and the via marina route were the only two options seriously considered by the city.the city council ultimately approved construction of the sewer pipeline along the via marina route on january.although it appears the county was aware of the city plans throughout the proceedings,the county never agreed to them.
as a result,the county filed a petition for writ of mandate on february,alleging violations of public utilities code sections and the california environmental quality act ceqa as well as a complaint for declaratory relief.the county alleged the city failed to seek its approval as required under section to construct the pipeline or seek a judicial determination of its rights under section.the county alleged that the pacific avenue route was the environmentally superior route and would have the least impact.a first amended petition was filed on july.the city demurred on the ground that sections and did not apply because it properly exercised its police power to construct the sewer pipeline outside of city limits.the city also argued that section permitted the city to construct the sewer pipeline along the via marina route because it was necessary and convenient.the trial court overruled the demurrer.
following extensive briefing and argument,the trial court granted the county petition for writ of mandate by order dated july.while the trial court rejected the county ceqa challenge,it found the city violated the public utilities code when it failed to obtain the county permission to use the via marina route or seek a judicial determination about the project.the city timely appealed.
discussion 
on appeal,the city contends it may locate a sewer line under county land pursuant to its police powers and sections to of the public utilities code.while we are not persuaded that the city has absolute authority to pursue such an extraterritorial incursion,we conclude that section permits the city to locate its sewer lines under county land where it is a necessary or convenient part of the proposed works.
the city first relies on southern cal.gas company city of cal d,southern cal.gas to argue that its police powers grant it absolute authority to extend its sewer line into county territory.in southern cal.gas,the supreme court explained,the power of a city to provide sewage disposal services is one of a city most important government powers and is one of the few powers it may exercise outside of its territorial limits without express authorization.id.at.contrary to the city position,southern cal.gas does not override or contradict the public utilities code.indeed,it is easily harmonized with sections to.as discussed below,the public utilities code allows a city to locate sewage disposal services outside of its jurisdictional limits without express authorization,subject either to judicial determination under section or the necessary or convenient exception articulated in section,depending on whether the sewer is to be located under the land of another municipality or in unincorporated land,respectively.the southern cal.gas court did not address these sections of the public utilities code and was not presented with this factual scenario.
we therefore consider the duties and powers granted to the city by the public utilities code to approve the via marina route.in the course of our analysis,we also consider a trial court duties and powers in reviewing the city decision.we start with our obligations as a court of appeal.
standard of review 
interpretation of a statute presents a question of law that we review de novo.carrancho california air resources board th,d carrancho.in interpreting a statute,our primary duty is to give effect to the intent of the legislature,so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.to determine intent,courts turn first to the words themselves,giving them their ordinary and generally accepted meaning.citation.if the language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,the court then looks to extrinsic aids,such as the object to be achieved and the evil to be remedied by the statute,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citation.ultimately,the court must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and it must avoid an interpretation leading to absurd consequences.citation.in re luke th,d.
t he plain meaning rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other provisions of the statute.the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute.the intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.citations.lungren deukmejian cal d.
ii.statutory framework 
given the above rules,we now turn to the language of the statute itself.the public utilities code grants the city a right to construct a sewer line outside of its territorial limits within certain parameters.section provides there is granted to every municipal corporation of the state the right to construct,operate,and maintain sewers and sewer mains,all with the necessary appurtenances,across,along,in,under,over,or upon any road,street,alley,avenue,or highway,and across,under,or over any railway,canal,ditch,or flume which the route of such works intersects,crosses,or runs along,in such manner as to afford security for life and property.section requires a municipality to restore the road,street,alley,avenue,highway,canal,ditch,or flume so used to its former state of usefulness as nearly as may be,and shall locate its use so as to interfere as little as possible with other existing uses of a road,street,alley,
