this case arises from a dispute over scientific methodology.cascadia wildlands and other environmental groups cascadia appeal from the district court denial of their motion seeking to enjoin the douglas fire complex recovery project recovery project in the southern oregon klamath mountains.cascadia specifically challenges the biological opinion issued by the united states fish and wildlife service the service.because cascadia has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits,we affirm.
background 
a.the recovery project 
the douglas complex fire burned approximately acres of federal and land in oregon klamath mountains.in response,the medford district of the bureau of land management bureau initiated the recovery project aimed at salvaging burned acreage.the bureau completed a douglas complex fire recovery project environmental assessment,and solicited public comment,which cascadia timely provided.subsequently,the bureau issued a record of decision and finding of no significant impact approving the douglas complex fire recovery project.this finding authorized the salvage logging of approximately acres of or injured trees,including hazard tree removal to which cascadia does not object,and logging of interior forests for economic benefit.the bureau also consulted with the service,after conducting a biological assessment and determining that the recovery project may affect and is likely to adversely affect the northern spotted owl and its critical habitat.the service in turn issued a biological opinion,which concluded in part 
t he proposed project is likely to incidentally take adult and up to young spotted owls at seven sites.the take is in the form of harm caused by habitat destruction or degradation via timber harvest of up to acres of nesting,roosting,and foraging habitat and acres of foraging habitat that is likely to significantly disrupt the breeding,feeding,and sheltering behavior of these spotted owls to an extent that causes injury or death.
nevertheless,the biological opinion concluded that the recovery project was not likely to result in jeopardy to the species or destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.
district court decision 
the district court denied cascadia motion for a preliminary injunction,finding that cascadia failed to adequately establish that it was likely to succeed on the merits,that there were serious questions going to the merits,or that irreparable harm to the spotted owl was likely.
barred owls effect on the northern spotted owl 
cascadia primary argument focused on barred owls,which are predators of the northern spotted owl.cascadia contended that when barred owls are present,northern spotted owls are less likely to respond to survey calls cascadia submitted that the service failed to account for this possibility and underestimated the number of spotted owls sites by relying on false no occupancy determinations.cascadia wildlands thrailkill,d,internal quotation marks omitted.
the court disagreed with cascadia contention that the service no jeopardy conclusion was arbitrary and capricious,finding that the service adequately acknowledge d and account ed for the potential impact of barred owls on spotted owl detectability id.the court observed that the biological opinion specifically referenced the presence of barred owls and the effect of barred owls presence.
the court found that the service utilized the best available scientific information a series of and uniform bureau surveys.the consistent nature of the surveys provided surveyors with accurate site locations and movement patterns of the owl in the area of the proposed action.the service also recommended that the bureau continue the survey process during the upcoming survey season to further inform project planning.cascadia did not assert that the service failed to identify the best available scientific information,and did not cite alternative occupancy data.the court found that the service approval of the salvage project was not arbitrary,capricious,or otherwise in violation of the law.
wildfire effect on northern spotted owl habitat 
cascadia asserted that the best available scientific data suggests that following a wildfire,the northern spotted owl expands its core areas and home ranges including roosting and foraging sites.as a result,the required habitat area would also increase.
the court found that the record did not support cascadia contention that the service failed to consider this data.the court determined that the service fully considered the possibility that the spotted owl may have expanded or shifted its areas and home ranges.although cascadia failed to produce any evidence that the home ranges actually did expand,the service examined and analyzed a variety of data from the study area to locate,to its best estimation,the sites where shifts may have occurred.
the court concluded that the one study cascadia cited did not support cascadia argument.indeed,that study found no significant differences between areas and home ranges in and around areas.the court observed that the service examined home range circles that were twice as large as those described in the cited study,and areas that were four times the size of those in the study.thus,the court found the service methodology appropriate to evaluate any potential shifts in home range due to wildfires.
the court was not swayed by cascadia other documentary evidence.the court concluded that an email from a bureau official discussing movement of a single owl due to the presence of a barred owl was not evidence of expansion or shifting of ranges due to the douglas complex fire.moreover,the bureau was aware of and tracked the single owl,completely accounting for its movement.similarly,an internal service memorandum suggesting that some owls could move because of the new conditions created by the douglas complex fire did not undermine the service analysis.the service anticipated and accounted for these potential shifts by surveying larger home range and areas and by using,intensive spotted owl demographic studies on the action area.with this data,the service identified spotted owls at eight of fourteen sites that could potentially shift.because the service adequately and lawfully accounted for the effect of wildfire on spotted owl site locations,the court concluded that the service decisions regarding owl habitat were not arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.
endangered species act procedural requirements 
cascadia argued that the service failed to comply with the procedural requirements of the endangered species act because it did not assess the effects of the proposed action on six known spotted owl sites that overlap the planning area,but not the salvage units explain why it used two different methods for assessing effects to the species and consistently apply its effects analysis methodologies.
the court rejected cascadia arguments,finding that the service appropriately assessed the sites around the spotted owl nesting areas and appropriately defined the action area to include the home ranges of known spotted owl sites that could be impacted.of the historical nest sites within the action area,only would be affected by any salvage treatment or construction work.of the six sites that overlapped the action area,none of them would be affected by the habitat modifications in recovery project areas.cascadia did not contend otherwise.rather,cascadia argued that the service miscalculated the nesting,roosting,and foraging coverage at the home range and areas.however,as the court noted,the calculations urged by cascadia were guidelines rather than fixed formulas.
in addition,the service took into consideration other factors,beyond the amount of remaining nesting,roosting,and foraging habitat,including the condition of the habitat the amount of foraging habitat left or slated for removal and its proximity to the critical habitat owl occupancy in the action area and other abiotic factors like stream distance,elevations,and slope positions.the service also evaluated the relative habitat suitability to determine owl of an area.areas that were unlikely to be affected by the recovery project were to be left relatively intact,thereby supporting a higher level of site occupancy and habitat fitness potential.despite cascadia contentions that several sites were occupied by the northern spotted owl,the record surveys proved otherwise.
the court rejected cascadia argument that the recovery project will remove more than minimal foraging at two sites.it also rejected cascadia contention that the service not likely to adversely affect determination was arbitrary and capricious.mindful of the deference due to the service on scientific matters,the court declined to substitute cascadia definition of minimal for that employed by the service.the court explained that habitat must be evaluated in relationship to the remaining habitat.for example,one site was slated to have a total of acres of foraging land removed from the home range,but the areas most impacted were in a low relative habitat suitability area.only approximately acres of the total foraging land would be removed from the area.for another site,only acres of foraging land would be removed from the home range s,and none from the area s.the court determined that the service credibly determined that the proposed foraging removals were minimal in nature and that the recovery project was not likely to adversely affect the spotted owl at the respective sites.
finally,the court was not convinced by cascadia contention that the service inconsistently applied its methodology to determine when a take had transpired at a respective spotted owl site the service had concluded that spotted owls were not likely to occupy the site where the no take determination was made,but were likely to occupy the site where the take determination was made.the court concluded that the service rationale was not arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.
recovery plan for the northern spotted owl 
cascadia final argument regarded what it perceives to be an inconsistency between the service determination that the project would not jeopardize the spotted owl and the recovery measures identified in the service northern spotted owl recovery plan recovery plan.
in,the service devised the recovery plan for the spotted owl population.the recovery plan included various recovery actions.recovery actions are recommendations to guide the activities needed to accomplish the recovery objectives and achieve the recovery criteria such that a species may be delisted from endangered species act protection.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
recovery action instructs agencies to c onserve spotted owl sites and high value spotted owl habitat to provide additional demographic support to the spotted owl population.the intent of this recovery action is to protect,enhance,and develop habitat in the quantity and distribution necessary to provide for the recovery of spotted owls id.citation omitted.
recovery action directs that i n lands where management is focused on development of spotted owl habitat,silvicultural activities should concentrate on conserving and restoring habitat elements that take a long time to develop,large trees,medium and large snags,downed wood id.citation omitted.
the court initially reasoned that cascadia claims regarding recovery actions and must fail because recovery plans do not have the force of law,a point cascadia conceded at oral argument in the district court.pursuant to the endangered species act,the service jeopardy analysis should consider whether a particular action is reasonably likely to appreciably reduce the likelihood of both survival and recovery of a listed species id.at citing.the court explained that the jeopardy analysis is not focused on whether the federal action would itself implement or bring about recovery,and thus,the court rejected cascadia attempt to conflate jeopardy with recovery.id.
the court also found that the biological opinion was consistent with recovery actions and.consistent with recovery action,the bureau and the service examined the known affected sites and for the top tier of the identified sites,avoided and mitigated recovery project impacts by excluding over acres of foraging land from salvage activity.the bureau avoided road and landing construction within the high priority spotted owl areas.the bureau concentrated its salvage activities on spotted owl sites with established results for several years prior to the fire.in sum,the bureau mitigated the potential adverse effects to the spotted owl and its habitat,consistent with recovery action.
the court similarly concluded that the biological opinion discussed and properly implemented recovery action.the bureau excluded any acres that were subject to low severity fire in the areas allocated for salvage activity,as these sites were likely to be frequented by the spotted owl.this exclusion left a significant portion of action area land with both burned and green legacy features,snags,downed wood,which is important to the spotted owl development and future nesting,roosting,and foraging habitat.id.at.conversely,approximately percent of the area within the fire perimeter was burned by medium to high severity fire,and within this smaller area only eight percent is subject to harvest.the bureau also took special snag related precautions with regard to the areas set for harvest.id.
the court denied cascadia motion for a preliminary injunction after considering all arguments presented by the parties.cascadia filed a timely appeal,and a motion in the district court for an injunction pending appeal.despite the court concern that it lacked jurisdiction to grant the relief requested by cascadia,it proceeded to address the motion on its merits.the court explained that cascadia was asking the court to reconsider its previous order denying cascadia motion for a preliminary injunction,as cascadia reiterated many of the same arguments that were previously submitted to the court.ultimately,the court found that cascadia failed to satisfy its burden to prove that it was likely to succeed on the merits it was likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief the balance of equities tipped in its favor and an injunction was in the public interest.as in its previous order,the court found that the biological opinion,which was at the center of cascadia argument,was thorough,reasoned,and reflective of an analysis of the issues pertaining to the impact of the recovery project on the spotted owl.order denying pl.mot.for injunction pending appeal,ecf.

iii.discussion 
section of the endangered species act directs that federal agencies conserve species listed as endangered or threatened,and whenever a federal action could affect an endangered or threatened species,the agency involved must consult the service with jurisdiction over the relevant listed species.see a.here,the fish and wildlife service was the appropriate consulting agency because it is responsible for administering the statute with respect to terrestrial wildlife.see b see also pyramid lake paiute tribe of indians dep t of the navy,cir noting that the national marine fisheries service administers the endangered species act only as to marine species and anadromous fish listed in a and building industry ass of the bay area dep t of commerce,cir.pursuant to this directive,the service issued a biological opinion examining the required factors,such as the current status of the listed species,its critical habitat,and effects of the proposed action.the service employed several methodologies to examine the effect of the proposed action on the spotted owl,and ultimately determined that there was no jeopardy and no adverse modification
