we must decide whether the united states forest service properly denied owners access to their patented mining claims within the kootenai national forest in montana.
alan skranak and james skranak the skranaks currently own the tract consisting of four mining claims in the kootenai national forest in montana.the united states granted a patent on one in and on the other three in.a wide wagon road was built to the tract in.the road has long since been closed to motorized traffic and now functions as the trail.
henry skranak,the skranaks father,bought the tract in and has had numerous with the forest service over issues of access in his efforts to work the mining claims.in henry skranak requested a special use permit under the alaska national interest land conservation act anilca to construct a access road on and near the trail.the forest service considered the request and its potential effects on endangered species,water quality,and recreation,among other concerns.the forest service decided to allow the road to be built,but along a different,route,in order to minimize its impact.road construction would only be permitted from june to october in each year.the forest service promised to issue an easement good for a period and renewable thereafter upon completion of construction,estimated to be within two to three years.in order to protect grizzlies,the forest service would permit only vehicle round trips from june to september,and round trips from september to november,with unlimited access in the winter.use would be forbidden from april to june.
charles harpole owns the wayup mine tract,consisting of two mining claims which the united states patented in.currently,a primitive road off of forest road fr provides access.fr is open year round to motorized traffic,but is in need of maintenance and reconstruction.the forest service states that fr was built sometime between and,and has not been maintained for years.the road is miles long and in need of significant work before it can be used by motorized traffic.
beginning in,harpole worked the mining claims episodically.during such times,the forest service allowed him to have access but required that he obtain a permit.the forest service has blocked access entirely during those periods in which harpole was not using it.
in,after nearly a decade of inactivity,harpole applied for a special use permit under anilca to reconstruct and to use fr and the road.the forest service considered the request and its potential effects on endangered species,water quality,and recreation,among other concerns and granted harpole permit,but with conditions.road construction would only be permitted from june to october in each year.the forest service promised to issue an easement good for a period and renewable thereafter upon completion of construction,estimated to be within two to three years.in order to protect grizzlies,the forest service would permit only vehicle round trips from april to june,vehicle round trips from june to september,and vehicle round trips from september to november,with unlimited access in the winter.
henry skranak and harpole appealed from the denial of unconditional permits,complaining that the special use permits either took or ignored their easements.they also complained that they ought not to bear the cost of improving forest service roads that would become accessible to the public.the forest service denied their joint administrative appeal.
at that point,the skranaks their father having died and ownership of the tract having passed to them filed suit in district court to quiet title to an easement to the tract under the quiet title act and to challenge the forest service permit as arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act apa.in a separate action,harpole raised similar quiet title act and apa claims with respect to the wayup mine.
on cross motions in the two respective actions,the district court granted summary judgments in favor of the forest service.the district court held that neither the skranaks or harpole had owned an easement under any theory that if they did,anilca had extinguished it and,with respect to the apa claims,that the conditions on the permits were reasonable.harpole and the skranaks have timely appealed.
as the district court should have,we forbear any consideration of the skranaks and harpole easement claims under the quiet title act until we determine whether we have jurisdiction.the skranaks and harpole filed suit on those claims on december.the quiet title act contains a statute of limitations.g.therefore,the skranaks and harpole claims are barred if they knew or should have known of the united states adverse claim by december.
such bar is jurisdictional.the quiet title act is a waiver of sovereign immunity.if the statute of limitations has run on a waiver of sovereign immunity,federal courts lack jurisdiction.block north dakota,d see also adams united states,cir adams i holding that a district court grant of summary judgment to the government on a quiet title act claim was improper because the statute of limitations had run,removing jurisdiction.although the united states did not move to dismiss the quiet title act claim on statute of limitations grounds below,jurisdictional bars can not be waived by the parties and may be addressed sua sponte.humboldt county united states,cir.before reaching the merits,then,we must decide whether the skranaks and harpole have actions to quiet title that accrued before december.
we have given significant guidance as to when a quiet title act statute of limitations begins running in mcfarland norton,at,wl cir.we pointed out that the government,in its capacity as the owner of the alleged servient tenement,has the right to reasonable use of its land,and we concluded that mild interference with the use of an easement pursuant to the government own property interests will not start the statute of limitations running.id.at,wl.more importantly,we explained that federal agencies like the forest service often have regulatory powers over easements and other property interests,including,presumably,the ability to require permits and put conditions on use.see,clouser espy,cir holding that confers broad powers on the forest service to regulate roads for the good of the forests.therefore,to avoid forcing landowners and the government into premature and often unnecessary suits over title,michel,at,we concluded that government regulatory or supervisory actions,as opposed to those that deny the easement existence,will trigger the statute of limitations.mcfarland,at,wl.
since the statute of limitations issue was not addressed in the district court,the record is not well developed.even on the current scanty record,however,we are able to determine that the skranaks action to quiet title accrued before.by the,at the latest,the forest service had converted the road into a trail usable only for hiking and riding.although merely barring the public vehicular access would not have necessarily been inconsistent with the skranaks easement affirmatively converting the road to a trail barred not only the public vehicular access but the owner use of the alleged easement as well.because converting the road to a trail barred access in a way that was neither temporary nor obviously overcome by the securing of a permit or special permission,the skranaks should then have been put on notice.in addition,henry skranak appears to have been well aware that the forest service was adverse to his claimed right of access.in he stated that he ha d been denied access to his property for more than years.in a letter,he complained that d ue to the policy of the department of agriculture and the forest service over the years,we have been barred out by berms,kelly ditches,arrests and fines.such was sufficient to start the statute of limitations running and thus to defeat the skranaks ability to bring a quiet title action.therefore,the grant of summary judgment against the skranaks on their quiet title act claim must be vacated and the district court is instructed to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
in harpole case,what evidence there is tends to suggest that p
