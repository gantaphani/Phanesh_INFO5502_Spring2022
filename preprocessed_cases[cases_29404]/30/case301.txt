over years ago,the natural resources conservation service nrcs working with local sponsors,devised a project to provide watershed protection,flood prevention,and recreation along the lost river subwatershed.the proposed project involved a combination of measures and five dams and impoundments.in,the nrcs issued an environmental impact statement relating to the project,and since that time,three dams and most of the measures have been completed.after preparing a supplemental environmental impact statement in,the nrcs issued a record of decision that eliminated one of the remaining dams from the project and authorized construction of the final dam for the added purpose of providing water supply.appellants,seven individuals who allege that their land will be adversely affected by this final dam construction,filed this action contending that the nrcs has failed to comply with the national environmental policy act nepa.they now appeal the district court order granting appellees motion for summary judgment.because we determine that the nrcs has complied with the procedures mandated by the nepa and taken a hard look at the project environmental effects,we affirm.
the nepa is a procedural statute that sets forth a regulatory scheme for major federal actions that may significantly affect the natural environment.audubon soc y dep t of the navy,cir.its procedural mandates serve dual purposes.id.they ensure that an agency planning a major federal action obtains and considers the necessary information concerning any significant environmental impacts that the action may cause.hodges abraham,cir.they also guarantee that the public has access to the relevant information about the proposed action so that it can participate in the decisionmaking process.id.
under the nepa,every federal agency contemplating a major action must formulate an environmental impact statement eis if the action could significantly affect the environment.robertson methow valley citizens council,see also c.an eis must contain certain information specified by federal statute and regulations promulgated by the council of environmental quality ceq,a governmental body created by the nepa.audubon soc y,at hodges,at.this information includes the environmental effects and impacts of the proposed action,reasonable alternatives to it,possible mitigation measures for any negative environmental impacts that will result from it,and the cumulative impacts of it combined with other past,present,or foreseeable future actions.audubon soc y,at citations omitted.
when preparing an eis,an agency must follow procedures established by the ceq.id.these procedures require that an agency draft an eis in stages.id.the process begins with the agency publishing in the federal register a notice of intent to prepare and consider an eis.then the agency must engage in a scoping process designed to determine the scope of the issues to be addressed in the eis and to identify significant issues related to the proposed action.id.during the scoping process,the agency must,among other things,invite participation and input by federal,state,and local agencies,as well as the public.see also citizens comm.to save our canyons forest,cir.utilizing information acquired during the scoping process,the agency is then to prepare an initial draft eis,which it must make publicly available and circulate to other agencies for feedback.a.after doing so,the agency must draft a final eis that addresses any comments.id.b.

finally,after the agency makes a decision regarding the action,it must publish a record of decision,at which point it may then finalize its action.audubon soc y,at.as a purely procedural statute,the nepa does not mandate particular results,but simply prescribes the necessary process.robertson,at.in that sense,it does not force an agency to reach substantive,outcomes,meaning that as long as the agency adequately considers a proposed project adverse environmental effects,it may choose to pursue the project if it decides that the benefits outweigh them.audubon soc y,at.simply put,the nepa merely prohibits uninformed rather than unwise agency action.robertson,at.
with this regulatory framework in mind,we now address the underlying events giving rise to this appeal.
in december,congress enacted the flood control act of,ch,stat,authorizing the construction and operation of certain dam and reservoir projects.cent.power,se.power,cir.among the authorized projects were works of improvement for and waterflow retardation,and prevention for various specified watersheds,including the potomac river watershed.stat.at.the dispute here involves a project on the lost river,a part of the potomac river watershed situated in hardy county,west virginia.
pursuant to this grant of authority,the nrcs,upon application by local sponsoring organizations developed the lost river subwatershed project project.in october,after circulating a draft for comment,the nrcs issued a final eis eis related to the project.in it,the nrcs observed that the lost river subwatershed was incurring damage from erosion,sedimentation,and frequent floods.it also recognized the need for more recreational opportunities in the area.the nrcs thus identified three overarching purposes underlying the project watershed protection,flood prevention,and recreation.
additionally,in the eis,the nrcs analyzed six alternatives,including the alternative of no action,before settling on a plan that involved applying measures to acres and constructing five dams and impoundments on designated sites.four of the dams,located on sites,and,were to be structures.the fifth dam,located on site,was to be a floodwater storage and recreation structure.the nrcs described the project anticipated environmental impacts and recognized that it would require relocating eleven residences.the nrcs also considered and responded to comments received by various governmental agencies.
also in october,the nrcs and the local project sponsors released a work plan for implementing the project.they discovered,however,that local support for the project was lacking,prompting them to suspend its implementation.in,the nrcs noted in a letter that revival of the project would primarily depend on a decision by the local sponsors to proceed.after serious flooding in caused damage along the lost river,the project sponsors requested that the nrcs resume implementation of the project,so it did.
in august,the nrcs issued an environmental assessment ea,which is a document that an agency prepares to assist its planning and decisionmaking or to determine whether an eis is necessary,c.in the ea,the nrcs reevaluated potential environmental impacts relating to site,the first dam scheduled for construction.a little over a year later,the nrcs drafted a supplemental information report analyzing whether there had been any significant changes to the project as a whole or whether any significant environmental changes had occurred since issuance of the eis.it concluded that there had been no such changes and determined that the eis still adequately described the project and its impacts.nevertheless,in this report,the nrcs addressed some insignificant environmental changes and changes with respect to the costs,benefits,and opportunities for incidental recreation.
the nrcs issued a record of decision in january approving implementation of the project.a federal lawsuit was then brought challenging the project and the planned construction of the dam at site,but the parties ultimately agreed to dismiss the claims involving site with prejudice and the claims challenging the remainder of the sites without prejudice.in may,as site dam was under construction,the nrcs issued an environmental information report relating to the next dam scheduled for construction,the site dam.by,construction of the dams on sites and was complete,and measures had been applied to acres in accordance with the project.
the nrcs then turned its attention to construction of the dam at site.in,it issued an environmental assessment report ea primarily addressing this dam planned construction.the nrcs discussed a recent drought in the area that prompted the local sponsors to request that it add water supply as a purpose for the site dam.it evaluated the need for this additional purpose and the resultant effects of such a change.the nrcs considered three alternatives involving the use of surface water,groundwater,and water purchase agreements before concluding that adding water supply storage to the dam at site was the only practicable alternative for providing both water supply and flood prevention.
the hardy county public service district hcpsd,though not a local sponsor of the project,began planning the construction of the water distribution system as early as october,when it released a preliminary engineering report.the purpose of the system,which the usda agreed to fund partially,was to supply water to the central region of hardy county.to do so,it would utilize the water supply source from the dam at site.although construction of site dam was complete by,as of,construction of the water distribution and treatment system remained pending.
meanwhile,the nrcs and the local project sponsors continued to evaluate hardy county water resources.in april,the nrcs and the wvsca prepared a report entitled hardy county water resources assessment,which evaluated the existing and projected water needs for hardy county.also,in march,the local project sponsors,with assistance from the nrcs,issued a report entitled projected water needs in hardy county.this report concluded that adding water supply storages to the dams at sites and was necessary to meet the projected water demand.
in the local project sponsors requested that the nrcs add water supply and remove recreation as purposes for site dam.that same year,the nrcs issued a report reevaluating site and proposing its elimination.the changes to the site dam purposes and the proposed elimination of site required the nrcs to prepare a supplemental eis,so in the nrcs published a notice of intent to prepare such a statement and engaged in a scoping process.in april,after circulating a draft for comment,the nrcs published a final supplemental eis seis.the seis reflected changes in the purposes of the site dam to include flood control,water supply,and watershed protection,but not recreation.approximately two months later,the nrcs issued a record of decision however,the nrcs withdrew it almost two years later after the filing of a federal lawsuit challenging it.according to the nrcs,additional analyses and investigations involving site had become available,and it wanted to incorporate them into its supplemental eis.the district court thereafter dismissed the federal lawsuit pursuant to the parties stipulation.
in march,the nrcs published a notice of intent to update and reissue a second draft supplemental eis.it did not,however,engage in another scoping process.after distributing a draft for comment,the nrcs issued a second final supplemental eis in august seis.in it,the nrcs eliminated site from the project and added water supply as a purpose for the dam at site.although it removed recreation as a purpose,it recognized that site would still offer incidental recreational opportunities.as in the seis,the purposes of site dam were watershed protection,flood prevention,and water supply.the nrcs considered seventeen alternatives for achieving these purposes,but analyzed only two in detail,the alternative and construction of the dam at site.after considering the relative impacts of these two alternatives,including cumulative impacts,the nrcs recommended constructing the dam at site and described measures for mitigating its adverse impacts.in october,the nrcs issued a second record of decision agreeing to implement the project for site.
on november,appellants filed a complaint in the northern district of west virginia.named as defendants were the usda,nrcs,pvcd,hcc,and wvsca collectively,appellees.appellants challenged appellees decision to construct the dam at site and contended that they had failed to comply with the nepa.all appellants asserted that construction of the dam would not only affect their land,but would cause them to lose at least some,if not all,of it.after alleging numerous violations of the nepa,primarily relating to purported deficiencies in the seis,appellants requested declaratory and injunctive relief,costs,expenses,and attorneys fees.
in early,the parties filed for summary judgment.on june,the district court issued an order granting appellees motion for summary judgment and denying appellants.it addressed each alleged nepa violation before concluding that appellees complied with the nepa by abiding by its procedural requirements,taking a hard look at the environmental consequences that would result from construction of the dam at site,and allowing for public participation in the decisionmaking process.appellants brought this timely appeal.

on appeal,appellants raise essentially eight issues,which we address in turn.
appellants first contend that the nrcs failed to comply with the nepa in arriving at watershed protection,flood prevention,and water supply as its stated purposes and needs for constructing the dam at site.they maintain that the nrcs blindly accepted the purposes and needs provided by the local project sponsors without conducting an independent,objective inquiry.appellants also challenge as inadequate the evidence relied upon by the nrcs in justifying these purposes and needs.as a result,they insist that the nrcs stated purposes and needs for the dam at site are unreasonable.
an eis must briefly specify the underlying purpose and need to which the agency is responding in proposing the alternatives including the proposed action.only alternatives that accomplish the purposes of the proposed action are considered reasonable,and only reasonable alternatives require detailed study.wyoming dep t of,cir.so how the agency defines the purpose of the proposed action sets the contours for its exploration of available alternatives.see id.
agencies enjoy considerable discretion in defining the purposes and needs for their proposed actions,provided that they are reasonable.see,id.at parks conservation ass n,at citizens against burlington,busey.typically,a purpose is unreasonable when the agency defines it so narrowly as to allow only one alternative from among the environmentally benign ones in the agency power,such that the eis becomes essentially a foreordained formality.citizens against burlington,at.conceivably,a purpose can also be unreasonable if the agency draws it so broadly that an infinite number of alternatives would accomplish it and the project would collapse under the weight of the possibilities.id.but the potential for an agency to define a purpose that broadly appears remote,for agencies have a disincentive that assumedly would discourage them from doing so whereas drawing a purpose too narrowly is attractive because it eases the agency burden in drafting an eis by reducing the number of alternatives that it must explore in detail,drawing a purpose too broadly complicates an agency drafting of an eis by expanding the number of alternatives it must examine to a point that would make its task unmanageable.
in deciding on the purposes and needs for a project,it is entirely appropriate for an agency to consider the applicant needs and goals.see id.appellants,in arguing that the nrcs inappropriately relied upon the local project sponsors purposes and needs,seek support from the seventh circuit decision in simmons united states army corps of engineers,cir,where it stated that agencies have a duty under the nepa to exercise a degree of skepticism in dealing with statements from a prime beneficiary of the project.id.at quoting citizens against burlington,at buckley,dissenting in part internal quotation marks omitted.this decision,however,is of no assistance to appellants.contrary to their assertions,the nrcs conducted a searching,independent review of the stated purposes and needs for site dam,which demonstrates that it exercised a degree of skepticism in establishing them.
in explaining why watershed protection and flood prevention were necessary purposes and needs in the seis,the nrcs incorporated by reference,among other things,the eis and work plan,which explained in detail the floodwater,sediment,and erosion problems justifying the project.furthermore,the seis reaffirmed the continued need for measures to curb problems relating to flooding,noted the almost decennial occurrence of damaging floods in the area,and provided various maps and other investigative analyses in support.even if the nrcs did not provide precisely the information that appellants desire,it set forth enough of a discussion to demonstrate that it had a reasonable basis for deciding that watershed protection and flood prevention were appropriate purposes and needs for site dam.this discussion and its accompanying information reveal that the nrcs carefully considered including watershed protection and flood prevention as purposes and needs for the dam at site.
moreover,in the seis,the nrcs noted the local project sponsors request to add water supply as a purpose and need for the dam at site,and the sponsors explanation of why this addition was appropriate in light of population and development trends and projections in the area.in recognizing these trends and projections,the nrcs discussed the and reports on water resources in hardy county,both of which it assisted in preparing.collectively,these reports suggested that additional water supplies in the area were necessary and that water storage in the dams at sites and was required to meet demand.although appellants charge that these reports have not been updated and are likely overstated,they provide nothing beyond speculation that would call into question their findings.based on the nrcs discussion concerning the need for water supply and the supporting reports,we are confident that it adequately scrutinized whether adding water supply as a purpose and need was appropriate.
on the whole,it is evident that although the nrcs considered the local project sponsors goals and needs,as was appropriate,it nevertheless conducted its own searching inquiry into the purposes and needs for the site dam.it then framed the purposes and needs in a manner that was neither so narrow as to yield only one suitable alternative nor so broad as to produce an overwhelming and unmanageable number of alternatives.and,importantly,the nrcs purposes and needs for the dam at site are consistent with congress authorization in the flood control act.see citizens against burlington,at recognizing that when arriving at the purposes and needs for a proposed action agencies must consider their statutory authorization to act.in the end,therefore,the nrcs decision to include watershed protection,flood prevention,and water supply as the purposes and needs underlying site dam was an appropriate exercise of its discretion.
appellants next insist that the nrcs violated the nepa by failing to engage in a scoping process before issuing the seis.as noted,the goal of the scoping process is to identify specific issues to be addressed and studied by solicit ing comments and input from the public and other state and federal agencies.citizens comm.to save our canyons,at.agencies,however,are not required to engage in a scoping process when devising a supplemental eis,see c,but they may have to revise determinations made in an initial scoping process if they subsequently make substantial changes to the proposed action or if significant new circumstances or information bearing on the proposed action or its impacts arise,see id.c.
appellants acknowledge this general rule.their retort,however,is that the seis did not supplement the seis but instead replaced it.although they fail to elaborate further,we presume their argument to be that even though the nrcs undertook a scoping process prior to the seis,it needed to undertake one leading up to the seis because the seis replaced the seis.we disagree.
when it prepared the seis,the nrcs justifiably relied on the scoping determinations made leading to the seis.that the nrcs decided to withdraw its record of decision related to the seis and issue the seis does not operate to nullify the scoping process it had previously undertaken.like the seis before it,the seis supplemented the eis in light of the elimination of site and the addition of water supply as a purpose for the dam at site.as the nrcs acknowledged,the nature and extent of the action did not change between the seis and the seis.moreover,appellants do not highlight any significant new circumstances or information that arose during that time and would require revising the previous scoping determinations.the specific issues that the nrcs needed to study remained the same.simply put,nothing occurred after the scoping process leading to the seis that required the nrcs to revisit the scoping determinations when it prepared the seis.
in the absence of any such changes or new information or circumstances,requiring the nrcs to undertake another scoping process for the seis would exact needless costs and delay.the nepa imposes procedural mandates for the purpose of ensuring informed decisionmaking and public participation,not to impose red tape for its own sake.requiring the nrcs to engage in a new scoping process prior to preparing the seis would achieve the latter consequence but not the former purpose.we are therefore of the opinion that the nrcs was not required to engage in another scoping process when preparing the seis.
appellants third contention is that the seis omits information that is necessary for a complete analysis of the site dam potential environmental impacts and stated benefits.they specify a variety of missing information,mostly pertaining to details about the construction or operation of the dam at site.they also maintain the nrcs failed to consider connected actions in the seis specifically,the construction and operation of a water treatment facility and water distribution system 
at the outset,we reiterate that we may not seize upon trivial inadequacies to reject the agency decision,for that would impermissibly intrude into its decisionmaking prerogative.audubon soc y,at.put another way,d eficiencies in an eis that are mere flyspecks and do not defeat the nepa goals of informed decisionmaking and informed public comment will not lead to reversal.ex rel.richardson bureau of land,cir.
also,in assessing a claim that an agency has omitted information in an eis,we must further keep in mind that agencies are charged with concentrat ing on the issues that are truly significant to the action in question,rather than amassing needless detail.b see also id.eiss shall be analytic rather than encyclopedic.that is in part because an eis containing vast quantities of inconsequential information can actually defeat the nepa goals of informed decisionmaking and public participation by drowning out truly significant information with that which is insignificant.agencies therefore face a delicate balancing act they must include enough details about a proposed action to allow for the requisite hard look at its environmental effects without providing so much information that the eis becomes.except when prescribed by statute or regulations,deciding what details need to be included or omitted in an eis is generally a matter left to the agency discretion,which we will not disturb unless we are convinced that its exercise prevented the agency from taking a hard look at the action environmental effects or the public from participating in the decisionmaking process.
turning to the information appellants insist was missing,we note initially that the seis included at least some of it.for example,whereas appellants contend that the seis omitted information regarding the excavation of borrow material for use in constructing the dam,it in fact discussed where the borrow areas would be and provided a map showing their locations.and,similarly,notwithstanding appellants assertion that the seis did not provide the size and location of the construction site,it actually did describe the size of the site and its location and provided a project map showing the same.
to the extent the seis did not include the other information specified by appellants,we find the omissions to be inconsequential.the purportedly missing information includes such items as the n umber of workers needed for construction,the l ocation and distance of access roads,the l ocation and distance of utility,the t ype of construction equipment that would be used and for how long,and the l ocation and size of parking areas.appellants simply list the types of missing information without any explanation as to their significance or how their omission impedes the nepa goals of informed decisionmaking and public participation.and the consequentiality of their omission is not readily apparent to us.instead,they strike us as either needless detail that would clutter the seis or trivial deficiencies that invite flyspecking.in the end,the omission of this information does not disturb our belief that the nrcs took a hard look at the site dam environmental effects and that the public had adequate information to participate in the decisionmaking process.as a result,we will not the agency decision to omit it.
we also find unmeritorious appellants assertion that the nrcs violated the nepa by failing to consider as connected actions the construction and operation of a water treatment facility and water distribution system.
agencies must consider connected actions in the same eis.a.this requirement is intended to prevent agencies from engaging in segmentation,which involves an attempt to circumvent the nepa by breaking up one project into smaller projects and not studying the overall impacts of the single overall project.coal.on valley nuclear wastes chu,cir quoting stewart park reserve,slater,cir internal quotation marks omitted.connected actions include those that a utomatically trigger other actions which may require environmental impact statements c annot or will not proceed unless other actions are taken previously or simultaneously or a re interdependent parts of a larger action and depend on the larger action for their justification.a.generally,in determining whether actions are connected so as to require consideration in the same eis,courts employ an independent utility test,which asks whether each project would have taken place in the other absence.see,plains res.council,surface transp,cir chu,at wilderness workshop bureau of land,cir.if so,they have independent utility and are not considered connected actions.plains res.council,at.
appellants have failed to point to a water treatment facility or water distribution system connected to the construction of the dam at site.although appellants do not specifically argue that the hcpsd planned development of the water distribution system is a connected action,we nevertheless underscore that it is independent of the nrcs proposed action here.the nrcs emphasized when responding to comments in the seis that the hcpsd would implement its system regardless of whether the dam at site was constructed and,conversely,that the nrcs would add water supply to the dam at site even if the hcpsd abandoned its system.given that the water distribution system is independent of the nrcs construction of site dam,it is not a connected action.
furthermore,appellants have failed to demonstrate that any other water treatment facility or water distribution system has been planned,much less in connection with the dam at site.appellants apparently argue that because the site dam will include a water supply source,it will necessarily require such a facility and system in the future to service the source,so the nrcs should have considered them as connected actions.appellees,however,insist that there are no plans for such a facility or system,and appellants give us no reason to question this representation.in the absence of any impending plans to construct such a system or facility,segmentation is not a concern.see wilderness workshop,at army corps of eng rs,cir.and,furthermore,we fail to see how the agency could consider a water treatment facility and water distribution system,much less their impacts,when there are no current plans to build them.because such a project is speculative at best and any discussion of its impacts would be speculative,the agency was not required to discuss it as a connected action.see wyoming,at in general,we have not required agencies to consider speculative impacts or actions in an eis.
appellants next maintain that the nrcs failed to consider all reasonable alternatives in its seis.
at the heart of an eis is the required analysis of alternatives to the proposed action.c iii.in this section,the agency must r igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives.a.for alternatives that are unreasonable,the agency need only briefly discuss its reasons for eliminating them from detailed study.see id.hence,because alternatives that do not accomplish the purpose or objective of the action are unreasonable,they require only a brief explanation for their rejection.wyoming,at.also,the agency is not required to analyze the environmental consequences of alternatives it has in good faith rejected as too remote,speculative,or impractical or ineffective.id.omission in original quoting citizens comm.to save our canyons,at internal quotation marks omitted the agency,however,must always consider the alternative of no action.d.
we are confident that the nrcs considered all reasonable alternatives.throughout the project history,from the eis and the various supplements and reports that followed it to the seis,the nrcs studied numerous alternatives to its proposed action.in the seis specifically,the nrcs discussed seventeen alternatives.it offered appropriate reasons for eliminating all but two from detailed study,including,among other considerations,reasons related to technical feasibility,pecuniary costs,and effectiveness in achieving the purposes of the action.the nrcs then provided detailed examination of the alternative and the alternative involving construction of the dam at site.on its face,this discussion of alternatives complies with the mandates of the nepa.
appellants argue that the nrcs analysis is nevertheless deficient because it failed to give detailed study to two general types of alternatives.first,they maintain that the nrcs should have afforded detailed consideration to alternatives involving multiple actions that separately could achieve the individual purposes underlying the dam at site.in fact,in the seis,the nrcs considered alternatives that would provide flood control and water supply separately,but eliminated them from detailed consideration for various appropriate reasons described above.notably,appellants fail to offer a specific alternative involving multiple actions that the nrcs should have considered in detail.nor do they highlight a specific alternative that the nrcs eliminated from further consideration of which it should have provided detailed study.so we are left only to speculate that one might exist,which is an insufficient ground for disturbing the agency decision.we therefore are unconvinced that the nrcs improperly eliminated from detailed consideration alternatives involving multiple actions that could achieve site dam purposes individually.
second,appellants contend that the nrcs failed to consider alternatives involving other sites for the proposed dam within the lost river subwatershed.instead,according to appellants,the nrcs simply relied upon the eis consideration of thirty other locations,even though the purposes for the dam have changed.but that is inaccurate.in the seis,after noting that it examined thirty other locations leading up to the eis,the nrcs asserted that as part of its supplemental evaluation it had reconsidered whether the site and site locations were still the most viable alternatives.it observed that its reevaluation prompted it to eliminate site as infeasible.with respect to the dam at site,it determined that there were no new locations for impoundments that were viable and that would achieve the identified purposes and needs.appellants do not offer a location that would call into question this determination,so we defer to it.the nrcs thus was not required to give this alternative detailed consideration.
appellants assert that in the seis the nrcs failed to address all of the environmental effects that would result from construction of the dam at site in support,they list specific effects that they allege the nrcs neglected to consider.relatedly,according to appellants,the nrcs also did not conduct a sufficient analysis.
an eis must include a discussion of the environmental impact of the proposed action and any adverse environmental effects which can not be avoided should the proposal be implemented.c i ii.because t his section forms the scientific and analytic basis for the comparison of alternatives,it must include the environmental impacts of the alternatives,including the proposed action.
the ceq has instructed agencies on the types of impacts or effects the regulations treat these terms as synonymous that they must consider ecological such as the effects on natural resources and on the components,structures,and functioning of affected ecosystems,aesthetic,historic,cultural,economic,social,or health.id.agencies must study these effects whether they are direct,meaning that they are caused by the action and occur at the same time and place,or indirect,which means that they are caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in distance,but are still reasonably foreseeable.id.additionally,agencies have to examine cumulative impacts resulting from the incremental impact of the proposed action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions.id.yet although agencies must take into account effects that are reasonably foreseeable,they generally need not do so with effects that are merely speculative.wyoming,at.
after reviewing the seis,we are convinced that the nrcs took a hard look at the environmental effects that construction of the dam at site would have.the seis provided detailed analyses of the dam effects on the following flood damage public health and safety water supply,including its economic implications soil erosion and sedimentation agricultural productivity prime and unique farmland land use and upland habitats aquatic resources recreation riparian areas wetlands waters of the united states water quality threatened and endangered species invasive species historic,scientific,and cultural resources and environmental justice.the nrcs examined the effects of each with relation to both the alternative and the construction of the dam.
the seis also contained a analysis in which it discussed the environmental effects that construction of the dam at site would have in conjunction with the effects of five other projects in the area.contrary to appellants assertion,the nrcs considered the overall cumulative impact of these projects with respect to various environmental effects,including,but not limited to,effects on forestland,farmland,wetlands,and habitats.in the end,we are satisfied that the nrcs performed a thorough investigation into the action effects and candidly acknowledged its risks.
our opinion that the nrcs took a hard look at the environmental effects of constructing the dam at site is undisturbed by the specific effects that appellants contend the nrcs failed to discuss.it is again clear that the nrcs considered at least one of the sources of information that appellants insist is missing specifically,the impact that the dam would have on downstream fisheries.the nrcs,in its discussion of the site dam effects on aquatic resources,candidly acknowledged that the dam would result in a barrier to fish movement between the upper reaches of lower cove run and the lower sections of this stream and the main stem of the lost river.
other effects that appellants maintain are missing are either speculative or relatively inconsequential flyspecks.for instance,similar to their argument regarding connected actions,appellants assert that the nrcs should have considered the effects resulting from the construction of a new water treatment facility and water distribution system to service the water supply source at site dam.but,as we explained,such a system has not been planned and is speculative,making any effects resulting from it speculative as well.after reviewing the remainder of appellants list of purportedly unaddressed effects and considering the seis discussion of environmental effects holistically,we remain convinced that the nrcs took a hard look at the action environmental effects.
appellants assert that the nrcs included a misleading and inaccurate analysis.they highlight the following as contributing to its misleading nature the nrcs admitted that the usual design life for and structures is fifty to one hundred years,but in its analysis,it used a design life of one hundred years,the far end of the spectrum the nrcs ratio compared the costs and benefits of the project as a whole,not site specifically,which,according to appellants,may mask a less desirable ratio for site alone and the nrcs included as benefits over that would result from incidental recreation,even though it eliminated recreation as a purpose.
we have emphasized before that an agency must weigh a proposed action benefits with its environmental costs.see ohio valley envtl,at e ven agency action with adverse environmental effects can be nepa compliant so long as the agency has considered those effects and determined that competing policy values outweigh those costs.hughes
