the wildlife conservation board board paid million from the habitat conservation fund to the federal bureau of reclamation for the battle creek salmon and steelhead restoration project.outfitter properties,llc and rocky springs ranch,llc collectively outfitter subsequently filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking to vacate the board expenditure decision.the trial court denied the petition.
outfitter contends on appeal that fish and game code section,subdivision d section d limits expenditures from the habitat conservation fund to no more than million over any month period the board expenditure violated the million annual limit on allocations to state agencies set forth in section,subdivision f section f the legislature can not amend the million and million limits without the approval of of the members of both houses of the legislature and the trial court erred in considering documents that were not considered by the board in making its expenditure decision.
we conclude section d does not establish a million expenditure limit but instead gives the board limited discretion to make expenditures the board expenditure did not violate the million limit on allocations to state agencies because the expenditure was paid to the federal bureau of reclamation the budget act did not amend section d or section f and the evidence was admissible to assist the trial court in deciding outfitter challenge to the expenditure.
we will affirm the judgment.
background 
california salmon and trout populations have declined in recent decades partly because water projects have blocked fish access to natal streams.chinook salmon and steelhead trout have been listed as threatened or endangered species.
battle creek,a tributary of the sacramento river located in tehama and shasta counties,is an important habitat for anadromous salmon and trout because of its geology and hydrology.outfitter owns real property adjoining portions of the south fork of battle creek in tehama county.pacific gas and electric company pg e owns and operates the battle creek hydroelectric project,which includes diversion facilities on the north and south forks of battle creek.
recognizing the unique characteristics of battle creek and its importance to the restoration of salmon and trout populations in the sacramento river,the national marine fisheries service,federal bureau of reclamation,fish and wildlife service,california department of fish and game fish and game and pg e signed a memorandum of understanding in the mou for the battle creek chinook salmon and steelhead restoration project the restoration.the restoration would modify pg e battle creek hydroelectric operation by,among other things,installing fish screens and fish ladders,decommissioning certain dams,and installing connections and water conveyance facilities.the proposed changes aimed to improve fish passage on battle creek while minimizing the loss of energy production.
the parties to the mou anticipated the restoration would cost about million,of which approximately million would be provided by a federal grant.the federal bureau of reclamation would be the lead agency for construction and would authorize disbursements of federal funds for the restoration.fish and game was not responsible for funding any component of the restoration.
in,however,fish and game applied to the board for a million grant from the habitat conservation fund fund because increased costs necessitated additional funds to complete the restoration the grant would provide a portion of the necessary funding for a partnership project involving various public agencies and private entities,including the entities that signed the mou,for the purpose of restoring salmon and trout habitat along miles of battle creek and an additional six miles of tributaries in tehama and shasta counties the partnership project.the partnership project evolved from the restoration described in the mou.
on august,the board approved the requested grant and subsequently paid million from the fund to the federal bureau of reclamation for the partnership project.the money had been collected under the water security,clean drinking water,coastal and beach protection act of water code,et,also known as proposition 
outfitter filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking to vacate the board expenditure decision the petition was asserted against the board,the state of california,and john donnelly,executive director of the board.fish and game was named as a real party in interest.the trial court denied the writ petition.

discussion 
outfitter contends that section d limits expenditures from the fund to no more than million over any month period for projects relating to the acquisition,restoration or enhancement of riparian habitat and aquatic habitat for the spawning and rearing of anadromous salmonids and trout.
sections d is part of the california wildlife protection act of the act et.california voters passed the act as proposition on june.the act declares that the p rotection,enhancement,and restoration of wildlife habitat and fisheries are vital to maintaining the quality of life in california and all state officials shall implement the act to the fullest extent of their authority in order to preserve,maintain,and enhance california diverse wildlife heritage and the habitats upon which it depends,subds.a and e.the act must be liberally construed to further its purposes.voter information guide,primary june,text of.
the voters intended to make additional needed funds available to protect fish,wildlife and native plant resources,and for the legislature to provide those funds through bond acts and other appropriate sources.to that end,proposition created the fund and,effective july,requires the state controller to transfer million annually to the fund from the general fund and existing environmental funds,such as the water security,clean drinking water,coastal and beach protection fund of,for the next years to be used to acquire,enhance or restore specified types of lands for wildlife or open space,voter information guide,primary june,analysis by the legislative analyst.money in the fund is appropriated annually as follows a million to the department of parks and recreation for specified projects or purposes,b million to the state coastal conservancy,c million to the santa monica mountains conservancy for the ten fiscal years commencing with the fiscal year for specified purposes,d to the california tahoe conservancy,and e the balance of the fund to the board.
section lists the purposes for which money in the fund may be expended,including the restoration of aquatic habitat for the spawning and rearing of salmon and trout resources,subd.e.in this case,the funds were allocated for that purpose.
section d provides,notwithstanding the requirement for acquisition in subdivisions a,b,and c of section the b oard shall,to the extent practicable,expend the money in the f und in a manner and for projects so that,within each month period,approximately six million dollars of the money,including,until july,the expenditures by the agencies receiving money from the f und pursuant to subdivisions a to d,inclusive,of section are expended for the purposes specified in subdivision e and f of section.
outfitter argues the voters intended million to be the maximum amount that may be expended in a month period for the restoration of anadromous salmon and trout habitat.but section d authorizes the expenditure of approximately million,subd.d.approximately means about or nearly it is the opposite of precisely or exactly.hoffman mcnamara,interpreting former section of the motor vehicle act black law dictionary ed approximately means very nearly but not absolutely.in contrast with the use of the word approximately in section d,the voters used the phrase not more than in section,subdivision a and section f to convey a ceiling for other categories of expenditure.this indicates the word approximately was not intended to impose an expenditure ceiling.people murphy cal th,use of different language suggests a different legislative intent faulder mendocino county bd.of supervisors th,when the legislature uses materially different language in statutory provisions addressing the same subject or related subjects,the normal inference is that the legislature intended a difference in meaning.
section d authorizes the board to expend money from the fund to the extent practicable.some courts have said that practicable in a government context means that an entity is vested with discretion to consider the advisability of an action,and have explained that practicable does not mean possible.covarrubias superior court th,covarrubias wilson ostly,supra,d at.section d thus authorizes the board,when it considers it advisable,to expend within each month period about million of the money in the fund for the purposes specified in section,subdivisions e and f.
outfitter also points to the argument in favor of proposition in the june,official ballot pamphlet as an indication of voter intent.the ballot argument states that proposition will also benefit fishing.approximately million per year will go to improve our trout and salmon streams.voter information guide,primary june,argument in favor of.outfitter says the reference to approximately million per year evidences voter intent to cap expenditures at million.
it is not necessary to consider the ballot argument,however,because the language of the statute is not ambiguous on this issue.when section d uses the words approximately six million dollars,that clearly does not mean no more than six million dollars.in any event,the ballot argument also uses the word approximately.
outfitter further argues that the board staff interpreted section d as imposing a million expenditure cap.page of the administrative record purports to be an analysis of the act prepared by board staff.the analysis says section d provides that up to million shall be spent every two years for the acquisition,enhancement or restoration of aquatic habitat for spawning and rearing anadromous salmon and trout and riparian habitat.outfitter asserts that this interpretation by the board staff is entitled to consideration and respect by the courts.
we decline to adopt the staff interpretation,however,because it is inconsistent with the language of the statute.as we have explained,the words approximately six million dollars in section d do not mean up to six million dollars.in fact,the purported staff analysis notes that it was prepared without legal advice and may be subject to further legal clarification.moreover,even if the statutory language was ambiguous,the staff analysis could not assist us in determining voter intent because there is no evidence it was ever presented to the voters in.delaney superior court,supra,cal d at.there is also no evidence that the board adopted the staff interpretation.
we thus reject outfitter contention that section d imposes a strict million expenditure limit.we conclude instead that the board has limited discretion to expend money from the fund under section d see,covarrubias,supra,th at the juxtaposition of the phrase where practicable with the word shall in code of civil procedure section evinces an intent to vest discretion to determine the practicability of a course of action wilson ostly,supra,d at provision in county charter that promotional examinations shall be held when practicable gave defendants limited discretion.the statute sets a biennial goal and does not mandate a maximum or a minimum.although we recognize that million is not million,outfitter did not raise or brief how we would determine the outer boundary of the board limited discretion if we rejected its claim of a strict million expenditure limit.accordingly,the outer boundary of the board discretion under section d is not before us in this case and we express no opinion on that issue.in addition,the suggestion by outfitter that the million expenditure took money away from other worthy environmental projects is not accompanied by citation to the record and is thus forfeited.duarte chino community hospital th.
outfitter ultimately agrees that the board has limited discretion to expend money from the fund,but it argues that the phrase to the extent practicable in section d imposed a threshold requirement to determine why it would be impracticable to expend only million for the partnership project.outfitter relies on people vieira cal th,vieira,a case that cited covarrubias,supra,th.
in vieira,the california supreme court noted that code of civil procedure section vests the trial court with discretion to determine the advisability or practicability of conducting voir dire in the presence of the other jurors and that a trial court that altogether fails to exercise its discretion to determine the practicability of group voir dire has not complied with its statutory obligation.vieira,supra,cal th at.nonetheless,the supreme court concluded that the defendant forfeited the claim that group voir dire was not practicable in his case because he did not timely raise the issue and,even if the claim could have been considered on appeal,the defendant did not show that group voir dire was impractica
