in,the epa sued robert krilich and several corporations he controlled,alleging violations of the clean water act.the parties entered into a consent decree resolving the case.however,after the supreme court held that the army corps of engineers exceeded its authority in extending the definition of navigable waters under the clean water act to include intrastate waters used by migratory birds,krilich moved the district court to vacate the consent decree.the district court refused to do so.krilich appeals,and we affirm.
factual and legal background 
on august,the united states environmental protection agency epa filed a civil complaint against the defendants alleging that they violated the clean water act,et.cwa.the government alleged that krilich violated section of the cwa by discharging fill material without a permit into wetlands on two illinois sites that he was developing the royce renaissance site in oakbrook,illinois and the sullivan lake site in lakemoor,illinois.section a prohibits the discharge of any pollutant,except as otherwise authorized by the cwa.a.section of the cwa authorizes the secretary to issue a permit approving the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters.a.navigable waters are defined as waters of the united states.waters of the united states are further defined by regulations promulgated under the cwa.a.see generally pt.section a further defines waters of the united states to include a ll other waters such as intrastate lakes,rivers,streams including intermittent streams,mudflats,sandflats,wetlands,sloughs,prairie potholes,wet meadows,playa lakes,or natural ponds,the use,degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate or foreign commerce.a.
while the suit was pending and the parties were negotiating,this court issued a decision holding that the epa construction of waters of the united states as including intrastate,nonadjacent or isolated wetlands under s exceeded its authority under the cwa.see hoffman homes,adm r,united states envtl.prot.agency,cir hoffman homes i,vacated by cir.in hoffman homes i,this court further held that,even if the regulation was reasonable under the cwa,congress lacked authority under the commerce clause to regulate such waters based simply on the actual or potential use of such waters by migratory birds id.at.following hoffman homes i,krilich and the epa drafted a consent decree to settle their dispute.the consent decree acknowledged the potential impact of the hoffman homes i decision by incorporating the following provisions 
iv.definitions 
except as specifically modified herein,the terms waters of the united states wetlands dredged material fill material discharge of dredged material and discharge of fill material shall have the meanings assigned them at or.epa means the united states environmental protection agency,and corps means the united states army corps of engineers.
waters of the united states 
for purposes of this consent decree,the parties shall treat wetland and open water areas depicted on exhibit,together with the new wetland and open water area created pursuant to part vii injunctive relief and depicted on exhibit,as waters of the united states located on the royce renaissance property.
the defendants shall continue to treat wetland and open water areas depicted on exhibit as waters of the united states until the mandate issues in hoffman homes,epa,cir and until proceedings related to any appeal,petition for certiorari,or remand are completed.following completion of these proceedings,unless pertinent portions of the seventh circuit april,decision are reversed,exhibit areas,and shall be excluded from the obligations imposed in paragraph.
thus,the parties expressly excluded some waters on the defendant property and agreed to treat the rest of the waters as waters of the united states.
before the parties approved the final consent decree,hoffman homes i was vacated on september,before the birds had reason to migrate south.united states krilich,cir krilich iv.thereafter,the parties signed the consent decree,incorporating the hoffman homes i language,notwithstanding the fact that it had been vacated.the consent decree required the defendants to undertake certain remediation and mitigation activities and to pay fines for filling wetlands.on october,the district court entered final judgment under the consent decree,and under the terms of the decree,retained jurisdiction 
nine months after the consent decree was agreed upon and final judgment entered,this court issued hoffman homes ii,wherein we held that the epa lacked jurisdiction over the wetlands at issue because the government had failed to present substantial evidence under the migratory bird rule that migratory birds actually used the wetlands as a habitat.see hoffman homes,adm r,united states envt l prot.agency,cir hoffman homes ii.unlike hoffman homes i,we did not reach the question of whether the migratory bird rule was within the limits of congress power under the commerce clause.
on september,the government moved to enforce the consent decree,alleging that krilich had failed to construct the replacement wetland by the date specified in the consent decree and that krilich had violated the decree by discharging fill material into an area known as,which the government contended was a water of the united states.the district court agreed with the government regarding krilich failure to perform remediation and imposed civil penalties of.see united states krilich,krilich i.with respect to the allegation that krilich had improperly discharged fill material into,the district court concluded that pertinent portions of hoffman homes i had not been reversed by hoffman homes ii within the meaning of paragraph of the consent decree.id.at.therefore,the district court concluded that,under the decree,was not a water of the united states and accordingly denied the government motion to impose a penalty for filling that area.krilich appealed the district court decision to impose penalties for his failure to perform remediation,and this court affirmed,but remanded the case to the district court to correct an error made in calculating that penalty.see united states krilich,cir krilich ii.on remand,in november,krilich moved pursuant to rule b to vacate the district court original judgment entering the consent decree,arguing that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the epa complaint.specifically,krilich argued that 
the land he allegedly filled was an isolated intrastate wetland which was beyond the federal government commerce power to regulate.because congress lacked authority to regulate his property,krilich contend ed that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the epa complaint.and even though he agreed to the terms of the consent decree,which included a provision that the wetlands filled were waters of the united states,krilich argued that this does not change the result because you can never consent to subject matter jurisdiction,and lack of jurisdiction can be raised at any time.
krilich iv,at.the district court rejected krilich argument,united states krilich,wl.march,krilich iii,and on appeal this court held that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the epa case against krilich because the suit civilly charged a violation of a federal statute which is within the federal courts federal question jurisdiction.krilich iv,at.additionally,we held that krilich argument failed because he entered into a consent decree stipulating that the waters involved were waters of the united states.id.finally,we stated that,because the district court had subject matter jurisdiction based on the terms of the consent decree,we did not need to reach the question of whether the regulation of isolated intrastate wetlands exceeded congress power under the commerce clause.id.at.
last year,nine months after we issued krilich iv,the supreme court rendered a decision holding that a,as clarified by the migratory bird rule,exceeds the authority granted to the army corps of engineers under a of the cwa.solid waste agency of northern cook united states army corps of engineers,d swancc.in interpreting section a,the court concluded that nothing in the text of the cwa indicated that congress intended to allow the jurisdiction of the corps of engineers to extend to ponds that are not adjacent to open water.id.at.the supreme court did not reach the question of whether congress could exercise such authority consistent with its power to legislate under the commerce clause.id.at.
after swancc was issued by the supreme court,krilich brought the present motion in federal district court,arguing that,under swancc,the waters affected by the consent decree are not subject to the epa authority under the cwa.therefore,krilich reasoned,the execution and enforcement of the consent decree by the epa is an ultra vires act and the consent decree was void ab initio.krilich identified three bases for the district court authority to vacate or modify the decree the express clause contained in paragraph of the consent decree,the court inherent power to modify its judgments,and rule b in light of a change in the law,namely,the swancc decision 
in considering krilich motion,the district court assumed that all of the waters at issue were nonnavigable,isolated wetlands that had no surface connection to the nearest stream or nearest navigable body of water krilich v,d at.even so,the district court denied the defendants motion,holding that even if the consent decree were ultra vires,it did not have the authority to vacate or modify it.the court reached this conclusion for several reasons but only one is challenged on appeal whether the decree should be modified under rule b due to a change in the law the district court first noted that in hoffman homes i this court held that isolated wetlands were not subject to cwa regulation.id.at.the court then noted that the parties took this decision into account by referencing it in paragraph of the consent decree and expressly excluding specified wetlands that krilich contended were isolated.id.the court also noted the supreme court decision in swancc holding that the migratory bird rule exceeded the agencies authority under the cwa.id.the district court determined that the supreme court decision in swancc was no more narrow than hoffman homes i,and since paragraph of the consent decree was crafted with that decision in mind,the district court concluded that the decree was drafted in light of controlling precedent that was no less favorable to krilich than swancc.id.at.the court also noted that e quity does not require that the decree be reopened so that defendants may now litigate whether the wetlands on the property are actually isolated.defendants chose not to do so more than eight years ago and the legal framework has not changed in a manner that would justify doing it today.id.at.
krilich appeals,claiming that the district court should have vacated or modified the consent decree under either rule b or the consent decree clause in paragraph.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review a denial of rule b relief for an abuse of discretion.see protectoseal barancik,cir.we review a district court interpretation of a consent decree de novo.see alliance to end repression city of chicago,cir.
although the defendants submitted a professional engineer expert report attempting to establish that all the wetlands subject to the consent decree are isolated,the district court did not conduct a hearing on that issue,nor did it reach a conclusion.rather,it assumed that all waters at issue were nonnavigable,isolated wetlands with no surface connection to the nearest stream or nearest navigable body of water.krilich v,d at.we proceed under the same assumption because,as discussed below,even assuming that the wetlands were isolated,krilich is nonetheless bound by the consent decree.
grounds for relief under rule b 
a consent decree,while contractual in nature,is enforceable as a judicial decree that is subject to the rules generally applicable to other judgments and decrees.rufo inmates of suffolk.jail,d.accordingly,parties wishing to modify or vacate a consent decree may do so by resorting to rule b.in moving to modify or vacate the consent decree,krilich relies upon the third clause of section b of rule,which provides that a judgment may be modified if it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.b.in interpreting this clause of rule b,the supreme court has set forth a test to determine whether modification is warranted.see rufo,at.under that test,a party seeking to modify a consent decree bears the burden of establishing that a significant change in circumstances warrants revision of the decree.id.a party may meet the initial burden of establishing a significant change in circumstances by showing a significant change either in factual conditions or in law.id.at.krilich does not contend that there has been a change in factual conditions,only that the supreme court decision in swancc is a significant change in the law.if the moving party meets this initial burden,the court should consider whether the proposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.id.at.
in rufo,the supreme court identified instances in which a significant change in law may have occurred.for example,the court stated,a consent decree must of course be modified if,as it later turns out,one or more of the obligations placed upon the parties has become impermissible under federal law.but modification of a consent decree may be warranted when the statutory or decisional law has changed to make legal what the decree was designed to prevent.id.at.see also agostini felton,d granting a rule b modification of a permanent injunction based on intervening law.the rufo court also noted that w hile a decision that clarifies the law will not,in and of itself,provide a basis for modifying a decree,it could constitute a change in circumstances that would support modification if the parties had based their agreement on a misunderstanding of the governing law.id.at.
krilich argues that rule b provides a basis to modify the decree,and that the district court abused its discretion by denying him relief thereunder.specifically,he contends that swancc represents a significant change in the law under the third clause of rule b,thereby requiring the consent decree to be vacated,or at a minimum,modified prospectively.he argues that swancc establishes that the government never had authority to regulate the waters at issue and that it is difficult to imagine a more relevant change in the law.accordingly,he reasons that swancc makes clear that the entry and continued enforcement of the consent decree are ultra vires acts by the epa,requiring the decree to be vacated.see,federal crop ins.merrill.where agency granted crop insurance,and later found out that crop was planted on land for which agency could not issue insurance policies,court found insurance policy void ab initio.see also dunn carey,cir because a consent decree force comes from agreement rather than positive law,the decree depends on the parties authority to give assent.
initially,krilich argues that the district court improperly applied the rufo test by reasoning that the parties were not operating under a misunderstanding of law and therefore that krilich was not entitled to vacate the consent decree.he argues that the district court should instead have asked whether swancc changed the law.however,the district court did not improperly apply the rufo test.the district court concluded that swancc was not a significant change in the law by reasoning that the consent decree was drafted in light of a law as enunciated in hoffman homes i that was as favorable to krilich as was the later swancc decision.in essence,the district court was determining whether the statutory or decisional law has changed to make legal what the decree was designed to prevent.rufo,at.to the extent that the district court did question whether the parties misunderstood the law,rufo specifically identifies the parties misunderstanding of law,as later clarified by another decision,as a circumstance where modification might be warranted.rufo,at.
krilich also contends that the district court erre
