this consolidated appeal is the latest manifestation of the numerous contract disputes arising from the government failure to accept and dispose of radioactive waste from the nation nuclear utilities.specifically,the appeal flows from this court decision in yankee atomic electric united states,which reversed the united states court of federal claims initial damages determination,and remanded for a calculation of damages according to the rate at which the government was contractually obligated to accept the utilities waste.
yankee atomic electric company yankee atomic,maine yankee atomic power company maine yankee,and connecticut yankee atomic power company connecticut yankee collectively,the yankees originally brought this action seeking damages to compensate for the cost of storing spent nuclear fuel snf and radioactive waste hlw beyond the time that the government promised by contract to begin storing that waste in a permanent and secure repository.on remand,the trial court correctly calculated damages for dry storage construction costs,deferred costs of loading waste to the department of energy doe,and reracking costs.however,the trial court erred in denying yankee atomic claim for a portion of its wet pool storage costs and nuclear regulatory commission nrc fees.unlike consolidated edison of united states,wl,this case does not include a claim for nrc fees that allegedly increased due to doe breach.rather,the plaintiff here claims that no nrc fees would have been incurred by the inactive plant if the snf had been removed in a timely manner pursuant to the standard contract.see yankee atomic power united states.
therefore,this court and the trial court damages award as recited below.
this court has often addressed the standard contract between the government and nuclear utilities,and the government liability for a partial breach.see me.yankee atomic power united states,yankee atomic united states,yankee i.however,the history of this case is necessary on this appeal from an earlier remand decision.
starting in august,the trial court held a trial on damages.yankee i.at.yankee atomic received as damages to compensate for the cost of building dry storage,an independent spent fuel storage installation isfsi connecticut yankee received for reracking its wet pool to increase storage capacity and for isfsi construction and maine yankee received for reracking costs and for isfsi construction expenses.id.at.during the yankee i trial,the government argued that greater than class c radioactive waste gtcc was not covered by the standard contract.according to the government,the yankees would have been required to build dry storage for gtcc in the world,thus incurring isfsi costs in whole or in part.id.at.the trial court rejected this argument.id.
on appeal,this court accepted the trial court findings on foreseeability,reasonable certainty and the use of the substantial causal factor standard for causation purposes,as well as the determination that an award of nuclear waste fund fees should be denied as premature.yankee atomic united states,yankee ii.however,this court noted that the trial court made its causation analysis without formally interpreting the standard contract and did not fulfill its obligation to apply the annual capacity report rate in determining the substantial cause of the yankees costs.id.at.for that reason,this court remanded for application of the annual capacity report acr rate to the damages claimed by the parties.the acr set forth the projected annual waste receiving capacity for doe and the annual acceptance ranking relating to doe contracts for the disposal of snf hlw.pac.gas united states.
on remand,the trial court accepted the fuel exchange model presented by the yankees expert,and concluded that the yankees would not have built dry storage maine yankee and connecticut yankee also,according to the trial court,would not have reracked their storage pools under the acr rate.yankee atomic power united states,yankee iii.the trial court found that,using fuel exchanges,the yankees would have emptied their wet storage facilities in the world within the first ten years of doe performance.id.at.
the trial court also addressed certain matters beyond the remand and mandate.id.at.each side claimed the other presented issues beyond the scope of the remand.id.at.the yankees claimed that the government argument to include gtcc pickup in the acr queue was of new cloth and beyond the scope of the mandate.id.at.the government responded that the yankees claims for the cost of transferring snf from their wet pools to doe including crane upgrades were beyond the scope of the mandate.id.at.the government also objected to yankee atomic claim for the costs to operate and maintain o m its wet pool for and,as well as its nrc fees.
the trial court found that the government argument to include gtcc into the acr queue was not raised during the yankee i trial and was thus barred.id.at.however,the trial court noted that even if the issue was not barred,removal of gtcc by the date of at least the last snf removal would likely have occurred.id.at.moreover the gtcc generated from reactors was statistically insignificant and would not have had an appreciable affect sic on the snf queue.id.at.finally costs associated with dry storage and reracking would not have been incurred due to the presence of gtcc.id.at.
another remand issue involved the costs of future loading to doe and crane upgrades.the yankees had voluntarily deducted these costs from the damages in yankee i under the belief these costs were avoided costs and thus not recoverable.on remand,the trial court concluded that intervening federal circuit precedent indicated these were actually deferred costs,not avoided costs,and thus should not be deducted from the yankees damages.yankee iii.at.
lastly,the trial court rejected yankee atomic attempt to resurrect its claims for costs relating to wet storage and nrc fees for the years and.yankee atomic unsuccessfully sought these costs during yankee i,but did not appeal the costs in yankee ii.yankee iii.at.the trial court found that yankee atomic could not attack the original trial decision during the remand because it had not appealed the issue.id.the trial court found in the alternative that yankee atomic was entitled to an additional for wet pool o m costs and in nrc fees.id.at.
on appeal,the government complains that the trial court erroneously based its damages calculations upon estimates and speculation.specifically,the government claims that the trial court errantly relied on an exchanges model which was not grounded in fact and did not account for doe discretion to reject fuel exchange requests.the government likewise appeals the trial court interpretation of the yankee ii remand as allowing the yankees to claim damages conceded in the original trial yet precluding the government from asserting that the yankees must establish how gtcc would impact the snf acceptance queue.the government also appealed this court prior rulings regarding the appropriate rate of snf and hlw acceptance under the standard contract and the status of gtcc as hwl under the standard contract.see carolina power light united states,yankee ii,at.the government recognizes that its arguments conflict with binding precedent and appealed the issues solely to preserve its right to seek en banc review.in the counter appeal,the yankees raise just one issue,requesting that this court reverse the trial court exclusion of yankee atomic wet pool o m costs and nrc fees.
