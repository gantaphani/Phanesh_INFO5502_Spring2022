between the late and the early,the number of bighorn sheep in north america declined dramatically,falling from a high of to million individuals to approximately of that number.scientists have generally attributed the decline to,habitat loss,competition for food,and disease transmission from domestic sheep.
in response to concerns regarding disease transmission to immunologically vulnerable bighorn sheep,the chief of the forest service ordered further analysis of the effects of grazing domestic sheep in the payette national forest of idaho payette.in response,the forest service prepared a draft supplemental environmental impact statement dseis,an update to the dseis,and,eventually,a final supplemental environmental impact statement fseis and record of decision rod.concluding that there is a significant risk of fatal disease to the small and insular populations of bighorn sheep in the payette,the forest service decided in the rod to close to domestic sheep grazing approximately of the allotments on which grazing had been permitted.
the idaho wool growers association,other state and national trade associations,and two sheep ranchers collectively,wool growers challenged the forest service decision,objecting to the forest service failure to consult the agricultural research service ars,a federal agency within the department of agriculture,before preparing the fseis and rod failure to supplement the fseis and rod in light of the publication in of a certain study of the transmission of disease from domestic to bighorn sheep,the lawrence study and choice and use of particular models to evaluate the risk of contact between domestic and bighorn sheep and the effects of disease transmission from domestic to bighorn sheep.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the forest service.wool growers appealed.
we conclude that any error in failing to consult ars was harmless.as the forest service did not otherwise act arbitrarily or capriciously or abuse its discretion,we affirm.
background 
bighorn sheep are currently found in two populations in the payette one in hells canyon and the other in the salmon river mountains.in approximately,major of bighorn sheep began to occur in the salmon river mountains.the roughly coincided with the onset of grazing of domestic sheep in the payette.
over the years,the payette bighorn populations have continued to experience periodic,rapid.fseis xx see also rod.since,despite efforts at transplanting sheep from elsewhere,the total population in the payette has decreased by.although at one time more than bighorn sheep lived in hells canyon and the surrounding mountains,they were extirpated by the mid.rod.between and,bighorn sheep were transplanted into hells canyon.seven in the hells canyon population have been reported since.at the time the fseis was written,that population numbered sheep.
the salmon river population was never extirpated.according to surveys in,and,that population numbers roughly sheep.
b.the nepa environmental review process 
the administrative process underlying this appeal began in,when the forest service,pursuant to the national environmental policy act nepa,issued the southwest idaho ecogroup land and resource management plans final environmental impact statement and record of decision eis,which revised the payette national forest land and resource management plan.the eis was appealed,appellants urging that the eis violated the national forest management act and hells canyon national recreation area hcnra act on the payette national forest by providing for grazing of domestic sheep within or near the range of bighorn sheep,thus threatening the viability of bighorn sheep though sic disease transmission.rod.in march,the chief of the forest service agreed that the eis did not adequately address viability of bighorn sheep populations in the payette or the potential for disease transmission.id.the chief therefore rejected the eis analysis.
the chief then instructed the regional forester to reanalyze the potential impacts of domestic sheep grazing on bighorn sheep viability on the payette national forest to ensure habitat is available to support a viable population of bighorn sheep.rod.the chief decision reflected general concerns regarding disease transmission in particular,the spread of various strains of bacteria from domestic to bighorn sheep,as confirmed by anecdotal evidence and a multitude of studies.
there is uncertainty regarding the particular mechanics of disease transmission,and the evidence of transmission is largely circumstantial.bacteria are commonly found in domestic sheep,with the worst outbreaks killing of domestic sheep in a herd.the impact of pneumonia on bighorn sheep is considerably more catastrophic.episodic pneumonia outbreaks appear to be the current limiting factor in bighorn sheep abundance and distribution,both because caused by pneumonia kill most or all of a given population,and because female bighorns who survive experience low reproduction and high lamb mortality rates for years following an outbreak.consequently,a number of state and federal agencies with jurisdiction over bighorn sheep have expressed concern and modified their management plans to address disease transmission from domestic to wild sheep.rod see,john beecham et,rocky mountain bighorn sheep ovis canadensis a technical conservation assessment,timothy schommer melanie woolever,a review of disease related conflicts between domestic sheep and goats and bighorn sheep,montana department of fish,wildlife and parks,montana bighorn sheep conservation strategy,draft,august idaho department of fish game,draft bighorn sheep management plan,may.as the fseis explained,s cientists from both sides of the issue recommend that the species be kept separate until the disease transmission science is better understood.rod.
in september,the forest service released the dseis,which proposed to modify,delete,and add to the current forest plan direction in response to the chief instructions.rod.the dseis precipitated over public comments.
in,because of declining bighorn sheep numbers,the forest service designated bighorn sheep a sensitive species in the intermountain region,which includes the payette.under that designation,the objectives of bighorn management are to prevent listing under the endangered species act esa,avoid or minimize impact to the species,whose viability has been identified as a concern,maintain viable populations of the species,and to develop and implement management objectives for the species populations and habitat.rod.
the forest service released an update to the dseis in january,which provided interested stakeholders and the public an opportunity to review and comment on improved analyses and alternatives.rod.in the update,the forest service responded to criticisms of the dseis qualitative analysis by providing a quantitative analysis.see fseis xvii,a.that analysis used modeling to study the potential risks and effects of contact and disease transmission.more than comments on the update to the dseis were submitted.
in july,the forest service completed and released the fseis and rod.to analyze the effects of various alternative plans on the payette bighorn sheep,the forest service used three models developed in conjunction with researchers at the university of california,davis center for animal disease modeling and surveillance.the models called the source habitat,risk of contact,and disease models incorporated telemetric location data,including more than data points collected in the payette over the course of twelve years from over bighorn sheep.even with the use of these models,the forest service recognized,d etermining the probability that a bighorn sheep will reach an occupied domestic sheep grazing allotment in the payette and that contact between the species will result in disease transmission is problematic,and there is essentially no research that would allow estimation of the likelihood of contact causing disease transmission.rod.to account for that difficulty,the forest service ran the disease model using a range of probabilities of contact resulting in disease transmission,and.this approach allowed the forest service to assess the effects of various management alternatives on bighorn sheep subpopulations despite its inability to estimate accurately the degree of risk of contact.
after applying the models,the forest service selected one of the alternatives analyzed in the fseis,alternative.alternative would result in the termination of domestic sheep grazing on approximately acres in the payette,with implementation to occur over three years.the models showed that this alternative reduced the risk of extirpation of all but one of the bighorn subpopulations to at the transmission level the models predicted a likelihood of extirpation of the sheep mountain subpopulation at all transmission levels,due to that subpopulation demographics and proximity to domestic sheep grazing allotments.at the higher transmission levels,the probabilities of extirpation under alternative ranged from to.ultimately,the forest service found that large distances between domestic and bighorn sheep are necessary to assure protection of bighorns from disease,as bighorn sheep travel long distances across rugged terrain domestic sheep are known to stray from their herds,remaining on allotments at unpermitted times and bighorn and domestic sheep are attracted to each other and seek out each other company.
the fseis incorporated findings from the lawrence study,the first experiment to demonstrate directly that transmission of bacteria from domestic to bighorn sheep is implicated in causing pneumonia in bighorn sheep.the study authors extracted bacteria from domestic sheep,genetically modified the bacteria to be antibiotic resistant and to radioactively fluoresce that is,give off light.the domestic sheep were then inoculated with the modified bacteria.the domestic sheep were initially placed in pens separated by ten meters from pens of bighorn sheep.later,they were moved so that they were separated only by a fence.still later,all the sheep were commingled in a single pen.
by the end of the study,three of the four bighorn sheep had contracted pneumonia and died,and the fourth was euthanized after displaying telltale and severe signs of pneumonia.examinations of the bighorn sheep showed that they carried the,bacteria with which only the domestic sheep had been inoculated.
c.this litigation 
wool growers appealed the rod and fseis to the intermountain regional forester.during the appeal process,donald patrick knowles,a of the lawrence study and a research scientist within ars,submitted a letter discussing his interpretation of the study results letter.knowles maintained that the study did not prove that contact between domestic and bighorn sheep resulted in transmission of bacteria between the species transmission of a organism,as well as the mechanisms of disease,are complex processes and transmission of an organism does necessarily lead to disease.letter.the regional forester,having considered knowles input,denied wool growers appeal.
wool growers then filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the district court,challenging the forest service decision.the court granted intervenors,a group of environmental organizations,leave to enter the action as defendants.wool growers moved to expand the record pursuant to asarco,epa,cir the district court granted the motion,permitting the parties to submit expert declarations in support of their for summary judgment.after a hearing,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the forest service and intervenors and dismissed the action.
wool growers timely appealed the district court decision.on appeal,wool growers challenges three aspects of the forest service decision under nepa its failure to consult ars prior to completing the fseis failure to supplement the fseis and choice and use of models.
nepa is a purely procedural statute it does not impose any substantive requirements on an agency undertaking environmental review.lands council mcnair,cir en banc,overruled on other grounds by winter nat.res.def.council,d.rather,nepa aims to make certain that the agency will have available,and will carefully consider,detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts,and that the relevant information will be made available to the larger public audience.id.citation and alterations omitted.accordingly,federal agencies must take a hard look at the environmental consequences of their actions by preparing an eis for each major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.id.at alteration omitted quoting c.an eis must provide a full and fair discussion of significant environmental impacts so as to inform decisionmakers and the public of the reasonable alternatives which would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment.id.at quoting.
under nepa and the administrative procedure act apa,our review is limited to determining whether the forest service analysis was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.at quoting u.a.we conclude that although the forest service may have acted contrary to nepa in one respect,any such error was harmless.the forest service did not otherwise act arbitrarily or capriciously,nor did it abuse its discretion.
consultation 
duty to consult 
nepa imposes on federal agencies conducting environmental review a duty to consult with certain other agencies.prior to making any detailed statement,the responsible federal official shall consult with and obtain the comments of any federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved in the proposed action.c.further,to promote nepa policies of public participation and informed decisionmaking,copies of the eis and comments thereon from other agencies shall accompany the proposal through the existing agency review processes.id.
the regulations implementing these provisions state that a fter preparing a draft environmental impact statement and before preparing a final environmental impact statement the agency shall o btain the comments of any federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved a see also id.b accurate scientific analysis,expert agency comments,and public scrutiny are essential to implementing nepa.emphasis added.special expertise is defined as statutory responsibility,agency mission,or related program experience.id.under the statute and its implementing regulations,the forest service may have had a duty to consult with ars before issuing the fseis.
the pivotal question is whether ars has special expertise concerning one significant aspect of the proposed decision,the mechanics of pathogen transmission in domestic sheep wool growers argues that it does.they note,for example,that delegates to ars,among other matters,the authority to c onduct research concerning domestic animals and poultry,their protection and use,and the causes of contagious,infectious,and communicable diseases.also,ars mission statement proclaims ars conducts research to develop and transfer solutions to agricultural problems of high national priority and provide information access and dissemination to enhance the natural resource base and the environment department of agriculture,agricultural research service,ars about us.
the forest service argues,in response,that it had no duty to consult with ars because that agency has no expertise in wildlife management.although ars expertise does center on domestic,not wild,animals,the development within and movement of pathogens in domestic sheep is of some relevance to concerns regarding disease transmission to bighorn sheep.the forest service assessment of the pertinence of that expertise may be too narrow an interpretation of its consultation duty under nepa.and the language establishing nepa consultation requirement is expansive.it mandates consultation with any federal agency that has special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved.c emphasis added.see also a t he agency shall o btain the comments of any federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved emphasis added.
further,warm springs dam task force gribble suggests that for the consultation requirement to apply,the particular expertise of an agency does not have to encompass the proposed project as a whole or the issue the proposed project was designed to address.rather,the expertise need relate only to one of the project anticipated environmental effects.see,cir per curiam.
in the end,we need not resolve in this case the precise parameters of the consultation requirement,or whether it extended to ars on the record before us.any violation of the consultation duty that occurred here,we are persuaded,was harmless.
the apa directs us to take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.see nevada dep t of energy.accordingly,we consider whether the forest service failure to consult was harmless.see warm springs,at.the analysis asks whether the failure to consult materially impeded nepa goals that is,whether the error caused the agency not to be fully aware of the environmental consequences of the proposed action,thereby precluding informed decisionmaking and public participation,or otherwise materially affected the substance of the agency decision.see tucson herpetological soc.salazar,cir.
here,wool growers contends that,had consultation occurred,ars and knowles would have conveyed to the forest service information regarding the uncertainties of disease transmission mechanisms from domestic sheep and other contributors to bighorn disease.it is fair to assume knowles would have offered this information he did offer it to the forest service,both in his letter on appeal to the forest supervisor,as well as in his declarations in the expanded record before the district court.but,as reflected in the fseis,such information had already been amply communicated,and the forest service and the public already had considered it.
for example,the fseis acknowledged 
some of these contentions challenging the link between disease in domestic sheep and disease in bighorn sheep are accurate.we do not understand all of the mechanisms involved in potential disease transmission between the species arguably,much of the evidence is circumstantial however,the compilation of cases throughout several decades does contribute to an increasing body of evidence that overwhelmingly demonstrates bighorn sheep near domestic sheep are at risk for disease transmission,even though contact may not have actually been observed.
fseis xxi.the fseis also specifically acknowledged comments by scientists and others,primarily from agricultural disciplines,regarding the effect of stressors on bighorn sheep disease,as well as uncertainties regarding disease transmission.id.at.and in the rod,the forest supervisor took those views and comments into consideration,stating some scientists and others,primarily from agricultural disciplines,contend that disease transmission between bighorn sheep and domestic sheep is not a relevant factor in bighorn sheep distribution and population declines in the wildland environment.i have taken these arguments into consideration while making my decision.rod.
nor did these concerns escape public comment.the public provided extensive comments showing awareness of these considerations,including the comments that the fseis should be particularly thorough when assessing the literature on the causal relationship of disease transmission between domestic sheep and bighorn sheep,fseis a e vidence linking disease outbreaks to domestic sheep is inconclusive,s tudies documenting disease transmission between the two species have been done in controlled environments,and s tress could be a precursor to the onset of sickness,id.at a and t he forest service should disclose plans for reduction or elimination of stressors,such as bad weather or lack of nutrition,that can predispose bighorn sheep to disease or exacerbate risk of mortality,id.at a.
in warm springs,we found no prejudice arising from the army corps of engineers failure to consult the geological survey because the corps subsequently considered the study that consultation would have revealed.see at.similarly here,the forest service failure to consult did not prejudice its review process.the forest service took into account essentially the same comments arguments from scientists and others,primarily from agricultural disciplines contesting the inference that domestic sheep can and do transmit disease to wild bighorn sheep that ars,through knowles,would have provided by formally consulting with the forest service during the environmental review process.
the forest service failure to consult ars is immaterial for another reason as well.the precise mechanisms of disease transmission did not affect the forest service decision.as the fseis states the exact means by which the disease is transferred from domestic to bighorn sheep is beyond the scope of this analysis and should be conducted by qualified researchers.fseis a.the fseis conclusion was that the scientific consensus is that disease transmission from domestic sheep by whatever mechanism and involving whatever confounding factors poses a sufficient risk to bighorn sheep viability to merit separation of the bighorns from the domestic animals.confirming that conclusion,numerous agencies with jurisdiction over bighorn sheep have found the risk significant enough to compel modification of their management plans.see section,supra.
because the lack of consultation did not prevent the forest service or the public from considering information about the uncertainties in transmission of disease from domestic to bighorn sheep such as ars would have offered and which knowles later did offer,and because information about the precise mechanisms of such transmission was not a basis of the forest service decision,no prejudice resulted from the lack of consultation.
wool growers maintains that its member wool companies were prejudiced some of them went out of business due to the forest service ultimate decision,they claim.but this is not the type of prejudice with which nepa is concerned.rather,the question is whether the failure to consult somehow materially altered the environmental review process,not whether a constituent body was harmed by the agency ultimate decision.see cnty.of del norte united states,cir.almost invariably,some individuals or entities are negatively affected by an agency decision.as long as t he integrity of the decision making process within the government and the public opportunity to comment in accordance with all legal requirements were not compromised in any way,there is no prejudice of the sort with which nepa is concerned 
accordingly,we conclude that any error arising from the forest service failure to consult was harmless.
supplementation 
wool growers next challenges the forest service failure to supplement the fseis.agencies s hall prepare supplements to either draft or final environmental impact statements if t here are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.c.but an agency need not supplement an eis every time new information comes to light after the eis is finalized.marsh or.nat.res.council,d.so requiring would render agency decisionmaking intractable,always awaiting updated information only to find the new information outdated by the time a decision is made.id.thus,only if the new information is sufficient to show that the remaining action will affect the quality of the human environment in a significant manner or to a significant extent not already considered,must a supplemental eis be prepared.id.at alteration and citation omitted.
here,wool growers contends that publication of the lawrence study in,after the fseis issued,triggered the forest service duty to supplement.but the forest service cited and discussed the study,in unpublished form,numerous times in the fseis the study bolstered the forest service decision by confirming that bacteria were transmitted from domestic to bighorn sheep,and that the transmitted bacteria likely caused the pneumonia that killed the bighor
