petitioner gregory sassé appeals the order of the department of labor administrative review board arb dismissing his complaint,which alleged that his employer,the department of justice doj,retaliated against him for protected activity in violation of the whistleblower provisions of three environmental statutes the clean air act caa,a,the solid waste disposal act swda,a,and the federal water pollution control act fwpca,a.because sassé did not engage in a whistleblowing activity protected by these statutes,and because in any event,sassé claims are untimely,we will affirm the decision of the arb.
in gregory sassé was hired as an assistant united states attorney ausa in the criminal division of the cleveland,ohio,office.after moving around various sections of the criminal division,sassé found his niche as an environmental crimes prosecutor and was appointed by united states attorney joyce george to serve as the chairman of the office newly established environmental crimes task force.in his first environmental case,sassé prosecuted nick bogas,a cleveland businessman,for illegally dumping hazardous waste at the cleveland hopkins international airport.see united states bogas,cir.adjacent to the land that bogas used for illegal dumping was a landfill,known as the south forty,which was owned by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa.based on his investigation of the bogas case,sassé concluded that nasa was illegally dumping hazardous waste at the south forty.though bogas was eventually settled with a plea agreement,sassé continued to investigate environmental wrongdoing at the airport and the south forty.
in november of,sassé filed a complaint with the department of labor,alleging that the doj had retaliated against him for investigating and prosecuting environmental crimes in violation of the whistleblower provisions of three federal environmental statutes.specifically,the complaint alleges that the discrimination was in response to sassé efforts in promoting the environmental crimes task force for the northern district of ohio,the goal of which task force is the initiation of prosecutions for criminal environmental violations,and in response to sassé efforts in investigation and prosecution of various specific environmental prosecutions this alleged discrimination,which began immediately after the indictment in united states bogas was handed down,took the form of less favorable performance appraisals,cruel remarks,the imposition of a heavier caseload,and a denial of training and office supplies.the complaint further alleges that doj officials assigned sassé a drunken secretary secretary x in an effort to harass him.
in october of,while his complaint was pending with the department of labor,sassé made a business proposal to nasa whereby he would leave his employment with the united states attorney and work for the agency in a private capacity to ensure that it complied with environmental laws.because sassé had learned through his work with the doj that nasa owned contaminated land,and because he was employed as an ausa when he submitted the proposal,nasa forwarded sassé proposal to the doj office of the inspector general.on january,the executive office for the united states attorneys mailed sassé a letter proposing to suspend him for five days because he had violated two ethical standards soliciting outside employment that involves a subject matter within the doj area of responsibility in violation of c,and using a public office for an employee own private gain in violation of.
early in the year,a staffer from congressman dennis kucinich office contacted sassé and requested that he assist the congressman in evaluating environmental issues at cleveland hopkins airport.on february,sassé relayed news of this contact to the first ausa,who asked him to write a memo detailing his concerns.sassé memo concluded that nasa officials were covering up contamination of nasa property near the airport.nasa,doj,the federal bureau of investigation and the environmental protection agency all investigated these allegations but unanimously concluded that no prosecution could be undertaken because there was no evidence of a wrongdoing that had occurred within the statute of limitations.on may,the director of the executive office of the united states attorneys suspended sassé for five days for his october attempt to obtain private employment with nasa.the letter that the director sent to sassé specified that he was being suspended for using government facilities to prepare documents for a private business venture and for his improper solicitation of nasa.
an administrative law judge alj of the department of labor conducted a hearing on sassé complaint and issued a written decision on may.the alj dismissed all of the claims contained in the complaint because it did not allege that sassé had engaged in a protected activity.the alj reasoned that because sassé had a duty as an ausa to prosecute and investigate environmental crimes,these activities were not protected by the whistleblower provisions of the pertinent statutes.however,the alj sua sponte amended the complaint to include sassé may suspension as an alleged act of retaliation for sassé contacts with congressman kucinich office.the alj held that the doj violated the whistleblower provisions of the pertinent acts by suspending sassé and recommended awarding compensatory and exemplary damages.the arb reversed and dismissed sassé complaint as untimely.alternatively,the arb stated that sassé claim failed on the merits but it did not rule on the issue of whether sassé work on environmental crimes was protected by the whistleblower provisions of the cited statutes.the arb also held that the alj erred by sua sponte amending sassé complaint to include his may suspension.sassé timely appealed the arb ruling.

the caa,swda,and fwpca contain whistleblower provisions,which prohibit an employer from discharging or discriminating against an employee for reporting environmental violations or instituting proceedings resulting from the administration or enforcement of the statutes to state a claim under the whistleblower provision of an environmental statute,the plaintiff must establish that his employer retaliated against him because he engaged in a protected activity.simon simmons foods,cir analyzing the whistleblower provisions of the swda and fwcpa see also american nuclear resources,united states department of labor,cir passaic valley sewerage com rs department of labor,cir.sassé alleges that he engaged in two types of protected activities which subjected him to retaliation by the doj his investigation and prosecution of environmental crimes and his contacts with congressman kucinich office.we consider each type of activity in turn.
sassé claim that the doj retaliated against him for his participation in the investigation and prosecution of environmental crimes requires us to determine whether the whistleblower provisions of the caa,swda,and fwpca protect an employee who is merely performing his assigned duties.in willis department of agriculture,the federal circuit held that a department of agriculture employee,whose job it was to review farms for compliance with usda regulations,did not engage in a protected activity under the whistleblower protection act wpa,b by reporting that seven farms were out of compliance.after observing that the wpa is intended to protect government employees who risk their own personal job security for the advancement of the public good,the court stated,
in reporting some of the farms as being out of compliance,willis did no more than carry out his required everyday job responsibilities.this is expected of all government employees pursuant to the fiduciary obligation which every employee owes to his employer.willis can not be said to have risked his personal job security by merely performing his required duties.
willis reasoning is equally applicable to the whistleblower provisions of the caa,swda,and fwpca.by their plain language,these whistleblower provisions protect employees who risk their job security by taking steps to protect the public good.sassé job as an ausa included the investigation and prosecution of environmental crimes,and he therefore had a fiduciary duty to carry out those investigations and prosecutions.like willis,sassé can not be said to have risked his personal job security by performing the duties required of him in that job.we therefore hold that in performing these duties,sassé was not engaging in protected activities.see huffman office of personnel management,a law enforcement officer whose duties include the investigation of crime by government employees and reporting the results of an assigned investigation to his immediate supervisor is a quintessential example of conduct that is not protected by the wpa langer department of the treasury,holding that an irs employee,whose duty it was to review actions taken by the irs criminal division,did not engage in activity protected by the wpa by informing doj officials that their grand jury investigations disproportionately targeted accordingly,sassé can not state a claim under the whistleblower provisions of these statutes premised on his investigation and prosecution of environmental crimes.
sassé claim that the doj suspended him in may of in retaliation for his contact with congressman kucinich office,which he says is a protected activity,is not cognizable in this action.because sassé may suspension occurred after he initiated this action and was not included in the complaint,the alj must have had the power to amend sassé complaint in order to consider this issue.an alj may amend a complaint to include issues tried by the implied consent of the parties pursuant to e,which provides 
when issues not raised by the pleadings are reasonably within the scope of the original complaint and are tried by express or implied consent of the parties,they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings,and such amendments may be made as necessary to make them conform to the evidence.the alj may,upon reasonable notice and such terms as are just,permit supplemental pleadings setting forth transactions,occurrences or events which have happened since the date of the pleadings and are relevant to any of the issues involved.
for guidance in determining when an amendment is permissible under e,we will look to cases applying fed civ.b,which provides in similar language for amendments to the pleadings to conform with the evidence 
to establish implied consent in the context of rule b,it must appear that the parties understood the evidence to be aimed at the unpleaded issue.carlisle equipment,united states sec y of labor occupational safety,cir.an agency may not base its decision upon an issue the parties tried inadvertently e vidence introduced at a hearing that is relevant to a pleaded issue as well as an unpleaded issue can not serve to give the opposing party fair notice that the new,unpleaded issue is entering the case.yellow freight,martin,cir.we must examine whether the employer knew what conduct was in issue and had an opportunity to present his defense.id.quoting soule glass and glazing nlrb,cir.
during the hearing on sassé complaint,doj attorneys asked sassé questions about his conversation with congressman kucinich office concerning the cleanup of nasa property and the business proposal he made to nasa.but the testimony elicited by these questions is clearly relevant to both sassé was at issue in the his was it therefore can not serve to give doj fair notice that the new,unpleaded issue is entering the case.id.
moreover,during the hearing,the doj moved to strike evidence concerning the condition of nasa airport property and the congressional request for sassé assistance,arguing that the evidence the complaint.sassé counsel responded that this evidence was relevant to whether the doj created a hostile work environment and emphasized that there is no specific claim related to nasa.the alj denied the motion to strike and admitted the evidence,stating,the matters mentioned go to a continuation of a pattern of violations besides these matters have been tried these past two weeks and even if were not so,we going to amend the complaint to include continuing violations.the record establishes that at the time the evidence relating to that suspension was admitted,neither the alj nor sassé counsel made it clear that the suspension would be considered as a discrete retaliatory act rather,their statements at best would have put the doj on notice that the suspension could be considered for the purposes of a hostile environment analysis.finally,in his recommended decision and order,the alj admitted that the issue of whether the incidents occurring after the filing of the complaint would be included in this proceeding as evidence themselves of protected activity was not directly addressed.for these reasons,sassé allegation that the doj retaliated against him for his contacts with congressman kucinich office can not support this whistleblower claim 
even if sassé had participated in an activity that is protected by the whistleblower provisions of the caa,swda,and the fwpca,his claim is barred because it was not timely filed.we review for substantial evidence the arb conclusion that a claim was untimely.varnadore,at.the caa,swda,and fwpca require a complainant to file a complaint within days after an alleged violation occurs.b b b.the alleged discriminatory act occurs when the employer discharges the plaintiff or otherwise discriminates against him.hill united states department of labor,cir analyzing the statute of limitations on the whistleblower provision of the energy reorganization act.accordingly,those violations which occurred more than days before sassé filed his complaint on november,are time barred.as the arb correctly observed,none of the employment actions that sassé listed in his complaint occurred within this window.
to circumvent the limitation on whistleblower actions brought pursuant to the pertinent statutes,sassé alleges that the doj subjected him to a hostile work environment.in national passenger morgan,a title vii case,the supreme court held that all of the acts comprising a hostile work environment claim,including those that would otherwise fall outside of the filing period,are timely so long as at least one act comes within title vii filing window,d p rovided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period,the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by a court for the purposes of determining liability.because we have refused to restrict morgan to title vii claims,see bell ohio state,cir and have,in the past,applied a continuing violation analysis in whistleblower cases alleging a hostile work environment,holtzclaw secretary of labor,wl at cir,varnadore,at see also williams administrative review board,cir english whitfield,cir,we can think of no reason why morgan hostile environment analysis is inapplicable to the case at bar.indeed,there is no mater
