in october,after several years of environmental analysis,public review,and public comment,the forest service issued the travel management plan plan,along with a final environmental impact statement,to manage travel and recreation within the study area.three conservation groups the same groups that are the applicants for intervention in this case,namely montana wilderness association,greater yellowstone coalition,and the wilderness society filed an action in march to challenge the plan under the apa on the theory that the plan permitted increased motorized and mechanized activity in the study area in violation of the mwsa and the national environmental policy act nepa.see.wilderness ass mcallister,d.cbu with several other recreational use advocacy groups,also filed suit against the forest service to challenge the plan,but,unlike the conservation groups,it asserted that the plan was overly restrictive of motorized and mechanized recreational activity in violation of the mwsa.the two separate challenges to the plan were consolidated.in september,the district court in the consolidated action granted summary judgement to the conservation plaintiffs applicants in this case based on its conclusion that the plan was arbitrary and capricious and violated the mwsa and nepa enjoined the continued implementation of the plan and remanded to the agency for further proceedings consistent with its ruling.see id.at.the forest service appealed the district court grant of summary judgment for the conservation plaintiffs applicants,and that appeal is currently pending before this court.
in november,in response to the district court ruling,the forest service announced an interim management strategy for the study area,made effective by an interim order,which further limited snowmobile and other motorized and mechanized use in april,cbu initiated this action against the forest service to challenge the interim order.cbu claimed that the interim order violated the mwsa and the apa because it restricts motorized and mechanized vehicle use in areas that were open to such use in.ten days after the forest service filed its answer in cbu new action,applicants filed a motion to intervene as of right under rule a,or,in the alternative to intervene in the court discretion under rule b.cbu opposed the motion.the district court denied the motion.applicants timely appealed the district court denial of their motion seeking intervention as of right or permissive intervention.

federal rule of civil procedure a states 
on timely motion,the court must permit anyone to intervene who claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action,and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant ability to protect its interest,unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.
an applicant seeking to intervene as of right under rule must demonstrate that four requirements are met the intervention application is timely the applicant has a significant protectable interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action the disposition of the action may,as a practical matter,impair or impede the applicant ability to protect its interest and the existing parties may not adequately represent the applicant interest.prete bradbury,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also berg,at.while an applicant seeking to intervene has the burden to show that these four elements are met,the requirements are broadly interpreted in favor of intervention.prete,at.in addition to mandating broad construction,our review is guided primarily by practical considerations,not technical distinctions.berg,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
cbu concedes that applicants meet the first three elements of the test for intervention as of right and urge that intervention was properly denied solely on the basis that applicants did not show that the forest service may not adequately represent their interest.we agree with the parties that applicants meet the first three requirements for intervention as of right.those requirements,while not now disputed,merit brief discussion because they are part of the setting in which we examine the disputed issue.
with respect to the first requirement,applicants filed their motion to intervene in a timely manner,less than three months after the complaint was filed and less than two weeks after the forest service filed its answer to the complaint.the motion to intervene was made at an early stage of the proceedings,the parties would not have suffered prejudice from the grant of intervention at that early stage,and intervention would not cause disruption or delay in the proceedings.these are traditional features of a timely motion.see nw.forest res.council glickman,cir.
second,applicants have a significant protectable interest in the action.whether an applicant for intervention as of right demonstrates sufficient interest in an action is a practical,threshold inquiry,and n o specific legal or equitable interest need be established.id.at quoting greene united states,cir.to demonstrate a significant protectable interest,an applicant must establish that the interest is protectable under some law and that there is a relationship between the legally protected interest and the claims
