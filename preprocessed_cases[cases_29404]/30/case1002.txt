the environmental protection information center epic appeals from the district court summary judgment in favor of the united states forest service usfs.epic challenges usfs failure to prepare an environmental impact statement eis in connection with the proposed knob timber sale in the klamath national forest and further argues that the environmental assessment ea usfs did prepare was inadequate.epic also contends that the project violates the national forest management act nfma.we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
the knob timber sale the project is a vegetation management project affecting the salmon river ranger district of the klamath national forest.the project provides for harvesting timber from approximately acres,scattered among units throughout the forest.the stated purpose of the project is to maintain stand health by leading stands into a resilient condition where they can provide a sustained yield of wood products and reduce their risk to potential catastrophic fire.
usfs issued an ea for the project in october in preparing the ea,usfs relied on a number of documents,reports and studies,including biological assessments prepared by the national marine fisheries service and the fish and wildlife service fws in formal consultations required by section of the endangered species act esa.the final ea identified and discussed in detail two key issues the project effect on the critical habitat of the northern spotted owl and watershed effects,in which timber harvest,fuel reduction and road activities could potentially cause soil erosion or trigger slope failure,increasing sediment in streams.
soon thereafter,usfs issued a decision notice and finding of no significant impact fonsi selecting the proposed action alternative.usfs explained that this alternative had the best potential to achieve the project purposes and that it would have beneficial effects for the northern spotted owl and watershed health,with only minor or negligible adverse effects.
epic filed suit in the district court,arguing that,under the national environmental policy act nepa,usfs should have prepared a full eis instead of an ea,and that the ea itself was inadequate.epic also alleged that usfs violated the nfma.the district court granted summary judgment to usfs on all claims.

discussion 
nepa claimsa.statutory background 
an eis is required for major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment c.the agency first prepares an ea to determine whether an action will have a significant impact,thus requiring preparation of an eis.if the agency concludes there is no significant effect associated with the proposed project,it may issue a fonsi in lieu of preparing an eis.a.
the critical term here is significantly.whether a project is significant depends on the project context and its intensity.context refers to the scope of the action,while intensity refers to the severity of the impact.id.the regulations include a list of ten intensity factors,four of which epic argues are applicable in this case 
impacts that may be both beneficial and adverse.a significant effect may exist even if the federal agency believes that on balance the effect will be beneficial.
the degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks.
whether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts 
the degree to which the action may adversely affect an endangered or threatened species or its habitat that has been determined to be critical under the endangered species act of.
epic also asserts that even if an eis is not required,the ea itself is inadequate and should be supplemented,citing many of the same reasons pertaining to its eis arguments.we address these contentions together where appropriate.
harm to the northern spotted owl and its critical habitat 
one of epic primary arguments is that the project will harm the northern spotted owl,a threatened species,and its habitat that has been designated critical habitat under the esa.to resolve epic contentions,it is useful to examine the backdrop of the debate and the specific project parameters.
after significant debate and litigation,the northern spotted owl was listed as a threatened species under the esa in.june.in,fws delineated the critical habitat for the spotted owl.january.critical habitat consists of those areas which have physical or biological features i essential to the conservation of the species and ii which may require special management considerations or protection.a.
debate and litigation continued,however,and ultimately the government adopted the northwest forest plan nfp,which provided a comprehensive forest management plan for the entire range of the spotted owl gifford pinchot task force fish wildlife,cir.the nfp withdrew million acres from potential timber harvesting,and designated approximately million acres of forest land as late successional reserves lsrs lsrs overlap with about of the owl critical habitat and are also generally to timber harvest,although thinning,salvage,and research activities are permitted under certain conditions.the remaining approximately million acres were designated matrix lands or adaptive management areas,and are potentially available for timber production,subject to standards in the nfp.id.at.
the project involves logging on acres scattered throughout the klamath national forest.of this,acres has been designated as critical habitat for the spotted owl.all of this critical habitat is outside the lsr and is thus in the matrix where timber production is permitted.however,within this acres,only fourteen acres of nesting habitat would actually be removed five acres from one unit and nine from another.in the third critical habitat unit,acres of high quality nesting habitat would be degraded to moderate quality.the remaining sixty acres within the three critical habitat units is not considered suitable for nesting and roosting but is suitable for dispersal according to the usfs ea and the fws biological opinion biop,all of the habitat units will maintain this dispersal function.
harm to the species 
against this backdrop,epic alleges that a full eis should have been performed or,alternatively,that the analysis of the issue in the ea is inadequate.the project,epic asserts,is likely to affect the northern spotted owl and its critical habitat significantly.epic points to portions of the fws biop in which the biop notes that three nest sites could be destroyed and that the logging will remove most,if not all,of the small amount of existing nesting habitat within the critical habitat units.
these statements,however,must be read in context.for example,although the logging will remove existing nesting habitat from two critical habitat units,this amounts to a total of only fourteen acres.similarly,the project does not authorize the destruction of any existing nest sites,and surveys and seasonal restrictions operate to protect potentially occupied nest sites.the projected take of three nests or pairs of owls is based on extrapolations from nesting data,and fws determined that this level of anticipated take was permissible under the esa.
nepa regulations direct the agency to consider the degree of adverse effect on a species,not the impact on individuals of that species.see native ecosystems,at i t does not follow that the presence of some negative effects necessarily rises to the level of demonstrating a significant effect on the environment.see also greater yellowstone coalition flowers,cir i ssuance of an incidental take statement anticipating the loss of some members of a threatened species does not automatically lead to the requirement to prepare a full eis.it was not arbitrary and capricious for usfs to determine that although there will be some effect on individual pairs,this will not cause a significant adverse effect on the species and require an eis.
uncertainty 
next,epic argues that an eis was required because the effects on the spotted owl are too uncertain.epic focuses on a statement within the fws biop in which fws,after analyzing the project likely effects based on historic distributions of the spotted owl,notes that if activity centers and home ranges have changed,the effects may be distributed differently but can not be accurately described without additional information.but epic fails to recite the remainder of the paragraph,in which fws goes on to say 
however,even if owl activity centers have changed in recent years,it is reasonable to assume that the density of owls in the project area should be roughly constant therefore,the magnitude of the overall effect of habitat removal in home ranges and core areas by the project should not be substantially different from that estimated above.
moreover,as this court has recently pointed out,the regulations do not anticipate the need for an eis anytime there is some uncertainty,but only if the effects of the project are highly uncertain.see native ecosystems,at simply because a challenger can cherry pick information and data out of the administrative record to support its position does not mean that a project is highly controversial or highly uncertain.see also b.
increased fire risk in critical habitat 
epic also alleges that the ea fails to disclose a concern of increased fire risk within critical habitat unit.however,the ea specifically acknowledges that in each critical habitat area,fuel loading increases will occur but loading will be reduced.it also recognizes that because fire risk is already low in,the overall benefit in this particular unit would be minimal.usfs ultimately concludes that the proposed project is still preferable to the alternative because,without action,fuel loading would increase in the stand over the next five to ten years.the ea thus contains adequate disclosure of the risk and a reasoned evaluation of it,and does not reveal the need for an eis on this ground.
habitat connectivity 
epic further contends that the ea fails to consider habitat connectivity,noting that portions of the critical habitat contain important dispersal habitat linking the lsrs.however,both the ea and the underlying fws biop address connectivity.the ea recognizes the important connectivity and dispersal nature of the habitat,and,with respect to each critical habitat unit,concludes that the dispersal function would be maintained under the project parameters.the fws biop also addresses the issue,noting that silvicultural prescription will provide habitat suitable for dispersal within these units by maintaining a minimum canopy closure of percent and concluding that 
all critical habitat acreage proposed for harvest will continue to provide dispersal habitat post harvest and will maintain connectivity between chus on the local scale by continuing to provide dispersal habitat therefore,the proposed action will not preclude the ability of chus to maintain connectivity between the physiographic provinces and thus will not compromise the function of critical habitat in the conservation and recovery of the nso.
epic claim therefore does not reveal a deficiency in the ea or a significant impact warranting a full eis.
reliance on fws no jeopardy opinion 
epic also complains that usfs improperly relied on fws opinion that the project would not jeopardize the northern spotted owl.epic argues that even if the project does not violate the esa by threatening the continued existence of a species,an eis is still required if the project may adversely affect the species.clearly,nepa and the esa involve different standards,but this does not require usfs to disregard the findings made by fws in connection with formal consultation mandated by the esa.see.
moreover,usfs did not rely solely on the no jeopardy conclusion,but on all of the analysis contained in the biop,as well as numerous other sources of information.in light of this information,usfs concluded in its fonsi that w hile the selected alternative may affect habitat and has the potential to affect individual northern spotted owls,it will not be significant under nepa.although epic seems to urge that any impact to a listed species requires an eis,usfs correctly argues that the regulation intensity factor focuses on the degree to which an action may adversely affect a threatened species or critical habitat.see native ecosystems,at rejecting need for eis despite fonsi acknowledgment of project impact on individual goshawks and their habitat,where usfs concluded impact on the species was not significant.
reliance on lsrs 
in a somewhat related argument,epic contends that usfs and fws improperly relied on the existence of lsrs to diminish the project impact on critical habitat.epic argument is based primarily on our recent decision in gifford pinchot,at.
gifford pinchot involved a challenge under the esa to fws regulations defining adverse modification of critical habitat and to fws reliance on lsrs to compensate for loss of critical habitat in various biological opinions.we invalidated the adverse modification regulation because it did not account for considerations of recovery as opposed to survival when evaluating adverse modification of critical habitat under the esa.id.at.we also held that fws loss of critical habitat was not an adverse modification because of the existence of the lsr arbitrary and capricious,and noted that this error was not harmless because reliance on the lsrs pervaded the biops.id.at.epic argues that fws biop in this case suffers from similar flaws,while admitting it has not brought an action under the esa or challenged the biop itself.
in the biops challenged in gifford pinchot,fws appears to have essentially treated the lsrs as a substitute for critical habitat.id.at.in contrast,although the fws biop in this case does contain some discussion of lsrs,it contains a significant analysis of the project effect on critical habitat that is independent of the lsr discussion.
moreover,even assuming the fws biop is similarly flawed,usfs did not rely exclusively on this document or on its finding of no adverse modification.further,epic nepa challenge involves a different statutory scheme than the one at issue in gifford pinchot nepa regulations direct usfs to consider the degree to which critical habitat is adversely affected,whereas the esa prohibits any adverse modification of critical habitat.
although there is some discussion of the existence of lsrs in the ea,in this case and unlike gifford pinchot,reliance on the lsrs does not pervade the ea or fonsi,and usfs did not use the lsrs as a substitute for critical habitat the ea and fonsi demonstrate that the agency gave a hard look at the project effect on critical habitat and an adequate explanation of why usfs found adverse impacts to critical habitat were not likely to be significant within the meaning of,the small percentage of critical habitat lost and maintenance of critical constituent elements such as dispersal habitat.we therefore conclude that the ea contains an adequate discussion of the critical habitat issue and that it was not arbitrary and capricious for the agency to determine that an eis was not required.
impacts to watershed 
uncertainty 
epic contends that an eis was also necessary because the project is likely to have significant,adverse impacts on the watershed and because the impacts are uncertain.epic allegation of uncertainty is based on the ea use of the term immeasurable to describe increases in cumulative watershed effects.however,read in the proper context,this term reflects not uncertainty in projecting effects,but usfs conclusion that any effects would be so negligible that they could not be measured these increases would be immeasurable and not likely to adversely affect water quality,anadromous fish habitat or species.
adverse effects 
epic also alleges that the ea analysis of watershed impacts does not provide the hard look required by nepa,that the agency did not use information,and that the agency focused disproportionately on the benefits of the project.although epic alleges that the ea contains very limited actual analysis of watershed impacts,in fact the ea contains fifteen pages devoted to the watershed issue,describing the existing status of the watershed and the projected impacts of the project,and including precautions and methods that would be utilized to minimize impacts.
although s ignificance can not be avoided by terming an action temporary,b,an adverse effect still must be significant to require an eis.the ea does not ignore adverse effects resulting from the project.the ea addresses such effects throughout the analysis,concluding that both direct and indirect effects will be minor or negligible for at least seven different,detailed reasons,including various protective measures incorporated into the project parameters and the small and nature of the areas affected.although the ea expects beneficial effects from the project,it contains a reasoned evaluation of the adverse impacts.because these impacts are expected to be only minor or negligible,an eis was not required.
cumulative impacts 
in determining whether an action requires an eis,the agency must consider w hether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts.b.epic asserts that the ea analysis of cumulative effects on the watershed was seriously flawed,suggesting that the agency glossed over cumulative effects because the effects of the project itself are small.however,the entire ea analysis of the watershed impacts is based on a cumulative watershed effects cwe model,which incorporates the proposed action effects together with current conditions and other reasonably foreseeable projects.the ea considers the cwe on a project level and also a larger watershed scale.epic does not argue that there is any particular error in using the cwe model indeed,this court has previously refused to question this methodology,deferring instead to the agency expertise in developing the model.inland empire pub.lands council schultz,cir.the agency considered cumulative watershed effects and provided a significant amount of quantified and detailed information the ea analysis was sufficient and did not reveal the need for an eis.
failure to include meteor timber sale 
epic also argues that the ea overall analysis of cumulative impacts is flawed because usfs failed to consider the impacts of the meteor timber sale.meteor and knob were both initially part of a larger project,called comet,which was abandoned.when the final knob ea was issued,the meteor project had just been proposed,containing some of the units from the original comet project.
projects that are reasonably foreseeable should be included in the cumulative effects analysis.in the ea,usfs noted the meteor proposal but specifically excluded it from its analysis because meteor was in the initial planning stage and specifics of the units size and treatment prescription had not been identified at that time.although i t is not appropriate to defer consideration of cumulative impacts to a future date when meaningful consideration can be given now,kern blm,cir,nor do we require the government to do the impractical,if not enough information is available to permit meaningful consideration,blue mountains biodiversity project blackwood,cir quoting inland empire pub.lands council usfs,cir.see kleppe sierra club,d noting that once contemplated actions become more formal proposals,later impact statements on those projects will take into account the effect of the earlier proposed actions 
moreover,later,in response to comments to the ea,usfs did analyze the effect of the meteor project based on the information known about the proposed project at that time.friends of the clearwater dombeck,cir considering evidence that agency rectified nepa violation.in the comment response,usfs explained that although the proposal was still not firm,enough was then known to permit a general discussion of effects.usfs noted that the meteor project resembled the knob project in terms of prescriptions,types of logging systems,scattering of units and other resource protection measures,and concluded that meteor would have similar minor or negligible watershed effects.
in sum,because the parameters of the meteor project were unknown at the time of the ea,it was not arbitrary and capricious for usfs to omit the project from its cumulative analysis.moreover,even if usfs made a clear error of judgment by failing to include this project in the ea,it remedied this error by including a reasonably complete discussion of the issue in the comment response,based on the project parameters that were known at that point in time.
reliance on mitigation measures 
epic also criticizes usfs reliance on mitigation measures to downplay the adverse effects of the project.it argues that the ea provides no data supporting the efficacy of its mitigation measures.see parks,at eis required where effectiveness of proposed mitigation measures was too uncertain.
this case differs from national parks,however,because instead of analyzing potential impacts of a proposed action and then developing a plan to mitigate those adverse effects,the project incorporates mitigation measures throughout the plan of action,so that the effects are analyzed with those measures in place thus,it can not be said that the ea fails to analyze the effects of the mitigation measures instead,the ea analyzes the project under the enumerated constraints and concludes that any environmental impacts will not be significant.
the ea also contains very specific and detailed information on the ways that the timber harvest will be conducted in order to minimize effects on wildlife or watershed.in addition to these specifically identified measures,the ea also applicable best management practices bmps,attached in an appendix,which are also quite detailed.compare wetlands action network army corps of eng rs,cir upholding mitigation measures where special permit conditions were extremely detailed,even though all details of mitigation plan were not yet finalized with neighbors of cuddy mountain usfs,cir holding that perfunctory description of mitigation measures was inadequate.the ea also explains that there will be concurrent monitoring of the implementation and effectiveness of these bmps to aid in timely identification of threats and the need for preventative measures or project modifications.see okanogan highlands alliance williams,cir upholding discussion of mitigation measures in an eis where document provides methods for ensuring environmental problems do not develop.
in short,given the specificity of the protection measures,the analysis of the environmental impacts with these measures in place,and the provision for ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance,usfs has taken the requisite hard look at the project environmental consequences,and it was not arbitrary and capricious for it to determine that the impacts would not be significant with these mitigation measures in place.
failure to consider reasonable range of alternatives 
epic also complains that the ea is inadequate because it does not analyze an adequate range of alternatives to the proposed action.we recently joined other circuits in holding that an agency obligation to consider alternatives under an ea is a lesser one than under an eis,native ecosystems,at,and went on to hold that usfs considered an adequate range of alternatives when it dismissed four alternatives without detailed consideration and evaluated only two proposed project and a detail,id.at.
in contrast,the ea here considered
