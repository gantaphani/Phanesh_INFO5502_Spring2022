ii.facts and procedural history 
in,the new jersey department of environmental protection dep commenced an enforcement action in the superior court of new jersey against various entities as a result of contamination in the berry creek area the dep was successful in the action,and,on the ensuing appeal the supreme court of new jersey in affirmed a superior court order requiring those entities,including morton,to remediate the contamination in the berry creek area.see dep t of envtl.prot.ventron.in,morton,which is the successor in interest to ventron corporation,a defendant in the state case,filed this action seeking contribution for its damages arising out of the ventron litigation from rml and numerous other defendants under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,et the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra,stat,as amended et the new jersey spill compensation and control act,stat.ann.et.west the declaratory judgment act,et and the common law rml,which formerly was known as berk,berk,was the british parent corporation of the former berk company,berk.according to morton,rml was liable for contribution based on berk operation of a manufacturing facility from to the which continued to result in the handling,storage,treatment,transportation,disposal,release of solid hazardous wastes around the berry creek area.at 
on march,rml filed a motion in the district court seeking to dismiss morton contribution claim against it for lack of personal jurisdiction.the parties engaged in discovery on the jurisdictional issue following which,as we have indicated,on march,the court granted rml motion rml dismissal order at that time morton did not file a motion seeking an order certifying the rml dismissal order as final and appealable pursuant to.b rule b,and it has not done so since.as we also have indicated,on july,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of defendant tenneco and dismissed morton complaint as to tenneco tenneco order.then,on october,the court entered the consent order dismissing the action without prejudice as to the remaining defendants dismissal order as of october,the court had dismissed the action as to rml for lack of jurisdiction,granted tenneco summary judgment on the merits,and dismissed the action without prejudice against the remaining defendants by consent.thus,as there were no remaining defendants,the court on october,marked the case closed on the docket.nevertheless on october,at morton request in a motion it filed before the entry of the dismissal order,the district court entered an order certifying the tenneco order as final and appealable pursuant to rule b.
on november,morton filed an appeal from the tenneco order tenneco appeal.on september,we vacated the tenneco order and remanded the case for further proceedings.morton int l,staley,cir.on remand on september,the district court entered a stipulation and agreed order of voluntary dismissal without prejudice between morton and tenneco tenneco order.the tenneco order was nearly identical to the dismissal order.
on october,morton filed an appeal from the march,rml dismissal order.plainly,morton measured the time for appeal from the rml dismissal order from the time of entry of the tenneco order,for if it measured the time from the entry of the rml dismissal order or from the entry of the dismissal order,the appeal would have been grossly untimely.see fed.a a.thus,morton implicitly regarded the tenneco order as the final order in this case.
on december,rml filed its motion to dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction according to rml,morton appeal is premature inasmuch as the rml dismissal order was not final when entered because other defendants then remained in the case,the dismissal order dismissing all of the then remaining defendants without prejudice did not render the rml dismissal order final,and the tenneco order did not render the rml dismissal order final morton opposed the motion.the motions panel referred the motion to a merits panel,and on june,we heard oral argument on the appeal.we will dismiss the appeal as premature notwithstanding the elapse of more than seven years since the entry of the order from which morton appeals.
iii.discussion 
ordinarily the proceedings in a district court must be final as to the all causes of action and parties for a court of appeals to have jurisdiction over an appeal under andrews united states,d jackson hart,cir.the classic definition of a final decision is one that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.quackenbush allstate ins,d quoting catlin united states.thus,an order which terminates fewer than all claims,or claims against fewer than all parties,does not constitute a final order for purposes of appeal under.carter city of philadelphia,cir.
accordingly,unless the district court directs the entry of a final judgment as to that order pursuant to.b,an order,such as the rml dismissal order,in which the district court dismissed one defendant for want of personal jurisdiction but other defendants remained,could not in itself be a final order for purposes of appeal when the court entered it.see special,aero air,cir an order dismissing one party for lack of personal jurisdiction while allowing suit to continue against the remaining defendants is not a final,appealable order,absent an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and an express direction for the entry of judgment.citing.b see also pennzoil prods.colelli,cir district court order dismissing some,but not all,defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction not considered final and appealable although appellate jurisdiction existed because district court granted permission for an interlocutory appeal allen okam holdings,cir dismissing appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction when district court dismissed one of two defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction chapple levinsky,cir dismissal of three defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction could not be appealed absent certification under rule b,because case remained pending against other defendant,even though court transferred action as to that defendant to more convenient venue.therefore,the district court march,rml dismissal order dismissing rml as a defendant for want of personal jurisdiction was not a final order for purposes of appeal under when the court entered it inasmuch as other defendants remained in the case and the court did not certify the order as final under rule b.
furthermore,the court,by dismissing the remaining defendants on october,after it entered the tenneco order,did not render the march,rml dismissal order final.the general rule that once all claims against all parties have been dismissed a prior order will become final for purposes of appeal under,see,ragan excavating,cir,does not apply in this case because the district court order entered on october,dismissed all remaining defendants without prejudice and expressly contemplated that morton could refile the action if the parties were unable to resolve their dispute through a alternative resolution process.moreover,the dismissal order contained comprehensive provisions tolling the running of any and all applicable statutes of limitations,and morton,in opposing rml motion to dismiss this appeal,did not contend and never since has contended that the tolling provisions are not still in effect.thus,morton does not argue that it no longer can initiate litigation arising out of the basic controversy in this case against the defendants dismissed without prejudice in the dismissal order.
the principle that,w hen a district court dismisses a case pending settlement,and grants the appellants leave to within a set period of time,the order can not be considered final for the purposes of appeal on the date it was entered,berke bloch,cir,governs this case.only if terms are reached,the plaintiff makes no attempt to the litigation,will the order ripen into a final,appealable order upon the expiration of the fixed time period.id.thus,an order dismissing a complaint without prejudice is not a final and appealable order,unless the plaintiff no longer can amend the complaint because,for example,the statute of limitations has run,or the plaintiff has elected to stand on the complaint.newark branch,town of harrison,cir internal citations and footnotes omitted see also fed.home loan mortgage scottsdale ins,cir given the strong policy against piecemeal litigation that underlies the finality requirement of,we have adhered consistently to the general rule that we lack appellate jurisdiction over partial adjudications when certain of the claims before the district court have been dismissed without prejudice.emphasis added citing erie county retirees ass county of erie,cir ahmed dragovich,cir a dismissal without prejudice is considered final where the applicable statute of limitations would not permit the refiling of a claim tiernan devoe,cir order of dismissal without prejudice not a final,appealable order unless and until the party seeking relief disavows any intention to reinstitute the litigation.
the reason for the dismissal without prejudice exception to the general rule that an order in a case is final for purposes of appeal when the court has dismissed the case as to all claims and parties is obvious,as the treatment of dismissals without prejudice as not being final disallows the manipulative plaintiff from having his cake the ability to refile the claims voluntarily dismissed and eating it too getting an early bite at reversing the claims dismissed involuntarily.marshall kansas city ry,cir.on the other hand,the reason for the exception to the exception to the rule that a case dismissed without prejudice is not final is equally obvious.the exception to the exception is appropriate because a case dismissed without prejudice that can not be reinstituted is in the same position as a case dismissed with prejudice in that both classes of cases have reached finality.
several of our cases demonstrate the application of finality rules when cases are dismissed without prejudice.in tiernan,for example,we pointed out that the plaintiffs initially retained the ability to reinstitute part of the litigation following the dismissal without prejudice of some,but not all,of the defendants.at.we nonetheless determined that the order was final because,s everal months after th e appeal was filed,plaintiffs renounced,through letter briefs,any intention to take further action against the defendants.id.in blair scott specialty gases,cir,we similarly held that the district court order dismissing the case without prejudice and directing the parties to proceed with arbitration was final and appealable because the district court did not retain jurisdiction over any of the plaintiff claims as every claim was held to be arbitrable.in other words,there was nothing left for the plaintiff to do but submit to arbitration,and nothing left for the district court to do other than execute,modify,or vacate the ultimate arbitration award.id.at.
here,in its dismissal order dismissing the action as to the defendants remaining without prejudice after tenneco and rml were out of the case,the district court expressly contemplated that there could be subsequent proceedings in the event litigation is resumed.rml,ex.d at.the order also provided that the parties may claims against each other if they are unable to settle the dispute in informal,alternative dispute resolution procedures.rml,ex.d at.in addition,the district court specifically stated that the dismissal shall not constitute an adjudication on the merits.rml,ex.d at.unlike the order in blair directing the parties to arbitrate,which left nothing for the court to do but to execute the judgment,the dismissal order did not compel the parties to participate in binding arbitration.the order merely afforded the parties the opportunity to participate in alternative dispute resolution procedures and contemplated that there could be further litigation should the resolution process fail.
furthermore,unlike the plaintiffs in tiernan,morton has not renounced its intention to take further action against the defendants.see at.quite to the contrary,at oral argument before us morton expressly declined to disavow any intention to take further action against the berry creek defendants and stated that at some point in the future another action might be brought involving this matter.thus,its position at oral argument reiterated what morton said when,in opposing rml motion to dismiss this appeal,it acknowledged that there might be a new action sometime in the future based upon the same controversy.morton opp at.
we reject morton contention that the dismissal order is nonetheless final because,although there might be a new action sometime in the future based upon the same controversy,morton opp at emphasis added,there is nothing in the dismissal orders that will allow morton to reinstitute the current action.morton opp at emphasis added citing aluminum of am.beazer east,alcoa,cir.in this regard,morton relies on alcoa,in which we stated that finality is not lacking even if another action regarding the same controversy may occur before the same or another court,alcoa,at,and when there will not be any further proceedings in the district court as part of the same action,the district court decision must be considered final for purposes of.id.at.
although the quoted language in alcoa distinguished between further proceedings in the same action,at,and further proceedings in another action,id.at,alcoa involved an unusual posture,id.at,and the purported distinction upon which morton relies is inapposite to the facts of this case.in alcoa,the district court entered a consent order,which stated that any issues remaining after the liability trial,allocation or apportionment of damages,shall be referred to a private binding process id.at.following a subsequent bench trial in which the district court found that certain of the defendants were not liable,the took an appeal from the order entered on the findings.
we concluded that we had jurisdiction over the appeal despite the fact that the consent order le ft other issues relevant to the therefore,certain of the parties to be resolved through a separate arbitration or mediation process,id.at,because every issue that was left unresolved,issues after trial had been removed from the district court and referred to.the consent order guarantees that there will be no further proceedings before the district court in this action.id.we explained that the district court accomplish ed all that the parties asked the court to accomplish,id.at,and subsequent judicial proceedings to enforce,confirm,or vacate an arbitration award are regarded as distinct matters,and the possibility of their occurrence does not deprive the district court order in the original proceeding of its finality.id.at.
after our review of the quoted language from alcoa in its proper context,we are satisfied that that case does not support a conclusion that the without prejudice dismissal order in this case is final.here,morton may refile its claims should the alternative dispute resolution procedures fail as the dismissal order expressly allows it to do so.despite the district court characterization of such a refiling as litigation,see rml,ex.d at,the district court to date has not accomplish ed all that the parties asked the court to accomplish merely by allowing the parties to resolve their differences in a setting.see alcoa,at.therefore,any litigation effectively will be part of the original action and controversy,albeit with a new caption and docket number.unlike the situation in alcoa,the subsequent action or actions will not be initiated solely to enforce,confirm,or vacate an arbitration award,at,inasmuch as the dismissal order did not compel the parties to arbitrate,or even contemplate that the parties would engage in binding arbitration,but rather contemplated that if settlement efforts failed that there might be further litigation regarding the original controversy consequently,there is potential for the district court to revisit the case in the event that morton refiles its claims against one or more of the defendants,which may require the district court to adjudicate its claim or claims on the merits.therefore,the order of dismissal of all remaining defendants on october,was not a final order and thus did not render the rml dismissal order final and appealable 
our holding in lnc invs.llc republic nicaragua,cir,further supports the principle that a dismissal order that contemplates that there may be a future action based on the same controversy does not constitute a final order for purposes of appeal.in lnc,we did not consider final lnc voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the pending garnishment actions against defendant former parent companies inasmuch as the order did not effectively bar a future garnishment action against the parent companies arising from the disputed agreement.id.emphasis added.similarly,in patten sec.diamond greyhound genetics,cir,we concluded that an order terminating the action pending the result of an arbitration proceeding and allowing the matter to be reinstated upon motion by either party was not final for purposes of section we explained that w hile it is not clear what course the case will take upon the completion of the pending arbitration,the order clearly contemplates the possibility of further proceedings.id.emphasis added see also delgrosso spang,cir an order that permits reinstatement and contemplates the possibility of future proceedings is not final for purposes of.
the approach to finality that we take here and took in lnc,patten,delgrosso and numerous other cases is consistent with the approach of other courts of appeals.for example,the court of appeals for the second circuit has held that a dismissal without prejudice that does not preclude another action on the same claims will not be considered final for purposes of appeal.chappelle beacon commc ns,cir emphasis added see also larkin galloway,cir plaintiff can not appeal dismissal without prejudice if he is free to refile his claims.in addition,samco global arms,arita,cir,is consistent with the exception to the rule of for appeal purposes of a dismissal without prejudice that we recognized in tiernan and blair,as it indicated that,a lthough the district court order dismissed the case without prejudice,it is clear that the order was nevertheless final,as the district court found the defendants immune from all claims by the plaintiff relating to the defendants actions,and closed the case without granting the plaintiff permission to amend or refile.
contrary to morton assertion,the words case closed entered on the docket sheet on october,are not dispositive on the question of whether the dismissal order and thus the earlier rml dismissal order are final.an order reciting that no further action is contemplated and directing the clerk to mark the case closed does not become final for purposes of appellate jurisdiction merely by reason of the execution of that order and its entry on the docket delgrosso,at.in delgrosso,we explained that t he order directing the clerk to mark the case closed does not purport to end litigation on the merits and the parties agree that it does not determine any issues or resolve the entire case.id.the case closed entry on the docket sheet in this case similarly fails to demonstrate that the orders entered were final for purposes of appeal.
we also draw on our own experience in recognizing that a district court does not render a matter final for purposes of appeal merely by marking the docket in the case with the notation case closed.in fact,our experience teaches us that sometimes a district court will mark a case closed when it could not possibly be final for purposes of appeal.see penn west,cohen,cir.we believe that there is not an inconsistency in marking a case closed even though the court has not entered a final order in the case for appeal purposes as district courts mark cases closed for unassailable administrative reasons when they contemplate that there will not be further proceedings in them.for example,as happened here,it is appropriate for a district court to mark the docket as case closed even though the court dismissed the action without prejudice and there was no impediment to a party seeking to reinstate the case.in this regard,we point out that it is entirely reasonable for a court to mark such a case as closed though the court has not entered a final order in the case for appeal purposes because frequently the parties do not reinstitute cases dismissed without prejudice.
in sum,the dismissal order dismissing all remaining defendants on october,was not a final order and thus did not lend finality to the march,rml dismissal order.the dismissal order dismissing the remaining defendants without prejudice did not purport to end the litigation on the merits and specifically contemplated that there could be subsequent proceedings in which the litigation over the controversy would resume.accordingly,the dismissal order fails to satisfy the traditional requirement for a judgment to be final and therefore can not lend finality to the earlier order dismissing rml.see quackenbush,at.at.the same is true with respect to the tenneco order,the entry of which morton regards as triggering its right to appeal from the rml dismissal order,as it does not preclude further litigation against any of the defendants in this case.
finally,we should not close our opinion without commenting on an inconsistency in morton position.morton argument that its appeal is not too early is predicated on the premise that the district court disposed of the case against the last remaining defendant when it entered the tenneco order dismissing the action without prejudice as to tenneco.however,if we accept this proposition,morton appeal of the rml dismissal order is too late inasmuch as the district court dismissed the remaining defendants in the dismissal order after it granted tenneco summary judgment in the tenneco order,but morton appeal would be untimely if measured from either of those orders.the point we make is necessarily true because both the dismissal order and the tenneco order dismissed the defendant or defendants remaining at that time without prejudice.thus,if the tenneco order was final for purposes of an appeal then the dismissal order was similarly final because at that point there were no remaining defendants in the case.
in explaining that its appeal is not too late,morton claims that the orders entered in were not final because this court subsequently entertained morton appeal as to the tenneco order and remanded the case against tenneco for further proceedings.morton opp at.according to morton,a ll claims against all parties were not effectively disposed of since this court remanded for further proceedings the claims against tenneco.morton opp at.
this argument plainly is flawed in
