this appeal concerns a proposal to construct a home improvement center in the city of sonora.a local citizens organization challenged the approval of the project and the adoption of a mitigated negative declaration by alleging violations of the california environmental quality act ceqa and local ordinances.the superior court denied the organization petition for a writ of mandate.
the organization appealed,arguing that the whole of the action constituting a single ceqa project was segmented when the realignment of an adjacent road was not treated as part of the home improvement center project.this case is similar to plan for arcadia,city council of arcadia d.plan for arcadia,where the court found that the construction of i a shopping center,ii a parking lot,and iii improvements to an adjacent street were all part of a single ceqa project.following the opinion in that case,we conclude as a matter of law that the construction of the home improvement center and the realignment of the road constitute a single ceqa project.as a result,the combined activity should have been analyzed in the same initial environmental study.
therefore,judgment is reversed and the matter remanded for the issuance of a writ of mandate.
facts and proceedings 
plaintiff and appellant tuolumne county citizens for responsible growth,responsible growth alleged that it is a nonprofit public benefit corporation organized under california law and that its mission includes protecting the greater sonora,california area rural quality of life by,among other things,seeking the enforcement of environmental protection laws.
defendants and respondents city of sonora,the city council of the city of sonora,and the planning commission of the city of sonora collectively,city approved the project application for the proposed home improvement center.
respondents and real parties in interest are california gold development,the entity that applied to city for approval of the project sometimes referred to as applicant ray sanguinetti land,sonora developers,llc and lowe hiw,a washington corporation.for purposes of this opinion,we will refer to the real parties in interest collectively as lowe.
in december,lowe submitted to city design review,site plan review,and landscape review applications for a new lowe home improvement center.
the site for the proposed lowe home improvement center is acres of land located to the west of old wards ferry road and south of the sierra railroad tracks.a store is located on the eastern side of old wards ferry road.the approved project is to include the construction of a square foot building square feet of merchandising area,and square foot garden center,along with associated parking areas,driveways,landscaping,and street improvements,as illustrated in the revised site plan submitted on may,
the initial study indicated the site would be accessed by two driveways connected to old wards ferry road,one on the north end of the site near the sierra railroad tracks,and one on the south end,adjacent to the state highway,to primarily serve truck traffic needs.
the initial study also stated that old wards ferry road will be realigned across the adjacent parcel to the north to create a four way intersection with sanguinetti and greenley roads,in accordance with local and regional street and road improvements previously identified by the city of sonora and the tuolumne county transportation commission.moving a portion of old wards ferry road to the west,so that it aligns with greenley road and creates a intersection at sanguinetti road,would require that old wards ferry road cross the sierra railroad to the west of the existing crossing.
on march,city published a notice of intent to adopt a mitigated negative declaration that stated a public review period began on march,and ended on april.city circulated a proposed initial study,mitigated negative declaration,and mitigation monitoring and reporting plan.
after receiving comments from the public and additional information from lowe,city revised the mitigated negative declaration.city determined that recirculation of the final mitigated negative declaration was not necessary.
at its june,special meeting,the planning commission of city approved the application for design and site plan review submitted for the home improvement center project and adopted the mitigated negative declaration.the approval was subject to a number of conditions,some of which concerned old wards ferry road.one of the conditions required an encroachment plan,approved by the city engineer,for access to and from the site using old wards ferry road.condition provided 
in addition to the encroachment plan to old wards ferry road,and associated improvements,the following street and road improvements shall also be completed prior to the commencement of business operations by lowe realignment of the intersection of old wards roads,along with relocation of the sierra railroad crossing of old wards ferry road to p ublic utility commission standards.signalization at the intersection of old wards roads,linked to the signal at mono road.an offer of dedication of across the north side of the project site related to the city study of an alternative route.a financial contribution to the county of tuolumne of twelve percent of costs for restriping,signing and widening associated with the mono loop intersection.
on july,responsible growth appealed the planning commission approval of the home improvement center project to the city council.the city council held a special meeting on july,to consider the appeal.the matter was continued to july.on that date,the city council denied responsible growth appeal,adopted the revised mitigated negative declaration,and approved the home improvement center project.
city filed a notice of determination on august.later that month,responsible growth filed a petition for writ of mandate that alleged the approval of the project for the construction of a lowe home improvement center violated ceqa and local ordinances.
on may,the superior court held a hearing on the petition for writ of mandate.in august,the superior court signed and filed a statement of decision that denied the petition in all respects.judgment in favor of city and lowe was filed on august.responsible growth filed a timely notice of appeal in october.
requests for judicial notice 
responsible growth first motion requesting judicial notice,filed on february,includes four documents exhibits through.exhibit is chapter of the sonora municipal code,titled parking and loading.see part,post.exhibits through are documents related to the realignment of a portion of old wards ferry road.
lowe joint motion for judicial notice filed on april,includes eight documents exhibits a through exhibit c is chapter of the sonora municipal code,which also is exhibit in responsible growth motion.
responsible growth opposition was filed on april,and does not oppose judicial notice of exhibits a through g,but does oppose judicial notice of exhibit h,a resolution of the tuolumne county transportation council,which did not exist at the time city approved lowe proposed project 
we grant responsible growth first motion requesting judicial notice and lowe joint motion for judicial notice so that we have a better picture of the issues that will confront the superior court on remand.responsible growth second motion requesting judicial notice filed on july,is denied.
discussion 
scope of the projecta.contentions of the parties 
the parties disagree over whether the proposed home improvement center and the realignment of old wards ferry road are part of a single project for purposes of ceqa.see pub.resources code,definition of project,tit,subd.a same.responsible growth contends the two endeavors are part of the whole of a single ceqa project,and city thus violated ceqa by finding it was unnecessary to consider the realignment of old wards ferry road in the mitigated negative declaration prepared for the home improvement center project.
lowe disagrees.it contends that city properly evaluated the whole of the home improvement center project and substantial evidence shows that the road realignment project was a longstanding,separate city project.furthermore,according to lowe,city determination does not mean environmental review of the road realignment project has been avoided because that project is undergoing a separate ceqa review.
statutory and regulatory provisions that define project 
ceqa requires public agencies to undertake an environmental review of proposed projects that require their discretionary approval.pub.resources code,subd.a.consequently,the determination of the scope of the project is an important step in complying with the mandates of ceqa.
ceqa broadly defines a project as an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment,and that involves the issuance to a person of a lease,permit,license,certificate,or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.pub.resources code.
the statutory definition is augmented by the guidelines,which define a project as the whole of an action,which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment guidelines,subd.a,italics added see remy et,guide to the cal.environmental quality act ceqa ed remy whole of an action requirement.the term project refers to the activity which is being approved and which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies.the term project does not mean each separate governmental approval.guidelines,subd.c.
the scope of the environmental review conducted for the initial study must include the entire project.specifically,a ll phases of project planning,implementation,and operation must be considered in the initial study of the project.guidelines,subd.a.
policies that influence the definition of a project 
the california supreme court has considered how to interpret the word project and concluded that ceqa is to be interpreted in such manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.friends of mammoth board of supervisors cal d,disapproved of on other grounds in kowis howard cal th,d.based on this guidance from the california supreme court and the policies identified by the legislature in public resources code sections and,the court of appeal has given the term project a broad interpretation and application to maximize protection of the environment.azusa land reclamation main san gabriel basin watermaster th,d see friends of the sierra railroad tuolumne park recreation dist.th,d this court stated ceqa conception of a project is broad.this broad interpretation ensures that the requirements of ceqa can not be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into pieces which,when taken individually,may have no significant adverse effect on the environment plan for arcadia,supra,d.lake county energy council county of lake d.
question of fact or question of law 
a fundamental dispute between the parties is whether city decision about the scope of the home improvement center project is reviewed as a question of fact or as a question of law.lowe argues that the question is factual in nature and,thus,reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.
it is that w hether an activity is a project is an issue of law that can be decided on undisputed data in the record on appeal.citation.muzzy ranch solano county airport land use com.cal th,d,see friends of the sierra railroad tuolumne park recreation,supra,th at,d.that proposition,however,does not answer a preliminary question.
before the question whether an activity is a project can be addressed,the question concerning which acts to include and exclude from the scope of the activity must be answered which acts,that is,constitute the whole of an action for purposes of determining the scope of a potential project guidelines,subd.a term project encompasses whole of an action affecting environment.
a number of published decisions have stated that the question whether an activity is a project is one of law subject to independent review by an appellate court,association for a cleaner environment yosemite community college dist.th,d ace black property owners city of berkeley th,d w hether a particular activity constitutes a project in the first instance is a question of law.
in contrast,it appears that no published opinion has yet addressed explicitly the question whether a determination of the scope of an activity is reviewed as either a question of law or a question of fact.this court has,however,ruled by implication that the question is one of law.ace,supra,th at,d.
in ace,we addressed what actions should be considered as part of the potential ceqa project in a case involving the closure of a community college shooting range.ace,supra,th at,d.we determined that the closure and removal of the shooting range,the cleanup activity,and the transfer of the operations previously conducted there to other facilities were all part of a single,coordinated endeavor undertaken by the community college.id.at,d.as a result,we concluded that those acts were part of the whole of an action by the community college for purposes of guidelines section.ace,supra,at,d.we reached this conclusion based on an independent review of the evidence in the record.we did not apply the substantial evidence test to the agency determination or otherwise defer to its determination.see id.at,d.
accordingly,absent contrary authority,we take the same approach taken in ace and conclude that the question concerning which acts constitute the whole of an action for purposes of guidelines section is a question of law that appellate courts independently decide based on the undisputed facts in the record.
undisputed facts in the record 
lowe has not argued explicitly that there are insufficient undisputed facts in the record for this court to determine the scope of the whole of its action as a matter of law.nevertheless,we will treat such an argument as implicit in lowe position that a question of fact was resolved by city.
scope of the home improvement center project 
the parties approach the scope of the home improvement center project from different perspectives.responsible growth emphasizes the whole of an action language in guidelines section and the connections between the home improvement center project and the road realignment.in contrast,lowe emphasizes the age and historical independence of the plan to realign old wards ferry road.
case law concerning building projects and adjacent roadwork 
we begin by comparing the facts of this case to the facts of a case with significant for arcadia,supra,d,where the court of appeal addressed whether the construction of a shopping center,a parking lot,and improvements to an adjacent street were all part of a single ceqa project.the court stated it was clear that the shopping center and parking lot projects together with the widening of the southern portion of baldwin avenue are related to each other and that in assessing their environmental impact they should be regarded as a single project under ceqa.plan for arcadia,supra,d at.in contrast,the court also determined that the widening of the northern portion of baldwin avenue was a separate ceqa project.id.at.consequently,in this case,we examine whether the road realignment is more like the widening of the northern portion of baldwin avenue or the widening of the southern portion.
in the,the city of arcadia determined that the completion of the foothill freeway would cause baldwin avenue to receive more traffic and that,eventually,it would need to be improved to safely accommodate the increased traffic.plan for arcadia,supra,d at.in,the developer applied for a zoning change to allow the construction of a major regional shopping center,fashion park.id.at.the city voters approved the zoning change in april.when the fashion park applications were under consideration the city determined that additional traffic generated by the shopping center could be accommodated by the widening of baldwin avenue already requested because of the freeway.id.at.the city saved itself part of the cost of widening the avenue by requiring the developer to commit itself to paying for widening the portion adjacent to the shopping is,the southern portion.ibid.in march,the city council included the widening of the northern portion in a capital improvement plan and subsequently conducted a separate environmental review of that part of the widening of baldwin avenue.id.at.
in plan for arcadia,the court of appeal referenced two facts to support the conclusion that the widening of the northern portion of baldwin avenue was not part of the project that included building the shopping center and parking lot and widening the southern portion of baldwin avenue.first,the city had determined long before the application for the zoning change that the completion of the freeway would require the widening of baldwin avenue.second,the widening of the northern portion was a municipal capital improvement project,not a private project.plan for arcadia,supra,d at.
in contrast to these two facts,the widening of the southern portion of baldwin avenue was a condition of the fashion park development plan for arcadia,supra,d at,fn.also,the developer had committed to paying for it.id.at.consequently,the court concluded that the building of the shopping center and parking lot and the widening of the southern portion of baldwin avenue were related to each other and should be regarded as a single project under ceqa.plan for arcadia,supra,at.
the realignment of old wards ferry road is similar to the widening of the southern portion of baldwin avenue in two important ways.first,the approval of the home improvement center project is conditioned upon completion of the road realignment.second,lowe has committed to funding and completing the road realignment these two similarities are more significant than the one similarity between the realignment of old wards ferry road and the widening of the northern portion of baldwin plan for the work.consequently,there is a strong connection between the road realignment and the completion of the proposed home improvement center.it follows that our decision will be consistent with plan for arcadia only if we conclude that the home improvement center project and the road realignment are part of a single ceqa project.citizens for sensible development of bishop area county of inyo d.acts related to development of shopping center were single project use of two negative declarations overturned on appeal.
application of general principles 
before following the result reached in plan for arcadia,we test that result by applying some of the general principles used to determine whether a particular act is part of the activity that constitutes a ceqa project.
one way to evaluate which acts are part of a project is to examine how closely related the acts are to the overall objective of the project.the relationship between the particular act and the remainder of the project is sufficiently close when the proposed physical act is among the various steps which taken together obtain an objective.robie et,cal.civil litigation.
in this case,lowe objective is to open and operate a home improvement center in sonora.the commencement of business operations at the site is conditioned upon the completion of the realignment of old wards ferry road.as a result,the road realignment is a step that lowe must take to achieve its objective.in this regard,we note that lowe has cited no case or other authority for the proposition that a condition or mitigation measure is not part of the project to which it is attached.
in addition,the road realignment and the proposed home improvement center are related in time,physical location and the entity undertaking the action.as to timing,the road alignment must be completed before business operations at the home improvement center may begin.with respect to the physical location,the activities are next to one another.furthermore,the realignment of the road will be undertaken by the project proponents which also will be making other changes to old wards ferry road.when two acts are closely connected in time and location,the potential for related physical changes to the environment in that location is greater than otherwise.thus,the need for a single review of the environmental impact of the two acts is greater.also,when the same entity undertakes both matters,it increases the likelihood that the matters are is,are part of a larger whole.
in summary,the various connections between the road realignment and the proposed home improvement center compel us to conclude that they are related acts that constitute a single ceqa project.
separate and independent 
city has long recognized the advantages of aligning old wards ferry road with greenley road so that a intersection is created at sanguinetti road.city community development director testified at the july,city council hearing that it has been a separate and distinct project for over twenty years,as far as it relates to the city.he further testified that the realignment is shown in the general plan circulation element and in city redevelopment plan as a regional road improvement.also,this intersection and roadway realignment has been part of our local road program under the traffic impact fee program for quite sometime sic 
lowe contends the foregoing testimony is part of the substantial evidence that supports city finding that the road realignment is separate and independent from the home improvement center project lowe presents three arguments to support this position.
first,lowe contends the developer only sought approval to construct the lowe facility and did not seek approval of the road realignment.the guidelines,however,establish that the need for separate approvals does not sever all of the connections between the two acts.see guidelines,subd.c separate governmental approvals do not create separate projects.the acts remained connected,notwithstanding the separate approvals,because the road realignment is a condition that must be completed by the developer of the home improvement center before that center may commence business.
second,lowe argues the road realignment is separate because it is not necessitated by the home improvement center project.lowe asserts the need for the road realignment was caused by regional traffic conditions and cumulative impacts associated with growth and development throughout sonora.case law requires that the term project be given a broad interpretation and application.we reject the position that a ceqa project excludes an activity that actually will be undertaken if the need for that activity was not fully attributable to the project as originally proposed.the necessitated by test is best applied in cases that consider whether a potential future action is sufficiently certain to occur to justify its inclusion in the scope of the activity that might constitute a ceqa project.see friends of the sierra railroad tuolumne park recreation,supra,th at,d.when the situation involves action that actually will be taken to complete the project as proposed,the necessitated by test is a far too narrow standard for determining the scope of the project.for example,it is contrary to the broader related to language used by the court of appeal in plan for arcadia,supra,d at page,and the whole of an action language used in guidelines section.also,it is inconsistent with the inquiry into whether the act is a step taken towards the achievement of an is,whether the act is part of a coordinated endeavor.see ace,supra,th at,d series of acts all part of single,coordinated endeavor.
third,lowe contends that the home improvement center project and the road realignment are not integral,because they could be implemented independently of each other.based on this contention,lowe concludes that the two undertakings are not part of a single ceqa project.we reject this argument for two reasons.
first,lowe has misstated how the concept of integral parts is used to determine the scope of a ceqa project.we accept the following as an accurate statement of law courts have considered separate activities as one ceqa project and required them to be reviewed together where both acti
