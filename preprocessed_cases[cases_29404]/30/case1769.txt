in this workers compensation case,claimant filed a claim,and employer accepted it.thereafter,claimant filed a claim for a new medical condition,but employer neither accepted nor denied that claim.instead,employer sent what has come to be known as an encompassed condition letter that stated,in essence,that the new medical condition already had been accepted.claimant was not satisfied with that answer,given that the specificity of an employer acceptance can affect the rating of a claim at closure.she challenged the lawfulness of employer response,arguing that pertinent statutes required employer either to accept or deny the new medical condition claim.the board rejected her challenge and upheld the validity of the encompassed condition letter.claimant then filed a petition for judicial review,seeking reversal and an award of attorney fees.
in the meantime,employer reevaluated the case and decided to grant claimant request for formal acceptance of the new medical condition.employer then moved to dismiss the petition for judicial review as moot.claimant responded that the case continues to present a live controversy because of her claim for attorney fees.
the case thus poses two questions for us to resolve.first,does employer decision to grant claimant request for formal acceptance moot her request for judicial review second,if not,did the board err in rejecting claimant challenge to the validity of employer encompassed condition letter that is,was employer required to formally accept a condition that it believed was already encompassed in its previous acceptance 
we answer the first question in the negative.claimant denied request for attorney fees remains a live issue,the disposition of which depends on whether the board correctly determined the validity of employer encompassed condition letter.we answer the second question in the affirmative.the relevant statutes required employer to accept or deny claimant new medical condition claim.we therefore reverse and remand for reconsideration.
factual background 
the facts are not in dispute.claimant injured her back at work.an mri performed the following week showed a herniated disc at and compression of the left nerve.claimant underwent a left micro diskectomy.employer accepted a claim for disc herniation.the claim later was closed with an award of temporary disability and an award of permanent partial disability.
claimant,however,still suffered some pain in her back.an epidural injection revealed that the motion segment with irritation of the nerve root was her primary pain generator.claimant physician,weingarten,agreed with the diagnosis of nerve root irritation.
at that point,claimant wrote to employer asking it to formally accept a new medical condition,namely,nerve root irritation.employer responded by writing to weingarten to ask whether he agreed that the accepted condition of disc herniation encompassed and reasonably apprised the condition of nerve root irritation.weingarten replied that it did.employer then wrote to claimant,issuing the encompassed condition letter that is the subject of claimant challenge on review.that letter stated that w e have received your request to formally accept nerve root irritation.we have reviewed that request and find that the previously tendered acceptance s in this claim encompass es the diagnoses or conditions that you have requested.
claimant wrote weingarten,stating that she believed that the notice of acceptance of the herniated disc did not reasonably apprise her of the acceptance of the nerve root condition.weingarten responded that he now agreed with claimant.
claimant underwent an medical examination by reimer and grossenbacher.those physicians concluded that there were too many inconsistencies in the examination to identify any residual motor weaknesses in the left lower extremity.in their opinion,there was no evidence of an nerve root irritation at all.
weingarten then suggested that,in light of the panel conclusions,perhaps nerve conduction studies could resolve the matter.devere performed such studies.he found no electrodiagnostic evidence for lumbrosacral radiculopathy,plexopathy or neropathy.he believed that claimant symptoms most likely were secondary to pain and poor effort.weingarten conceded that it appeared that none of the relevant diagnostic tests supported a diagnosis of weakness.
meanwhile,claimant requested a hearing on the validity of employer encompassed condition letter.claimant characterized the letter as an effective denial,which she asked the administrative law judge alj to overturn with an award of attorney fees for the wrongful denial.ors.claimant argued that,under ors,employer had an obligation to respond to her new medical condition claim by either formally accepting or formally denying the claim.as employer did neither,she argued,the encompassed condition letter that employer issued must be treated as a denial,which,she contended,had been erroneously issued.employer responded that ors expressly provides that an employer is not required to accept each and every diagnosis or medical condition with particularity as long as the acceptance tendered reasonably apprises the claimant and the medical providers of the nature of the compensable conditions.claimant replied that weingarten stated that,in fact,employer acceptance of the disc herniation did not reasonably apprise her or medical providers of the nerve condition.
the alj rejected claimant argument.the alj began by quoting ors and stating that the dispositive issue is whether employer earlier acceptance of the disc herniation reasonably apprise d claimant and the medical providers of the nature of the compensable conditions.the alj noted that claimant relied primarily on the opinion of weingarten to support her contention that the claimed nerve irritation should have been accepted as a separate and additional condition.the alj observed that weingarten did say that,at least initially.but following that,the alj explained,when employer specifically asked weingarten if the notice of acceptance the condition of the nerve root irritation,weingarten replied that it did.
claimant requested review of the alj opinion and order,but the board adopted it in toto and affirmed without further discussion.
claimant petitioned for judicial review and filed an opening brief in which she reverts to her initial argument before the alj that,under ors,employer had an unqualified obligation to formally accept or formally reject her new medical condition claim.employer responds that claimant is ignoring ors and the reasonably apprises standard that was the basis for the board decision.in reply,claimant states that the notice of acceptance in this case did not reasonably apprise her or the medical providers of her new medical condition.
in the meantime,as we have noted,employer decided to give claimant what she had asked for,namely,formal acceptance of her nerve root condition.employer then moved to dismiss on mootness grounds.
ii.analysis 
we begin with employer motion to dismiss on the ground of mootness.employer contends that,because it has now formally accepted claimant nerve root irritation condition,there is nothing left for us to decide and,thus,no justiciable controversy.claimant responds that the board upholding of the encompassed condition letter was in effect a determination that her claim had not been denied and resulted in the denial of her request for attorney fees under ors.as a result,she argues,her entitlement to attorney fees remains a live issue,the disposition of which depends on the effect of employer issuance of its encompassed condition letter.

whether a judicial decision will have such a practical effect on the rights of the parties depends on the facts and the procedural posture of e
