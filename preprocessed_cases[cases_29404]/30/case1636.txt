introduction 
powerine oil company powerine,a now defunct oil refinery,faces liability for certain governmentally imposed cleanup and abatement orders requiring it to remediate soil and groundwater pollution resulting from its past refinery operations at various locations.in certain underwriters at lloyd of london superior court powerine oil company cal th,d,powerine i,an earlier writ proceeding in the instant case,we held that the insurer duty to indemnify powerine,the insured,for all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages under the wording of the standard comprehensive general liability cgl insurance policy is limited to money ordered by a court,and does not extend to environmental cleanup costs ordered by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute.id.at,d.this conclusion flowed logically both from the literal language of the standard cgl policy,which provides coverage for damages,and from our earlier decision in,national union fire ins.cal th,d,which held that the insurer duty to defend the insured in a suit seeking damages under the wording of the same standard cgl policy is likewise limited to civil suits prosecuted in court.id.at,d.
in this matter,following on the heels of the earlier writ proceeding,we are called upon to decide whether the obligation of another insurer to indemnify powerine under the wording of nine insurance policies is likewise limited to money ordered by a court in a suit for damages against the insured.the court of appeal concluded it is not,reasoning that the insuring language of the policies here in question is broader than that of the standard primary cgl policy at issue in powerine i,and covers costs that the insured must expend in complying with an administrative agency pollution cleanup and abatement orders.for reasons to be explained,we agree.although other policy provisions or exclusion clauses yet to be litigated could ultimately defeat coverage as this litigation progresses,the express wording of the central insuring agreement in these nine excess umbrella policies goes well beyond mere coverage for money damages,and is broad enough to include coverage for the liability of environmental cleanup and response costs ordered by an administrative agency.under a literal reading of these policies,we conclude such would be the objectively reasonable expectation of the insured.accordingly,we shall affirm the judgment of the court of appeal directing the trial court to deny the insurer motion for summary adjudication of the duty to indemnify.
facts and procedural background 
the parties have stipulated to the underlying facts.the issue before the lower courts and now this court is one of law,and involves the interpretation of the insuring provisions of nine standard form policies issued by real party in interest central national insurance company of omaha central national to powerine over the course of years.
powerine,through its various owners,was periodically engaged in oil refinery operations in southern california since the.these included oil refining,oil and exploration,production,terminaling and transportation operations throughout the western states.at one point powerine business occupied over acres at its santa fe springs refinery.in,however,a soft petroleum market forced powerine into bankruptcy.since that time,the refinery has not been operated at all and only a skeleton crew of employees has remained for environmental compliance and equipment maintenance purposes.
as a result of its operations,powerine faces governmentally imposed environmental liabilities arising from alleged soil and groundwater contamination at various locations.the california regional water quality control boards for the los angeles and san diego regions regional water boards initiated remedial administrative proceedings against powerine pursuant to an environmental statute,the act,et two cleanup and abatement orders were issued to powerine requiring it to remediate pollution resulting from its past oil refinery operations at locations.it is undisputed that these orders were not issued as a result of litigation or as part of an injunction.cleanup and abatement order,issued by the los angeles regional water board,allegedly followed negotiations and a series of compromises between powerine and that regional water board concerning the scope of the order and the nature and extent of investigative activities to be undertaken thereunder.as of the date of the proceedings in the court of appeal,powerine had not incurred any expenses pursuant to either order.
powerine notified its many insurers of the orders,giving rise to a declaratory relief action against it.highlands insurance company powerine,et,super.county,no.powerine against numerous insurers,including certain london underwriters which had issued both primary cgl and policies,and real party in interest central national,which had issued nine policies covering periods from to the expiration of the last policy in february the alleged that each insurer had a contractual duty to defend and indemnify powerine for the costs of cleanup and abatement arising from the environmental orders issued by the regional water boards,and sought,inter alia,declaratory relief and damages for breach of contract and of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
while the declaratory relief action and were pending,this court decided,supra,cal th,d,holding that under the standard cgl policy defense clause language,no duty to defend arises in connection with prelitigation administrative proceedings as it does when a suit seeking damages is commenced through the filing of a complaint in court.id.at,d.consequently,the primary insurers in this action certain underwriters at lloyds of london,hereafter the london market insurers moved for summary adjudication of their duty to defend and duty to indemnify costs resulting from the regional water boards administrative proceedings and issuance of cleanup and abatement orders under the act when the trial court denied the motion,the primary insurers petitioned for a writ of mandate in the court of appeal.that court ordered the issuance of a writ directing entry of an order granting the primary insurers summary adjudication motion on the duty to indemnify as noted,this court affirmed in powerine i,supra,cal th,d,holding that the primary insurers had no duty to indemnify powerine for costs or expenses incurred in connection with the administrative proceedings because the insurer duty to indemnify under the standard cgl policy language is limited to money ordered by a court in a suit for damages.id.at,d.
after powerine i was decided,central national moved for summary adjudication of the duty to indemnify under the central national policies,resulting in the judgment giving rise to the instant writ proceeding.in its motion,central national sought an order that,pursuant to powerine i and,it has no duty to indemnify powerine under its policies for any sums expended by powerine in connection with the regional water boards proceedings because no money had been ordered by a court in a suit for damages against the insured within the meaning of those policies.powerine in turn argued that this court holding in powerine i was not controlling because the earlier writ proceeding involved only primary cgl policies which,powerine argued,are different in nature,purpose,and wording than the policies issued by central national.
the trial court granted central national motion for summary adjudication.pursuant to powerine i,the trial court ruled that central national has no duty to indemnify powerine under its various policies for sums powerine expends pursuant to the cleanup and abatement orders issued by the regional water boards.the trial court focused on the policies inclusion of the term damages in the insuring provisions,concluding,as this court did in powerine i,that the term does not encompass environmental response costs ordered by an administrative agency outside the context of a lawsuit.the trial court rejected powerine argument based on the difference in purpose between its policies and the primary cgl policies at issue in powerine i,reasoning it could not apply a meaning to damages that changes from policy to policy.
the insuring language of central national standard form policies is identical throughout all nine policies.it provides,in relevant part the company hereby agrees to indemnify the insured for all sums which the insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the insured by law for damages,direct or consequential and expenses,all as more fully defined by the term ultimate net loss on account of property damage caused by or arising out of each occurrence happening anywhere in the world.italics added.ultimate net loss is defined as the total sum which the insured,or any company as his insurer,or both,become obligated to pay by reason of property damage either through adjudication or compromise,and shall also include hospital,medical and funeral charges and all sums paid as salaries,wages,compensation,fees,charges and law costs,premiums on attachment or appeal bonds,interest,expenses for doctors,lawyers,nurses and investigators and other persons,and for litigation,settlement,adjustment and investigation of claims and suits which are paid as a consequence of any occurrence covered hereunder 
seven of the nine central national policies also contain defense coverage endorsements identical in substance to the duty to defend clauses of the primary cgl policies at issue in and powerine they obligate central national to defend any suit against the insured alleging liability insured under the provisions of this policy and seeking damages on account thereof,a s respects occurrences covered under this policy,but not covered under the underlying insurance or under any other collectible insurance italics added.each of the nine policies further contains an absolute pollution exclusion.additional policy provisions deemed relevant to the issues raised herein are set forth and discussed below 
powerine appealed from the trial court order granting central national summary adjudication motion on the duty to indemnify under the policies.in a published decision,the court of appeal issued a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order and to issue a new order denying the motion.the court held that the duty to indemnify in these policies is broader in scope than that of the policies in powerine i and,and includes the costs powerine expends in responding to administrative agencies cleanup and abatement orders.the court found that the term expenses,as used in the insuring and ultimate net loss provisions,must be broadly construed to include costs arising from compromise as well as adjudication and third party claims as well as suits.the court concluded that the fact that the duty to defend in seven of the nine policies is limited to suits seeking damages under does not foreclose indemnity coverage under the syllogism because the wording of these policies is different than the standard cgl policy examined in powerine i and.finally,the court of appeal opined that the central national policies are different in scope and purpose from the standard primary cgl policy in that they expressly provide umbrella coverage which can operate to fill any gaps in higher level primary coverage.
we granted central national petition for review.amicus curiae briefs in support of central national have been filed by the london market insurers and the complex insurance claims litigation association.amicus curiae briefs in support of powerine have been filed by itt industries,and united giller.
discussion 
issue preclusion and law of the case 
at the threshold we address central national procedural argument that the judgment of the court of appeal in the prior writ proceeding culminating in powerine i,which granted the london market insurers summary judgment on certain policies issued by those insurers to powerine,establishes law of the case and,under principles of issue preclusion,bars powerine from here revisiting the matter of coverage for nonlawsuit expenditures under central national policies.see,interinsurance exchange of the auto.club superior court d.a former judgment is a collateral estoppel on issues which were raised,even though some factual matters or legal arguments which could have been presented were not.witkin cal.procedure ed.judgment,original italics.kowis howard cal th,d,law of the case doctrine applicable to writ proceedings mccutchen city of montclair th,d doctrine of issue preclusion applicable where issue in present proceeding is identical to one actually litigated and necessarily decided in prior proceeding.
this procedural argument was considered and rejected by the court of appeal on the following basis 
central national insists that our now superseded decision in powerine i precludes powerine from arguing that the scope of coverage here is not limited to money ordered by a court.observing that in our powerine i decision we mentioned one umbrella and four excess policies issued by the certain underwriters insurers in addition to the primary policy,central national asserts that that decision definitively resolved the identical issue,namely,that no coverage exists for administratively imposed costs under the insurer excess and umbrella policies covering damages that the insured is legally obligated to pay.central national argues any references we made to the umbrella policy in that opinion is law of the case and is binding on powerine inasmuch as powerine did not appeal from that issue and the issue was not addressed by the supreme court in powerine not so.
first,we stated clearly in our superseded opinion that we are only concerned with the primary policy issued to powerine by certain underwriters and we have no reason to reach or consider the several excess policies which certain underwriters also issued over a period such statements render any comments made about the secondary policies pure obiter dictum.second,we quoted from the language of the excess and umbrella policies in that opinion the language is materially different from the language at issue here because,inter alia,the policies language does not more fully define the term damages by reference to another clause in the policy.for these reasons,our opinion in powerine i is neither law of the case nor binding on powerine for anything involving the excess or umbrella policies there.
we do not necessarily agree with the court of appeal that statements made in its now superseded opinion in the prior writ proceeding powerine i respecting the london market insurers policies were pure obiter dictum.the court of appeal judgment in that proceeding did,after all,grant summary adjudication in favor of those insurers on their policies in addition to finding no coverage under their primary cgl policy.but the fact remains that the central national policies here at issue were not directly at issue in powerine i,nor,indeed,was central national itself even a party to that earlier writ proceeding.and,as the court of appeal has indicated,the wording of the insuring provisions of the london market insurers policies is different than that of the central national policies here concerned.finally,given that the parties appeal in powerine i presented only the issue of coverage for administratively ordered environmental cleanup costs under the standard primary cgl policy issued by the london market insurers powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,this court had no occasion to directly address coverage issues concerning those insurers policies.
as will be explained below,while insurance policies are a special category of contracts,they fundamentally remain contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation must be applied.whatever the court of appeal may have concluded about coverage under the london market insurers policies in the earlier writ proceeding,the fact remains that central national policies are distinct contractual policies of insurance,and the express wording and provisions of central national policies were not before the lower courts in powerine 
as the court of appeal below observed,the now superseded opinion of the court of appeal in powerine i contained statements to the effect that we are only concerned with the primary policy issued to powerine by certain underwriters,and we have no reason to reach or consider the several excess policies which certain underwriters also issued over a period we further observe that in ultimately entering judgment on those excess insurance policies in favor of the insurers in the prior proceeding,the court of appeal appears to have focused on the circumstance that coverage under the london market insurers excess policies could not be triggered because the underlying primary cgl policy was found not to provide coverage,and exhaustion of the limits of the underlying primary policy was a prerequisite to coverage under the excess policies.thus,not only were central national policies not directly at issue or considered in the prior writ proceeding,the umbrella or drop down coverage included in central national policies does not lend itself to the exhaustion of limits analysis by which the court of appeal in that proceeding determined there could be no indemnity coverage under the london market insurers policies.
accordingly,we conclude that central national procedural powerine should be estopped from claiming coverage under the central national policies here at issue as a result of the court of appeal judgment in the first writ be rejected.
standard of review and rules of insurance policy interpretation 
we next set forth the applicable standard of review and rules of insurance policy interpretation that govern resolution of the issue before us.
this second writ petition was presented to the trial court upon stipulated facts.the issue before both the trial court and the court of appeal was one of pure law the interpretation of the indemnification obligation under the insuring clauses of central national nine policies issued to powerine.when determining whether a particular policy provides a potential for coverage,we are guided by the principle that interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.aiu ins.superior court cal d.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.
the insurer is entitled to summary adjudication that no potential for indemnity exists if the evidence establishes as a matter of law that there is no coverage.citation.we apply a de novo standard of review to an order granting summary judgment when,on undisputed facts,the order is based on the interpretation or application of the terms of an insurance policy.smith kandal real estate continental casualty th,d see powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.
in reviewing de novo a superior court summary adjudication order in a dispute over the interpretation of the provisions of a policy of insurance,the reviewing court applies settled rules governing the interpretation of insurance contracts.we reiterated those rules in our decision in 
while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.bank of the west superior court cal th,d,see aiu ins.superior court cal d at.the fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.aiu,supra,cal d at.if contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d,supra,cal th at,d.
a policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,bay cities paving grading,lawyers mutual ins.cal th,d.the fact that a term is not defined in the policies does not make it ambiguous.bay cities paving grading,lawyers mutual ins,supra,cal th at,d,bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d,castro fireman fund american life ins.d.nor does d isagreement concerning the meaning of a phrase,or the fact that a word or phrase isolated from its context is susceptible of more than one meaning.castro fireman fund american life ins,supra,d at.l anguage in a contract must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole,and in the circumstances of that case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted.if an asserted ambiguity is not eliminated by the language and context of the policy,courts then invoke the principle that ambiguities are generally construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist,the insurer in order to protect the insured reasonable expectation of coverage.la jolla beach tennis club,industrial indemnity cal th,d,supra,cal th at,d.
in powerine i,we explained further that standard form policy provisions are interpreted under the same rules of construction.w hen they are examined solely on a form,apart from any actual agreement between a given insurer and a given insured,the rules stated above apply mutatis mutandis.that is to say,where it is clear,the language must be read accordingly,and where it is not,in the sense that satisfies the hypothetical insured objectively reasonable expectations.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,quoting buss superior court cal th,d.
the holdings in,powerine i,and aiu 
powerine principal contention is that our holding in powerine i does not control the interpretation of central national policies because the literal insuring language of these policies is both different and broader in scope and purpose than the insuring language of the standard primary cgl policy considered in powerine 
before turning to the specific insuring language of central national nine policies,a brief review of this court holdings in,powerine i,and aiu ins.superior court,supra,cal d,aiu,is necessary to properly inform our inquiry.
our analysis in powerine i relied in part on our earlier holding in,the salient points of which we summarized as follows 
in,we held that the insurer duty to defend the insured in a suit seeking damages under the standard comprehensive general liability insurance policy was limited to a civil action prosecuted in a court,national union fire ins,supra,cal th at,d.
there,we took what we referred to as a literal approach to the provision imposing on the insurer the duty to defend the insured in a suit seeking damages,national union fire ins,supra,cal th at,d.in doing so,we considered the provision in its full context we proceeded to find,in effect,that it was clear in its limitation to a civil action prosecuted in a court,and that,in such limitation,it did not run counter to the hypothetical insured objectively reasonable expectations.id.at,d.we declined to take either a functional or a hybrid approach id.at,d,each of which treats the provision as ambiguous id.at,d,the former deeming suit to reach anything that is equivalent to a suit,apparently without qualification id.at,fn,d,the latter deeming suit to reach anything that is equivalent to a suit,but only if it is sufficiently coercive and threatening id.at,fn,d.we declined to take either approach because the duty to defend involved a suit,and not something equivalent to a suit or even something equivalent to a suit that was sufficiently coercive and threatening.id.at,d.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
in light of the foregoing,we went on to conclude that the insurer duty to defend the insured did not extend to a proceeding conducted before an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute,national union fire ins,supra,cal th at,d.our reason was that a proceeding conducted before an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute does not constitute a suit,a civil action prosecuted in a court,but rather implicates a claim.ibid.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.
in arriving at our conclusion,we declined to rewrite the provision imposing the duty to defend in order to remove its limitation to a civil action prosecuted in a court,national union fire ins,supra,cal th at,d.we would not do so for the insured itself,in order to shift to the insurer some or all of the potentially substantial costs that might be imposed on the insured in the course of a proceeding conducted before an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute.id.at,d.neither would we do so for considerations of public policy,in order,perhaps,to bring such a proceeding to a timely and appropriate outcome through such a shifting of costs.id.at,d.our reason was that we do not rewrite any provision of any contract,including the standard policy underlying any individual policy,for any purpose.ibid.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.
powerine i 
while interpreted the scope of the duty to defend under the standard cgl policy,powerine i addressed the scope of the duty to indemnify under that same standard policy,in the form utilized by the london market insurers below.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.as noted,we held in powerine i that the insurer duty to indemnify the insured for all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages under the standard cgl insurance policy is limited to money ordered by a court.id.at,d,italics added.
in the analysis that followed,we explained that the duty to indemnify and its limitation to money ordered by a court is sufficiently supported when we look to what we may call syllogism alone.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.the syllogism can be summarized this way the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.the duty to defend is not broad enough to extend beyond a suit,a civil action prosecuted in a court,but rather is limited thereto.a fortiori,the duty to indemnify is not broad enough to extend beyond damages,money ordered by a court,but rather is limited thereto.id.at,d.put another way,the insurer obligation to indemnify for damages is limited to money ordered by a court because the provisions in the standard cgl policy imposing both a duty to defend and a duty to indemnify on the insurer each link damages to a suit,a civil action prosecuted in a court.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.
in reaching our holding in powerine i,we distinguished between the term damages used in the insuring agreement of the standard cgl policy,and the term expenses,which does not appear in the insuring provisions of that standard policy.the duty to indemnify for damages,we explained,does not extend to any expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental,here,proceedings conducted before the regional water boards pursuant to the act.our reason is that expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute,whether for the cleanup of a contaminated site and the abatement of the contamination effects or otherwise,do not constitute money ordered by a court.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
as the court of appeal below correctly observed,read together,and powerine i stand for the proposition that the duty to defend a suit seeking damages under the standard cgl policies is restricted to civil actions prosecuted in a court,initiated by the filing of a complaint,and does not include claims,which can denote proceedings conducted by administrative agencies under environmental statutes.likewise,the duty to indemnify for all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,italics added in the same standard primary policies is limited to money ordered by a court,and does not include expenses such as may be incurred in responding to administrative agency orders.
in aiu,supra,cal d,a unanimous opinion authored by then chief justice lucas,we were called upon to determine whether various primary and excess cgl policies issued to real party in interest fmc corporation fmc obligated the insurers to provide coverage to fmc for contamination cleanup and other environmental response costs incurred pursuant to cercla et and related state and federal environmental laws.fmc sought review of a peremptory writ of mandate issued by the court of appeal that had directed the superior court to enter summary adjudication on this issue in favor of the insurers.we reversed.aiu,supra,cal d at.
the insurance policies at issue in aiu provided coverage to fmc for all sums fmc became legally obligated to pay as damages under two standard policy forms or ultimate net loss under a third as a result of property damage within the meaning of the policies.aiu,supra,cal d at.several of the policies in the latter category contained insuring language substantially identical to the insuring provisions in central national policies.id.at fn.
we explained in aiu that under established principles of contract interpretation,we construe policy language according to the mutual intentions of the parties and its plain and ordinary meaning,resolving ambiguities in favor of coverage aiu,supra,cal d at.we concluded that all of the policies at issue afforded coverage for the costs of reimbursing government agencies and complying with injunctions ordering contamination cleanup under cercla and similar environmental statutes.ibid.
aiu established early on that liability arising from government suits for injunctive relief and costs incurred in cleaning up polluted sites pursuant to an environmental statute fall within the definition of property damage found in standard form primary and excess cgl policies.aiu,supra,cal d at.we explained that the mere fact that the governments may seek reimbursement of response costs or injunctive relief without themselves having suffered any intangible harm to a proprietary interest does not exclude the recovery of cleanup costs from coverage under the damages provision of cgl policies,italics added.
unlike this case,the government in aiu brought suit against the insured for remedial relief in powerine i we explained that we did not hold in aiu that the duty to indemnify extends to any money in addition to that ordered by a any expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute.indeed,we did not even consider the issue.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.we had no occasion to consider the issue in aiu precisely because the government had brought suit hence the facts of that case did not present it.here,it is undisputed that the two cleanup and abatement orders were issued to powerine through administrative proceedings and were not the result of injunctive relief.the issue is squarely presented.
the insuring agreement in central national policies provides indemnity coverage for the liability of administratively ordered environmental response costs 
the insuring language in central national standard form policies is identical throughout all nine policies.it provides,in relevant part the company hereby agrees to indemnify the insured for all sums which the insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the insured by law for damages,direct or consequential and expenses,all as more fully defined by the term ultimate net loss on account of property damage caused by or arising out of each occurrence happening anywhere in the world.italics added.
ultimate net loss in turn is defined as the total sum which the insured,or any company as his insurer,or both,become obligated to pay by reason of property damage either through adjudication or compromise,and shall also include hospital,medical and funeral charges and all sums paid as salaries,wages,compensation,fees,charges and law costs,premiums on attachment or appeal bonds,interest,expenses for doctors,lawyers,nurses and investigators and other persons,and for litigation,settlement,adjustment and investigation of claims and suits which,are paid as a consequence of any occurrence covered hereunder italics added.
the mutual intention of the parties is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.where contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d,aiu,supra,cal d at.like the court of appeal,we conclude that coverage under central national policies is unambiguous and clearly extends beyond money ordered by a court.
the phrase obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the insured by law in the insuring agreement of central national policies is the functional equivalent of the phrase sum that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay in the standard cgl policy considered in powerine see aiu ins.superior court,supra,cal d at,legally obligated and obligated by law treated as similar.both connote a legal obligation in the abstract.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.in the standard primary cgl policy,it is the addition of the single word damages that limits the indemnification obligation to money ordered by a court.ibid.
the insuring clause of the central national policies,in contrast,provides indemnification coverage for damages,direct or consequential and expenses the use of both terms raises the inference that they were not intended to be synonymous.reserve insurance pisciotta cal d.in powerine i we ourselves used the term expenses when explaining that expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute,whether for the cleanup of a contaminated site and the abatement of the contamination effects or otherwise,do not constitute money ordered by a court.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.surely then,an insured would harbor an objectively reasonable expectation that these policies also afforded coverage for such expenses,something above and beyond damages.we agree with the court of appeal that the addition of the term expenses in the central insuring clause of these policies extends coverage beyond the limitation imposed were the term damages used alone,and thereby enlarges the scope of coverage beyond money ordered by a court.
in addition to the inclusion of the term expenses,which itself broadens the scope of coverage beyond that afforded under the standard primary cgl policy,the central insuring clause of these policies further define s the indemnification obligation by reference to and incorporation of a definition of ultimate net loss.ultimate net loss in turn is defined as the total sum which the insured becomes obligated to pay by reason of property damage either through adjudication or compromise,and shall also include all sums paid for litigation,settlement,adjustment and investigation of claims and suits as a consequence of any occurrence covered hereunder italics added.
sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay through adjudication denote money damages.but sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay through compromise or the settlement,adjustment and investigation of claims do not necessarily reflect an underlying court suit.as the court of appeal observed,a compromise may be reached in order to avert a lawsuit altogether.moreover,as we explained in,a claim is not a suit.a claim can be any number of things,none of which rise to the formal level of a suit while a claim may ultimately ripen into a suit,claim and suit are not synonymous.citations,supra,cal th at,d,quoting fireman fund ins.superior court th,d,italics added.
finally,as explained,this court has already held in aiu,supra,cal d,that a court order for payment of expenses to remediate or abate pollution pursuant to an environmental statute constitutes liability for property damage within the meaning of the standard primary cgl policy.id.at.it follows that where the express insuring language of an policy broadens indemnity coverage for sums paid in furtherance of a compromise or settlement of a claim initiated by an administrative agency for such remedial relief,the insured liability for such expenses falls within the policy indemnification obligation even though no government suit was filed.
we therefore conclude that under a literal reading of central national policies,the indemnification obligation is expressly extended beyond money damages to include expenses incurred in responding to government agency orders administratively imposed outside the context of a government lawsuit to clean up and abate environmental pollution.
we reach the same conclusion when considering the insuring provisions of these policies in the context of the policies as a whole.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d.central national argued in the court of appeal that these policies were intended to operate primarily as excess insurance policies,following the form of the underlying policies adjudicated in and powerine i.if that were the case,then the circumstance that the underlying primary cgl policies afforded no indemnity coverage by virtue of our holding in powerine i would end the inquiry,as the limits of those underlying policies were not exhausted for purposes of triggering excess coverage.
but the policies here in question are not merely intended to operate as excess insurance.under the limitation of liability provision,central national has agreed to pay the excess of the amount of ultimate net loss in respect of each occurrence not covered by said underlying insurances.italics added.hence,these policies also provide umbrella coverage,alternative primary coverage as to losses not covered by the primary policy.reserve insurance pisciotta,supra,cal d at,see century indemnity london underwriters th,fn,d.the umbrella coverage here may serve to fill any gaps in coverage left open by the underlying coverage croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra.
we agree with the court of appeal that the fact these central national policies also provide umbrella indemnity tells us that the insured would have expected the policies to grant broader coverage than that provided by the primary insurance.citation.our reading of the central national insuring clause to be more expansive than the primary insurance in powerine i gives effect to the mutual intent of the parties as evinced by the mechanism of umbrella insurance.citations.
central national remaining arguments 
central national raises a number of additional arguments in opposition to the conclusions reached by the court of appeal,none of which we find has merit.
redundancy of the term damages 
first,central national argues that to interpret the insuring provisions as affording coverage for the expenses of a compromise or settlement of a government claim for environmental cleanup and response costs would render the damages limitation in these policies redundant.we disagree.
the term damages in these policies serves the same purpose that it does in the standard primary cgl extends the indemnity obligation to money ordered by a court in a suit against the insured.were the term not included in the policy language,the insurer could be heard to argue that coverage is not provided for money judgments.as our decision in powerine i implies,one reason the term damages limits coverage to money ordered by a court under the standard cgl policy is that there is no other term contained in the insuring clause of that policy that could serve to expand coverage.here,in contrast,the central insuring provision extends coverage for damages,direct or consequential and expenses italics added,and further define s the scope of the indemnity agreement through the definition of ultimate net loss,which in turn defines coverage for liability for property damage as including sums expended either through adjudication or compromise,and shall also include all sums paid for litigation,settlement,adjustment and investigation of claims and suits italics added.there is no merit to central national assertion that to give effect to the literal terms of these policies would render the term damages in the insuring agreement a redundancy.
b.the insurer right to approve settlements 
next,central national argues that to construe the literal language of these policies as expanding coverage for the expenses of a compromise or settlement of a government claim for environmental response costs would mean that the insured could settle such claims without central national participation and obtain coverage under the policies for settlements to which central national objected.central national asserts that it right to participate in and approve any settlement would be compromised under such an interpretation of the scope of coverage.it points to the assistance and cooperation clause as the source of that right.again,we disagree.
as the court of appeal observed,central national has failed to identify any language in these particular policies requiring that it approve settlements or
