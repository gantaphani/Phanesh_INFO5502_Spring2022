environmental law 
the panel affirmed in part,reversed in part,and vacated in part the district court judgment,and remanded for further proceedings in an action brought by plaintiffs challenging the bureau of land management approval of the hope project,a proposed molybdenum mining operation near eureka,nevada.
addressing plaintiffs challenge to several aspects of the blm analysis of the project under the national environmental policy act,the panel held that the blm selection of baseline levels of certain air pollutants was unreasonable,that the blm analysis of cumulative air impacts was deficient,that the blm took the required hard look at the potential impacts of poor water quality on ground water,and that the blm discussion of mitigation and reclamation in the final environmental impact statement was reasonably complete.
the panel declined to address plaintiffs claim that the blm violated its duty to protect lands withdrawn from settlement,location,sale or entry under executive order public water reserve.first,the panel held that the blm should be given an opportunity to fix the errors in its analysis of the project under nepa before challenges to the approval of the project itself are entertained.second,the panel held that the proper analysis of the claim turned in large part on whether four springs in the area of the project were covered by the executive order,but the blm position on that question was unclear.the panel remanded for clarification.
graber,circuit judge 
plaintiffs great basin resource watch and the western shoshone defense project challenge defendant bureau of land management blm approval of the hope project project,a proposed molybdenum mining operation near eureka,nevada.plaintiffs argue that the blm review of the project under the national environmental policy act of nepa was inadequate and that the approval of the project violated the federal land policy and management act of flpma and the laws governing lands withdrawn under the executive order known as public water reserve pwr.because we conclude that the blm environmental review of the project violated nepa in several ways,we affirm in part the district court judgment,reverse in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
a.the hope project 
the hope project will be located in eureka county,nevada approximately miles northwest of the town of eureka and will consist of a proposed molybdenum mine including a power transmission line,a water well field,and all associated facilities to be located on public land administered by the blm and on private land controlled by eureka moly,llc,the project operator.the project will utilize an open pit mining method and will process the mined ore using a flotation and roasting process.a total of acres of disturbance is proposed within the project area.bureau of land,dep t of interior,mount hope project record of decision,plan of operations approval,and approval of issuance of grants,i.of those acres,are public lands administered by the blm.id.at.the project will have an to construction phase,years of mining and ore processing,years of reclamation,and five years of monitoring.additionally,obligations will follow final reclamation.id.at.
the active mining phase of the project will last years,during which time the mine will produce approximately billion tons of waste rock.during that phase,pumps will be used to extract water from the open mining pit at the end of the active mining phase,the pit will be allowed to fill slowly with ground water,forming a lake that is expected to reach a depth of feet.pumping of ground water will also take place in the kobeh valley,which is adjacent to hope,to provide fresh water for various mining and ore extraction purposes.
environmental review of the project 
eureka moly filed its first plan of operations for the project with the blm in june.the blm determined that approval of the project was a major federal action under nepa,and thus required the preparation of an environmental impact statement eis.the blm released a draft eis deis in december.after receiving nearly comments on the deis,the blm prepared a final eis feis,which was released in october.
throughout the nepa review process,plaintiffs raised concerns about several aspects of the project.many of those concerns related to the adequacy of the blm analysis of environmental impacts in the deis and feis.in comments on the deis,plaintiffs criticized the blm analysis of the project cumulative impacts,impacts to water quantity and quality,and impacts to cultural,religious,and historical resources.plaintiffs renewed those criticisms in their comments on the feis,and they offered fresh criticisms concerning,among other things,the feis discussion of funding for mitigation and reclamation.
in addition to criticizing the blm analysis of environmental impacts under nepa,plaintiffs expressed their view to the blm that approval of the project would violate the agency duties under the flpma and pwr.in comments on both the deis and feis,plaintiffs opined that approval of the project would violate flpma requirement that the blm prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the lands that it administers,b.plaintiffs also pointed out that the project would affect some springs and water holes located on lands that they claimed had been withdrawn by pwr.
plaintiffs were not alone in criticizing the blm analysis of the project environmental effects.the environmental protection agency epa reviewed the feis and found that the blm analyses of air impacts,water quantity impacts,and the funding aspects of mitigation were lacking.eureka county also criticized several aspects of the blm nepa review,including the agency analysis of air impacts.
approval of the project 
in november,a little more than a month after releasing the feis,the blm issued a record of decision approving the project.plaintiffs petitioned for review of that decision with the blm state director for nevada,who rejected the petition in january.plaintiffs then brought this action in the district court under the administrative procedure act,alleging that the blm review of the project under nepa was deficient and that its approval of the project violated flpma and pwr.soon after plaintiffs filed suit,the district court granted eureka moly leave to intervene on the side of the blm.
the district court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted the parties joint motion for entry of judgment in favor of the blm.plaintiffs timely appeal from that judgment.

plaintiffs challenge several aspects of the nepa analysis.they assert that the blm selection of baseline levels of certain air pollutants was unreasonable and that the blm analysis of cumulative impacts was deficient.as we will explain below,we agree.plaintiffs also challenge the adequacy of the blm consideration of various mitigation measures.with respect to those arguments,we either are not persuaded or need not reach the issues.
air pollution baselines 
plaintiffs first argue that the blm did not assess adequately the baseline levels of certain air pollutants when conducting the air impacts analysis.establishing appropriate baseline conditions is critical to any nepa analysis.without establishing the baseline conditions which exist before a project begins,there is simply no way to determine what effect the project will have on the environment and,consequently,no way to comply with nepa.half moon bay fishermans mktg.ass carlucci,cir.an agency need not conduct measurements of actual baseline conditions in every situation it may estimate baseline conditions using data from a similar area,computer modeling,or some other reasonable method.see or.nat.desert ass jewell,cir.holding that it would not necessarily be impermissible for the blm to estimate baseline conditions in one area by extrapolating from another area.but whatever method the agency uses,its assessment of baseline conditions must be based on accurate information and defensible reasoning.id.
when determining baseline air pollution levels for the project,the blm did not use actual measurements from the project site because none were available.in the deis,the blm used baseline values taken from measurements in clark county,nevada the county in which las vegas is located for some pollutants,and used the default values for unmonitored rural areas suggested by the nevada department of environmental protection ndep bureau of air pollution control for some other pollutants.the deis noted that the baseline numbers drawn from the clark county measurements were conservatively high given the relatively urban character of the monitoring locations.
in preparing the feis,the blm instructed eureka moly to follow ndep guidance in selecting the background concentrations for the air quality analysis.a permitting supervisor from the ndep bureau of air pollution control had previously advised by means of a short email that the agency assumed a baseline of zero for all pollutants other than particulate matter,and the feis adopts most of those baseline values in place of the conservatively high baseline values used in the deis.specifically,the feis uses baseline values of zero for carbon monoxide,nitrogen dioxide,one and sulfur dioxide,and lead,while the deis had used measured values from clark county for those pollutants.the feis continues to use the same clark county data for the two longest sulfur dioxide baselines,and it uses measurements taken at great basin national park for particulate matter baselines.
plaintiffs first argue that it was unreasonable for the blm to use data from great basin national park,a pristine area more than miles away from the project,to establish baselines for particulate matter.although it is true that this choice may have caused the agency to underestimate the baselines for particulate matter,the blm explained its choice adequately,and its explanation is reasonable.the project is located in a rural area,and the blm used data from a different rural area to estimate baseline conditions.plaintiffs have not shown that this choice rested on inaccurate information or indefensible reasoning.or.nat.desert ass n,at.
plaintiffs arguments concerning the baseline choices for particulate matter and the two longest sulfur dioxide concentrations are similarly unconvincing.like the baselines for particulate matter,the baselines for particulate matter relied on measurements taken at great basin national park.the baselines for the two sulfur dioxide concentrations were conservatively high,as the blm noted in the deis.by acknowledging the shortcomings in its data while using those data to make an estimate of baseline conditions,the blm complied with nepa.see lands council powell,cir.noting that nepa requires disclosures of relevant shortcomings in the data or models.
finally,plaintiffs argue that the blm use of a zero baseline value for the remaining pollutants was unreasonable.the blm and eureka moly respond that the choice of a zero baseline for those pollutants was reasonable because it was based on recommendations from the ndep bureau of air pollution control,the agency with expertise.the feis similarly invokes the expertise of the ndep bureau of air pollution control bapc,prefacing the table of baseline values with the note that t he bapc was contacted to obtain representative background concentrations for the modeling analysis.and the air impacts analysis prepared for eureka moly and submitted to the blm the study that underlies the feis air impacts analysis also notes that the recommends assuming zero background for the remaining pollutants.
it turns out,though,that the only expert recommendation in the record is a short email from an ndep official the email is,in fact,cited in the feis as the sole source of the zero baseline value.that email reads,in relevant part,as follows 
in an area,bapc uses ìg m for a average background and ìg m for an annual average background for.all other pollutants are assumed to be.if there is quality assured monitoring representative of an area,we can rely on that data to set a different background.i not aware of any monitoring being performed by bapc in the area you propose.
emphasis added.crucially,this email does not explain how or why the ndep arrived at zero.such a bare assertion of opinion coming from an expert within the blm,without any supporting reasoning,would not pass muster in an eis.see idaho sporting cong.thomas,cir.nepa requires that the public receive the underlying environmental data from which a reviewing agency expert derived her opinion,overruled on other grounds by lands council mcnair,cir.en banc see also cares dep t of energy,cir.at a minimum,an agency must support its conclusions with studies that the agency deems reliable.the fact that it comes from an expert at a state agency is of no significance to the analysis.nat.res.def.council,herrington,cir.i n a rulemaking which must be supported by substantial evidence,an agency may not rely without further explanation on an unelaborated order from another agency.neither we as a reviewing court nor participants in the rulemaking can possibly discover the substantive basis of the second agency edict.
we might reach a different conclusion had the ndep official explained why an estimate of zero was appropriate,or had the blm independently scrutinized that estimate and decided that it was reasonable,and then explained why.but none of that happened the blm simply used baseline estimates of zero for some pollutants in reliance on one conclusory sentence in an email from an ndep official,an email that itself contained no supporting reasoning.this important information,which affects the air impacts analysis,was essentially immune from meaningful scrutiny by the public because the blm never provided any data or reasoning in support of it.a baseline estimate must be based on accurate information and defensible reasoning.or.nat.desert ass n,at.the blm provided neither when it came to its baseline estimates of zero.
eureka moly argues that the feis air impacts analysis is nonetheless adequate because it relies in part on the fact that the ndep bureau of air pollution control issued a clean air act permit for the project.this argument evinces a misunderstanding of the nature of nepa and its relationship to substantive environmental laws such as the clean air act.see fork band council of shoshone of dep t of interior,cir.per curiam holding that a failure to discuss mercury emissions from a nearby mining facility in an eis was not excused by the fact that the facility operate d pursuant to a state permit under the clean air act,because a document can not satisfy a federal agency obligations under nepa.the failure to explain the zero baseline assumption frustrated the blm ability to take a hard look at air impacts,and the reference to the project clean air act permit did nothing to fix that error.
the blm argues that it corrected any error in its baseline estimates by conducting a double check analysis following the issuance of the feis.the blm conducted this analysis using measured baseline values from an undeveloped area in new mexico that epa had suggested might have similar air quality to the project area.the blm claims that those measurements confirm that the pollution from the project would not violate air quality standards.although that statement may end up being true,a analysis conducted without any input from the public can not cure deficiencies in an eis.ctr.for biological diversity forest,cir.the public never had an opportunity to comment on the double check analysis,frustrating nepa goal of allowing the public the opportunity to play a role in the decisionmaking process.robertson methow valley citizens council.
in conclusion,we hold that the blm analysis of air impacts in the feis was inadequate because the agency did not provide any support for its use of baseline values of zero for several air pollutants.
cumulative impacts 
plaintiffs next argue that the blm analysis of cumulative impacts was deficient.plaintiffs point out that,although the feis mentions that there will be cumulative impacts stemming from the project and nearby mining,agricultural,and other activities,there is no detailed discussion about the impacts,nor is there a quantified assessment of those impacts.
the cumulative impact from an action means the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.accordingly,i n a cumulative impact analysis,an agency must take a hard look at all actions that may combine with the action under consideration to affect the environment.tribe of shoshone of dep t of interior,cir.emphasis added.furthermore,simply listing all relevant actions is not sufficient.rather,some quantified or detailed information is required.without such information,neither the courts nor the public can be assured that the agency provided the hard look that it is required to provide.neighbors of cuddy mountain forest,cir.
the blm completed the first step of the cumulative impacts analysis by identifying the relevant past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions,that might affect the environment in the area of the project.and the blm provided a useful analysis of the cumulative impacts of those actions on some environmental resources.wildlands,at internal quotation marks citation omitted.for instance,the feis includes a relatively thorough discussion of cumulative impacts to water quantity,complete with a quantitative analysis.
however,the discussion of cumulative impacts to other resources in the feis falls short.in particular,the discussion of cumulative air impacts is insufficient.that discussion reads,in relevant part,as follows 
each of the identified individual projects within the study area,including existing and proposed mining operations,emit air pollutants.with the possible exception of motor vehicle emissions,the existing and proposed mining operations are the major sources of criteria pollutants within the study area.the modeling for the proposed action,as well as the ruby hill mine,shows that the levels of these pollutants are below the applicable standards.the proposed action would not result in a significant cumulative impact to air resources.the reasonably foreseeable future actions would result in additional emissions similar to those currently emitted by the existing operations within the study area.in addition,the major sources of pollutants except for motor vehicle emissions within the study area would operate under permit conditions established by the ndep bapc and therefore would not be significant.
that analysis suffers from many of the same shortcomings as the blm analysis in great basin mine watch hankins,cir.there,we faulted the blm for failing to include or cumulative data in its analysis of cumulative impacts to air resources.id.at.the blm had merely stat ed that ambient air quality data for the region currently reflects impacts of existing mining operations in the airshed,but did not identify and discuss the impacts that will be caused by each successive project,including how the combination of those various impacts is expected to affect the environment.id.at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.for that reason,we held that the feis was insufficient.id.at.similarly,the blm in this case did not provide sufficiently detailed information in its cumulative air impacts analysis.the blm made no attempt to quantify the cumulative air impacts of the project together with the ruby hill mine and vehicle emissions.nor did the blm attempt to quantify or discuss in any detail the effects of other activities,such as oil and gas development,that are identified elsewhere in the feis as potentially affecting air resources.
the cumulative air impacts analysis also suffers from the same problem that plagued the air impacts analysis namely,the choice of a baseline value of zero for certain pollutants.it was impossible for the blm to take a hard look at cumulative air impacts given its unjustified use of a zero baseline for those pollutants 
the blm and eureka moly argue that the air impacts analysis contained elsewhere in the feis suffices because that other analysis takes into account existing emissions.but,as already discussed,the modeling assumed baseline values of zero for many pollutants and,therefore,the analysis plainly does not take into account emissions from other sources in the area.the blm and eureka moly also argue that the reference in the feis to the cumulative air impacts analysis conducted in connection with the ruby hill mine an unrelated mining project renders the cumulative air impacts analysis in this feis adequate.but the analysis of the ruby hill mine did not consider the hope project,so its cumulative impacts analysis is of very limited relevance.
the cumulative air impacts portion of the feis fails to enumerate the environmental effects of other projects or consider the interaction of multiple activities.or.nat.res.council fund brong,cir.accordingly,we hold that the cumulative impacts portion of the feis does not comply with nepa.
mitigation lake 
plaintiffs next argument concerns the feis discussion of the lake that will eventually form in the mining pit.plaintiffs argue that the blm violated nepa by failing to consider mitigation measures aimed at reducing the possible adverse environmental effects of poor water quality.under nepa,an agency must consider appropriate mitigation measures that would reduce the environmental impact of the proposed action.protect our cmtys.found.jewell,cir.when reviewing an agency discussion of mitigation measures,w e need only be satisfied that the agency took the requisite hard look at the possible mitigating measures.okanogan highlands all.williams,cir.
the feis states that i nitial pit lake water quality is predicted to be good but that,a s evaporation from the lake surface concentrates the dissolved minerals,some water quality constituent concentrations would be predicted to increase over time relative to baseline concentrations and to exceed the present nevada water quality standards.the feis further predicts that t here would be a low potential for impacts to ground water quality due to the formation of a ground water sink in the open pit,but that the impact is not considered significant.the feis states that a ccess to the open pit by humans and livestock would be restricted and that t he lake is not intended to be a drinking water source for humans or livestock or to be used for recreational purposes.plaintiffs claim that the blm failed to consider any mitigation measures to address the potential effects of poor water quality.they argue that this omission is problematic for two reasons the feis states that there is a low potential for impacts to ground water quality,rather than no potential for impacts,and the water may at some point be needed by future water users in the area.
we hold that the blm complied with nepa in discussing possible mitigation measures to address the effects that would flow from poor water quality.although the blm did not include any discussion of possible mitigation measures in the portion of the feis discussing water quality,other portions of the feis contain discussions of such measures.the listing of applicant committed practices measures that eureka moly has promised to take and that are considered part of the operating procedures of the project states that the company will periodically review and update pit lake studies to incorporate new information accumulated during operations.these updates would provide quantitative predictions of water quality during the operational and period.additionally,the agency responded to a comment on the deis by noting that it would rely on future monitoring to further understand the ground water and surface water hydraulics and any potential impacts to waters of the state.based on further monitoring and evaluation,additional mitigation measures can be implemented at any time 
this sort of wait and see approach to mitigation does not always suffice under nepa.putting off an analysis of possible mitigation measures until after a project has been approved,and after adverse environmental impacts have started to occur,runs counter to nepa goal of ensuring informed agency decisionmaking.see robertson,at without a reasonably complete discussion of mitigation,neither the agency nor other interested groups and individuals can properly evaluate the severity of the adverse effects.but that approach was reasonable in the circumstances given the relatively low probability and temporal remoteness of adverse impacts to ground water.and though the blm did not consider any mitigation measures for the potential impact of poor water quality on future water users,it was not required to do so,because the existence of any such users is speculative.see san luis obispo mothers for peace nuclear regulatory comm n,cir.a n impact statement need not discuss remote and highly speculative consequences.internal quotation marks omitted.
to be sure,the blm mitigation analysis in this case was not as thorough as that of the agency in okanogan highlands.in that case,the forest service prepared an eis for a mining project that would produce a lake much like the one here.okanogan highlands,at.the agency concluded in the eis that seepage from the open pit is expected to have a low overall impact on ground water quality in the vicinity of the pit,but it nonetheless discussed several mitigation measures,including monitoring.id.at.we held that the agency had complied with nepa by considering extensively the potential effects and mitigation processes.id.at.
in this case,by contrast,the blm discussed only monitoring.but the disparity in the scope and depth of the agencies discussions in the two cases reflects important differences between the projects being analyzed,rather than a difference in the adequacy of the agencies analyses.the mining project in okanogan highlands was set to last eight to ten years,id.at,and the pit lake was expected to overflow and discharge water that would exceed pollution standards,id.at.here,by contrast,the pit lake will fill slowly,and will not begin to fill at all until after the end of open pit mining,some years after the start of the project.furthermore,the water quality in the pit lake is expected to be good at first.faced with an adverse impact that is predicted to be insignificant and that will not occur for decades,the blm in this case reasonably decided to rely on a monitoring scheme to develop future mitigation measures.
in short,we are satisfied that the blm complied with nepa by taking a hard look at the potential impacts of poor water quality on ground water.
mitigation reclamation bonding 
plaintiffs argue that the blm nepa review was deficient because the agency never reviewed the consideration or establishment of financial guarantees under nepa.plaintiffs argue that this failure rendered the discussion of mitigation in the feis inadequate and prevented the public from providing input into the reclamation bonding process.the blm and eureka moly respond that nepa does not require that third parties should be able to participate in the process of determining financial guarantees,and in any event,the feis contains an adequate discussion of financial guarantees.
the blm regulations require that an operator who files a plan of operations must,a t a time specified by blm,submit an estimate of the cost to fully reclaim its operations.d although the time specified by blm need not be the same as the time at which the plan of operations is filed,the estimate must be submitted and accepted before operations can begin,because a financial guarantee that meets the requirements of this subpart must be provided before starting operations.id.the regulations instruct operators to estimate the cost to reclaim your operations as if blm were hiring a contractor to perform reclamation of your operations after you have vacated the project area.id.a the financial guarantee provided by the operator must cover this estimated cost.id.a.in addition,the blm may require a trust fund or other funding mechanism to ensure the continuation of treatment to achieve water quality standards and for other long term,maintenance requirements.the funding must be adequate to provide for construction,operation,maintenance,or replacement of any treatment facilities and infrastructure,for as long as the treatment and facilities are needed after mine closure.blm may identify the need for a trust fund or other funding mechanism during plan review or later.id.c.
the blm and eureka moly assert that the details of a funding mechanism and the amount of a financial guarantee also called a reclamation bond need not be discussed in an eis because they are regulatory requirement s driven by the reclamation plan.for support,they cite the blm surface management manual,which states that a ny decision concerning the need,amount,acceptability,forfeiture of a financial guarantee do es not require an environmental review under nepa and is not to be included in nepa documents used to review a proposed operation.blm surface management manual at.they also cite our decision in center for biological diversity salazar,cir,for the proposition that setting an amount for a financial guarantee does not trigger nepa requirements.
salazar does not support the position taken by the blm and eureka moly.in salazar,we held that the blm approval of an update to an operator financial guarantee was not a major federal action for nepa purposes where the reclamation plan being funded by the guarantee had already been approved and was not itself being changed.id.at.we characterized the blm action as consisting of the ministerial tasks of feeding reclamation data from the reclamation plan into a software program,comparing the estimate from that program with that of the operator,and then accepting the operator proposed bond amount,which was greater than the estimate.id.at.we held that s uch functions are the type of monitoring and compliance activities that do not trigger nepa requirements.id.
for two reasons,this case differs from salazar.first,the reclamation plan here is in the process of being approved,and determining the contours of the financial guarantee particularly the funding mechanism at this stage is not a mere ministerial task.second,plaintiffs legal theory for why nepa requires a discussion of reclamation funding differs from that advanced by the plaintiffs in salazar.in salazar,the plaintiffs argued that the update to the reclamation bond was a major federal action requiring the preparation of an eis.id.at.by contrast,plaintiffs argument is that the approval of a plan of operations requires an eis the eis should discuss possible reclamation and mitigation measures and a reasonably complete discussion of those measures requires some discussion of the funding mechanism and reclamation bond.
we need not address any further the broad argument that reclamation bonding need never be discussed in nepa documents.we assume,without deciding,that mitigation and reclamation funding issues must be discussed in sufficient detail to ensure that environmental consequences have been fairly evaluated.robertson,at.making that assumption,we hold that the feis contains an adequate discussion of those issues.
the feis discusses several specific mitigation measures that the funding mechanism may fund.it also states that the funding mechanism would be reviewed annually during the operation phase of the project and potentially increased to meet the monitoring and mitigation needs associated with the project.elsewhere,the feis discusses some of the mitigation measures in more detail.for instance,the feis considers,in several places,the use of evapotranspiration cells to control discharge from mining waste.
the feis also contains a relatively thorough discussion of possible reclamation measures,complete with a proposed timeline.as for the reclamation bond,the feis states that,w ithin three years following plan approval and at least every three subsequent years,eureka moly would update the guarantee to reflect the actual disturbance and whatever additional disturbance is planned for the project phase anticipated over the next period.changes to equipment,consumables,and man power costs would also be incorporated during the updates.
the blm discussion of mitigation and reclamation in the feis is reasonably complete and does not violate nepa.although the blm could have discussed its options vis the funding mechanism and reclamation bond in more detail,its discussion of those aspects of the mitigation and reclamation plans is not so deficient as to preclude the agency or the public from properly evaluat ing the severity of the project adverse effects on the environment.robertson,at.and the reclamation and mitigation discussion,taken as a whole,contains an adequate evaluation of the effectiveness of possible reclamation and mitigation measures despite the relatively sparse treatment of the funding aspects of those measures.see fork band council,at an essential component of a reasonably complete mitigation discussion is an assessment of whether the proposed mitigation measures can be effective.
mitigation surface and ground water quantity 
plaintiffs next challenge the adequacy of the blm discussion of mitigation measures to address impacts to surface and ground water quantity.the project will require a great deal of water to support mining and milling operations.this water will come from two sources ground water pumped out of wells located in one of the valleys surrounding hope and water pumped from the open mining pit.the predicted effects of the pumping on certain stream and spring flows unlike the predicted effect of the pit lake on quality are potentially significant.
the feis discusses several mitigation measures aimed at addressing those impacts,including a monitoring scheme to keep track of the status of spring and stream segments,water hauling,and piping in water from other locations to replace lost surface water.in but accurate terms,many of the mitigation measures amount to measuring how much each spring or stream segment flow has been reduced and replacing that water.the replacement water which the blm estimates at about of water,or nearly million gallons,per year would at least initially come from eureka moly existing water rights if additional water rights have not yet been secured.
plaintiffs contend that the discussion of mitigation measures is inadequate because there is no analysis of where th e replacement water will come from,or the impacts from its withdrawal.plaintiffs note that epa criticized the blm for this omission during the nepa process and asked the blm to prepare a supplemental eis.eureka moly responds that the feis thoroughly analyzed the effect of using water from its production wells,so the effect of using some of it as substitute water was necessarily analyzed because it is the same water.
although eureka moly argument is factually incorrect the analysis of ground water pumping in the feis does not take into account the roughly gallons per minute needed to replace depleted spring and stream water that error appears to be quite small,raising questions about whether it might be harmless see idaho wool growers ass vilsack,cir.the analysis asks whether the agency error materially impeded nepa goals that is,whether the error caused the agency not to be fully aware of the environmental consequences of the proposed action,thereby precluding informed decisionmaking and public participation,or otherwise materially affected the substance of the agency decision.but no party has briefed the issue of harmlessness.and because the blm nepa analysis is deficient in other respects,the ultimate disposition of this appeal does not depend on the resolution of this portion of plaintiffs nepa claim.accordingly,we decline to reach this portion of plaintiffs nepa claim.
plaintiffs other major claim is that the blm violated its duty to protect lands withdrawn from settlement,location,sale or entry under the executive order known as pwr,public water reserve.plaintiffs also argue that pwr,which withdrew lands surrounding certain springs and water holes,created an implied reservation of water rights to the federal government in some springs in the area of the project,and that the project will unlawfully interfere with those water rights.
we decline to address plaintiffs pwr claim,for two reasons.first,the blm should be given an opportunity to fix the errors in its analysis of the project under nepa before challenges to the approval of the project itself are entertained.having addressed the problems with the eis,the blm may decide to make different choices.nepa is not a paper exercise,and new analyses may point in new directions.the problems with the approval of the project itself may never arise once the blm has had a chance to see the choices before it with fresh eyes.or.nat.desert ass blm,cir.
second,the proper analysis of the pwr claim turns in large part on whether four springs in the area of the project are covered by pwr that is,whether those four springs are located on lands that were withdrawn by pwr but the blm position on that question is unclear prudence counsels in favor of remanding to the agency to clarify its position,rather than addressing legal questions that may end up being irrelevant to the disposition of the claim.su hwa she holder,cir.w e lack the clairvoyance necessary to confidently infer the reasoning behind the agency conclusion.rather than countenance a decision that leaves us to speculate based on an incomplete analysis,we remand the case to the agency for clarification.footnote omitted.

footnote.this summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.it has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.
eureka moly contracted with an air quality consulting firm,air sciences,to conduct the air impacts analysis.that analysis,in turn,was submitted to the blm,which relied on it when preparing the feis.
the feis cites a different ndep official as the source of the baseline values for particulate matter concentrations.
what value to use as a baseline concentration for a particular air pollutant,in the absence of data,is a question of expert judgment,not one of fact.there is no doubt that the baseline pollutant levels are not,as a factual matter,zero the question is what to use as an estimate of baseline levels for purposes of modeling.in fact,the email to the ndep official asked for some guidance on what background concentration values to use for a modeling analysis in the mount hope area.emphasis added.
counsel for the blm conceded during oral argument that if we were to conclude that the assumption of a zero baseline for several air pollutants rendered the air impacts analysis deficient,we would necessarily have to conclude that the cu
