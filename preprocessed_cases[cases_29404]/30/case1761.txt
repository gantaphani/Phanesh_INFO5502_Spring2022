in its briefing in the trial court,creed claimed that the city failed to properly provide notice of its intent to vacate a public and to abandon various public easements on the property on which the project would be constructed specifically,creed maintained that the city failed to provide certain forms of particularized notice that creed asserts are required by the public streets,highways,and service easements vacation law pshsevl sts,et and the san diego municipal code municipal code creed also claimed that the city violated the municipal code by failing to provide proper notice of the city proposed amendment of its land use plans to facilitate the project.
the respondents countered that the notice requirements of the pshsevl did not apply in this case because the city provided notice of its intent to vacate the public and the public easements pursuant to the subdivision map act,et,rather than the pshsevl.the respondents also claimed that the city provided the notice required under the municipal code prior to amending the land use plans.

in may,creed filed a brief in support of its petition.in its brief,creed stated that it intended to dismiss its first cause of action in which it claimed a violation of the subdivision map act,and also stated that it intended to file a second amended petition in which it would add a cause of action alleging a violation of section creed claimed that the city had violated section by failing to provide proper notice of its intent to consider the land use plan amendments at the july hearing.
in an accompanying request for judicial notice,creed requested that the trial court take judicial notice of the city published notice for the july hearing,the resolution approving the amendments of the land use plan,the resolution approving the vacating of the easements and,and various provisions of the municipal code,among other items.
also in may,the trial court permitted creed to file the operative second amended petition for writ of mandate.the second amended petition contained four causes of three causes of contained in creed first amend petition,and the additional cause of action described in creed brief in support of its petition,alleging a violation of section.
d.the oppositions 
in its brief in opposition to the second amended petition,westfield argued that creed action was barred due to creed failure to exhaust administrative remedies.westfield also claimed that creed could not prevail on its claims because it could not establish that any purported notice errors had caused creed to suffer prejudice,as defined in government code section,subdivision b.
in the city opposition brief to the second amended petition,the city claimed that it had complied with all applicable notice requirements of both state law and the municipal code.the city maintained that the pshsevl was inapplicable to the project because the subdivision map act and the municipal code provide an alternative method for vacating public easements and,and that the city had effectuated the vacations at issue in this case pursuant to the subdivision map act and municipal code provisions implementing the subdivision map act,rather than the pshsevl.the city also claimed that it had not violated section in providing notice of the public hearing on the proposed amendments to the land use plans at issue.
in support of its opposition,the city offered the declaration of jeffrey strohminger,the city assistant deputy director of development services,who assisted in drafting many of the municipal code provisions at issue.strohminger stated that the city has consistently interpreted the municipal code as providing that public and easements may be vacated pursuant to either the subdivision map act or the pshsevl.the city attached to strohminger declaration an internal policy document entitled managing public vacations and easements.this document states that vacations may be processed by the city pursuant to either the subdivision map act or the pshsevl 
the city requested that the court take judicial notice of portions of the legislative history of government code section,subdivision g,and city council policy.the city council policy,which first became effective in,states in relevant part

creed reply 
creed filed a reply in which it reiterated its arguments that the city had failed to provide proper notice of the proposed vacations and amendments to the land use plan.creed also argued that it was not required to exhaust administrative remedies because it had not received proper notice of the july public hearing.in addition,creed contended that it was not required to establish prejudice,as defined in government code section,subdivision b,because its action did not arise under the planning and zoning law,et.with its reply,creed filed a request that the trial court take judicial notice of additional provisions of the municipal code.
f.the trial court ruling and creed appeal 
on june,the trial court issued a tentative ruling denying the petition for writ of mandate in its entirety the trial court concluded that creed had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies prior to filing the petition,and in any event,that the city had complied with all applicable notice requirements.creed submitted on the tentative ruling,and the trial court confirmed the tentative ruling as its final decision.on july,the trial court entered a judgment denying creed petition for writ of mandate and request for declaratory and injunctive relief.creed appeals from the judgment.
discussiona.the city provided adequate notice of its intent to vacate a public and various public easements 
creed claims that the city failed to provide notice of its intent to vacate a public and various public easements as mandated under the pshsevl sts,et and the municipal code.the respondents counter that neither the pshsevl nor the municipal code requires that the city vacate public or public easements exclusively pursuant to the provisions of the pshsevl,and that the city properly effectuated the vacations in this case pursuant to the subdivision map act,et,rather than the pshsevl.
standard of review and principles governing the interpretation of statutes and ordinances 
in reviewing a trial court judgment on a petition for writ of mandate,an appellate court exercises its independent judgment on legal issues,such as the interpretation of ordinances,szold medical bd.of california th.creed claims require that we interpret two statutes the subdivision map act,et and the pshsevl sts,et and also require that we interpret provisions of the municipal code.
in construing any statute,w rules of statutory construction require us to ascertain the intent of the enacting legislative body so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.citation.we first examine the words themselves because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.the words of the statute should be given their ordinary and usual meaning and should be construed in their statutory context.citation.if the statutory language is unambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.whaley sony computer entertainment america,th.

in yamaha,the california supreme court held that,whether judicial deference to an agency interpretation is appropriate and,if so,its extent the weight it should be given is fundamentally situational.yamaha,supra,cal th at.greater deference should be given to an agency interpretation where the agency has expertise and technical knowledge,especially where the legal text to be interpreted is technical,obscure,complex,or entwined with issues of fact,policy,and discretion.id.at,quoting cal.law revision,tent.recommendation,judicial review of agency action tentative recommendation.for example,where an agency interprets its own regulation the agency is likely to be intimately familiar with regulations it authored and sensitive to the practical implications of one interpretation over another.yamaha,supra,cal th at,quoting tentative recommendation,supra,at.in addition,greater deference is appropriate where there are indications of careful consideration by senior agency officials.yamaha,supra,cal th at.
the yamaha court also stated that evidence that the agency has consistently maintained the interpretation in question,especially if it is citation and indications that the agency interpretation was contemporaneous with legislative enactment of the statute being interpreted,warrant increased deference.yamaha,supra,cal th at,quoting tentative recommendation,supra,at.
substantive law 
a.the subdivision map act 
the subdivision map act,et is the primary regulatory control governing the division of property in california and generally requires that a subdivider of property design the subdivision in conformity with applicable general and specific plans and to construct public improvements in connection with the subdivision.hill city of clovis th.
with exceptions that are not relevant to this case,the subdivision map act requires a prospective subdivider of property to file a tentative map.a tentative map is a map made for the purpose of showing the design and improvement of a proposed subdivision and the existing conditions in and around it and need not be based upon an accurate or detailed final survey of the property.a local agency considers whether to approve a tentative map at a noticed public hearing.generally speaking,the local agency must publish notice of the hearing in at least one newspaper of general circulation,at least days prior to the hearing.once a tentative map is approved,the local agency must approve a final map that is in substantial conformity with the tentative map.local agencies may adopt specific requirements concerning the process of applying for,and approving,tentative and final maps.
of particular relevance to this case,government code section,subdivision g provides that public streets and easements that are not shown on a final map shall be deemed abandoned under the following circumstances 
the filing of the final map shall constitute abandonment of all public streets and public easements not shown on the map,provided that a written notation of each abandonment is listed by reference to the recording data or other official record creating these public streets or public easements and certified to on the map by the clerk of the legislative body or the designee of the legislative body approving the map.
b.the public streets,highways,and service easements vacation law 
the pshsevl sts,et provides a method by which public entities may vacate public service easements.sts.streets and highways code sections through specify the procedures by which a public entity may initiate,consider,and approve such vacations.creed notes that streets and highways code sections,subdivision b,and require that public agencies provide particular forms of notice prior to effectuating vacations of easements or under the pshsevl 
streets and highways code section,subdivision a specifies that the procedures set forth in the pshsevl are not intended to serve as the exclusive method by which a public entity may vacate public streets or easements.the statute provides 
the procedures provided in this part are alternative procedures for vacating streets,highways,and public service easements.the authority granted in this part is an alternative to any other authority provided by law to public entities.
c.the municipal code 
municipal code,chapter,article article is entitled subdivision procedures.chapter,article,division,contains section,which provides that article is intended to supplement the provisions of the subdivision map act and the pshsevl italics omitted.article contains divisions that govern tentative maps division,the vacation of public division,and the abandonment of public easements division.
i tentative maps 
division,tentative maps,implements the subdivision map act and specifies the process for approving tentative maps.section specifies which decision process the city will use in considering particular types of tentative map applications 
an application for a tentative map may be approved,conditionally approved,or denied in accordance with process four for tentative final maps except for those tentative maps that include proposals for the vacation of public or the abandonment of public service easements,which shall be reviewed in accordance with process five.italics altered.
ii vacations of public and public easements 
division is entitled public vacations.section provides,the purpose of these procedures is to establish a process for approving applications to vacate a public and to supplement the provisions of the pshsevl.section,subdivision a provides 
the vacation of a public may be initiated by resolution of the city council or by petition or request of any person.a public also may be vacated by filing a tentative map and a final map pursuant to the subdivision map act,section,and in accordance with the provisions of this article.italics altered.
section specifies the procedures that the city will use in making a decision on an application to vacate a public.section requires that the city provide the forms of notice specified in pshsevl for vacations to be effectuated under that law.division,easement abandonments,contains provisions with respect to easements that are nearly identical to those in division pertaining to.see.
application 
the pshsevl does not provide the exclusive method by which a 
public entity may vacate public or public easements 
creed claims that the city failed to provide notice of its intent to vacate a public and various public easements as mandated under the pshevl.specifically,creed maintains that the pshsevl required the city to post notices of the proposed vacations along the and the easements.sts.creed further contends that the city was required to publish notices of the proposed vacations for two successive weeks,and to include in the notices certain statutorily mandated information concerning the proposed vacations.sts,subd.a.
the pshsevl expressly states that the procedures set forth therein constitute alternative procedures for vacating streets,highways,and public service easements,and that the authority granted in this part is an alternative to any other authority provided by law to public entities.sts,subd.a.the subdivision map act provides a separate,lawful manner by which public entities may vacate public and easements,subdivision g the filing of the final map shall constitute abandonment of all public streets and public easements not shown on the map.the legislative history of government code section,subdivision g states,this bill specifies a procedure that permits public streets or public easements to be abandoned by the filing of a final subdivision map including a procedure requiring the clerk of the local legislative body to certify each abandonment on the applicable map.legis.counsel,bill reg.sess.accordingly,it is clear that state law permits public entities to vacate and easements pursuant to either the subdivision map act or the pshesvl.
we reject creed contentions to the contrary.creed first claims that the respondents should be precluded from arguing that pshsevl does not provide the exclusive method for vacating public easements because the city purportedly took the opposite position in another case in this court.we reject this contention because it is not based on documents in the record in this case we also reject creed suggestion,raised for the first time in its reply brief,that this court issue a writ of coram vobis directing the trial court to take additional evidence on this issue.the portion of the unpublished opinion in the case that creed quotes in its brief makes clear that the case involved whether the city could abandon a public easement through nonuse,not whether the city may abandon or vacate easements pursuant to the subdivision map act.we therefore reject creed argument that it has demonstrated that a writ should be issued to guard against the potential for fraud on the j udiciary.
creed also argues that public and easements may not be vacated pursuant to the subdivision map act because that act prescribes no application or approval procedure for public vacations or easement abandonments sought as part of a tentative map and that nothing on the face of government code section,subdivision g exempts the city from compliance with the pshsevl we are not persuaded.as noted above,the subdivision map act specifies the general procedures by which a local agency is to consider whether to approve tentative and final maps,and authorizes local agencies to adopt additional requirements concerning such maps.government code section,subdivision g,which outlines the circumstances under which the filing of a final map vacates public and easements,makes no reference to the pshsevl,and,as noted above,the pshsevl itself specifies that it is an alternative procedure for vacating public and easements.sts,subd.a.it is clear that,under state law,local agencies may vacate public and easements pursuant to the tentative and final map approval process,without also having to comply with the notice requirements of the pshsevl.
the municipal code authorizes the city to vacate public and public easements pursuant to the subdivision map act 
creed also argues that,even assuming the pshsevl does not provide the exclusive method for vacating public and easements under state law,the municipal code requires that the city comply with the notice provisions of the pshsevl whenever the city vacates a public or a public easement.the city argues that the municipal code follows state law,and provides that the city may vacate and easements pursuant to either the subdivision map act or the pshsevl.in our view,the city has the better argument.
to begin with,an application of the yamaha factors indicates that the city interpretation of its own municipal code is entitled to considerable deference see yamaha,supra,cal th at,since notice provisions under the municipal code are a subject as to which the city has expertise and technical knowledge.yamaha,supra,cal th at.in addition,the strohminger declaration,the development services department policy document,and city council policy see pt,ante,constitute evidence that the city has consistently maintained its interpretation of the municipal code,and that this interpretation has been given careful consideration by senior city officials yamaha,supra,cal th at.
section specifies the process that the city will use to consider tentative map applications that propose the vacation of public or the abandonment of public service easements.section is contained in a division of the municipal code that implements the subdivision map act and specifies the process for approving tentative maps.section contains no express or implied reference to the additional notice provisions mandated for vacations that are conducted pursuant to the pshsevl.section thus strongly supports the conclusion that the city may vacate public and easements pursuant to the subdivision map act,subdivision g,without complying with the separate notice provisions contained in the pshsevl.
in addition,the provisions of the municipal code that implement the pshsevl expressly acknowledge that and easements also may be vacated pursuant to the subdivision map act and the municipal code provisions implementing the subdivision map act.for example,section provides,a public also may be vacated by filing a tentative map and a final map pursuant to the subdivision map act and in accordance with the provisions of this article.italics altered see also same as to easements.similarly,section suggests that may be vacated pursuant to the subdivision map act or the pshsevl.section provides,the filing for record of a subdivision map pursuant to the subdivision map act shall have the same effect as recording a resolution of vacation of a.italics omitted.see also same as to easements.
we reject creed argument that sections and should be interpreted as providing that filing a application is one of the methods for initiating the process,and that the provisions of the municipal code implementing the pshsevl in divisions and,are triggered by filing a tentative map application.italics added.for the reasons stated in the previous paragraphs,we conclude that sections and,are best interpreted as referring to the alternative mechanism for vacating and easements pursuant to th
