at issue is a challenge under the national environmental policy act nepa,et,and the endangered species act esa,et,to the united states navy navy trident ii missile upgrade program at its submarine base in bangor,washington.appellants ground zero center for nonviolent action,waste action project,washington physicians for social responsibility,cascadia wildlands project,peace action of washington,mary fleysteen,and glen milner,collectively,ground zero maintain that the navy failed to review the probable significant environmental impacts of an accidental explosion of a trident ii missile during operations at bangor,and failed to consult the national marine fisheries service nmfs regarding the possible effects of such an explosion on threatened salmon species inhabiting the waters adjacent to the bangor submarine base.
the navy developed the fleet ballistic missile system during the cold war as a survivable retaliatory strike force,in the navy terminology,that can be launched from submarines deployed at sea if there is a prior nuclear attack against the united states the trident ii,or,intercontinental ballistic missile,first deployed by the navy in,is the sixth and most recent generation of this missile system.the trident ii missile is the replacement for the fifth generation trident i,or,missile.the trident i missile was initially deployed in,and is presently being phased out of the navy arsenal.
the navy ohio,or trident,class ballistic missile submarine serves as the primary launching platform for the trident i and ii missiles.each of the eighteen trident class submarines in the navy fleet is equipped to carry and launch trident missiles,and this program is a major part of the united states strategic arsenal.two naval bases serve as the home ports for the trident submarine fleet naval submarine base kings bay,georgia,located on the atlantic ocean just north of the florida border,and naval submarine base bangor,washington,located on the eastern shoreline of the hood canal in the puget sound basin,approximately miles west of the city of seattle and miles north of the city of bremerton.
naval submarine base bangor bangor was selected by the navy in the early as the first dedicated facility in the continental united states for the trident i missile system.after a review of potential sites considering both the operational requirements and the environmental impacts of the trident program,the navy settled upon bangor as its prospective site.upon selection of bangor,the navy undertook a detailed assessment of the impacts of trident program on the community and environment surrounding the base,culminating in issuance of a final environmental impact statement eis in july,
the navy supplemented the eis four times once in,twice in,and once in.both the eis and the four supplements considered that the bangor base could be upgraded at an unspecified future date to accommodate the navy conversion from the fifth generation trident i to the sixth generation trident ii system.
in the,the navy settled on a plan to upgrade eight trident submarines in the bangor fleet,originally fitted to carry trident i missiles,so that they could accommodate the trident ii missile.this plan required a corresponding upgrade of the trident i storage and handling facilities at bangor to make these facilities compatible with the larger trident ii missile.because the specifications for the final upgrade plan,the trident ii backfit facility program backfit program,varied from the conversion assumptions made in the eis and its supplements,the navy in issued an environmental assessment addressing the potential impact of the backfit program on the bangor environment.the environmental assessment incorporated the assumptions drawn in the eis,and independently considered only new requirements and impacts not addressed in the eis.based on the analysis in the environmental assessment,the navy issued a finding of no significant impact,concluding that the trident upgrade program at bangor will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.
the navy planned to commence construction on the backfit program in,at a projected cost of million.but the sudden end of the cold war led to a domestic debate on the necessary scope of the fleet ballistic missile system,and resulted in postponement of the backfit program.in,following a comprehensive nuclear posture review,president william jefferson clinton scaled back trident operations at bangor,but determined that the backfit program should proceed at a reduced scale.the revised backfit program,about the size and the cost of the original plan,commenced in.
in light of president clinton decision to redesign the scope of the backfit program,the navy reexamined the eis and supplements,as well as the environmental assessment.the navy review concluded that because the scaled back backfit program was a reduced version of the upgrade program first analyzed in,the environmental impacts of the backfit program were consistent with and contained in the environmental assessment analysis.the navy therefore did not prepare further nepa documentation for the backfit program.
in march,the national marine fisheries service nmfs listed as threatened under the esa two fish species found in the vicinity of the bangor base,the hood canal summer run chum salmon and the puget sound chinook salmon.in coordination with the nmfs,the navy reanalyzed the potential impact of the backfit program on these threatened species in a series of biological assessments.the navy biological assessments concluded that the backfit program would have no adverse effect on these species.the navy also forwarded the results of these assessments to the nmfs,which did not issue a response.the navy decided that it did not need to prepare any nepa documentation in response to the threatened species listing.
on june,ground zero filed suit in the united states district court for the western district of washington alleging violations of nepa and the esa,and seeking injunctive relief against the backfit program.on january,the district court granted the navy partial summary judgment with respect to ground zero claims that the navy was required to evaluate the environmental impacts of storing and handling trident ii missiles armed with nuclear warheads at bangor,the environmental impacts of potential terrorist attacks on the base,and the environmental impacts of a possible earthquake or tsunami.after oral argument,the district court on october,granted the navy summary judgment on ground zero remaining claims.the district court held that the navy was not required to publish a new eis for the backfit program because the impacts of the backfit program were covered in the environmental assessment and the navy decision not to publish an eis was entitled to deference that the navy was not required to publish a supplemental eis for the backfit program and that the navy complied with the esa when it evaluated impacts of the backfit program on the threatened salmon species.
on this appeal,ground zero makes three contentions.first,ground zero asserts that nepa requires the navy to issue a new or supplemental eis assessing the environmental risk of an accidental explosion of a conventionally armed trident ii missile during operations at bangor.second,ground zero claims that nepa further requires the navy to assess the environmental impact that would occur from an accidental explosion of a trident ii missile armed with nuclear warheads third,ground zero contends that the navy violated the esa by failing to consult with the nmfs about the potential effect of an accidental trident ii explosion on the threatened salmon species found in hood canal waters.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm the district court.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.sierra club babbitt,cir.we determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied substantive law.united states city of tacoma,cir.we may affirm summary judgment on any ground supported by the record.solomon interior reg l hous,cir.because neither nepa nor the esa contains an express provision for judicial review,our review of agency under these statutes is governed by the judicial review provisions of the administrative procedure act.a.we may overturn such agency only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.id.
we first address the nepa issues.
nepa requires that a federal agency contemplating action consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of the proposed action,and inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its process.baltimore gas natural res.def.council,d internal quotation marks omitted see also.nepa purpose is to ensure that federal agencies take a hard look at environmental consequences before committing to action.robertson methow valley citizens council,d.
because nepa is an essentially procedural statute,vermont yankee nuclear power natural resources defense council,d,it does not mandate that agencies achieve particular substantive environmental results,marsh oregon natural res.council,d.compliance with nepa is instead determined on the basis of whether an agency has adhered to nepa procedural requirements.id.
to this end,nepa provides that 
a ll agencies of the federal government shall include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,a detailed statement by the responsible official on 
i the environmental impact of the proposed action,
ii any adverse environmental effects which can not be avoided should the proposal be implemented,
iii alternatives to the proposed action,
iv the relationship between local uses of man environment and the maintenance and enhancement of productivity,and 
v any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.
prior to making any detailed statement,the responsible federal official shall consult with and obtain the comments of any federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved.
the process agencies must follow in carrying out this mandate is outlined in nepa implementing regulations.before undertaking a proposed action,an agency must first prepare an environmental assessment,a concise public document discussing the need for and alternatives to the action,as well as the environmental impacts of both the action and the potential alternatives.if the environmental assessment reveals that the proposed action will have a significant environmental impact,the agency must further prepare a detailed eis providing a full and fair discussion of significant environmental impacts,and informing and the public of the reasonable alternatives which would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment.conversely,if the environmental assessment leads the agency to determine that the contemplated action will not have an appreciable environmental effect,then the agency may forego the eis and instead prepare a finding of no significant impact,a document briefly presenting the reasons why an action will not have a significant effect on the human environment.
ground zero first contends that the navy violated nepa because the navy arbitrarily and capriciously failed to consider the probable significant environmental impacts that would follow from an accidental explosion of a conventional or nuclear trident ii missile.ground zero asserts that the navy had an obligation to prepare an eis assessing these impacts before commencing the backfit program.ground zero further asserts that events occurring after the start of the backfit program required the navy to prepare supplemental nepa analysis.
the navy threshold defense is that the decision to deploy trident ii missiles to bangor,and consequently to implement the backfit program,was presidential action embodied in a presidential decision directive issued by president clinton.the navy contends that because nepa does not apply to presidential action,the navy was not required to assess the environmental impacts of this decision 
the navy is correct that nepa procedural requirements do not apply to presidential action.by its language,nepa applies to all agencies of the federal government.the president lies outside of nepa definition of a federal agency.see providing that the term federal agency as used in nepa does not mean the congress,the judiciary,or the president.
we therefore assess whether the decision to deploy trident ii missiles at bangor and to implement the backfit program was one made by president clinton,or by the navy.the navy contention rests primarily on presidential decision directive number pdd,a largely classified document that the navy represents to contain president clinton decision to base the trident ii program at bangor.we do not rely on the navy representation of a classified document contents.although we would review the classified information in the record if we thought it necessary,we do not do so here because other documents in the record persuade us that it can not be genuinely disputed that president clinton used pdd to order the navy to locate trident ii missiles at bangor and to proceed with the backfit program.
the record contains unchallenged statements of two persons intimately familiar with the backfit program.these statements establish without equivocation that implementation of the backfit program was ordered by the president as.rear admiral dennis dwyer is the navy director of strategic systems programs,and is the manager of the backfit program.rear admiral dwyer states in a sworn declaration that in the president decided that the backfit effort at submarine base bangor should go forward but at reduced numbers,and further emphasizes that it was t he president decision to implement the scaled back backfit program.marvin frye is bangor environmental director.environmental director frye states in a file memorandum in the backfit program administrative record that in a s a result of the nuclear posture review,the president decided to backfit ohio class submarines at naval submarine base bangor with trident ii missiles.presidential decision document.the navy strategic systems programs office then reconfigured the program to meet this executive decision.environmental director frye memorandum is dated may,nearly a month and a half before the filing of ground zero complaint in the present case 
ground zero offered no evidence to counter the position that pdd ordered the navy to undertake the backfit program.ground zero instead offers the argument that pdd is not of controlling importance because the backfit program was originally devised by the navy,and,under ground zero argument,pdd only ordered that the navy scale back its original trident ii deployment plan.
we consider this argument by ground zero to be unpersuasive.it is true that the navy did conceive the original backfit program in the.but it is also true that the navy took no steps to implement the backfit program at bangor until after president clinton nuclear posture review.the navy prior planning for the eventual upgrade of bangor facilities to accommodate the trident ii missile in the event of the president ordering future deployment does not decide the issue of whether the navy had actual discretion in the final decision to site the trident ii missile at bangor.because the record unassailably shows that the president made a decision as to site the trident ii missile arsenal at bangor,whatever had been recommended by the navy,we are confronting a presidential decision that is not a proper subject of nepa review.
given the navy uncontroverted assertions regarding pdd,we hold that there is no genuine issue of material fact that it was the president,and not the navy,who made the decision to order deployment of the trident ii missile to bangor.when the president as makes a presidential decision to deploy a weapons system at a particular military installation,the military must follow the pre
