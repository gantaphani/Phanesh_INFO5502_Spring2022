this case arises from a federal agency authorization of a timber sale,known as the mudflow vegetation management project mudflow project or project,and its potential effects on the northern spotted owl owl critical habitat.plaintiff appellant conservation congress cc sued federal defendants appellees alleging that they had failed to adequately evaluate the effects of the mudflow project on the owl critical habitat,in violation of section a of the endangered species act esa,a,among other claims cc unsuccessfully sought to enjoin the mudflow project based on its esa claim.cc now appeals the district court denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it determined cc failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits as to its esa claim that defendants arbitrarily or capriciously approved the mudflow project.accordingly,we affirm.
facts and prior proceeding 
cc asserts two claims under esa section a against defendants.cc alleges that the forest service biological assessment ba for the mudflow project failed to adequately evaluate the project potential effects on the owl critical habitat,in violation of and a and the fws issued an arbitrary concurrence letter accepting the ba conclusion,in violation of a and a.
statutory framework 
the endangered species act of,et,is a comprehensive scheme with the broad purpose of protecting endangered and threatened species.ctr.for biological diversity bureau of land,cir citation and quotes omitted see also.to further this aim,esa section a imposes both substantive and procedural duties on certain federal agencies.forest guardians johanns,cir.
substantively,section a requires federal agencies,such as the forest service,to insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat of such species.a.procedurally,before initiating any action in an area that contains threatened or endangered species,federal agencies must consult with the fws for species or the national marine fisheries service for marine species to determine the likely effects of any proposed action on species and their critical habitat.natural res.defense council houston,cir forest guardians,at.the esa and its implementing regulations establish a framework for such consultation.the agency proposing the action action agency in this case,the forest service must independently determine whether the action may affect a listed species or its habitat under the esa.a.if the answer is yes,formal consultation with the appropriate consulting agency is generally mandatory.a c.an action agency may bypass formal consultation if it determines,and the consulting agency agrees,that the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect any listed species or critical habitat.b.when that occurs,the consultation process is terminated,and no further action is necessary.a.if,however,after this informal consultation,the consulting agency disagrees that the proposed action is not likely to have adverse effects,then formal consultation is required.medina cnty.envtl.action ass surface transp,cir.in formal consultation,the consulting agency must prepare a biological opinion that advises the action agency as to whether the proposed action,alone or taken together with cumulative effects,is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.g.
b.the northern spotted owl 
the northern spotted owl lives in and mature forests that extend from southwestern british columbia through parts of washington,oregon,and california.the fws listed the owl as a threatened species under the esa and designated million acres of critical habitat for the owl in the early.june.the esa defines critical habitat for a threatened or endangered species to mean areas that are essential to or essential for the species conservation.a i,ii the fws has divided the owl critical habit into four components nesting,roosting,foraging,and dispersal.see.at.
c.the mudflow project 
the mudflow project is located on the shasta trinity national forest,northeast of mccloud,california.the project area comprises approximately acres of land,and was developed to address several issues declining forest health due to tree root disease and overstocking,threat of wildfire to nearby communities,and declining wet meadow ecosystems.the project proposed treatments include thinning,sanitation and regeneration,and restoring wet meadow ecosystems,among others.a total of acres of the owl critical habitat are proposed for project treatment.
biological assessment 
on february,the forest service prepared a biological assessment analyzing the potential effects of the mudflow project on the owl and its critical habitat.the ba determined that the mudflow project area contains acres of suitable habitat and acres of suitable foraging habitat,but that no owls occupied the project area 
to evaluate whether a forest management project,such as the mudflow project,is likely to adversely affect critical habitat,the forest service applies a classification system for estimated degree of change degraded,downgraded,and removed.degraded means the treatment will reduce habitat elements,but not to the degree where existing habitat function is changed.downgraded habitat will not function in the capacity that existed before treatment,but retains some habitat function.removed means habitat elements will be reduced to the degree that it no longer functions as habitat for the species.
according to the ba,the effects of the proposed treatments would temporarily degrade but not remove foraging habitat in designated critical habitat within the project area.but in the,project treatments would improve forest health and resistance to insects and disease,increase tree diameter by reducing intertree competition,and encourage understory reproduction.in sum,the ba determined that the project would temporarily degrade a total of acres of the owl suitable foraging habitat within the project area.no areas would be degraded,and no part of the owl critical habitat would be downgraded or removed.the ba concluded that the mudflow project may affect,but is not likely to adversely affect,the owl or its critical habitat.
informal consultation and concurrence 
in april,the forest service engaged in informal consultation with the fws.the fws concurred with the forest service determination that the mudflow project is not likely to adversely affect the owl or its critical habitat.
in late and early,the forest service engaged in further consultation with the fws regarding the mudflow project,in light of new literature and additional updated information.in february,the fws reconcurred with the forest service that the mudflow project may affect,but is not likely to adversely affect designated critical habitat,given that treatments were not proposed within nesting or foraging habitat,and acres of treated foraging habitat would retain its function.on june,the forest service approved the mudflow project in its record of decision,thereby ending the consultation process.a.
in december,while this appeal was pending,the forest service reinitiated additional informal consultation with the fws regarding the potential effects of the mudflow project on the owl,in light of the revised habitat rule.on april,the fws issued a third concurrence letter agreeing with the forest service determination that the project may affect,but is not likely to adversely affect designated critical habitat for the owl.
procedural history 
cc filed its original complaint on october,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants.cc amended the complaint in march,which defendants answered.on april,cc moved for a preliminary injunction as to its esa claim.the district court denied the motion on june.cc timely appealed the district court denial of its motion for preliminary injunction.a week before oral argument,defendants filed a suggestion of mootness,seeking dismissal of the appeal because of recent events.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under a.we review a district court denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.earth island inst.carlton,cir.the abuse of discretion standard is limited and deferential,and we may only reverse the district court decision if it was based on an erroneous legal standard or clearly erroneous findings of fact.id.quotes omitted.
discussion 
in its suggestion of mootness,defendants argue that a new habitat designation,and subsequent reinstatement of informal consultation between the forest service and the fsw,render this appeal moot.we disagree.a claim is moot if it has lost its character as a present,live controversy.am.rivers marine fisheries,cir.stated another way,a claim is moot and must be dismissed if an event occurs that prevents the court from granting effective relief.id.defendants,as the party seeking dismissal based on mootness,bear a heavy burden,as they must show that it is absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior will not recur if the lawsuit is dismissed.rosemere neighborhood ass epa,cir citation and quotes omitted see also forest guardians,at.
defendants fail to meet this burden.as the april fws concurrence letter filed by defendants reveals,defendants continue precisely the behavior cc the mudflow project without conducting a cumulative effects analysis.this appeal is therefore not moot.
ii.likelihood of success on the merits 
a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy that requires the movant to show that it is likely to succeed on the merits it is likely to suffer irreparable harm if the preliminary injunction is not granted the balance of equities tips in its favor and an injunction is in the public interest.winter natural res.def.council.here,the district court denied cc motion for preliminary injunction on the basis that it had not established a probability of success on the merits as to its esa claim.
the administrative procedure act apa,stat,sets forth additional requirements to be considered when deciding whether cc is likely to succeed on the merits as to its esa claim.earth island,at.under the apa,a reviewing court may only set aside an agency action that is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.a decision is arbitrary and capricious only if the agency relied on factors congress did not intend it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,or offered an explanation that runs counter to the evidence before the agency or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.lands council mcnair,cir quotes omitted.agency action is valid if the agency considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.id.citation and quotes omitted.moreover,when reviewing scientific judgments and technical analyses within the agency expertise,the reviewing court must be at its most deferential.id.quoting balt.gas natural res.def.council.
cc challenges the district court determination that it has not established a probability of success on the merits as to its esa claim on two grounds.first,cc asserts that the district court committed legal error by disregarding the purported requirement that the forest service perform a cumulative effects analysis during its informal consultation with the fws.second,cc claims that the district court committed clear factual error by ignoring evidence controverting defendants conclusion that the mudflow project would degrade the owl critical habitat,but not result in an adverse effect.
cumulative effects under esa 
the forest service prepared a biological assessment and engaged in informal consultation with the fws to evaluate the potential effects of the mudflow project on the owl and its critical habitat.cc argues that defendants violated the procedural requirements of esa section a by failing to analyze the cumulative effects of defendants multiple allowances of degradation of critical habitation through the mudflow project and in connection with other past,present,and future,nearby logging projects.this argument is unavailing.
as a preliminary matter,cc argument is premised on a misunderstanding of the term cumulative effects in the esa context.the esa defines cumulative effects as those effects of future state or private activities,not involving federal activities,that are reasonably certain to occur within the action area of the federal action subject to consultation.emphasis added see also medina cnty.envtl.action ass n,at.applied to the mudflow project,cumulative effects are those stemming from future state or private activities that are reasonably certain to occur within the project area.this definition only pertains to esa section analyses and should not be conflated with nepa broader term cumulative impact,which means impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency federal or or person undertakes such other actions.see also sierra forest legacy sherman,cir nor,contrary to cc argument,is cumulative impact or cumulative effects a shorthand for environmental baseline,which means past and present impacts of all federal,state,or private actions and other human activities in the action area see also esa handbook,at stating that cumulative impact captures a snapshot of a species health at a specified point in time.in sum,the terms cumulative effects,cumulative impact,and environmental baseline have distinct regulatory meanings under the esa and nepa.
moreover,cc complains that defendants failed to analyze the cumulative effects of other nearby federal projects past,present,and future.but consideration of federal projects,past projects,and projects outside the mudflow project area exceed the scope of a cumulative effects analysis,as defined under.additionally,in conducting an analysis of the effects of the mudflow project on the owl,the forest service considered past effects by incorporating them into the baseline it used for analysis.thus,the baseline already appears to account for the aggregate effects of past activities,while future federal and private actions must withstand independent regulatory scrutiny.in essence,cc demands that defendants conduct a more extensive,cumulative impacts analysis.but nepa and esa call for different regulatory review,and we must defer to the procedural mechanisms established by the implementing agency.see.yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,absent constitutional constraints or extremely compelling circumstances the administrative agencies should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties.citations and quotes omitted.
cc argument also fails because there is simply no statutory mandate to consider cumulative effects during informal consultation.we must uphold any reasonable interpretation agencies give to ambiguous statutes they are charged with administering.see chevron,natural res.def.council.here,congress has not directly spoken to the issue of whether a cumulative effects analysis is required during informal consultation under esa section a.id.at.the statute only requires consultation with the appropriate agency.a.under its implementing regulations,fws has clearly created an affirmative duty to consider cumulative effects during formal consultation,but there is no such duty during informal consultation.the fws responsibilities during formal consultation include the formulation of a biological opinion that advises the action agency as to whether or not the action,taken together with cumulative effects,g,is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat,h.
in contrast,an informal consultation is defined as an optional process that includes all discussions,correspondence,between the service and the federal
