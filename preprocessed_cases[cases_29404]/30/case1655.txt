citizens makes four arguments the environmental impact report eir certified by the city did not mandate adequate mitigation measures for the urban decay impact of the project the eir did not sufficiently analyze the project impacts on landfill and recycling facilities and did not mandate adequate mitigation measures for those impacts the eir failed to contain adequate information correlating the project air pollution impacts with resulting effects on human health and the city statement of overriding considerations,a document that explains how the project benefits will outweigh its significant and unavoidable environmental impacts,was not supported by substantial evidence.we reject each of these arguments.

we affirm the trial court on the appeal by citizens and reverse as to wal mart appeal on the cost of preparing the administrative record
