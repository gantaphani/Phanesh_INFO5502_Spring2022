this case concerns an environmental protection agency epa or the agency directive banning agency consideration of human studies in evaluating the safety of pesticides.in the late,epa began reevaluating its practice of relying on data from human studies,and began considering such data on a basis only.in october,the agency made this practice clear to the regulated community.then,however,the agency abruptly reversed its position.on december,epa issued a directive in a press release,announcing that,pending review by the national academy of sciences nas or academy of the ethical issues posed by epa use of human studies,the agency will not consider or rely on any such human studies in its regulatory decision making,whether previously or newly submitted.environmental protection agency,press release,agency requests national academy of sciences input on consideration of certain human toxicity studies announces interim policy,appendix app.press release.
petitioners croplife america,et pesticide manufacturers and a trade association that claims that its members will be adversely affected by the announced moratorium seek review of the directive in the december press release.petitioners contend that the epa directive is unlawful,because it constitutes a binding regulation that was issued without the notice of proposed rulemaking and period for public comment mandated by the federal food,drug and cosmetic act,et ffdca.see e c e see also.petitioners also argue that the policy violates the rule,enunciated in both the federal insecticide,fungicide and rodenticide act,fifra,and ffdca,requiring epa to consider all relevant reliable data.see g b d.finally,petitioners assert that the policy is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the administrative procedure act.see a the reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.
we hold that epa directive constitutes a binding regulation issued without notice and the opportunity for comment.we therefore grant the petition for review and vacate the new rule.as a consequence,the agency previous practice of considering human studies on a basis,applying statutory requirements,the common rule,and high ethical standards as a guide,is reinstated and remains in effect unless and until it is replaced by a lawfully promulgated regulation.
background 
epa oversees a comprehensive scheme of pesticide regulation under fifra and ffdca.while fifra governs pesticide registration,ffdca regulates pesticide residues in the food supply.originally enacted in,fifra establishes a registration system allowing epa to prescribe the conditions under which a pesticide may be sold or distributed.in determining whether to register a pesticide under fifra,epa considers whether the pesticide would cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.c c.to determine whether the pesticide would cause such unreasonable environmental effects,the agency determines whether it would produce an unreasonable risk to man or any human dietary risk.bb.under ffdca,epa regulates the amount of pesticide that may remain on food products,establishing tolerance levels for pesticide residues on raw and processed food products.b.
the ffdca provision dealing with the method of setting tolerances for pesticides was substantially revised by the food quality protection act of,stat.fqpa.see governing tolerances for pesticide chemical residues see also andrew miller,note,the food quality protection act of science and law at a crossroads,duke envtl.pol y,the fqpa rewrites most of section of the ffdca.the revised provision defines pesticide tolerances as safe when there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue,including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.b a ii.in determining whether pesticide tolerances are safe,epa may consider the validity of the available data from studies,anticipated and actual residue levels of the pesticide in or on foods,the percent of food actually treated with the pesticide,and international standards.see b d f,b.
in,congress amended fifra to require that every pesticide registered before be reregistered under standards,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of.in,congress also set deadlines for epa to review all existing tolerances against the new standard established by the fqpa.q.as a result,the agency is currently in the process of reexamining thousands of regulated pesticides.this process involves years of preliminary action and evaluation under both fifra and ffdca,culminating in public pronouncements of the agency position on the safety of a given pesticide.
for decades,epa accepted and relied upon human data in evaluating pesticide safety.however,the agency position shifted in.on july,epa stated publicly that it would ask an internal review board to reevaluate the agency use of human studies.epa statement,july,app.epa statement also indicated that n o human test data has been used by epa for any final decisions about acceptable levels of pesticide use under the fqpa.id.an october internal epa memorandum amplified this statement,indicating that epa policy was to consider only human data that meets the highest ethical standards.memorandum from peter robertson,acting deputy administrator,epa,to epa assistant administrators,app.although the july statement signaled the beginning of epa reconsideration of the role of human testing,the agency office of pesticide programs continued to review human test data and to discuss the results of such reviews in the public record of regulatory decisions.see office of pesticide programs,envtl.prot.agency,role of human studies in the office of pesticide programs,app.
as part of its policy development process,epa appointed a joint subcommittee of its science advisory board and fifra scientific advisory panel the joint subcommittee to evaluate the circumstances under which human data should be considered.in september,the joint subcommittee issued a report addressing the ethical and scientific acceptability of utilizing such data.the report envision ed particular circumstances under which such dosing of humans could be scientifically and ethically acceptable,but found such circumstances very difficult to define.envtl.prot.agency,comments on the use of data from the testing of human subjects a report by the science advisory board and the fifra scientific advisory panel,app.sixteen panel members recommended that the agency continue to consider human studies under strict standards,while two members advocated a blanket ban on such tests.id.at,app.
thereafter,in october,epa made clear that it would consider data from human studies on a basis.see john heilprin,epa using human testing data from manufacturers in evaluating pesticide regulations,exposure levels,associated press,lexis,news library,news group file shogren,supra shankar vedantam,epa used data from human pesticide tests.postt,at.in several pesticide regulatory decisions issued around the time of the announcement,epa in fact considered available human data.see,interim reregistration eligibility decision for azinphosmethyl,case,at epa,app.interim reregistration eligibility decision for phosmet,case,at epa,app.interim reregistration eligibility decision for chlorpyrifos,case,at epa,app.however,the agency decision to resume consideration of such data provoked criticism,primarily from environmental groups.see,katharine seelye,reconsiders human tests of pesticides,times,at quoting richard wiles,senior vice president of the environmental working group,as saying that t he administration would be in an awkward position if it was against research but for dosing people up directly with pesticides.
on december,epa announced a broad moratorium on the use of human test data.epa publicly released a letter to the nas in which the agency sought the academy recommendations regarding the ethical and scientific acceptability of human pesticide tests.see letter from stephen johnson,assistant administrat
