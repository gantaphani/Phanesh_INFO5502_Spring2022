the question in this case is whether three wyoming statutes unconstitutionally limit equal access to hunting opportunities for nonresidents.donald schutz,a florida resident,brings this suit against the state of wyoming and various state officials representing the game and fish commission together wyoming for allegedly violating his constitutional rights.relying on the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and the dormant commerce clause of article i,section,of the united states constitution,he claims that sections the fee statute,the quota statute,and the guide statute of the wyoming code impermissibly burden nonresident hunters.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants,and schutz filed a timely appeal.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm the district court holdings regarding schutz standing to challenge the statutes.as to the merits,a we affirm the district court dismissal of the statutory challenges on equal protection grounds,and b regarding the dormant commerce clause claim,we find that it is moot in light of section of house bill,approved by the united states congress and signed into law on may.
background 
factual and procedural history 
schutz resided in wyoming from until his graduation from the university of wyoming in.during that time,schutz traveled the state extensively,hunting species of big game.after moving,he often returned during the various hunting seasons.schutz is not alone in finding wyoming an enticing place to hunt big game.according to amicus outfitters,nonresident hunters in spent approximately million in wyoming.schutz himself claims that wyoming receives million in direct revenue from hunters and fishermen,of which comes from nonresidents.app.tab at.
wyoming has responded to the interest in these sports by crafting a variety of regulatory provisions.three such statutory provisions led schutz to file the present claim.as discussed in detail below,the first is a fee statute,which charges higher fees to hunters compared to hunters.the second is a quota statute,which reserves a greater number of licenses for residents.finally,wyoming adopted a guide statute,requiring hunters to employ either a professional or resident guide to hunt in designated wilderness areas.
in,schutz purchased a nonresident elk license,and used it to hunt on lands.some months later,schutz applied for a license to hunt bighorn sheep but decided against applying for elk or deer licenses because the licenses were too expensive,and he was unwilling to hire a professional guide or find a resident guide.the record does not disclose whether he in fact drew a bighorn sheep license.
schutz then filed suit challenging the constitutionality of these three provisions of the wyoming code.wyoming responded by moving to dismiss,and again moved to dismiss after schutz filed an amended complaint.the district court converted wyoming motion to a motion for summary judgment and allowed both parties to supplement the record.schutz also filed a cross motion for summary judgment.finding that schutz did not have standing to challenge the guide statute and that the quota and fee statutes did not violate his constitutional rights,the court granted summary judgment for wyoming.
wyoming hunting statutes 
schutz claims that three hunting statutes,individually and in concert,unconstitutionally limit his ability to legally hunt big game in the state of wyoming.the statutes create special preferences for wyoming residents in three ways hunting licenses are cheaper,more licenses are allocated to residents,and residents are exempt from a requirement that hunters in wilderness areas obtain a guide.
the fee statute 
the fee statute assesses much higher hunting license fees on residents 
xiii resident deer license one deer 
xiv nonresident deer license one deer 
xvii resident elk license one elk 
xviii nonresident elk license one elk 
xxi resident bighorn sheep license one bighorn sheep 
xxii nonresident bighorn sheep license one bighorn sheep 
the fee difference is applicable to every species of big and trophy game,including,among others,deer,elk,mountain lion,grizzly bear,and antelope.the fee structure also includes a reduced rate for resident and nonresident youth.
the quota statute 
the quota statute reserves to wyoming residents a majority of the available licenses for exotic game such as bighorn sheep,mountain goats,moose,and grizzly bear 
the commission shall reserve eighty percent of the moose and percent of the bighorn sheep,mountain goat and grizzly bear licenses to be issued in any one year for resident hunters.
stat.ann.e.
a smaller percentage of deer and elk licenses are reserved to wyoming residents.
the guide statute 
the guide statute creates two classes of and wilderness hunting 
a no nonresident shall hunt big or trophy game animals on any designated wilderness area,as defined by federal or state law,in this state unless accompanied by a licensed professional guide or resident guide 
b any resident possessing a valid resident big or trophy game animal license may apply for and receive a resident guide license 
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo questions of subject matter jurisdiction,including whether a plaintiff has standing to sue.wilson glenwood intermountain,cir.we also review de novo the grant of a motion for summary judgment.garrett,cir.
summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.a disputed fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law,and the dispute is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.allen muskogee,cir.when applying this standard,we view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.simms oklahoma ex rel.dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir.the nonmoving party must nonetheless present facts such that a reasonable jury could find in his favor.id.
standing analysis,as the district court recognized,is as important as it is.the doctrine is especially significant when federal courts sit in judgment over duly enacted state laws,given our concern about the properly of the courts in a democratic society.allen wright,d elk grove unified sch.dist.newdow,d.whether a plaintiff has standing to sue turn s on the precise allegations of the parties seeking relief and must be supported by specific facts.wyoming ex rel.sullivan lujan,cir quoting national wildlife fed hodel.as a result,standing analysis is often as confusing as it is fundamental.see schaffer clinton,cir citing valley forge christian college americans united for separation of church and state,d charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.
the three constitutional elements of standing are nonetheless well established 
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest that is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
lujan defenders of wildlife,d nova health gandy,cir.these three,causation,and exist before federal courts will exercise jurisdiction.we turn first to whether schutz meets these requirements as to each statute.
the fee statute 
we agree with the district court that schutz has standing to challenge the fee statute.first,the higher fee he paid as a nonresident for an elk license in and a big horn sheep license in is an actual,concrete injury that the courts could remedy.see vermont agency of natural res.united states ex rel.stevens,d.second,the increased cost for nonresidents over residents is an injury caused by the statute.finally,a change to the statute,eliminating the gap between resident and nonresident fees,would redress this grievance.thus,schutz fee statute challenge meets the three basic constitutional standing requirements.
the quota statute 
second,we also agree with the district court that schutz has standing to challenge the quota statute.the district court based this decision on the doctrine set forth in northeastern.chapter of associated contractors of am.city of jacksonville,d.in that case,the court held that the inability of eligible bidders to compete for a governmental set asides for racial an injury in fact,even when the petitioning party can not demonstrate that they would have obtained the benefit but for the barrier.id.at.the injury in fact in an equal protection case of this variety is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier,not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.see also gratz bollinger,d describing cases where standing found even though plaintiff not denied a benefit.we have applied the equal footing analysis in this circuit.see cache valley utah dep t of transportation,cir.
here,the quota system requires that schutz and other applicants compete for a limited number of hunting licenses,while a separate pool of resident applicants compete for a larger portion of the available licenses.schutz can demonstrate standing if he can show that he applied for a hunting license and that wyoming law made the benefit more difficult to obtain because of its preference system.id.at see also conservation force,manning,cir finding standing to challenge similar regulations on this basis where plaintiffs had never received a license.this he has done.schutz is required to compete unequally for a limited supply of bighorn sheep licenses that are disproportionately reserved for wyoming residents.he is therefore injured in fact and his injury is caused by the statute.a favorable ruling in this case would redress his injuries by leveling the playing field for license applicants.he therefore has satisfied our standing requirements for his challenge to the quota statute.
the guide statute 
schutz standing as to the guide statute is less clear.the district court found that schutz had neither set forth in his affidavit sufficient facts detailing that he has suffered a concrete or particularized imminent injury,nor demonstrated that court action will redress these alleged injuries.schutz wyoming,slip op.at.may,order.in particular,the guide statute would not,according to the district court,actually force schutz to hire a guide to hunt bighorn sheep,since the statute left him free to hunt without a guide in areas.stat.ann.a.further,the court held that the guide statute allows any resident of wyoming to serve as a resident guide merely by applying for a license,thus likely reducing the expense and difficulty of procuring a guide.finally,the court was least persuaded by schutz claim that the statute interferes with his right to consider selling a bighorn mount on.order at.the court concluded that to make such a sale,schutz would have to successfully attain four uncertain goals draw a license,kill a trophy bighorn,remove the cape and horns of the animal without damage,and find a willing buyer.until schutz has been denied the opportunity to hunt in a wilderness area or forced to pay for a guide,he has yet to suffer any injury,and thus does not have standing to challenge the guide statute.id.
we agree,but for slightly different reasons.schutz asks us to assert jurisdiction over a claim when he has yet to be injured by the challenged statute.first of all,he hunted for elk in and nothing in his affidavit suggests he was limited by operation of the guide statute in the hunt.he alleges he would like to hunt in wilderness areas in the future without a guide,but at the time he filed for summary judgment he had not yet applied for deer or elk licenses and established that the guide statute in fact limited his hunting options.standing is not conferred by conjecture or speculation about future hunts.
as to schutz application for a big horn sheep license,he also has not demonstrated standing.he may indeed be forced to choose between the unpalatable alternatives of hunting in areas,paying for a guide,or foregoing hunting in wyoming.but he has not demonstrated in his affidavit that he actually drew a big horn sheep hunting license and was denied access to hunting in wilderness areas until this choice is actually put to schutz,no cognizable injury in fact exists.
we therefore affirm the district court ruling that schutz has not suffered an injury sufficiently concrete to give him standing to challenge the guide statute.
equal protection 
we now turn to the merits of schutz claims.schutz first argues that the district court erred in finding that the fee and quota statutes did not violate the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause.the court below,of course,found that hunters are not a suspect class and that hunting is not a fundamental right,thus correctly concluding that the standard of review is the rational basis test.see baldwin fish and game comm of montana,d.under that standard,courts will uphold a law if it is rationally related to a legitimate end.tonkovich kansas bd.of regents,cir.
applying rational basis review,the district court concluded that the fee and quota statutes are reasonably related to a number of legitimate ends.first,they help to encourage residents to maintain their residency and by extension support wyoming conservation programs.order at.second,given that residents tend to hunt smaller female game while nonresidents tend to hunt larger trophy males,the statutes help preserve the gender balance needed to maintain herd sizes.id.finally,the preferences for residents provide an economic boost because many people in wyoming hunt outside their county of residence.id.at.
schutz apparently concedes that these are legitimate ends and questions only whether the statutes further them in a rational way according to schutz,the district court erred in dismissing this claim at the summary judgment stage because,in his view,the analysis of the reasonable relationship of the regulation to the means is a factual question,not a legal issue.aplt.op.br.at.schutz is mistaken.under rational basis review,a legislative choice is not subject to courtroom factfinding and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.fcc beach communications,d powers harris,cir tymkovich,concurring.moreover,those attacking the rationality of the legislative classification have the burden to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.beach communications,at.quoting lehnhausen lake shore auto parts,d.under this standard,statutory classifications will be set aside only if no grounds can be conceived to justify them.powers,at quoting mcdonald bd.of election comm rs,d.nor should courts in reviewing challenged classifications second guess the wisdom,fairness,or logic of legislative choices insist on legislative classifications or inquire into legislative motivations.id.at citations omitted.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the application of the rational basis standard to the facts of this case.while we agree with schutz that some of wyoming goals may seem speculative,we can not conclude that there exists no reasonable justification for the preferences.many reasons exist,in fact,for states to adopt a preference scheme.residential preferences are commonly considered a benefit of state citizenship for finite resources such as wildlife resources,higher education,or access to state run facilities.while the reasons for preferences are context is not irrational to provide them.residents,for those who hunt or a vested interest in the sustainability of wyoming wildlife management system.this includes not just political support for such programs,but direct financial support through fees and taxes.residents may be counted on more reliably to hunt in wyoming year after year,thus supporting game and fish habitat preservation,herd management programs,new species programs such as the introduction of the gray wolf or grizzly bear populations,or,finally,the more mundane aspects of wildlife pro
