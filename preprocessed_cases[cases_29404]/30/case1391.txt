the environmental protection agency epa or the agency says howmet corporation howmet violated the resource conservation and recovery act and the hazardous and solid waste amendments of,et collectively rcra,and its implementing regulations.howmet says its actions were permitted by the regulations.whether viewed as a syntactical ambiguity or a semantic squabble,the dispute focuses on one question when is a material no longer serving the purpose for which it was produced the epa insists the initial use of the material is determinative howmet contends the initial use is irrelevant.the question matters because spent material is subject to rcra hazardous waste regulations,but material that has not been spent is not.howmet insisted that used koh liquid potassium hydroxide sent to a fertilizer manufacturer for use as a fertilizer ingredient was not spent material and thus not subject to rcra regulations.after howmet lost this argument before an administrative law judge alj and the environmental appeals board eab,the district court rejected howmet administrative procedure act claim and granted the epa for summary judgment,holding the epa interpretation of its spent material regulation was not arbitrary and capricious and that howmet had fair notice of the agency interpretation.see howmet epa,d.we affirm.
subtitle c of rcra,establishes a stringent regulatory structure for overseeing the safe treatment,storage and disposal of hazardous waste.sierra club epa.the statute defines hazardous waste as a solid waste that may pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly treated,stored,transported,or disposed of,or otherwise managed.the epa has broad investigatory and enforcement authority under rcra.see motors epa.cir.pursuant to this authority,the epa has imposed numerous requirements and restrictions on the generators and transporters of hazardous waste,including requiring epa identification numbers,c,the use of hazardous waste manifests identifying contaminants,id.a,and written notification of land disposal restrictions,id.a.
hazardous wastes are a subset of solid wastes.see a.since a substance can not be a hazardous waste or subject to the epa hazardous waste regulations unless it satisfies the threshold definition of solid waste,our analysis begins with the definition of solid waste.solid waste is discarded material,including solid,liquid,semisolid,or contained gaseous material resulting from industrial,commercial,mining,and agricultural operations.discarded material includes recycled materials materials that have been used,reused,or reclaimed,c and spent materials any material so contaminated by use it can no longer serve the purpose for which it was produced without processing,id.c.under the epa regulations,when a spent material is recycled,it must be managed as a solid waste.moreover,if the material also exhibits a hazardous characteristic,such as corrosivity see id.a,it must be managed as a hazardous waste subject to the rcra requirements.thus,as the eab noted,when a hazardous spent material is recycled,or u sed to produce products that are applied to or placed on the land or are otherwise contained in products that are applied to or placed on the land,id.c i b,it must be managed as hazardous waste.the resolution of this appeal rests on whether the materials in question were spent and should be deemed solid waste.since spent material is material that has been used and as a result of contamination can no longer serve the purpose for which it was produced without processing,the central issue in this case is the interpretation of the phrase the purpose for which it was produced.
the eab syllabus succinctly summarizes the dueling interpretations howmet argues that purpose implies a fundamental purpose.howmet interpretation would allow a product,such as koh,to be used first as a cleaning agent and then as a fertilizer ingredient without being spent,because both uses allegedly are consistent with koh broad fundamental purpose as a concentrated source of hydroxide ions and of potassium.the agency argues that a product purpose for production,the purpose for which it was produced must be related to its original use,so a product first used as a cleaning agent becomes a spent material when it becomes too contaminated for that use and then is sent to a fertilizer manufacturer to be used in a fundamentally different manner.
the facts in this case are not in dispute.howmet manufactures precision investment castings for aerospace and industrial gas turbine applications.to clean the ceramic core from the metal castings,howmet uses an aqueous koh solution.during the cleaning process the koh is contaminated.howmet uses the koh solution until it becomes so contaminated it can no longer effectively clean the castings.the used koh is corrosive.thus,under the epa regulations,the used koh would be regulated as hazardous waste.see.
typically,howmet accumulates the used koh in storage tanks at an authorized hazardous waste disposal facility.however,between august and september,howmet sent some of the used koh to royster,an independent fertilizer manufacturing company that,without processing or otherwise reclaiming it,added the koh to its fertilizer to control ph and provide a source of potassium.howmet did not prepare any hazardous waste manifest for the shipments to royster or otherwise treat the koh as a hazardous waste under rcra.
in,the epa brought enforcement actions against howmet,alleging the used koh sent to royster was a solid and characteristic hazardous waste,in that it was corrosive and potentially contaminated with chromium,and therefore subject to rcra jurisdiction.the epa alleged howmet violated rcra and its implementing regulations by shipping hazardous waste to facilities that did not have an epa identification number sending hazardous waste offsite using transporters without epa identification numbers failing to prepare hazardous waste manifests for the koh shipments to royster and failing to send and maintain on file appropriate land disposal restriction notifications for the koh shipments informing royster whether the koh was too contaminated for land application without prior treatment.
howmet contested the allegations and requested a hearing.an alj found howmet liable under rcra,concluding the used koh sent to royster was a hazardous spent material and therefore a solid waste that must be managed as a hazardous waste and that howmet had failed to manage the koh in accordance with epa regulations.the alj also concluded howmet had not proved it was denied due process because it had not received fair notice of the epa interpretation of its spent material regulation.the alj assessed a civil fine of against howmet.howmet appealed to the eab,which upheld the alj finding in a lengthy decision detailing rcra statutory and regulatory framework.howmet filed a complaint in the district court claiming the eab decision was arbitrary and capricious,but the district court awarded summary judgment in favor of the epa,holding the epa reasonably interpreted its spent material regulation and that howmet had fair notice of the epa interpretation.howmet,d.this appeal followed.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,see steele schafer,and must set aside the epa final determination if arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a.we accord an agency interpretation of its own regulations a high level of deference,accepting it unless it is plainly wrong.epa,see also exportal ltda.united states,it is well established that a reviewing court owes deference to an agency construction of its own regulations.under this standard,we must defer to the epa interpretation as long as it is logically consistent with the language of the regulation s and serves a permissible regulatory function,at.but see exportal,at explaining deference is due only when the plain meaning of the rule itself is doubtful or ambiguous and thus deference to an agency interpretation is not in order if the rule meaning is clear on its face.moreover,t he policy favoring deference is particularly important where a technically complex statutory scheme is backed by an even more complex and comprehensive set of regulations,at noting that i n such circumstances,the arguments for deference to administrative expertise are at their strongest.
a.the definition of spent material is ambiguous 
both parties seem to agree our analysis should begin with determining whether the regulatory text of the epa spent material definition,as applied to howmet koh shipments to royster,is clear on its face.howmet argues the epa definition is unambiguous.it claims both the dictionary definition of purpose the object for which something exists,as well as the context of the regulation,are relevant and support its position.howmet insists the plain language of the definition the purpose for which it was produced looks retrospectively to a material intended purpose at the time it was produced,not prospectively to the first use made of the material following its production and therefore does not permit the interpretation adopted by the epa.the epa,on the other hand,argues the word purpose is ambiguous,both taken alone and in context,and that the phrase the purpose for which it was produced could relate to a material use,especially where,as here,the producer of the material does not itself put the material to use,but rather creates the product for sale.we agree with the epa.
neither the word purpose nor the phrase the purpose for which it was produced are defined in the epa regulations,and the dictionary definition relied on by howmet provides little help in determining the meaning of either the word or phrase,as they are used in.the everyday meanings of the term and phrase also do not provide any clarity as to whether the initial use of a material is relevant to determining the purpose for which the material was produced.in sum,the text of the epa definition is simply ambiguous with respect to whether we should adopt howmet multiple,original purposes approach to determining when a material is spent,or whether we should,instead,adopt the original use based purpose test advanced by the epa.
b.the epa interpretation of the spent material regulation is reasonable 
having concluded the plain language of the epa spent material definition does not answer the question whether the used koh sent to royster was a spent material,we examine whether the epa interpretation of the definition is reasonable.see,gorman ntsb,explaining this court must uphold an agency interpretation of an ambiguous regulation if reasonable devon energy kempthorne.in so doing,we look to the epa overall regulatory framework under rcra,as well as the regulatory history of the agency spent material definition.both establish the epa interpretation is reasonable and consistent with the agency prior interpretations.
regulatory history of the epa spent material definition 
the epa current hazardous waste regulations were promulgated in primarily to clarify which materials are solid and hazardous wastes when they are recycled.hazardous waste mgmt.definition of solid waste,to be codified at pts.the epa original regulations implementing subtitle c of rcra did not include a reference to spent material or a material purpose.hazardous waste mgmt.identification and listing of hazardous waste.may,to be codified at pt.instead,a material was considered solid waste when,among other things,it had been used and sometimes discarded.see id.at.under the regulations,a material that ha d served its original intended use and sometimes wa s discarded was a solid waste.b emphasis added see also.at thus,once a material had been used and could no longer serve its originally intended use,it was considered waste.notably,the preamble to the final regulations used the phrase original intended purpose rather than original intended use to describe solid waste.at,emphasis added.the preamble,while not binding,see kennecott utah copper dep t of the interior,explaining whether a preamble has independent legal effect is a function of the agency intention to bind either itself or regulated parties see also res.def.council epa,is informative with respect to how the epa intended to determine a material purpose.the fact the epa substituted the term use for purpose in the final regulation is consistent with the epa current position that a used material original purpose should be determined by looking to how the material was initially deployed after being purchased as a,the material original intended use.
in,the epa proposed the rule containing the current hazardous waste regulations.see hazardous waste mgmt.proposed,to be codified at pts.the agency proposed several important changes to the definition of solid waste.most importantly,the epa proposed definition would no longer base a material status as solid waste on whether it was sometimes discarded.see id.at.instead,a recycled material regulatory status would depend upon both what the material was and how it was actually managed.id.the revised definition of solid waste stated that five types of recycling activities,including u se constituting disposal which involves the direct placement of wastes onto the land,would be within the epa jurisdiction.id.at.the five categories were further divided according to the type of waste involved.one such type of waste was spent material,which the epa described in the preamble as materials that have been used and are no longer fit for use without being regenerated,reclaimed,or otherwise.id.emphasis added.the epa explained that processes using spent materials may be more logical candidates for regulation because spent materials having already fulfilled their original use are more inherently.id.at emphasis added.the proposed regulation itself defined spent material as any material that has been used and has served its original purpose.id.at proposed b emphasis added.again,the epa synonymous use of the singular term original use and the term original purpose reveals the agency viewed the two concepts as closely connected and interrelated.
the epa finalized the proposed regulations in.see hazardous waste mgmt.definition of solid waste.although the epa stated it was continuing to define spent materials as those which have been used and are no longer fit for use without being regenerated,reclaimed,or otherwise reprocessed,id.at,the epa acknowledged its reference to original purpose in the proposed regulations was ambiguous when applied to situations where a material can be used further without being reclaimed,but the further use is not identical to the initial use.id.the agency therefore stated it was clarifying what it mean t by spent materials,and,accordingly,revised the wording of the definition to read as it does today a spent material is any material that has been used and as a result of contamination can no longer serve the purpose for which it was produced without processing,c.in the preamble,the epa provided an example of a product used for a subsequent purpose not identical to its original use that would not be considered a spent material 
w here solvents used to clean circuit boards are no longer pure enough for that continued use,but are still pure enough for use as metal degreasers.these solvents are not spent materials when used for metal degreasing.the practice is simply continued use of a solvent this is analogous to a secondary material as an effective substitute for commercial products.the reworded regulation clarifies this by stating that spent materials are those that have been used,and as a result of that use become contaminated by physical or chemical impurities,and can no longer serve the purpose for which they were produced.
as noted above,we recognize an agency preamble guidance generally does not have the binding force of the agency regulations.nonetheless,it is at least informative.the example the epa provided is illustrative of the type of subsequent use of a material it sought to regulate under rcra.the example suggested certain continued use s of a material sufficiently similar to or consistent with the material initial use would be considered a purpose for which the material was produced and thus permitted under the agency spent mater
