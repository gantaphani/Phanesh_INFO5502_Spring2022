in this case we consider petitions by the sierra club and the national lime association challenging the environmental protection agency hazardous air pollutant emission regulations for cement manufacturing.with respect to the sierra club petition we reject its challenge to the emission standards for hazardous metals and find the agency failure to set standards for hydrogen chloride,mercury,and total hydrocarbons contrary to the clean air act plain language direct epa to consider the health impacts of potentially stricter standards for hazardous metals and sustain the regulation monitoring requirements.concluding that the national lime association has associational standing,we reject its argument that epa use of particulate matter as a surrogate for metal hazardous air pollutants violates the clean air act and is arbitrary and capricious and reject its challenge to the testing method epa adopted for determining whether a manufacturer qualifies as a major source of hazardous air pollutants.
background 
the clean air act requires the environmental protection agency to establish emission standards for major sources of hazardous air pollutants listed in the statute.d.the act directs the agency to review the list periodically and,where appropriate,to revise it by rule.id.b.hazardous air pollutants are known as haps.
a major source is any stationary source that emits ten tons per year or more of any single hap or tons per year or more of any combination of haps.id.a.under section d of the statute,emission standards must require 
the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of haps that the administrator,taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction,and any nonair quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements,determines is achievable through application of measures,processes,methods,systems or techniques including,but not limited to,process changes,substitution of materials or other modifications.
in addition to this general guidance,the statute includes minimum stringency requirements for emission standards that apply without regard to either costs or the other factors and methods listed in section d.these stringency requirements differ depending on whether a source is new or existing.new sources are defined as stationary source s,the construction or modification of which is commenced after the publication of regulations or,if earlier,proposed regulations prescribing air pollution standards that will be applicable to such sources.id.a.for new sources,the statute provides that t he maximum degree of reduction in emissions that is deemed achievable for new sources shall not be less stringent than the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source,as determined by the administrator.id.d emphasis added.for existing sources,defined as all stationary sources other than new sources,id.a,the statute provides that standards shall not be less stringent than the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing percent of the existing sources for which the administrator has emissions information.id.d a.
epa implements these statutory requirements through a process.the agency begins by setting the minimum stringency standards required by section d for new and existing sources.adding confusion to this already complex statute,epa calls these minimum stringency requirements floors,even though they in fact establish maximum emission levels.see sierra club epa,sierra.once the agency sets statutory floors,it then determines,considering cost and the other factors listed in section d,whether stricter standards are achievable.d.the agency calls such stricter requirements standards.
this case concerns emission standards for portland cement manufacturing plants.see national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants from the portland cement manufacturing industry.patented in by joseph aspdin and named for its resemblance to portland stone limestone from the isle of portland,see the new encyclopedia britannica ed,portland cement is a fine powder that serves as the key ingredient in the concrete used in most construction.see national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants proposed standards for hazardous air pollutants emissions for the portland cement manufacturing industry.the cement manufacturing process begins by grinding together materials such as limestone,clay,shale,sand,iron ore,and flyash and heating the mixture in a kiln.see.at.known as clinker,the heated mixture is then cooled in a clinker cooler and ground to a fine powder in a mill.see.
prior to setting cement manufacturing emission standards,epa estimated that portland cement plants throughout the country emitted a total of tons of haps per year.at.epa found that most individual cement plants released over ten tons of hydrogen chloride hcl annually,qualifying them as major sources of haps for which the clean air act required the agency to set emission standards.see id.at.in addition to hcl,epa found that cement plants emitted significant levels of hap metals,mercury,and organic haps other than.see id.at.these haps were released by kilns,clinker coolers,and mills,as well as by storage and transportation of materials within cement plants.see id.at.according to epa,the potential health effects of these pollutants include inflammation of the respiratory tract,reproductive problems,cancer,nausea,blood disorders,and damage to the immune system.see id.at.
acting on this information,epa began by considering emission floors for each of the five major categories of haps released by cement plants.for,the agency set emission floors for both new and existing sources.considering particulate matter pm to be an appropriate surrogate for hap of pm that are difficult to measure established emission floors for new and existing sources for pm as well.epa set no to as floors of no control for the three remaining haps hcl,mercury,and organic haps other than.
the agency took a approach to setting emission floors.for cement plants qualifying as new sources,epa identified the emission control technology used by the best performing plant for which it had information and called this the mact floor technology.mact means maximum achievable control technology.epa then looked at emissions data for all plants using the mact floor technology for which it had information,not just data from the best performing plant,and set the new source emission floor at the highest emission level reported by a plant using that technology.to set existing source emission floors,epa followed a similar procedure.it identified the technology used by the median plant out of the best twelve percent of plants for which it had information and set the existing source emission floor at the emission level of the worst performing plant in its database using that technology.if,as in the case of hcl,mercury,and organic haps other than,epa found an insufficient number of plants in its database one for new sources or twelve percent for existing sources controlling a particular hap with pollution control technology,it set no standard at all,it determined that the emission floor was no control.
proceeding to the next stage of the emission standard setting process,epa declined with one exception not relevant to this case to set standards for either new or existing sources for any of the five haps.
in addition to requiring epa to set emission standards,the clean air act directs the agency to require owners and operators of major sources to conduct enhanced monitoring of their emissions and to submit compliance certifications reporting compliance with the emission standards.a.acting pursuant to this requirement,epa directed cement plants to use a technique known as fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir to measure their hcl emissions to determine whether they qualify as major sources.see a id.pt,app.plants qualifying as major sources must conduct performance tests that measure pm emissions every five years.see id.b,c.to test for compliance with pm standards between performance tests,cement plants must monitor opacity either with a continuous opacity monitor or through visual inspections.see id.c.cement plants must also develop operations and maintenance plans to be submitted to epa for approval as part of the permitting process.see id.a.
petitioners sierra club and national lime association nla challenge these regulations.the sierra club mounts four specific challenges epa approach to setting emission floors for pm and both violates the clean air act and is arbitrary and capricious the agency refusal to set standards for hcl,mercury,and total hydrocarbons violates the statute epa rejection of standards for mercury,total hydrocarbons,and hap metals for which pm is a surrogate is arbitrary and capricious and the monitoring requirements fail to provide adequate assurance of compliance with the pm standard.nla,a trade association representing lime manufacturers,some of which also manufacture cement,argues that epa decision to use pm as a surrogate for hap metals violates the statute and is arbitrary and capricious and the agency decision to require cement plants to use the ftir method to determine their major source status is arbitrary and capricious.the american portland cement alliance,a trade association representing cement manufacturers and marketers,intervenes in support of epa.we consider the sierra club challenges in section ii and nla in section iii.
ii.sierra club petition 
pm and floors 
relying on chevron natural resources defense council,d establishing that when congress intent is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress,the sierra club argues that the agency approach conflicts with the clean air act plain language.according to the sierra club,section d requires epa to set new source floors at the lowest recorded emission level for which it has data and existing source floors at the average of the lowest twelve percent of recorded emission levels for which it has data.nothing in the statute,the sierra club argues,permits the agency to set floors based on the performance of technology as opposed to the recorded performance of plants.
in resolving this issue,we do not write on a clean slate.epa approach to setting new source emission standards has already faced and survived a chevron one challenge.in sierra,we reviewed a new source emission standard for solid waste combustion that epa promulgated pursuant to section,which establishes emission requirements virtually identical to section.there,as here,the sierra club argued that epa mact technology approach to setting emission standards is unambiguously forbidden by the clean air act.sierra rejected that argument,holding that epa may estimate the performance of the best performing units and that it was not impossible that epa methodology constituted a reasonable estimation technique.see at.concluding that epa could reasonably interpret the statutory phrase emissions control that is achieved in practice to mean emissions control that is achieved under the worst foreseeable circumstances,see id.citing national lime ass epa,we hypothesized perhaps considering all units with the same technology is justifiable because the best way to predict the worst reasonably foreseeable performance of the best unit with the available data is to look at other units performance.id.at.but because epa failed to explain why it adopted the mact approach,we remanded to the agency for further explanation,thus never needing to determine whether the mact approach would have survived petitioners chevron two or arbitrary and capriciousness challenges.
epa has now explained why it adopted the mact approach.in the announcement of the regulations challenged in this case,the agency,citing sierra,explains that it must ensure that emission standards are achievable under the most adverse circumstances which can reasonably be expected to recur,june,quoting sierra,at,and that evaluating how a given mact technology performs is a permissible means of estimating the actual performance of the top twelve percent of plants.id.epa explains further that the emission standards it set are based on the emission levels achieved through the application of mact floor technologies and account for variation in the process and in the air pollution control device effectiveness.id.at.
the sierra club does not challenge epa extension of sierra to existing source standards.instead,it argues that sierra chevron one analysis does not control this case because section at issue here differs from section at issue in sierra.although the two sections contain identical stringency requirements for new sources,section,the sierra club emphasizes,directs the agency to base emission standards for existing sources on those plants for which the administrator has emissions information,d a,a limitation appearing nowhere in section.see id.a.according to the sierra club,section additional limitation implies that epa must directly calculate the average of the best twelve percent from the data it has,thus precluding the agency from estimating emissions based on the use of mact technology.
we do not agree that the difference between the two sections requires a different result in this case.section additional phrase says nothing about what data the agency should use to calculate emission standards.it says only that standards must be based on the best performing sources for which the administrator has emissions information.d a.following this directive,epa set standards for pm and at the average emission levels it estimated the best percent for which it had information achieved.in doing so,the agency simply did not limit itself to consideration of data from the best twelve percent of plants instead,it used data it had from other plants that use the same technology as the best twelve percent to estimate the performance of the best twelve percent.sierra found this approach not unambiguously forbidden by the statute.see at.
thus bound by sierra chevron one analysis,we turn to the sierra club argument that the mact approach is both unreasonable,see chevron,at.if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute,and arbitrary and capricious.see d a.according to the sierra club,epa has never explained why emission floors set through the mact approach accurately estimate the performance of the relevant best performing plants the agency provide d absolutely no reason to believe that an emission level that is achievable by every source that uses a particular control technology is necessarily a reasonable estimate of the actual performance of the best performing twelve percent of sources.sierra club br.at.
we agree that to comply with the statute,epa method of setting emission floors must reasonably estimate the performance of the relevant best performing plants.see d sierra,at.yet the sierra club brief does not explain why the emission standards epa set might not accurately estimate the performance of the best performing twelve percent of plants.the brief never even suggests that the mact approach in fact fails to predict the emission levels of the best performing sources.when we asked about this at oral argument,it became clear that the sierra club believes that epa mact approach would not accurately estimate emission levels of the best performing twelve percent of plants if the best performing plants achieved their emission levels not just by using technology,but also by selecting cleaner manufacturing inputs.for example,the best performing twelve percent of plants might perform well because,in comparison to other plants having the same technology,they use fuels or purer raw materials.such plants would have predictably lower emissions than plants using mact floor technology alone.under such circumstances,the sierra club argues,because technology would represent only one of the factors determining emission levels of the best performing plants,epa could not assume that emission levels from the plant using mact floor technology predict the performance of the best performing plants under the worst conditions.
although this argument may well have merit,the sierra club failure to include the argument in its opening brief precludes us from considering it.see corson gruman nlrb.claiming only that the agency has never explained why the mact approach accurately predicts the performance of the relevant best performing sources falls far short of alerting epa to the argument we now understand the sierra club to be making,thus giving the agency no opportunity to respond.the sierra club failure is particularly serious because the mact approach would accurately estimate the performance of the best performing sources of a particular hap if pollution control technology were the only factor determining emission levels of that other words,if emissions were unaffected by the use of either alternative fuels or raw materials.to be sure,as the sierra club points out in a letter submitted after oral argument pursuant to rule j of our rules,it did raise its multiple control factors argument during the rulemaking in a comment regarding emission standards for mercury.record comments,however,can not cure a failure to raise a key argument here.we will therefore deny the sierra club petition for review with respect to emission floors for pm and.
failure to set floors for hcl,mercury,and total hydrocarbons 
epa established emission floors of no control for hcl,mercury,and total hydrocarbons a surrogate for organic haps other than because the agency found no cement plants using control technologies for these pollutants.the sierra club argues that epa failure to set emission limits for these haps violates the statute requirement that the agency establish emission standards for each of the hazardous air pollutants listed for regulation.d.defending its decision,epa points to sierra suggestion that the worst foreseeable performance of the best performing unit might be predictable from the performance of the worst performing unit using the same technology.see.at citing sierra,at.according to epa,if no control technology exists,then the worst foreseeable performance could vary day by day and the standard must be no control.see epa response to comments may,at.
on this issue,we agree with the sierra club.nothing in the statute even suggests that epa may set emission levels only for those listed haps controlled with technology.to the contrary,the statute lists over one hundred specific haps,b,and requires epa to promulgate regulations establishing emission standards for each category or subcategory of major sources of hazardous air pollutants listed for regulation.id.d.the statute directs the agency to promulgate these emission standards by november.id.e e.congress added the list of pollutants to be regulated,regulation deadlines,and minimum stringency requirements to the clean air act precisely because it believed epa had failed to regulate enough haps under previous air toxics provisions.the air toxics law has worked poorly.in years,epa has regulated only some sources of only seven chemicals the legislation reported by the committee would entirely restructure the existing law,so that toxics might be adequately regulated by the federal government,at see also,pt,at since,epa has listed only eight substances as hazardous air pollutants and has promulgated emissions standards for seven of them.
contrary to epa argument,nothing in sierra relieves it of the clear statutory obligation to set emission standards for each listed hap.although sierra permits the agency to look at technological controls to set emission standards,see at,it does not say that epa may avoid setting standards for haps not controlled with technology.
although we thus believe that section d language disposes of this issue,we add that our reading of that section is reinforced by the clean air act legislative history.a report by the senate committee on environment and public works states 
the technologies,practices or strategies which are to be considered in setting emission standards under this subsection go beyond the traditional treatment or abatement system.the administrator is to give priority to technologies or strategies which reduce the amount of pollution generated through process changes or the substitution of materials less hazardous.pollution prevention is to be the preferred strategy wherever possible.
for all of these reasons,the absence of pollution control devices for hcl,mercury,and total hydrocarbons did not excuse epa from setting emission standards for those pollutants.we thus will remand for epa to do so.
the sierra club presents a number of objections to epa refusal to set general emission standards for mercury,total hydrocarbons,and hap metals for which pm is a surrogate.because epa will now need to initiate new rulemaking proceedings to establish emission floors for mercury and total hydrocarbons,we need not consider the agency refusal to set standards for those two haps.we address only the sierra club challenge to the agency refusal to set standards for hap metals.
when determining whether to set standards,the clean air act requires epa to consider the cost of achieving such emission reduction,and any quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements.d.the sierra club argues that epa violated the statute by failing to consider the quality health and environmental impacts of potential standards for hap metals.again,we agree.although epa considered costs and energy requirements,nowhere in the record does it appear to have taken account of any quality health effects.
epa analysis of potential standards for hap metals suffers from a second defect.as the sierra club points out,epa,responding to a comment in the rulemaking suggesting that stricter emission standards for hap metals could be achieved if cement kilns switched to natural gas,asserted that t here are no data available to epa that indicate that fuel switching can or has achieved metals emission reductions.yet a study in the record contains just such information,demonstrating that switching to natural gas would in fact reduce metal emissions.see office of air quality planning and standards,epa,study of hazardous air pollutants emissions from electric utility steam generating units.epa now tells us that fuel switching is not a viable alternative because of inadequate supplies of natural gas.in support of this proposition,the agency points to a handwritten notation on a report in the administrative record.but that note,supposedly written by an epa employee,is virtually the agency counsel was unable to decipher it at oral argument.therefore,the note can not supply a basis for epa decision.although the agency brief cites one other study in support of its assertion that the supply of natural gas is inadequate,nothing in the rulemaking indicates that epa relied on it.a n agency action must be upheld,if at all,on the basis articulated by the agency.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.
thus,because epa failed to consider quality health and environmental impacts of potential standards for hap metals,and because it relied on a factually incorrect assertion in rejecting such standards,we will remand the determination for hap metals for further consideration consistent with this opinion.in view of the sierra club request that we not vacate the epa regulations,because to do so would at least temporarily defeat sierra club purpose,the enhanced protection of the environment,environmental defense fund,adm r of the epa,we will leave the current pm regulations in place during remand.
monitoring 
in its final challenge,the sierra club argues that the regulation monitoring requirements fail to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with the emission standards.specifically,it argues that the opacity monitoring required by the regulation will not guarantee compliance with the pm standard.epa responds that opacity monitoring promotes good operation and maintenance,which in turn reasonably ensure compliance with the pm standard.because the sierra club has given us no basis for doubting this assertion,and because analysis of this issue requires a high level of technical expertise,we must defer to the informed discretion of the agency.marsh oregon natural resources council,d internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.petition of the national lime association 
petitioner national lime association nla claims that two additional aspects of the portland cement rule are contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious the epa use of pm as a surrogate for hap metals,and its requirement that cement kilns use a specified technique to measure their hcl emissions under certain circumstances.we consider these arguments only after concluding that the nla has standing to raise them.
standing of the nla 
the epa argues that the nla lacks standing to object to the portland cement rule because it is a trade association of lime and not of cement manufacturers.although the epa recognizes that some nla members manufacture both cement and lime,the agency asserts that the nla made no mention of its cement members during proceedings before the agency,suggesting only that the portland cement rule could establish adverse precedents for the commercial lime industry.the epa also emphasizes that nla members that manufacture both lime and cement are also members of the american portland cement association apca,the view of the represents their cement interests.the apca,as mentioned above,has intervened in this case in defense of the portland cement rule.
the epa cites no we know of that the position taken by one association affects the right of another to seek judicial review and although the possibility of an adverse precedent is clearly insufficient to establish the injury necessary for standing under article iii,an association anxious to avoid an adverse precedent may still bring a petition if it otherwise meets the requirements for standing.those requirements are straightforward 
a n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when a its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right b the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose and c neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.
hunt washington state apple advertising comm n,d.that the nla meets requirement c is unquestioned.in order to prevail on the standing question,then,the epa must show that the nla fails to meet requirement a or b.
requirement a is met if any one of the association members can make out a justiciable case.warth seldin,d.the member must show i that it was injured in fact,ii that its injury was caused by the challenged rule,and iii that its injury would likely be redressed by a favorable decision of the court.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the nla submits an affidavit from the environmental director of blue circle,affirming that blue circle is an nla member,stating that it operates both cement and lime manufacturing plants,and asserting facts indicating that it meets all three elements of requirement a.blue circle asserts both that the use of pm as a surrogate and the hcl measurement requirement impose significant monitoring and compliance costs upon its cement operations,which would be avoided by this court favorable decision.blue circle specific assertions as to harm,causation,and redressability are neither general nor conclusory,as the epa suggests.we conclude,therefore,that the nla has at least one member that could assert a justiciable claim in its own right.
beyond injury in fact,causation,and redressability,requirement b of hunt demands that the interest an association seeks to protect be germane to the organization purpose.at.this requirement of germaneness is undemanding mere pertinence between litigation subject and organizational purpose is sufficient.humane soc y hodel.the subject of this litigation is the regulation of portland cement manufacturing that is certainly pertinent to the nla as a trade association of manufacturers of lime.not only do some companies manufacture both cement and lime,but both industries share a critical raw lime itself is sometimes used as an ingredient in portland cement.see.at oates,lime and limestone.the processes underlying the two types of manufacture are also similar,as is made abundantly clear by the nla efforts to introduce into the record in this case data from the epa administrative record regarding the manufacture of lime.op.at below.the two manufacturing processes also emit some of the same pollutants.the regulation of portland cement thus falls well within the specialized expertise and research resources of the nla.humane soc y,at.
our analysis of germaneness is unaffected by the epa argument that the nla,in advancing its lime interests,has taken a position on the cement rule adverse to the interests of cement manufacturers.the nla is entitled to be an advocate for a subgroup of cement manufacturers whose interests diverge from those of the run of cement example,companies such as blue circle that manufacture both cement and lime.national maritime union commander,military sealift command,quoted in humane soc y,at mere fact of conflicting interests among members of an association does not of itself defeat the association standing to urge the interests of some members in litigation,even though success may harm the legal interests of some members.
because the nla has at least one member that could have pressed the same claims in its own right,and because those claims are germane to the organizational purpose of the nla,we conclude that the association has standing to petition for review of the portland cement rule.
b.the use of pm as a surrogate 
the nla primary objection to the portland cement rule is that it limits pm emissions from cement kilns instead of regulating emissions of hap metals individually.the epa justifies its decision to regulate pm as a surrogate for nonvolatile hap metals by noting first that pm generated by cement kilns invariably contains hap metals,so that preventing the emission of a unit of pm necessarily prevents the emission of some quantum of hap metals.using pm as a surrogate thus achieves exactly the same level of hap metal emissions limitation as would be reached were the metals to be regulated directly.the agency also states that the mact floor equipment and level of control for hap metals is identical to that for pm.finally,the agency notes that the use of a surrogate eliminates the cost of performance testing to comply with numerous standards for individual metals.at.
the epa may use a surrogate to regulate hazardous pollutants if it is reasonable to do so.see dithiocarbamate task force epa,epa may attribute characteristics of a subclass of substances to an entire class of substances if doing so is scientifically reasonable nrdc epa,epa may regulate pollutant indirectly when its emissions are controllable by regulation of other pollutants.even a reasonable surrogate,of course,may not be used where doing so would be otherwise contrary to law.the nla does not challenge the legality of surrogacy in general,but does maintain that in this case the use of pm as a surrogate is both contrary to law and unreasonable.
legality of using a criteria pollutant as a surrogate 
the nla argues first that the epa may not use pm as a surrogate for hap metals because pm is a criteria of several ubiquitous pollutants that the epa regulates by establishing national ambient air quality standards naaqs under of the clean air act.the provision authorizing the epa to regulate haps in the clean air act is limited by the qualification that no criteria air pollutant may be added to the list of regulable haps.id.b.the nla argues that although surrogates for haps are permissible in general,using a criteria pollutant as such a surrogate has the effect of regulating that pollutant as a hap through the back door and thus illicitly supplementing or even supplanting the naaqs applicable to that pollutant.
the epa suggests first that the nla interpretation is inconsistent with the stated expectation of the congress that hap metals might be regulated under the clean air act by way of a pm surrogate,but the agency point is not.the epa relies principally upon a report accompanying senate bill,a version of which would ultimately become the clean air ac
