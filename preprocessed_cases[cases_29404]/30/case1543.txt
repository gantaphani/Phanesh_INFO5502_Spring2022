the migratory bird treaty act mbta,extends protection to all birds covered by four migratory bird treaties,which,in relevant part,define migratory birds to include the family anatidae.congress has delegated authority to the secretary of interior secretary to implement the treaties covered by the mbta.see.under this authority,the secretary has published lists of protected migratory birds.
the instant case arose when appellant joyce hill filed a law suit pro se in district court claiming that the secretary regulation violated the mbta in excluding mute swans from the list of migratory birds promulgated at.the district court rejected hill claim and granted summary judgment in favor of the secretary.hill now appeals from that adverse judgment.
the disposition of this case is very nearly governed by chevron step one.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.this is so because the plain meaning of the statute and the applicable treaties strongly indicates that mute swans are qualifying migratory birds under the mbta.we hesitate,however,to decide this case on chevron step one grounds,because of the odd regulatory scheme created by the mbta which refers to four different treaties to glean a single substantive definition of migratory birds and the absence of any agency pronouncement on the specific issue before the court.we therefore assume,arguendo,that the disputed agency action is not positively foreclosed by the plain meaning of the statute.
even indulging in such an assumption,however,the secretary position fails under chevron step two.the secretary points to nothing in the mbta,treaties,or administrative record to support the exclusion of mute swans from the list of migratory birds.and the statute and relevant treaty support hill claim that mute swans should be included on the list.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court on hill mbta claim,grant judgment for appellant,and vacate the secretary list of migratory birds,codified at,insofar as the list excludes mute swans.we affirm the judgment of the district court rejecting hill complaint resting on the national environmental policy act nepa.we agree with the trial court that the nepa claim is meritless.
background 
mute swans 
mute swans scientifically titled cygnus olor are undisputed members of the family anatidae.mute swans in the united states probably descend from european birds introduced for ornamental purposes beginning in the century.michael ciaranca,et,mute swan,the birds of north america.mute swans generally do not migrate long distances,making only seasonal movements to find water.id.at.they are highly territorial and can treat other species with direct antagonism.id.at.indeed,the government claims that mute swans occupy habitat and consume food used by migratory,endangered,and threatened species.keith weaver decl,reprinted in joint appendix.there is also information to suggest that mute swans cause ecological damage as an exotic,feral species,the mute swan effects on native ecosystems are a concern.potential effects range from overgrazing aquatic vegetation to displacing native waterfowl.ciaranca,supra,at.see also mem.from rowan gould,acting director of fish and wildlife service,to regional directors,reprinted in if uncontrolled,mute swans pose a serious threat to the ecological integrity of many areas,including the national wildlife refuge system and other federal lands committed to the maintenance of natural wildlife diversity.
generally,state governments have assumed responsibility for the management of mute swan populations.recently,however,department of the interior doi officials at the blackwater national wildlife refuge secured a permit from the maryland department of natural resources to kill up to mute swans per year.doi officials claim to have taken only ad hoc measures to control mute swan populations,and they assert that no concerted effort to eradicate mute swans from any refuge has been undertaken by the fish and wildlife service.ronald lambertson decl,reprinted in.
statutory and regulatory background 
the mbta states that,
u nless and except as permitted by regulations made as hereinafter provided in this subchapter,it shall be unlawful to pursue,hunt,or kill any migratory bird included in the terms of the conventions between the united states and great britain on behalf of canada,the united states and the united mexican states,the united states and the government of japan,and the united states and the union of soviet socialist republics.
the mbta does not define migratory bird but merely refers to the treaties for a definition.the secretary,however,has declared that 
migratory bird means any bird,whatever its origin and whether or not raised in captivity,which belongs to a species listed in.
section,in turn,lists all species of migratory birds protected by the mbta.the only swans on the list of migratory birds in are trumpeter,tundra,and whooper swans.the secretary regulations do not explain why mute swans are excluded from the list of migratory birds.
the four treaties to which the mbta refers each provide different definitions of covered birds.the treaty with great britain the canada treaty broadly defines migratory birds to include anatidae or waterfowl,including brant,wild ducks,geese,and swans.convention for the protection of migratory birds,art.i,a,stat.the proclamation to the canada treaty refers to birds that migrate across national borders 
whereas,many species of birds in the course of their annual migrations traverse certain parts of the united states and the dominion of canada and 
whereas,many of these species are of great value but are nevertheless in danger of extermination through lack of adequate protection during the nesting season or while on their way to and from their breeding grounds.
id.canada and the united states amended the treaty with a protocol that revised the definition of migratory birds to include anatidae,or waterfowl ducks,geese and swans.protocol amending the convention for the protection of migratory birds in canada and the united states,art.i,treaty doc.
the treaty with mexico also defines migratory birds broadly to include familia anatidae.convention for the protection of migratory game birds and game mammals,art.iv,stat.the introductory proclamation to the mexico treaty refers to migratory birds without regard to their origin 
whereas,some of the birds denominated migratory,in their movements cross the united states of america and the united mexican states,in which countries they live temporarily 
whereas it is right and proper to protect the said migratory birds,whatever may be their origin,in the united states of america and the united mexican states,in order that the species may not be exterminated.
the treaty with japan defines migratory birds more specifically 
a the species of birds for which there is positive evidence of migration between the two countries from the recovery of bands or other markers and 
b the species of birds with subspecies common to both countries or,in the absence of subspecies,the species of birds common to both countries.the identification of these species and subspecies shall be based upon specimens,photographs or other reliable evidence.
convention for the protection of migratory birds and birds in danger of extinction,and their environment,art.ii.the japan treaty also contains an annex that specifically lists species defined as migratory birds.id.at art.ii,a.the only swan identified in the annex is the whooper swan,cygnus cygnus.id.at annex.
finally,the treaty with the soviet union defines migratory birds as 
a the species or subspecies of birds for which there is evidence of migration between the soviet union and the united states derived as a result of banding,marking or other reliable scientific evidence or 
b the species or subspecies of birds,populations of which occur in the soviet union and the united states and have common flyways or common breeding,wintering,feeding,or moulting areas,and for these reasons there exists or could exist an exchange of individuals between such populations.the identification of such species or subspecies will be based upon data acquired by banding,marking,or other reliable scientific evidence.
convention concerning the conservation of migratory birds and their environment,art.i.similar to the japan treaty,the soviet union treaty includes an annex listing species by name.only three swan species whooper,bewick,and whistling swans are listed in the annex.id.at annex.
the first regulations implementing the mbta simply imported the language of the canada treaty.see,dep t of,bureau of biological survey,service and regulatory announcements,defining migratory birds,in relevant part,as anatidae or waterfowl,including brant,wild ducks,geese,and swans.after a few rounds of statutory changes that placed regulatory authority with the president and the secretary of interior,the president,by executive order,delegated sole authority to the secretary to promulgate regulations under the mbta.see exec.order.june.the secretary initially maintained the established definition of migratory birds.see.
in,the secretary issued a notice of proposed rule making which sought to,among other things,further clarify and define the term migratory birds by adding a requirement that birds be indigenous to the united states.these regulations were adopted in,see.june,but the indigenous requirement was.two years later,the secretary amended the mbta regulations by adding a definition of migratory birds that did not include the indigenous requirement.see.july,printing new.this new definition did not,however,replace the old definition,thus leaving the regulations with two different definitions of migratory birds.
these dual definitions remained in place until,when the secretary deleted and changed the definition of migratory birds to include 
all birds,whether or not raised in captivity,included in the terms of the migratory bird conventions between the united states and any foreign country.
the secretary also published a list of covered migratory birds,f or reference purposes only.id.at.the only swans included on the final list were the trumpeter and whooper swans.see.
the secretary proposed revised regulations in that added a different qualification to the list of migratory birds.see,june.the operative definition of migratory birds remained the same,but the secretary proposed to a dd species that are of regular occurrence in the united states that were not included on the last list,and also to d elete species whose occurrence in the united states is deemed accidental,the is outside the species normal range and occurrence is infrequent and irregular.id.the secretary adopted these changes,see,and the regulations remained in effect until this lawsuit was filed.
procedural background 
appellant hill,appearing pro se,filed a complaint in district court on july,which was amended on july.her principal claim was that the secretary failure to include the mute swan on the list of migratory birds protected under the mbta was arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act apa.on september,the district court granted summary judgment for the federal defendants.the trial court rejected the defendants argument that hill lacked standing to pursue her claim.on this point,the district court found that the federal defendants failure to protect the mute swan under the mbta is causally linked to the diminished presence of the swan in and about hill property on the eastern shore of maryland,that the decline in mute swans reduces hill aesthetic enjoyment of her property,and that the decline will be ameliorated if federal defendants include the bird under the mbta.hill babbitt,civ.act,slip op.at.on the merits,the trial court found that the treaties underlying the mbta impose conflicting obligations,thus creating an ambiguity in the mbta with regard to whether mute swans must be included on the list of protected migratory birds.faced with this purported ambiguity,the district court held that agency deference is the most plausible alternative and granted judgment for the federal defendants.id.at.the trial court also ruled against hill on her nepa claim,holding that she had introduced nothing to support the contention that the government was obliged to conduct an environmental impact statement eis under the nepa.id.at.hill filed a notice of appeal on november.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
the secretary no longer challenges hill standing to pursue her claims in federal court,and with good reason.there is no doubt that the district court was correct in holding that hill satisfies the standing requirements of article iii.see friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,toc,d environmental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened by the challenged activity.quoting sierra club morton,d wabash valley power ass n,ferc,holding that if injury is traceable to agency decision and a favorable decision by the court will nullify the action that gave rise to injury,then plaintiff has satisfied causation and redressability requirements of article iii standing.
because the mbta does not create a private right of action or otherwise provide a process for judicial review,the secretary disputed failure to include the mute swan on the list of migratory birds can only be challenged by hill under the apa.though the apa does not directly grant subject matter jurisdiction to the federal courts,see califano sanders,d,challenges brought under the apa fall within the reach of the general federal jurisdiction statute.road sprinkler fitters local union herman.
as hill notes,
this case primarily presents the question whether the mute swan cygnus olor is a member of the family anatidae as that phrase is used in two treaties between the united states and,respectively,the united kingdom on behalf of canada and mexico,and hence are covered as a protected species under the migratory bird treaty act mbta,et.the department of the interior has excluded mute swans from a regulatory list of species that it deems protected by the mbta.such exclusion has led to numerous adverse actions including killing and egg destruction against mute swans,thus injuring those who,like plaintiff,derive immense aesthetic and cultural value from the presence of mute swans in our environment.
the case presents the further question whether the conduct of the federal defendants adverse to mute swans constitutes major federal action requiring preparation of an environmental impact statement eis pursuant to the national environmental policy act nepa.c.
br.for appellant at.the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under to hear these claims,and this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.we will address the two disputed issues in turn.
b.the mbta and the treaties 
the mbta covers all migratory birds,as defined by the four cited treaties with canada,mexico,japan,and the soviet union.the government concedes that the most restrictive treaty definition of migratory birds,the one found in the canada treaty governs the disposition of this case.see alaska fish wildlife fed dunkle,cir holding that t he united convention is the most restrictive of the four treaties,and all of the secretary regulations must be in accord with that treaty.the government also concedes that under the literal terms of the most restrictive treaty the canada treaty swans,without limitation,are migratory birds and therefore presumptively within the protected class.furthermore,government counsel acknowledged at oral argument that,because of the seasonal movements of some mute swans across the border,mute swans are undoubtedly migratory birds.finally,no party doubts the authority of the secretary,under of the mbta,to issue regulations that create and refine lists of migratory birds,such as the list promulgated at.the only mbta issue before this court,therefore,is whether the secretary was justified in excluding the mute swan from the list of migratory birds.
under the familiar chevron analysis,the reviewing court must first exhaust the traditional tools of statutory construction to determine whether congress has spoken to the precise question at issue.bell atl.fcc,quotations and citations om
