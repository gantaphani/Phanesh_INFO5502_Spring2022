native ecosystems council native ecosystems appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to the united states forest service forest service in connection with the forest service approval of the jimtown vegetation project jimtown project in the helena national forest.to lower the potential for a catastrophic fire,the jimtown project involves thinning,prescribed burning,and weed management on approximately acres in an area of the helena national forest prone to high intensity fires.
native ecosystems claims the forest service violated the national environmental policy act nepa et,by preparing an environmental assessment ea instead of an environmental impact statement eis and by considering only two proposed jimtown project and a no action alternative.in addition,native ecosystems claims the forest service violated the national forest management act nfma,et,because the project threatens the viability of the northern goshawk we affirm.
background 
the helena national forest encompasses nearly one million acres in western montana.the forest service manages the helena national forest according to the helena forest plan.see a.parts of the helena national forest consist of dry ponderosa pine stands,and are characterized by the forest service as fire dependent ecosystems.over the past ninety years,however,the forest service suppressed fires in this ecosystem,leading to what it describes as dense stocking and intense competition for moisture and nutrients on these sites.in the forest service view,prevention of,periodic fires has led to an increase in the likelihood of large,fires.because forests are more dense,fires spread from small understory trees to the crowns of the older overstory trees,rather than burning at a on the floor and understory of the forest.
due to nearly a century of fire suppression,the forest service has witnessed an increase in wildfires in the northwest.in december,the forest service published an ea for the jimtown project,a resource management project in the helena national forest designed to reduce the potential for a,high intensity,fire in the jimtown vicinity.according to the forest service,a fire in the vicinity of the jimtown july cave gulch fire which burned more than acres of the helena national the area potential for intense and extensive stand replacing fires.the jimtown project,as originally proposed,consisted of forest thinning through timber harvest,underburning,and weed management,all of which are intended to provide for a more sustainable forest.
the proposed jimtown project lies just yards north of a nest area used by a pair of northern goshawks in the summers of and.the forest service has designated goshawks as a sensitive species a designation that requires the forest service to prepare a biological evaluation to consider the potential impact of proposed forest management actions on the goshawks.
the forest service completed a biological evaluation for the jimtown project,and concluded that the project m ay impact individuals or habitat but is unlikely to contribute to a trend towards federal listing or cause a loss of viability to the population or species.in particular,the proposed jimtown project would open up acres of forest habitat,making it less attractive to goshawks for foraging.the biological evaluation also concluded that the primary threat to goshawks is loss of habitat due to logging and fire.the biological evaluation noted that an e levated risk of fire would remain if the forest service decided to forego the jimtown project,putting existing goshawk habitat in the area at risk.the jimtown project ea incorporated the biological evaluation goshawk findings.
the helena national forest plan also designated goshawks as a management indicator species for forest in the helena national forest.forest service planning regulations direct the forest service to select management indicator species for the purpose of monitoring the effects of management activities in various types of habitat.a,the forest plan requires the maintenance of five percent of the helena national forest as old growth.the jimtown project does not include any old growth,but the ea emphasized that the forest service will retain larger trees and trees with old growth character,and suggested that the jimtown project would contribute to the development of a sustainable forest in the project area.
after considering comments filed in response to the jimtown project ea,including comments filed by native ecosystems,the forest service issued a decision notice and finding of no significant impact in may.in the,the forest service partially rested its decision not to prepare an eis on the fact that the forest service prepared an eis in for a substantially similar and larger management project in the helena national project.the project was located about four miles north of the jimtown project and applied the same treatment techniques to an area more than the size of the jimtown project area.the forest service noted in the that environmental monitoring associated with the project demonstrated that the type of treatments proposed in the jimtown project do not have significant effects.in particular,the forest service concluded based on wildlife monitoring that goshawks continued to nest in the vicinity of the project after the project treatments.
the also included an amendment to the helena national forest plan.the project area,whether the forest service implements the jimtown project or opts for the alternative,is out of compliance with the helena national forest plan hiding density standard designed to protect big game the proposed amendment reduces the hiding density standard applicable to the project area by three percent,thus curing.
native ecosystems filed an administrative appeal challenging the,which the forest service denied.in october,native ecosystems filed suit in federal court in montana.in july,while the case was pending in district court,a wildfire burned portions of the jimtown project area.acres burned in the jimtown fire,and approximately eighty percent of the trees died or were expected to die within the year following the fire.the fire burned about acres of the acres proposed for thinning and underburning in the proposed jimtown project.the forest service published a supplemental information report sir that concluded that the jimtown fire,and the subsequent reduction of the thinning and underburning portion of the project to acres,did not change its conclusion that the jimtown project would not have a significant effect on the environment.
the district court granted the forest service motion for summary judgment.with respect to the claims pending on appeal,the district court rejected native ecosystems claim that the forest service violated nepa by failing to consider reasonable alternatives to the jimtown project in addition to the ea no action alternative and the proposed project alternative the district court also determined that the forest service did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in concluding that the jimtown project would not impact goshawk viability under nfma and in concluding that an eis was not necessary to consider the impacts of the project on the goshawk population.

ii.nepa claims 
nepa requires agencies to prepare an eis for all major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.nepa implementing regulations provide that an agency shall prepare an ea to determine whether a proposed federal action will have a significant impact and to determine whether preparation of an eis will be necessary.see also bob marshall alliance hodel,cir.an ea is a concise public document that include s brief discussions of the need for the proposal,of alternatives as required by e,of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives,and a listing of agencies and persons consulted.a,b.if the agency concludes in the ea that there is no significant effect from the proposed project,the federal agency may issue a finding of no significant impact fonsi in lieu of preparing an eis.a id.finding of no significant impact means a document by a federal agency briefly presenting the reasons why an action will not have a significant effect on the human environment and for which an environmental impact statement therefore will not be prepared.
nepa requires us to analyze whether the forest service took a hard look at the likely effects of the proposed jimtown project.blue mountains biodiversity project blackwood,cir.in other words,the forest service must undertake a thorough environmental analysis before concluding that no significant environmental impact exists.id.determining whether the forest service took the requisite hard look is judged against the apa arbitrary and capricious standard.id.
preparation of an environmental assessment rather than an environmental impact statement 
native ecosystems seeks to compel the forest service to prepare an eis,rather than simply an ea,for the jimtown project.an agency is required to prepare an eis where there are substantial questions about whether a project may cause significant degradation of the human environment.see idaho sporting congress,at.as we have explained 
in reviewing an agency decision not to prepare an eis under nepa,we employ an arbitrary and capricious standard that requires us to determine whether the agency has taken a hard look at the consequences of its actions,based its decision on a consideration of the relevant factors,and provided a convincing statement of reasons to explain why a project impacts are insignificant.

in benchmarking whether the jimtown project may have a significant effect on the environment,we turn to the nepa regulations that define significantly.whether a project is significant depends on both the project context and its intensity.id.a project intensity will be evaluated based on various factors,three of which are relevant to native ecosystems appeal t he degree to which the effects on the quality of the human environment are likely to be highly controversial,id.b t he degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks,id.b and w hether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts,id.b.
forest service conclusion of no significant impact 
native ecosystems seeks to capitalize on the forest service thorough and candid environmental analysis by seizing on various bits of information and data in the jimtown project nepa documents the ea,sir and biological evaluation to claim that substantial questions exist as to whether the jimtown project may have a significant effect on the environment.the biological evaluation and acknowledged that the jimtown project may impact individual goshawks and their habitat,but determined that this impact was not significant.
the presence of negative effects regarding the impact of the jimtown project on goshawks or even information favorable to native ecosystems position in the project nepa documents,however,does not mean native ecosystems has demonstrated that the jimtown project impacts are highly controversial or highly uncertain.a project is highly controversial if there is a substantial dispute about the size,nature,or effect of the major federal action rather than the existence of opposition to a use.blue mountains,at quoting sierra club forest,cir.further,in explaining the highly uncertain standard,we stated 
an agency must generally prepare an eis if the environmental effects of a proposed agency action are highly uncertain.preparation of an eis is mandated where uncertainty may be resolved by further collection of data,or where the collection of such data may prevent speculation on potential effects.the purpose of an eis is to obviate the need for speculation by insuring that available data are gathered and analyzed prior to the implementation of the proposed action.
national parks,at alteration in original citations omitted quoting sierra club,at.
the use of the word highly in the nepa regulations to modify controversial and uncertain means that information merely favorable to native ecosystems position in the nepa documents does not necessarily raise a substantial question about the significance of the project environmental effects.rather,as our explanation of the nepa regulations makes clear,something more must exist for this court to label a project highly controversial or highly uncertain.simply because a challenger can cherry pick information and data out of the administrative record to support its position does not mean that a project is highly controversial or highly uncertain.
under native ecosystems theory,any information included in an ea and its supporting nepa documents that admits impacts on wildlife species and their habitat would trigger the preparation of an eis.not only would such a standard deter candid disclosure of negative information,it does not follow that the presence of some negative effects necessarily rises to the level of demonstrating a significant effect on the environment.we decline to interpret nepa as requiring the preparation of an eis any time that a federal agency discloses adverse impacts on wildlife species or their habitat or acknowledges information favorable to a party that would prefer a different outcome.nepa permits a federal agency to disclose such impacts without automatically triggering the substantial questions threshold.in short,nepa requires us to determine whether the forest service took a hard look at the environmental consequences of a proposed action.
a hard look should,of course,involve the discussion of adverse impacts.a hard look does not dictate a soft touch or of negative effects.but such information does not automatically make the project highly controversial or highly uncertain for the purposes of determining whether substantial questions exist as to the significance of the effect.we turn then to native ecosystems various claims that substantial questions exist as to whether the jimtown project may have a significant effect on the environment.
goshawk habitat components 
native ecosystems asserts that as to the goshawks,the project is highly controversial and highly uncertain because the forest service failed to abide by a forest service report,management recommendations for the northern goshawk in the southwestern united states reynolds report.according to native ecosystems,the ea failed to address the reynolds report goshawk habitat recommendations pertaining to old growth,family areas,and canopy cover.this argument fails because the forest service referenced the reynolds report multiple times in the various jimtown nepa documents and specifically addressed each of these habitat recommendations.
although the reynolds report recommends maintaining a certain percentage of old growth in a goshawk home range,it is significant that no old growth exists in the project area.as a result,the jimtown project is not capable of negatively impacting the old growth component of the jimtown goshawk home range.it can hardly be said that a controversy or uncertainty exists under these circumstances.more pointedly,native ecosystems concern that the forest service fails to demonstrate in the ea that it has set aside sufficient old growth habitat for goshawks ignores the very purpose of the jimtown of a landscape that permits large trees to mature into old growth.the explained that o ne of the goals of the project is to create a stand structure that will allow to develop on the site over the long term and remain intact in the face of fire,an objective that precisely meets native ecosystems concern.
both the biological evaluation and cite the reynolds report habitat designations,including the nesting,and foraging area acreage recommendations,and discuss their impact at length before concluding that the jimtown project will not deprive the nearby goshawk home ranges of these necessary components.native ecosystems complains that the forest service failed to specifically delineate a family area to be preserved around the and goshawk nest stand yards from the jimtown project area.the biological evaluation and establish that the forest service took a hard look at the available family area habitat in the vicinity of the jimtown project.indeed,the forest service response to native ecosystems comments underscores our conclusion that the forest service took a hard look and fairly considered the reynolds report habitat recommendations 
t he area proposed for thinning is not good family area habitat 
the key unburned habitat needed to sustain breeding and provide core family areas for young goshawks is in the dense,mature forest in the nest stand itself and in other such stands spread across north and north east slopes south and west of the project area.these stands are outside the proposed thinning area.as a result,the best habitat contributing to local family areas will be retained,and goshawks will be able to continue fledging young in the nest stand.
finally,native ecosystems urges that the forest service failure to disclose the canopy closure in the area before and after the project makes the impact of the project on goshawk habitat highly uncertain.although the nepa documents did not specify percentages of canopy cover in the same manner as delineated in the reynolds report,the forest service did not ignore the impact of changes to canopy closure in the project area.nothing in the law or the science mandates wholesale adoption of the details of the reynolds report.ultimately,while the forest service concluded that the project would reduce suitable habitat by about acres,due in part to reduced canopy cover as a result of the thinning component of the project,the project would leave intact sufficient acreage to provide for resident acres of mostly forested habitat.
the forest service goshawk habitat analysis and consideration of the reynolds report demonstrate the project is neither highly controversial nor highly uncertain.native ecosystems effort to identify conflicts between the jimtown project and the reynolds report does not raise substantial questions that would trigger the need for an eis.in fact,as the reynolds report explained,current forest conditions put the existing goshawk habitat in jeopardy and thus the proposed thinning and burning would actually be necessary to sustain goshawks and their prey.the situation of the goshawk is a reality not a fiction.while the reynolds report outlines ideal goshawk habitat conditions,including optimum,and canopy cover prescriptions,the report also recognizes that fires wipe out these critical habitat components in their entirety.the proposed jimtown project seeks to balance the sometimes conflicting goshawk habitat needs as outlined in the reynolds report,and thereby makes a reasoned and reasonable choice between the competing goals of preserving the goshawk current habitat and promoting a sustainable,habitat for the goshawk.
impact on goshawk prey 
native ecosystems also contends substantial questions are raised by the uncertain effects of the jimtown project on red squirrels,which serve as prey for the goshawk.in support of this challenge,native ecosystems seizes on the conclusion in the ea that certain species,including the red squirrel,would decline in the project area as a result of the changed habitat.native ecosystems reads the ea as saying that red squirrel populations would suffer a sharp decline as a result of the project.the ea statement is much less dramatic in context 
the abundance of several species would decline as a result of proposed changes in habitat structure,but it is unlikely that any species would disappear.species that would suffer the sharpest population declines are those tied to the denser stands of mature trees and to the thickets of seedling and sapling conifers.these animals would shift primarily to unthinned reserves in and adjacent to the project area.species likely to decline are the kinglet,warbler,nuthatch,red squirrel,porcupine,and brown creeper.
the identification of potential declines does not permit us to leap to the conclusion that the ea raises substantial questions on project impact,especially where the ea also concluded that the thinned stand would continue to provide prey for goshawks 
overstory thinning would reduce the density of red primary prey make the project area less inviting to foraging goshawks.the thinned stand would continue to support a variety of suitable prey species hairy woodpeckers,mourning doves,robins,townsend solitaires and local goshawks might continue to exploit it.
where other prey species will be available,native ecosystems focus on the red squirrel does not demonstrate that the project effects are highly uncertain.
reliance on the eis 
native ecosystems challenges the forest service reliance on the project eis as a demonstration that the jimtown project will not have a significant effect on the environment.the project was simply a larger version of the same type of fuels reduction project proposed for the jimtown area.the forest service prepared an eis for,which was incorporated by reference into the jimtown documentation.in concluding that an eis was not necessary for the jimtown project,the forest service observed that the proposed management practices were not unique and that monitoring of other projects,particularly the nearby project,documented that such projects did not have significant effects.
native ecosystems points to a forest service monitoring log to conclude,based on a lack of goshawk sightings in the project area after,that the project somehow eliminated goshawks resident in the project area prior to the thinning.the forest service offers a very different interpretation of the log,noting that field monitoring showed that goshawks in the area change nest sites each year regardless of logging activity and that goshawks are not averse to occupying nest sites close to logged areas.further,according to the forest service,the monitoring data demonstrates that thinning can be done in a way that will not eliminate local goshawk territories,but that large stand replacement fires will eliminate them.citations to administrative record omitted.we defer to the forest service explanation of the log.
native ecosystems tries to create a facade of high controversy by citing to comments submitted by sara jane johnson,a wildlife biologist and representative of native ecosystems.johnson concluded the monitoring log demonstrated that the project eliminated a pair of goshawks.when specialists express conflicting views,an agency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable opinions of its own qualified experts even if,as an original matter,a court might find contrary views more persuasive.marsh oregon natural res.council,d.the forest service conclusion that the project did not have a significant effect on goshawks and their habitat and its reliance on this conclusion in the jimtown ea and was not arbitrary and capricious.
in summary,the forest service consideration and application of the reynolds report goshawk habitat recommendations in its nepa documentation defeats native ecosystems attempt to characterize the jimtown project impacts as highly uncertain or controversial.johnson interpretation of the reynolds report and goshawk monitoring data simply does not rise to the high level of controversy that was present in other ninth circuit cases where we faulted the agency review.see sierra club,at noting testimony from numerous experts that demonstrate the inadequacies of an ea blue mountains,at explaining that a forest service ea failed to consider a report on logging despite the specific directions of the regional forest supervisor to do so national parks,at noting that percent of comments received during administrative review opposed the ea preferred alternative.nor will we take sides in a battle of the experts,id.at,as the forest service considered and applied the reynolds report and provided a thorough and reasoned explanation for its rejection of johnson position.
cumulative effects analysis 
although we conclude that the challenges to the jimtown project ea withstand scrutiny,our analysis does not end there.in determining whether an action is significant for the purposes of preparing an eis,an agency must consider whether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts.b the regulations further provide 
significance exists if it is reasonable to anticipate a cumulatively significant impact on the environment.significance can not be avoided by terming an action temporary or by breaking it down into small component parts.
id.in accord with the regulatory directives,the forest service offered extensive analysis of the cumulative impacts of the jimtown project.a review of the reveals an articulate and careful cumulative effects analysis that took into consideration the impacts of the cave gulch fire,the north hills fire,two minor thinning projects,and the project.the recognized that within the cumulative effects as goshawk home ranges exist,and within each home range,the forest service identified the necessary components of goshawk habitat.the then detailed,from a quantitative perspective,the impact of the project on nest sites and acreage suitable as goshawk habitat.the forest service concluded the jimtown project impact on the immediate goshawk home range will not cause it to fall below the reynolds report acreage recommendations for nesting,family,and foraging areas,let alone result in a cumulatively significant effect when considered in light of other recent projects and fires in this area of the helena national forest.because significant evidence in the record supports the forest service conclusion that the goshawk home range will remain viable under the jimtown project,we conclude that the forest service easily satisfies the standard we articulated in neighbors of cuddy mountain i to consider cumulative effects,some quantified or detailed information is required.without such information,neither the courts nor the public,in reviewing the forest service decisions,can be assured that the forest service provided the hard look that it is required to provide.at 
consideration of range of alternatives 
nepa requires federal agencies to study,develop,and describe appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action in any proposal which involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.e.the alternatives provision of nepa applies whether an agency is preparing an eis or an ea,and nepa implementing regulations require an ea to include brief discussions of the need for the proposal,of alternatives as required by e,of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives,and a listing of agencies and persons consulted.b see also bob marshall alliance,at a ny proposed federal action involving unresolved conflicts as to the proper use of resources triggers nepa consideration of alternatives requirement,whether or not an eis is also required.in short,nepa requires that alternatives be given full and meaningful consideration.bob marshall alliance,at.
native ecosystems discredits the jimtown ea as insufficient because it did not consider a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed project.native ecosystems argument is confusing.in one breath,native ecosystems faults the forest service for failing to consider a range of that its concern is with the number of alternatives considered by the forest service.in the next breath,native ecosystems faults the forest service for failing to consider an alternative to the jimtown project that would comply with the helena national forest forest that its concern is with the substance of the alternatives considered by the forest service.
if native ecosystems is simply concerned with the number of alternatives considered by the forest service in the jimtown project ea,native ecosystems claim fails.the forest service jimtown project ea considered a total of six alternatives,four of which were raised but rejected without detailed consideration.of the six proposed alternatives,two no action alternative and the preferred alternative the proposed jimtown project were the focus of the ea and given detailed consideration by the forest service.native ecosystems ignores the four alternatives dismissed by the agency,and contends that the ea development of only two alternatives failed to meet nepa requirements.
nepa and its implementing regulations only require the following with respect to the number of alternatives that must be considered by an agency the agency must consider appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action,e an eis must r igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives and must explain why it has eliminated an alternative from detailed study,a emphasis added the agency must consider a no action alternative,id.d and the agency must designate a preferred alternative,id.e.the statutory and regulatory requirements that an agency must consider appropriate and reasonable alternatives does not dictate the minimum number of alternatives that an agency must consider.
to the extent that native ecosystems is complaining that having only two final action and a preferred the regulatory scheme,a plain reading of the regulations dooms that argument.so long as all reasonable alternatives have been considered and an appropriate explanation is provided as to why an alternative was eliminated,the regulatory requirement is satisfied.in short,the regulation does not impose a numerical floor on alternatives to be considered 
nor have we previously imposed a numerical requirement as the bellwether of reasonableness.rather,the substance of the alternatives has been a focus,not the sheer number of alternatives considered.see muckleshoot indian tribe forest,cir noting that the forest service failed to consider an adequate range of alternatives because its eis included a no action alternative and two nearly identical action alternatives,none of which were more consistent with the agency basic policy objectives than the alternatives that were the subject of final consideration.see also land exch.project dombeck,d,concluding that the forest service met its statutory obligations where it had considered and dismissed six alternative plans that did not meet the purpose and needs of the proposed project.
we turn now to the substance of the alternatives considered by the forest service,and the potential alternatives raised by native ecosystems,to determine whether the forest service considered appropriate and reasonable alternatives under nepa.in undertaking this analysis,we join our sister circuits in holding that an agency obligation to consider alternatives under an ea is a lesser one than under an eis.in rejecting any alternatives,the agency must only include brief discussions of the need for the proposal,of alternatives required by e,of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives,and a listing of agencies and persons consulted.b.see.nebo prop.prot.ass fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir the rigor with which an agency must consider alternatives is greater when the agency determines that an eis is required for a particular federal action.sierra club espy,cir same friends of the ompompanoosuc fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir same.
in judging whether the forest service considered appropriate and reasonable alternatives,we focus first on the stated purpose for the jimtown project.see idaho conservation league mumma,cir benchmarking whether an alternative is reasonable,and should have been considered by the forest service in its ea or eis,depends on the nature and scope of the proposed action quoting california block,cir.the purpose and need section of the ea states 
the purpose is to maintain healthy,sustainable ecosystems that reduce fire risk,control noxious weeds and provide native habitats similar to the habitat that existed when fire was a natural component of the ecosystem,and provide wood for people use.
alternatives that do not advance the purpose of the jimtown project will not be considered reasonable or appropriate.see westlands water dist.dep t of interior,cir the range of alternatives that must be considered in the eis need not extend beyond those reasonably related to the purposes of the project.quoting laguna greenbelt,dep t of,cir.
according to native ecosystems,the forest service did not consider a reasonable range of alternatives because it failed to consider an alternative that would fully comply with the current helena national forest plan.native ecosystems first claims the forest service should have considered an alternative that did not involve commercial harvest as part of the thinning portion of the jimtown project native ecosystems goes on to argue the forest service should have considered in detail an alternative that did not require amendment of the helena national forest plan hiding density standard,but instead,included treatment measures designed to move the project area into compliance with the forest plan hiding density standard.
the ea preferred alternative proposes to offer the commercial sale of any marketable timber from the thinning component of the jimtown project.the project area is designated as a livestock grazing area under the helena national forest plan,which provides timber harvest may be used as a tool to improve forage production in designated livestock grazing areas.however,forested land is classified as unsuitable for timber management.native ecosystems insistence that this designation prevents a commercial timber harvest in the jimtown project area is a misinterpretation of the plan,which does not prohibit commercial timber harvest on the project timber management.timber management is defined as the purposeful growing,tending,harvesting,and regeneration of regulated crops of trees to be cut into logs,bolts or other round sections for industrial or consumer use.
the forest service will not engage in timber management in the jimtown project area if it adopts the ea preferred alternative.rather,the forest service would be thinning to reduce fire risk a service contractor will be permitted to sell any commercially viable small trees taken during the thinning.these actions do not amount to timber management in violation of the helena national forest plan.the forest service persuasively points out that whether or not the preferred alternative involved a commercial sale component,the environmental impacts of the project are the same a commercial component does not affect the project design because the project focuses on fuels reduction and not on profitability the availability of commercial timber is simply a collateral benefit to the government and does not change the purpose or scope of the project.native ecosystems has not persuaded us that the forest service ignored a reasonable alternative.
native ecosystems also asks us to invalidate the ea because the forest service did not consider an alternative that would not require an amendment of the helena national forest plan hiding density standard this challenge does not make sense in the context of the jimtown project.the project was conceived in an effort to address the increased vegetation resulting from fire suppression.the objective is to remove excess fuels and reduce the potential for fires that could ultimately wipe out any hiding cover.increasing hiding cover conditions will lead to an inevitable wildfire,a condition that might obliterate all hiding cover for the long term.as the forest service noted while continued exclusion of fire can allow for development of dense sapling understories and thereby provide hiding cover for a period,these conditions are clearly not sustainable over time.consequently,the forest service determined that sustaining some cover over time is preferable to losing a large percentage of it in a single event.see akiak native cmty.postal,cir observing that it makes no sense for the postal service to consider alternatives that do not promote the goal of improving efficiency when the agency purpose is to accomplish one thing.quoting city of angoon hodel,cir per curiam.when the purpose of the jimtown project is to reduce fire risk,the forest service need not consider alternatives that would increase fire risk.
native ecosystems proposed alternative also would have been redundant.the makes clear that if native ecosystems wanted an alternative that did not involve amending the helena national forest plan and moved the project area closer to compliance with the current hiding density standard,it got no action alternative.nepa does not require federal agencies to consider alternatives that are substantially similar to other alternatives.see westlands water,at nor is an agency required to undertake a separate analysis of alternatives which are not significantly distinguishable from alternatives actually considered,or which have substantially similar consequences.quoting headwaters,bureau of land,cir.
we are not persuaded by native ecosystems reliance upon muckleshoot indian tribe to support its demand for a no forest plan amendment alternative.in muckleshoot,we faulted the forest service for failing to consider an alternative that was more consistent with its basic policy objectives than the alternatives that were the subject of final consideration.at.
in light of native ecosystems failure to raise substantial questions that demonstrate the jimtown project may have a significant effect on the environment,the forest service consideration of a no action alternative and its preferred alternative met its statutory and regulatory duty to prepare appropriate alternatives for the jimtown project ea.
iii.national forest management act claims 
nfma creates a process for the management of our national forests.neighbors of cuddy mountain i,at.the forest service must first develop a land resource management plan forest plan for each unit of the national forest system.f.for individual management actions within a forest unit,all relevant plans,contracts,or permits must be consistent with each forest overall management plan.id.i.
in addition,nfma imposes substantive requirements on the forest service management of the national forests.neighbors of cuddy mountain i,at.nfma requires that forest plans provide for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area.g b.the forest service nfma regulations further require 
fish and wildlife habitat shall be managed to maintain viable populations of existing native and desired vertebrate species in the planning area.for planning purposes,a viable population shall be regarded as one which has the estimated numbers and distribution of reproductive individuals to insure its continued existence is well distributed in the planning area.in order to insure that viable populations will be maintained,habitat must be provided to support,at least,a minimum number of reproductive individuals and that habitat must be well distributed so that those individuals can interact with others in the planning area.
the duty to ensure viable populations applies with special force to sensitive species.inland empire pub.lands council forest,cir.
native ecosystems claims the forest service failed to comply with the substantive wildlife requirements of the nfma.specifically,native ecosystems claims the forest service failed to ensure goshawk viability,in violation of the nfma,by failing to discuss goshawk population trends and the impacts the jimtown project would have on goshawk viability and population trends the helena national forest plan designated goshawks as a management indicator species and the forest service considers the goshawk to be a sensitive species.as a result,native ecosystems contends the forest service had a substantive duty under nfma to ensure goshawk viability before approving a project that would impact goshawk habitat.
although native ecosystems admits that the fores
