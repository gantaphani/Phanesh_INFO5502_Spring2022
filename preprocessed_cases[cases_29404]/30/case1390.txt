defendant great lakes appeals the judgment against it in a suit for damages brought by the united states under the national marine sanctuaries act for damage to the florida keys marine sanctuary caused by a grounded tugboat and dredge pipe.the government concerns the district court ruling that no primary restoration is required for the grounding site.we affirm the district court decision on liability,but we vacate a portion of the damages award,specifically that no action is the best alternative for addressing damage at the grounding site.we remand for further factual findings regarding this question.
in may,great lakes dredge dock company great lakes hired coastal marine towing coastal to tow lengths of dredge pipe and other equipment from boca grande to green cove on the east coast of florida.coastal supplied two tugs,captain joe and miss necie and their crews.great lakes supplied two assist tugs,volunteer state and cavalier state.
while proceeding through the florida keys national marine sanctuary,one of the pipes in a raft towed by miss necie dragged the sea bottom creating a pipe scar approximately miles long.
the following facts caused grounding site damage which is the subject of this appeal.due to a navigational error by miss necie,the flotillas got off course and captain joe ran aground in seven feet of water trying to pass miss necie.great lakes assist tug,cavalier state,was tied to the captain joe.sanctuary and state officials helped devise a plan to extricate captain joe.at high tide,captain joe was powered off the bank by a combination of its own motor and the cavalier state.the grounding left behind a channel meters long,eight to ten meters wide and two meters deep.the grounding destroyed square meters of sea bottom,consisting of turtle grass,manatee grass and finger coral.the boats also created a large hole,or blowhole,meters long by nine meters wide.
the united states brought this action on behalf of the department of commerce,national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa under the national marine sanctuaries act nmsa of,as amended,for the destruction caused by the grounding of the sanctuary resources,primarily seagrasses,in the marine sanctuary.the state of florida also filed a complaint against defendants,which was consolidated with the federal case.the first day of trial,coastal settled its claims with the united states and the state of florida for.the settlement satisfied florida claims against great lakes as well,and florida is not a party to this appeal.the state of florida did file an amicus brief in support of the united states positions concerning liability and damages,but argues only liability.
after an bench trial in april,the district court granted in part and denied in part the relief sought by the government.the court ruled in favor of the united states on liability,finding that great lakes was strictly liable under the nmsa for all damages to the sanctuary.regarding damages,the government sought compensation for implementation of both its primary restoration plan and its compensatory plan.
under the primary restoration component of damages,the government is entitled to recover the cost of implementing its plan to restore or replace the injured resource,or the cost of acquiring the equivalent of the sanctuary resource,if it can not be restored or replaced.see a.both the government and great lakes agreed that the pipe scar recovered on its own in three years,so the damage caused is not a part of this appeal.as for the grounding site,the government proposed a plan to use imported sediment to fill and restore the grounding site,one of three alternative primary restoration plans considered by the government.the district court determined that another plan,the no action plan for the primary restoration of the grounding site was appropriate,but that the should recover the cost of physical and biological monitoring of the site.
the district court also held that the government was entitled to damages for compensatory restoration,which is compensation for the interim lost use of the resources at the pipe scar and grounding site during the period from destruction to recovery.see a.recovery for lost interim services is in the form of seagrass restoration projects at other suitable locations within the sanctuary.the district court determined that the prop scar restoration program developed by the government is an appropriate compensatory restoration project that would provide seagrass services equivalent to those lost due to the injuries caused by great lakes at both the grounding site and the pipe scar.the court also held that the government reliance on the habitat equivalency analysis hea was appropriate to scale the compensatory seagrass restoration project.based on these determinations,the district court awarded to the government,its response and assessment costs compensatory and monitoring costs and permitting and supervision costs.the district judge required the government to recalculate the appropriate damages by simple mathematical computations based on its findings of fact.on march,the district court entered final judgment against great lakes in the amount of,the figure after setting off the settlement amount paid by coastal.
on appeal,great lakes argues the district court erred in finding great lakes liable to the united states because suit by the united states not authorized under common law great lakes was not vicariously liable for coastal actions,and the method used to assess restoration was faulty.on,the united states argues the district court erred in approving no action as the primary restoration plan for the grounding site.
ii.applicable statutory provisions.
the national marine sanctuaries act governs the designation and management of federally protected marine areas of special significance.congress enacted the nmsa in response to the increasing degradation of marine habitats and in recognition of the need to protect marine ecosystems.see,sess,reprinted in.the nmsa confers authority for the designation and management of marine sanctuaries on the secretary of commerce,who has delegated these responsibilities to the noaa.
the nmsa imposes civil liability on any person who destroys,causes the loss of or injures any sanctuary resource.
the attorney general,at the request of the secretary,may commence an action against any person or vessel who is liable for response costs and damages.c.response costs include costs of actions taken to minimize the destruction of sanctuary resources.damages include compensation for the cost of restoring,replacing,or acquiring the equivalent of a sanctuary resource and the interim loss value of the resource pending restoration damage assessment costs,and reasonable monitoring costs.
iii.discussion.
whether the national marine sanctuaries act authorizes damages to the united states government for injuries to sanctuary resources.
at the outset,we reject great lakes argument that the government has no claim for damages in this case because the property at issue is and the united states therefore has no proprietary interest.see robins dry dock repair flint.this argument belies the express language and scheme of the relevant statutes.on november,congress enacted the florida keys national marine sanctuary act the sanctuary act,stat,which designated nautical miles of coastal water in the florida keys as the florida keys national marine sanctuary.the sanctuary act provides that t he sanctuary shall be managed and regulations enforced under all applicable provisions of the nmsa as if the sanctuary had been designated thereunder.sanctuary act,a.in this case,the united states seeks damages from defendants for a violation of of the nmsa,which imposes strict liability for damage or injury to any sanctuary resource.see,united states jacquelyn,cir a.the nmsa plainly authorized the united states to recover the damages it seeks for injuries to seagrass resources.the nmsa explicitly provides,any person who destroys,causes the loss of,or injures any sanctuary resources is liable to the united states for an amount equal to the sum of the amount of response costs and damages resulting from
