in april,a particularly cold month in a dry year,young salmon were found to have been fatally stranded along banks of the russian river stream system,which drains sonoma and mendocino counties.federal scientists concluded the deaths were caused by abrupt declines in water level that occurred when water was drained from the streams and sprayed on vineyards and orchards to prevent frost damage.following a series of hearings and the preparation of an environmental impact report,the state water resources control board board adopted a regulation that is likely to require a reduction in diversion of water from the stream system for frost protection,at least under certain circumstances.the regulation itself contains no substantive regulation of water use,instead delegating the task of formulating regulatory programs to local governing bodies composed of the diverting growers themselves.the regulation declares that any water use inconsistent with the programs,once they have been formulated and approved by the board,is unreasonable and therefore prohibited.the trial court granted a writ of mandate invalidating the regulation on several grounds.we reverse.
foremost among plaintiffs grounds for challenging the regulation is their contention the board lacks the regulatory authority to limit water use by riparian users and early appropriators,whose diversion is beyond the permitting authority of the board.although the board has no authority to require such users to obtain a permit to divert,there is no question it has the power to prevent riparian users and early appropriators from using water in an unreasonable manner.we conclude that,in regulating the unreasonable use of water,the board can weigh the use of water for certain public purposes,notably the protection of wildlife habitat,against the commercial use of water by riparian users and early appropriators.further,the board may exercise its regulatory powers through the enactment of regulations,as well as through the pursuit of judicial and proceedings.because this is a facial challenge,our ruling is a narrow one,grounded in the general authority of the board we have no occasion to rule on the validity of any particular substantive regulation that might be approved by the board in the process of implementation.
we also conclude the board properly found the regulation to be necessary to enforce water use statutes and did not unlawfully delegate its authority by requiring local governing bodies to formulate the substantive regulations.finally,we find no error in the board certification of the environmental impact report.
background 
the stream system of the russian river is home to three species of salmon classified as either threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act of et.the river and its tributaries,which flow to the sea through mendocino and sonoma counties,contain over miles of potential salmon habitat.in late fall and winter,adult salmon enter the river from the ocean,swim upstream,and lay eggs in gravel on the streambed.the eggs typically hatch in late winter,and the fry emerge from the gravel after four to eight weeks and move to shallow water,typically near the margins of the stream.here the young salmon,known as salmonids,spend several months,moving into deeper water as they mature 
in april,when unseasonably cold weather followed an exceptionally dry winter,the national marine fisheries service fisheries service discovered two episodes of fatal strandings of salmonids in the mainstem russian river and a tributary stream.strandings occur when salmonids in shallow areas of the watercourse are left without water or are trapped in isolated pools.there is evidence suggesting the problem is not necessarily one of low water levels per se,but of sudden decreases in water level,which allow the salmonids insufficient time or opportunity to seek the protection of deeper water.because the salmonids spend their time in shallower water near the stream banks,they may be particularly susceptible to such sudden decreases.extrapolating from the available limited data,the fisheries service reached a coarse but conservative estimate that some salmonids had been killed throughout the stream system in the april events.
the fisheries service blamed the strandings,in large part,on agriculturalists,especially grape growers,located along the system.the watershed of the russian river is home to over acres of vineyards,of which percent are within feet of salmonid habitat.grape plants are particularly susceptible to frost damage when new growth appears in the spring.the newly emerged vegetation is delicate,and a freeze can result in substantial crop loss.a method of preventing frost damage is to spray the new growth with water,which by freezing on the plants insulates them against the colder air.if a number of growers anticipating a frost all draw their water directly from a stream at the same time,the net effect can be a sudden decrease in the volume of flowing water.the problem occurs both because the growers diversion of water is effectively synchronized all growers in a threatened area must at the same time and because the overhead sprayers necessary for frost protection consume relatively large quantities of water.examining data for march through may,the fisheries service found an association between air temperatures and sudden and substantial drops in the flow of a stream in the system 
in a letter,the fisheries service urged the board to undertake regulatory activity to reduce the risk of frost salmonid deaths.although the fisheries service pointed the finger at growers,other factors were potentially involved.most obviously,the affected area of the stream system is downriver of two large reservoir lakes created by the coyote and warm springs dams.the pace of water release from these dams directly affects the level of water in the system.following the discovery of the stranding deaths,the agency responsible for controlling the release of water from the dams,the sonoma county water agency scwa,experimented with anticipatory releases of water to counteract the effects of frost protection diversion.the scwa concluded such releases were impractical,given the long time,up to hours,necessary for the released water to reach the more distant portions of the stream system and the difficulty in predicting frost events,which gave rise at times to wasteful false alarm releases.in addition,the coordinated nature of the frost protection diversions made it difficult to counteract their impact.the scwa told the board additional anticipatory releases would be ineffective in preventing the sudden drawdowns.
on the other hand,while protecting sensitive crops from frost is of critical commercial importance,the practice can be managed to reduce the immediate demand on stream flows.growers can minimize their use of sprayed water by precisely targeting truly threatened acreage,and better frost forecasting and temperature monitoring can avoid unnecessary sprayings.many growers have constructed basins to collect water at times of high stream flow.drawing water from such basins or from wells,rather than directly from the stream system,serves the same frost protection purpose without an immediate impact on stream flow.in addition,there are alternative methods,such as wind machines,heaters,and cold air drains,that will work under certain circumstances to protect against frost damage.
following the discovery of salmonid deaths,the fisheries service formed a task force and attempted to organize voluntary efforts to reduce the impact of frost protection on the stream system.while it praised the efforts of participating growers,the fisheries service eventually concluded the problem could not be managed through voluntary efforts.the submitted proposals for voluntary action generally did not address diversion in the tributary streams of the river,where the problem was most acute,and the inability to compel the compliance of all growers with a voluntary plan made success unlikely.based on the fisheries service experience,the board concluded voluntary efforts would not solve the problem.
following a series of public hearings and the preparation of an environmental impact report,in september the board adopted a regulation addressing diversion for frost protection,codified as california code of regulations,title,section hereafter regulation.regulation applies to any diversion of water from the russian river stream system for purposes of frost protection from march through may.regulation,subd.a.the section contains no substantive regulation of water diversion for the purpose of frost protection,instead delegating the development of such regulation to water demand management program s wdmp.regulation is silent as to how and by whom the wdmp are to be developed,but they must be administered by an individual or governing body capable of ensuring that the requirements of the program are met,subd.b.the parties reasonably assume the wdmp will be created by groups of agricultural diverters,who will act as the governing bodies.each wdmp must be submitted annually to the board for approval.ibid.
as described in regulation,the fundamental functions of the wdmp are to develop and implement methods for monitoring the stage,or height,of the affected watercourses,determining when that stage poses a threat to young salmon,and responding with corrective actions to reduce a threat once detected,subds.b,c.among other requirements,the wdmp must contain an inventory of potential diverters within the area subject to the wdmp,including diverters who declined to participate,a stream stage monitoring program,and a plan for managing frost protection diversion to prevent strandings,subds.c.
regarding potential corrective actions,regulation,subdivision c states if the governing body determines that diversions for purposes of frost protection have the potential to cause stranding mortality,the governing body shall notify the diverter s of the potential risk.the governing body,in consultation with the diverters,shall develop a corrective action plan that will prevent stranding mortality.corrective actions may include alternative methods for frost protection,best management practices,better coordination of diversions,construction of offstream storage facilities,stream gage and diversion monitoring,or other alternative methods of diversion in developing the corrective action plan the governing body shall consider the relative water right priorities of the diverters 
once a program has been developed and approved,t he diverters shall implement corrective actions in accordance with the corrective action plan,or cease diverting water for frost protection.regulation,subd.c.reinforcing this ban,regulation declares,the diversion of water in violation of this section,including the failure to implement the corrective actions included in any corrective action plan developed by the governing body,is an unreasonable method of diversion and use and a violation of water code section,and shall be subject to enforcement by the board,subd.e.
in the resolution adopting regulation,the board stated the portion of the regulation requiring corrective actions would not be implemented immediately.instead,the resolution establishes a schedule allowing for the collection and analysis of baseline data during the first two and a half years following adoption.
regulation was challenged in two petitions for a writ of mandate filed in mendocino and sacramento counties.the mendocino county action was filed by rudolph light and linda light,owners of acres of vineyard in the affected area that are crossed by a stream from which the lights draw water for purposes of irrigation and frost protection.the sacramento county action was filed by a grower association,three individuals,and a limited partnership the sacramento plaintiffs,all of whom either grow grapes in the affected area or have members who do so both petitions alleged,for a variety of reasons,that regulation would unlawfully interfere with plaintiffs use of water drawn from the russian river stream system.the petitions were consolidated for decision in mendocino county superior court.in february,the trial court stayed enforcement of regulation pending resolution of the litigation.
the trial court later entered a page decision finding the board action unlawful on the following grounds the board exceeded its authority in adopting a regulation that limited the use of water by riparian users the regulation violated the rule of priority,which governs the manner in which insufficient water is divided among users the regulation improperly delegated regulatory authority to the wdmp and the declaration of necessity for the regulation was not supported by substantial evidence.given its ruling,the trial court initially declined to rule on plaintiffs claims under the california environmental quality act pub.resources code,et ceqa,but in a subsequent order the court found several flaws in the environmental impact report prepared in connection with regulation.the court entered judgment directing issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate requiring the board to set aside its certification of the environmental impact report and its adoption of regulation.
the board has appealed the trial court judgment.
ii.discussion 
legal background 
we begin with a summary of four areas of law that converge in the resolution of plaintiffs claims.
california dual system of water rights and the rule of priority 
ownership of california water is vested generally in the state residents,but individuals and entities can acquire water rights,the right to divert water from its natural course for public or private use.see generally united states state water resources control bd.d,united states.california maintains a dual system of water rights,which distinguishes between the rights of riparian users,those who possess water rights by virtue of owning the land by or through which flowing water passes,and appropriators,those who hold the right to divert such water for use on noncontiguous lands.el dorado irrigation dist.state water resources control bd.th,el dorado.for historical reasons,california further subdivides appropriators into those whose water rights were established before and after post appropriators may possess water rights only through a permit or license issued by the board,and their rights are circumscribed by the terms of the permit or license.riparian users and pre appropriators need neither a permit nor other governmental authorization to exercise their water rights.california farm bureau federation state water resources control bd.cal th,farm bureau.inevitably,given the nature of the resource,water rights are limited and uncertain.the available supply of water is largely determined by natural forces.united states,at see also gray,the uncertain future of water rights in california reflections on the governor commission report mcgeorge,discussing factors creating uncertainty in the exercise and administration of water rights.
the differences between and among riparian users and appropriators become most pronounced when the available supply of water is inadequate to satisfy the needs of all those holding water rights.under the rule of priority,which governs diversion in such circumstances,the rights of riparian users are paramount.although riparian users must curtail their use proportionately among themselves in times of shortage,they are entitled to satisfy their reasonable needs first,before appropriators can even begin to divert water.united states,supra,d at.as a result,appropriators may be deprived of all use of water when the supply is short.in turn,senior appropriators those who acquired their rights first in time are entitled to satisfy their reasonable needs,up to their full appropriation,before more junior appropriators become entitled to any water.id.at pp.north kern water storage dist.kern delta water dist.th.
the rule of reasonableness 
water use by both riparian users and appropriators is constrained by the rule of reasonableness,which has been preserved in the state constitution since.cal,art.x,hereafter article x,section.article x,section was a direct response to a judicial decision,herminghaus south.california edison cal,in which the supreme court affirmed an injunction that prevented the diversion of san joaquin river water to southern california.the court reasoned there was no water to spare because riparian users of the river were entitled to receive its usual and ordinary flow,which the court found to include even its floodwaters,of which the users made little use.id.at.the constitution was amended two years later effectively to overrule herminghaus by adding what is now codified as article x,section.joslin marin mun.water dist.cal d,joslin.article x,section states,in relevant part the right to water or to the use or flow of water in or from any natural stream or water course in this state is and shall be limited to such water as shall be reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served,and such right does not and shall not extend to the waste or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use or unreasonable method of diversion of water.riparian rights in a stream or water course attach to,but to no more than so much of the flow thereof as may be required or used consistently with this section,for the purposes for which such lands are,or may be made adaptable,in view of such reasonable and beneficial uses cal,art.x.as the supreme court recognized soon after article x,section was added,the rule limiting water use to that reasonably necessary appl ies to the use of all water,under whatever right the use may be enjoyed.peabody city of vallejo cal d,peabody.the rule of reasonableness is now the overriding principle governing the use of water in california.people ex rel.state water resources control bd.forni d,forni.
california courts have never defined,nor as far as we have been able to determine,even attempted to define what constitutes an unreasonable use of water,perhaps because the reasonableness of any particular use depends largely on the circumstances.peabody,supra,cal d at.what may be a reasonable beneficial use,where water is present in excess of all needs,would not be a reasonable beneficial use in an area of great scarcity and great need.what is a beneficial use at one time may,because of changed conditions,become a waste of water at a later time.tulare dist.lindsay strathmore dist.cal d.in this regard,the joslin court commented,although,as we have said,what is a reasonable use of water depends on the circumstances of each case,such an inquiry can not be resolved in vacuo isolated from statewide considerations of transcendent importance.paramount among these we see the ever increasing need for the conservation of water in this state,an inescapable reality of life quite apart from its express recognition in article x,section.joslin,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted see similarly in re waters of long valley creek stream system cal d,it appears that the reasonableness of a riparian use can not be determined without considering the effect of such use on all the needs of those in the stream system citation,nor can it be made in vacuo isolated from statewide considerations of transcendent importance.few decisions have ruled on the reasonableness of a specific use of water,but in separate cases the supreme court has concluded,essentially as,that the use of water for the sole purpose of flooding the land to kill gophers and squirrels is unreasonable tulare,at,as is the use of floodwaters solely to deposit sand and gravel on flooded land joslin,at.
public trust doctrine 
existing alongside the rule of reasonableness is a second doctrine imposing at least a potential limit on private uses of water.as the supreme court has explained that doctrine,the state holds the navigable waterways in public trust for the benefit of state residents.national audubon society superior court cal d,audubon society.in audubon society,the plaintiffs challenged water use permits issued by the board that,by allowing the diversion of water from streams feeding lake mono,had resulted in an environmentally destructive decrease in the lake level.in declining to reconsider the permits,the board concluded it was required to allocate all available water for beneficial use by appropriators,notwithstanding the potential environmental harm such diversions would cause.id.at.the audubon society court required the board to reconsider the permits,taking into account the public trust doctrine.id.at pp.although the doctrine originally protected navigable waterways for the purposes of navigation,commerce,and fishing,audubon society extended the geographic scope of the doctrine to streams that feed navigable waterways,and it expanded the purpose of the doctrine to the preservation of water function as natural habitat.id.at pp,see center for biological diversity,fpl group,th,an important purpose of the public trust over bodies of water is to protect the habitat for wildlife.
in defining the role of the public trust doctrine in water rights policy,audubon society recognized that the public trust doctrine and the appropriative water rights system administered by the water board developed independently of each other.each developed comprehensive rules and principles which,if applied to the full extent of their scope,would occupy the field of allocation of stream waters to the exclusion of any competing system of legal thought.audubon society,supra,cal d at.in bringing the two together,the court held the doctrine prevents any party from acquiring a vested right to appropriated water in a manner harmful to the interests protected by the public trust the legislature,acting directly or through an authorized agency such as the water board,has the power to grant usufructuary licenses that will permit an appropriator to take water,even though this taking does not promote,and may unavoidably harm,the trust uses at the source stream and t he state has an affirmative duty to take the public trust into account in the planning and allocation of water resources,and to protect public trust uses whenever feasible.audubon society,at pp,fn.omitted.
the board was created as the state water commission in to administer the appropriation of water for beneficial purposes.as originally created,the board had the limited role of granting use rights to water that was not being applied to beneficial purposes and was not otherwise appropriated.audubon society,supra,cal d at.t he function of the water board was restricted to determining if unappropriated water was available if it was,and no competing appropriator submitted a claim,the grant of an appropriation was a ministerial act.ibid.the enactment of article x,section,however,radically altered water law in california and led to an expansion of the powers of the board.audubon society,at.through subsequent legislation and judicial decisions,the function of the water board has steadily evolved from the narrow role of deciding priorities between competing appropriators to the charge of comprehensive planning and allocation of waters.id.at.
as currently constituted,the board has been granted broad authority to control and condition water use,insuring utilization consistent with public interest.environmental defense fund,east bay mun.utility dist.cal d,ebmud.its enabling statute describes the board function as to provide for the orderly and efficient administration of the water resources of the state and grants it the power to exercise the adjudicatory and regulatory functions of the state in the field of water resources.in that role,the board is granted any powers that may be necessary or convenient for the exercise of its duties authorized by law,subd.a,including the power to make such reasonable rules and regulations as it may from time to time deem advisable.among its other functions,the board shall take all appropriate proceedings or actions before executive,legislative,or judicial agencies to prevent waste,unreasonable use,unreasonable method of use,or unreasonable method of diversion of water in this state.the board authority to prevent unreasonable or wasteful use of water extends to all users,regardless of the basis under which the users water rights are held.farm bureau,supra,cal th at.
validity of regulation 
in contending regulation is invalid,plaintiffs argue the board lacks the authority to enact regulations governing the unreasonable use of water,the board lacks the authority to limit the use of water by riparian and pre appropriators,and regulation improperly violates the rule of priority.whether a particular regulation is within the scope of authority conferred by the legislature on an administrative agency is a legal issue we review de novo.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,fn.southern california gas south coast air quality management dist.th.
the board authority to enact regulations governing the unreasonable use of water 
the board characterized the regulatory premise of regulation as follows a diversion of water that is harmful to salmonids is an unreasonable use of water if the diversion can be managed to avoid the harm.state water resources control,notice of preparation and public scoping meeting mem.in finding the board lacked the authority to enact regulation,the trial court recognized the board had regulatory authority over the unreasonable use of state waters.it held,however,that this authority was limited,at least as to riparian users,to pursuing enforcement actions in the courts against allegedly unreasonable users,rather than enacting regulations to preclude unreasonable use.
neither decisional law nor the governing statutes support the trial court limited vision of the board regulatory authority.as noted above,the board is charged with acting to prevent unreasonable and wasteful uses of water,regardless of the claim of right under which the water is diverted.farm bureau,supra,cal th at.the board authority to enact regulations in furtherance of this purpose was addressed and upheld nearly years ago in forni.in that case,the board had adopted a regulation,then codified as section of title of the california administrative code,which held,diversion of water from the napa river after march for frost protection except to replenish water stored in reservoirs prior to march is an unreasonable method of diversion within the meaning of article x,section and section of the water code.the regulation was motivated by a lack of adequate water to satisfy the frost protection demands of all users forni,supra,d at,fn.based on that regulation,the board brought an action to enjoin certain vineyard owners from drawing water from the river for purposes of frost protection.id.at.the defendants were granted summary judgment on the ground the board lacked the authority to prohibit or limit the use of water by riparian users.id.at.in reversing the trial court judgment invalidating the regulation,the court rejected the argument,made on several grounds,that the board lacked the authority to interfere with water use by riparian users.forni,at pp.the court then upheld the board power to enact a regulation governing reasonable use.without extensive discussion,the court concluded the board had not exceeded its authority in enacting the regulation because,p roperly construed,section amounts to no more than a policy statement which leaves the ultimate adjudication of reasonableness to the judiciary.id.at.
plaintiffs rightly point out that,despite forni refusal to invalidate the regulation,its resolution of the issue was not a ringing endorsement of the board power to enact regulations governing the unreasonable use of water.in effect,forni chose to treat the regulation as an advisory statement of policy that left to the courts the ultimate authority to determine whether a particular use of water was reasonable.forni,supra,d at.of course,to the extent the bald declaration of unreasonableness in former section constituted a valid policy statement under forni,regulation is similarly valid.at a minimum,forni holding would require a reversal of the trial court invalidation of the regulation on the issue of authority.
yet to the extent forni ruling was based on the implicit rationale that only the judiciary has the power to declare a particular water use unreasonable,we conclude forni construed the board authority too narrowly.subsequent judicial decisions have rejected the contention that the judiciary is vested with sole authority over unreasonable use,most forcefully california trout,state water resources control bd.d california trout.at issue in california trout was the validity of a use permit conditioned on compliance with a state statute requiring the owner of any dam to allow sufficient water at all times to pass around or through the dam,to keep in good condition any fish that may be planted or exist below the dam.fish.among other arguments,a plaintiff contended the legislature may not impose a categorical priority for one use of water because reasonableness of use requires comparison of contending alternative uses which is an adjudicative question that can not be constrained by a statutory rule.california trout,at.the court rejected the contention the legislature lacked the power to enact broad rules governing reasonableness,using an analogy to the doctrine of reasonable conduct in tort law.as the court explained,it is often asserted that w hat constitutes a reasonable use or method of diversion is ordinarily a question of fact.citation.actually,since what occurs is development of a standard of reasonableness on the facts of the case it should be described as a making of law for the particular case.citation.the typical example of such a process is determination of the standard of reasonable care in the law of tort.however,the fact that,ordinarily,the standard of reasonableness is fixed ad hoc does not impel the view that the legislature has no power to fashion rules concerning reasonableness,by enacting statutory safety obligations which become the basis of negligence per se.id.at.after analyzing the text and judicial construction of article x,section,the court concluded,there is broad legislative authority for the conservation and regulation of scarce water resources citation.that authority is sufficient to authorize the legislature to enact statutes which determine the reasonable uses of water.california trout,at.
if,as california trout holds,the legislature has the power to enact general rules governing the reasonable use of water,the board has a similar regulatory authority.the water code authorizes the board,in carrying out its statutory duty to administer the state water resources,to exercise the adjudicatory and regulatory functions of the state.in that role,the board is granted any powers that may be necessary or convenient for the exercise of its duties authorized by law,subd.a,including the authority to make such reasonable rules and regulations as it may from time to time deem advisable.given the board statutory charge to prevent waste,unreasonable use,unreasonable method of use,or unreasonable method of diversion of water in this state and the recognized power of the legislature to pass legislation regulating reasonable uses of water california trout,supra,d at pp,the board grant of authority to exercise the regulatory functions of the state necessarily includes the power to enact regulations governing the reasonable use of water.
the supreme court has recognized as much,describing the board regulatory authority in the broadest terms.the legislature,consistent with its authority under article x,section,has established a thorough statutory system insuring reasonable water allocation and safeguarding water purity,commensurate in scope with the constitutional provision.citation.the statutes vest the board with full authority to exercise the adjudicatory and regulatory functions of the state in the field of water resources.citations.it has been granted broad authority to control and condition water use,insuring utilization consistent with public interest.citation.this authority includes protection of the environment.citation.the board powers extend to regulation of water quality and prevention of waste.citations.it has adopted administrative regulations to prevent waste and unreasonable use.ebmud,supra,cal d at pp,italics added.while the ebmud decision did not address the validity of the regulations to which it referred,the court did not hesitate in recognizing them as an exercise of the board authority.see similarly audubon society,supra,cal d at we have discerned a legislative intent to grant the water board a broad,expansive authority to undertake comprehensive planning and allocation of water resources.
in arguing the board authority in this area is limited to enforcement actions,plaintiffs rely in part on the text of section,the statutory provision directly addressing unreasonable use,which instructs the board to take all appropriate proceedings or actions before executive,legislative,or judicial agencies to prevent waste,unreasonable use,unreasonable method of use,or unreasonable method of diversion of water in this state.conspicuously missing,plaintiffs contend,is any reference to the exercise of authority.while we acknowledge the absence,we do not construe section as a limitation on the board authority in the area of unreasonable use.as discussed above,the remaining provisions of the water code,as construed by decisional authority,vest in the board broad adjudicatory and regulatory power and suggest the board regulatory authority is coincident with that of the legislature.there is no reason to conclude the legislature intended the board to have less or restricted authority in enforcing the constitutional mandate of article x,section.
a contention similar to plaintiffs was rejected in imperial irrigation dist.state water resources control bd.d,in which the board conducted hearings,found the plaintiff failure to implement water conservation measures to constitute an unreasonable use of water,and ordered it to undertake various measures.id.at.on appeal,the plaintiff challenged the board authority to adjudicate the issue of reasonable use,contending the board was required by section to rely on the courts in carrying out its mandate to prevent the unreasonable use of water.after reviewing the various statutes conferring regulatory authority on the board,the court concluded section was intended to augment the board powers,rather than limit them no case has construed section as a limitation on the board adjudicatory power a case decided since the trial court hearing in this matter correctly cites section when viewed together with article x,section and section,as authority for the proposition the board has the separate and additional power to take whatever steps are necessary to prevent unreasonable use or methods of diversion.citation.section is not to be construed as a limitation on the board adjudicatory authority,but rather as a statute granting separate,additional power to the board.id.at pp.in the same manner,we conclude section does not limit the board authority under section to issue appropriate regulations.
particularly in these circumstances,there is a practical reason for recognizing the board authority to issue regulations.the problem addressed by regulation is the abrupt drop in stream levels that occurs when a large number of users simultaneously activate sprinklers that draw a large volume of water.no one doubts the use of sprinkled water to prevent crop frost damage is a beneficial one.whether it is also a reasonable use,the board has determined,depends upon whether the diversion can be managed to avoid the harm to salmonids.it appears that in many,or perhaps most circumstances,diversion for frost protection purposes from the russian river stream system is biologically harmless.yet on those occasions when it might be damaging,it has the potential to inflict damage on already fragile salmon populations.restricting the board to litigation deprives it of any effective regulatory remedy,since the damage will have been done and the critical circumstances may not arise again for months or years.it is difficult to imagine what effective relief a court could grant,other than a broad and inflexible injunction against future diversion for purposes of frost protection,a ruling that would be in the interests neither of the enjoined growers nor the public.efficient regulation of the state water resources in these circumstances demands that the board have the authority to enact tailored regulations 
regulation of riparian users and pre appropriators 
in contending the board exceeded its authority,plaintiffs also cite the exemption of riparian users and pre appropriators from the permitting authority of the board,farm bureau,supra,cal th at.while such users can not be required to obtain permits as a condition of exercising their right to divert,that does not mean their use of california waters is free from board regulation.n o water rights are inviolable all water rights are subject to governmental regulation.united states,supra,d.the supreme court recognized as much in farm bureau immediately after noting the board has no permitting or licensing authority over riparian rights,or over appropriative rights acquired before,the court observed the board does have authority to prevent illegal diversions and to prevent waste or unreasonable use of water,regardless of the basis under which the right is held.id.at,fns.omitted.that the board can not require riparian users and pre appropriators to obtain a permit before making reasonable beneficial use of water does not mean the board can not prevent them from making unreasonable use.any other rule would effectively read article x,section out of the constitution.
plaintiffs argue that regulation effectively imposes a permit requirement,since it conditions their use of water on compliance with standards developed by a wdmp.the argument proves too much,since its acceptance would preclude any regulation of water use by riparian users and pre appropriators.preventing these users from the unreasonable use of water necessarily requires the imposition of limits on that use by the board.limited and particularized prohibitions designed to prevent unreasonable use are different from,and by no means legally equivalent to,the comprehensive regulation embodied in a water use permit,which,as an allocation of excess water,typically limits the user rights without regard to the reasonableness of use.see city of pasadena city of alhambra cal d.
the lights contend the vested rights doctrine prevents the board from redefining an existing beneficial use as unreasonable.the position has been rejected repeatedly.it is now recognized that,since enactment of article x,section,there can no longer be any property right in the unreasonable use of water.in re waters of long valley creek stream system,supra,cal d at.what constitutes an unreasonable use of water changes with circumstances,including the passage of time.joslin,supra,cal d at tulare dist.lindsay strathmore,supra cal d at what is a beneficial use at one time may,because of changed conditions,become a waste of water at a later time.thus,the extent of a particular user vested right to use water similarly may change.riparian users vested water rights extend only to reasonable beneficial water use,which is determined at the time of use 
violation of the rule of priority 
the lights additionally argue that,whatever the scope of the board regulatory authority,it does not have the power to adopt a definition that prohibits a beneficial use,even though the amount of water being used for that beneficial use is no more than minimally required,in order to protect another beneficial use to which it ascribes higher priority.essentially on this basis,the parties characterize the board regulation as a violation of the rule of priority.
in analyzing this contention,we start with the premise that the supply of water in california is variable and at times insufficient to supply all possible beneficial uses.as the circumstances of this appeal demonstrate,this may be true on a temporary and localized basis,as well as on a more global one.when the supply of water in a particular stream system is insufficient to satisfy all beneficial uses,water rights users must curtail their use.as discussed above,the rule of priority dictates that riparian users are satisfied first,but when the supply runs sufficiently short,even riparian users must curtail their beneficial use proportionately.united states,supra,d at.
so long as the only water uses involved are those governed by common law and statutory water rights,the lights contention might have force.when the supply of water is insufficient to satisfy all persons and entities holding water rights,it is ordinarily the function of the rule of priority to determine the degree to which any particular use must be curtailed.yet even in these circumstances,the board has the ultimate authority to allocate water in a manner inconsistent with the rule of priority,when doing so is necessary to prevent the unreasonable use of water.el dorado,supra,th.because no one can have a protectible interest in the unreasonable use of water citation when the rule of priority clashes with the rule against unreasonable use of water,the latter must prevail.ibid.
this case,moreover,involves more than traditional water rights.as the supreme court held in audubon society,no party can acquire a vested right to appropriate water in a manner harmful to public trust interests and the state has an affirmative duty to take the public trust into account in regulating water use by protecting public trust uses whenever feasible.audubon society,supra,cal d at pp.although the audubon society court considered the public trust doctrine only in relation to permitted appropriative water rights,subsequent decisions have assumed the doctrine applies as well in the context of riparian and pre appropriator rights.united states,supra,d at in audubon society,the court determined that no one has a vested right to use water in a manner harmful to the state waters el dorado,supra,th at when the public trust doctrine clashes with the rule of priority,the rule of priority must yield.
in holding that regulation does not violate the rule of priority,our decision extends only to the regulation potential for allocating water between the beneficial public trust use of maintaining stream levels to avoid salmonid deaths and the beneficial use of diversion for frost protection by water rights holders.as between particular rights holders,e very effort must be made to respect and enforce the rule of priority.a solution to a dispute over water rights must preserve water right priorities to the extent those priorities do not lead to unreasonable use.el dorado,supra,th at.the sacramento plaintiffs argue this principle is violated because t he regulation broadly declares unreasonable all water used for frost protection purposes in two counties,without consideration of the priority of individual water rights.this badly misstates the import of the regulation.regulation does not declare any specific diversion of water for frost protection unreasonable,much less all such use.frost protection diversion is unreasonable only if it occurs in violation of a wdmp.as among individual water rights holders,regulation requires wdmp to respect the rule of priority in assigning corrective actions,subd.c.
while it is possible,as the sacramento plaintiffs argue,that the decentralized system of wdmp creates a risk of priority rule violations,such concerns are premature until wdmp have been put into effect.this is a facial challenge to regulation,and we hold only that there is no basis for finding regulation,on its face,violates the rule of priority.a determination of whether specific regulatory measures adopted by the wdmp violate the rule of priority,and whether any such violation is justified by the board responsibilities under article x,section,must await implementation of the regulation 
delegation of regulatory authority to wdmp governing bodies 
the trial court concluded regulation improperly delegated the regulatory authority of the board to wdmp,reasoning the requirement of the section that the governing body be capable of ensuring that the requirements of the program are met regulation,subd.b means enforcement of the wdmp has been delegated to the governing boards.the court also concluded the section constituted an improper delegation of legislative authority because d eclaring the use of water for frost protection an unreasonable use of water is a fundamental shift in water policy in this state.we review the constitutional issue of unlawful delegation de novo.people ex rel.lockyer sun pacific farming th,sun pacific.
there is a tension when private industry shares responsibility for the governmental regulation of its commercial activities.on the one hand,members of the industry are well positioned to understand the regulatory needs and the impact of regulation on their business activities.in this respect,they are ideal partners in the formulation of appropriate regulations.perhaps for this reason,it has never been held that the mere involvement of regulated private parties in the making of administrative regulations constitutes an improper delegation of governmental authority.on the other hand,by involving members of the regulated industry the agency runs the risks associated with the fox guarding the henhouse.as a result,there is a tight line between lawful and unlawful delegation of regulatory authority.international of plumbing.officials california building stds.com.th,plumbing.officials holding that model building codes developed by private parties can not become binding regulations without agency review and approval.
to put it simply,the legislature could not lawfully grant the power to make laws to a private entity.plumbing.officials,supra,th at.while,as illustrated in plumbing.officials,private entities can formulate and suggest potential regulation,the doctrine of unlawful delegation requires the legislature or a regulatory agency to exercise the final say over whether any particular regulation becomes law.in addition,the legislature can not delegat e regulatory power to agencies composed of interested members of the regulated industries without imposing standards or safeguards adequate to prevent abuse.absent the required safeguards,such grants of authority constitute unconstitutional delegations of legislative power.dunn edwards south coast air quality management dist.th,fn.see bayside timber board of supervisors d.
the delegation of authority to the wdmp governing bodies under regulation is not materially different from the type of delegation found lawful in sun pacific.the defendant in sun pacific was a citrus grower that concededly harbored diseased trees in its operations.when the state brought an action in the name of the local citrus pest control district to remove the diseased trees,the defendant challenged the constitutionality of the delegation of power to the district.sun pacific,supra,th at.citrus pest control districts are established pursuant to state law for more effective control and eradication of disease.they may be organized by the local county boards of supervisors upon the petition of the owners of a majority of citrus growing acreage in a district.the districts are governed by a board of local growers,required to formulate a plan for pest control and eradication,and granted various powers to effectuate the program.id.at.in considering the lawfulness of this broad delegation,the court noted,a n unconstitutional delegation of authority occurs only when a legislative body leaves the resolution of fundamental policy issues to others or fails to provide adequate direction for the implementation of that policy.id.at.in rejecting the argument citrus growers who comprise a district board unlawfully set policy,the court held that the legislature had made basic policy decisions with respect to the control and eradication of citrus pests,through the best known and accepted methods,leaving only the implementation of that policy to growers.id.at.in addition,the legislature included specific standards and safeguards in the statute for both the formation of the pest control districts and the exercise of their authority to protect against the districts exercising their regulatory power arbitrarily.id.at.
similarly,in formulating regulation,the board clearly set out the fundamental purposes of the wdmp to develop and implement methods for monitoring the level of the affected watercourses,determining when that level poses a threat to young salmon,and responding with corrective actions to reduce a threat once detected.regulation,subds.b,c.it then established detailed standards for the manner in which the wdmp governing bodies are to monitor stream levels and the type of corrective measures that can be instituted to prevent sudden decreases in water level.ibid.finally,the board placed itself between the governing bodies and the regulated growers.no program developed by a governing body will become effective will acquire the force of law until it has been approved by the board,and that approval must be sought annually.nothing more was required to prevent an unlawful delegation of authority 
unlike the trial court,we do not construe regulation as delegating enforcement authority to the governing bodies.read in context,the requirement a governing body be capable of ensuring that the requirements of the program are met regulation,subd.b means only the governing body must have the organization and financial resources sufficient to develop a program,monitor its implementation,and comply with the reporting requirements in other words,be capable of administering a wdmp.the statute is clear that the failure to comply with a wdmp,once it has been approved,shall be subject to enforcement by the board,not the wdmp.regulation,subd.e.the enforcement obligation of the wdmp governing body is limited to reporting an uncooperative diverter to the board.regulation,subd.c e.while it is true,as the sacramento plaintiffs argue,that the governing bodies will decide which growers must take corrective actions at any given time,those decisions must be made in accordance with the wdmp,which in turn must be approved by the board.the role of the governing body is therefore the administration of a policy 
the trial court conclusion that the issue of balancing water use for frost protection against water needs for the protection of wildlife is novel and fundamental was erroneous,both conceptually and factually.the board first declared the use of water for frost protection to be unreasonable at least as early as forni,decided in.moreover,the truly fundamental issue was decided by the legislature over a ago when it enacted section and amended section.the former declares t he use of water for recreation and the preservation and enhancement of fish and wildlife resources is a beneficial use of water stats,ch,while the latter similarly characterizes preservation and enhancement of fish and wildlife as a beneficial use stats,ch.these sections represent a legislative declaration that the welfare of wildlife is a beneficial use on a par with the type of commercial use that has traditionally been recognized as beneficial.because,as discussed above,the responsibility of the board is to regulate the use of water for beneficial purposes,balancing the use of water for frost protection against its use for salmon habitat is simply an application of this fundamental policy decision 
the lights contend section actually expresses a legislative preference for riparian rights over fish,based on the concluding sentence of the statute.although section instructs the board to take into account,whenever it is in the public interest,the amounts of water required for recreation and the preservation and enhancement of fish and wildlife resources when determining the amount of water available for appropriation for other beneficial uses,it ends with the statement,this section shall not be construed to affect riparian rights.in understanding the legislature intent,it is important to recognize the context of section,which is codified in the part of the water code dealing with the board authority to issue permits and in an article defining beneficial uses,which begins with the declaration that such uses are a prerequisite for the granting of such a permit.given this context,we interpret the final sentence in section to constitute a reaffirmation of the freedom of riparian users from the permitting authority of the board,rather than a general declaration that the rights of riparian users are paramount to the preservation of water as wildlife habitat 
the lights also argue that allowing the wdmp to develop their own regulations constitutes an unlawful delegation of the board responsibilities under schecter county of los angeles d schecter.schecter involved a dispute between the county civil service commission and its board of supervisors over job classifications in the sheriff department.pursuant to a commission rule requiring its chief staff member to develop job classifications,subject to the approval of the commission,the chief recommended to the commission the consolidation of certain sheriff department job classifications.the commission rejected the chief recommendation,instead adopting its own,different classifications.when the commission order was sent to the board of supervisors for adoption,the board refused,in effect arguing the commission rule permitted it only to accept or reject the chief recommendation,rather than to develop classifications on its own initiative.id.at pp.the court rejected the board position,finding the board interpretation of the regulation to constitute an improper delegation of the commission authority to its staff member.while the commission could rely on employees to investigate and report the facts and their recommendation and to draft orders in the first instance,the court held,the members of the commission were required to exercise their own discretion in approving a final order.id.at pp.accordingly,the court affirmed the trial court order requiring the board to adopt the commission classifications.
as is evident from this description,schecterdoes not suggest that an unlawful delegation occurred here.in the same way that the civil service commission could use its employees to investigate and draft a proposed classification order,the board can rely on wdmp to organize and draft programs.so long as the board exercises its independent discretion in evaluating those programs,no unlawful delegation has occurred.the requirement of regulation that the board approve any program implicitly requires just such an exercise of independent discretion 
d.the necessity for regulation 
the trial court also found no substantial evidence to support the board finding of regulatory necessity for regulation,concluding the board had not collected sufficient data to demonstrate the need for the regulation,particularly in light of the purported success of voluntary efforts at mitigating the problem.
government code section,the statute governing judicial review of administrative regulations,states a regulation may be declared invalid if t he agency determination that the regulation is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute,court decision,or other provision of law that is being implemented,interpreted,or made specific by the regulation is not supported by substantial evidence,subd.b see also,regulation valid only if it is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute it implements.q rules represent an authentic form of substantive lawmaking within its jurisdiction,the agency has been delegated the legislature lawmaking power.citations.when a court assesses the validity of such rules,the scope of its review is narrow citations.when a regulation is challenged on the ground that it is not reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute,our inquiry is confined to whether the rule is arbitrary,capricious,or without rational basis citation and whether substantial evidence supports the agency determination that the rule is reasonably necessary citation.western states petroleum board of equalization cal th.in determining whether an agency decision was supported by substantial evidence,we resolve all conflicts in favor of the agency,indulging in all legitimate and reasonable inferences from the record when two or more inferences can be reasonably deduced from those facts,the reviewing court has no power to substitute its deductions for those of the fact finder.associated builders contractors,san francisco airports com.cal th.r easonable necessity generally does implicate the agency expertise therefore it receives a much more deferential standard of review.california of medical products suppliers maxwell jolly th.in reviewing a finding of reasonable necessity,our task is the same as the trial court the appellate court reviews the agency action,not the trial court decision in that sense appellate judicial review is de novo.vineyard area citizens for responsible growth,city of rancho cordova cal th.
regulation was enacted to protect salmonids in the russian river stream system from stranding mortality due to sudden drops in water level during the late spring and early summer.the fisheries service concluded salmonids propensity to occupy shallow water at the margins of the stream and their immature swimming skills make them vulnerable to sudden drops in water level,and,as noted,strandings were found following a period of abrupt fluctuations in stream flow in.the board conclusion the sudden drops in stream flow were caused by the unregulated diversion of water for the purpose of frost protection was based on studies finding that the drops were associated with predicted air temperatures,had been increasing in recent years,and did not occur in areas without vineyards.it is a logical inference from these observations that growers frost protection diversion was the cause of the sudden drops.the board conclusions were further supported by a study prepared by the fisheries service,which surveyed a wide range of scientific literature and concluded,the threat of frost protection on salmonids is significant and widespread throughout the russian river watershed.nat.marine fisheries service,frost protection threat assessment for threatened and endangered salmonids in the russian river watershed draft.in fact,one of the april strandings was traced directly to a single event of water diversion for frost protection by a particular grower at felta creek.giving due deference to the board expertise,and recognizing our obligation to resolve conflicts and draw inferences in the board favor,we conclude the foregoing provides substantial evidence to support the board conclusion that some regulation of growers diversion of water for frost protection was necessary to prevent unwarranted salmonid mortality.
the sacramento plaintiffs fault the four scientific studies reproduced in the record,arguing none of them directly connects salmonid strandings with water diversion for frost protection.the lights criticize the work of the fisheries service in investigating the stranding problem and argue the actual mechanism of salmonid stranding is not well understood.it appears to be unknown,for example,whether stranding occurs because the stage,or height,of the water drops below a certain level,or because the drop in stage occurs too quickly,or from an interaction of the two factors for example,a rapid drop from an already low stage.it appears similarly unknown how such a drop in stage is correlated with the volume of water flowing in the watercourse,which is the actual measurement normally made in monitoring stream flow.
while we acknowledge the validity of some of plaintiffs observations about the shortcomings of the current level of scientific knowledge,they do not lead to the conclusion the board finding of necessity was not supported by substantial evidence.as to the sacramento plaintiffs criticisms,the four studies discussed were not the only scientific evidence in the record.the fisheries service study mentioned above summarized the findings of a number of studies of hydrology and salmon biology,explaining the mechanism of salmonid stranding and supporting the board reasoning with respect to the impact of frost protection diversion.the lights observations about the precise mechanism of stranding highlight the uncertainty about the type of corrective actions necessary and when they should be employed,but they do not suggest the board conclusions about the need for some type of regulation are unsupported.given the evidence discussed above,the board inference associating salmonid mortality with the dramatic and sudden declines observed during periods of low temperature is a reasonable one,as is the inference connecting those declines with diversion for the purpose of frost protection.our standard of review requires us to draw all reasonable inferences in the board favor.associated builders contractors,san francisco airports,supra cal th at.while it may be uncertain from the record precisely what type of regulation of frost protection diversion is necessary to protect salmonids,the need for some type of regulation is supported by substantial evidence 
the lights contend the board evidence was concocted,citing an attorney letter submitted to the board on behalf of a winery.the letter provides no evidence,or even argument,to refute the genuine nature of the strandings found by the fisheries service.instead,it argues voluntary efforts by growers combined with better coordination of water releases by the scwa make future similar strandings less likely the combination of low flow and frost threat that led to the incident was relatively rare,having occurred in only of the last years and the actual cause of the strandings was the failure of the scwa in april to meet its instream flow requirements.
none of these arguments demonstrate the finding of necessity for the board regulation was not supported by substantial evidence.as the trial court recognized,it was within the board discretion to disregard the effects of voluntary efforts to mitigate the problem,since these efforts could be reversed or abandoned in the absence of compulsory regulation in any event,the evidence that voluntary efforts had mitigated the problem in the areas immediately surrounding the documented strandings,cited in the letter,did not support a finding of successful mitigation elsewhere on the stream system.as to the release of more water by the scwa,the board was entitled to rely on the scwa own conclusion that additional releases of water alone could not cure the problem,both because of the difficulty of accurately predicting the need for such releases and because the problem is one of sudden drops caused by uncoordinated diversion,rather than a more general lack of sufficient water in the system.finally,as to the rarity of the causative conditions,this will presumably be taken into account in the wdmp.given the potential impact on endangered and threatened salmon populations by these incidents,their rarity would be an argument for regulation responsive to environmental conditions,as regulation requires,not for an absence of regulation altogether.
the board prepared an initial draft environmental impact report in may and issued a revised draft environmental impact report eir four months later.the trial court found the eir inadequate because it failed to assess the impact on strandings of diversions other than for frost protection purposes,it contained no determination of the flow levels necessary to protect salmonids,it failed to adopt reasonable mitigation measures,and it failed to identify and analyze other environmental impacts.
section of the public resources code provides that a court inquiry in an action to set aside an agency decision under ceqa shall extend only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.as a result of this standard,the court does not pass upon the correctness of the eir environmental conclusions,but only upon its sufficiency as an informative document.citation.citation.we may not set aside an agency approval of an eir on the ground that an opposite conclusion would have been equally or more reasonable.citation.an appellate court review of the administrative record for legal error and substantial evidence in a ceqa case,as in other mandamus cases,is the same as the trial court the appellate court reviews the agency action,not the trial court decision in that sense appellate judicial review under ceqa is de novo.in re bay delta,supra,cal th.
failure to consider other diversions 
as discussed above,the flow in the russian river stream system is determined in part by water releases from two large dams.in addition,as the eir noted,water is diverted from the system for a number of purposes other than frost protection less than of the persons and entities having water rights in the system use those rights for purposes of frost protection.the trial courted faulted the eir for failing to quantify these other diversions,including the amount of water impounded by the dams during the relevant march to may period,concluding it was essential to comprehend how flows levels sic are being impacted during the frost season.the sacramento plaintiffs contend,and the trial court found,the eir was deficient because it failed to consider the impact on salmonid strandings by these various other diversions.
the eir explained its failure to address other sources of diversion in its response to comments.replying to a comment that diversion by the urban contractors and the scwa must be considered,the board explained,municipal diversions along the mainstem russian river are not included in the proposed regulation because these diversions are made at a rate that is known and accounted for by scwa releases to maintain flows.div.of water rights,state water resources control,responses to public comments on the may draft russian river frost protection regulation.in response to another comment,the board explained that diversion for irrigation was not considered because irrigation use was self randomizing and of relatively low intensity.frost protection is essentially the opposite.during major frost events,almost everyone is forced to protect all of their crops simultaneously using overheard sprinkler systems this acute demand can cause large,short term fluctuations in flow.id.at.
in essence,the board declined to quantify and otherwise consider in more detail other types of diversion because,it believed,they did not affect the problem of salmonid stranding.as discussed at length above,the board concluded stranding is caused by sudden drops in stream level associated with simultaneous,diversion for the purpose of frost protection.conversely,the board reasoned,because the other sources of diversion occur at a relatively steady and predictable pace that is compensated for by the dam releases,they have no impact on stranding.since,as discussed above,the board view is supported by substantial evidence,we find no abuse of discretion in the failure of the eir to consider this issue.plaintiffs may disagree with the board about the cause of the strandings,but the board was not required to adopt their views in compiling the eir.
we also find no abuse of discretion in the eir failure to quantify the amount of water retained by the dams.given their importance in regulating flow on the stream system and the legal constraints governing their release of water,the operation of the dams is,in effect,part of the environmental baseline.the eir described their role in its background section scwa operates lake mendocino and lake sonoma for water supply purposes in accordance with state water board decision,which set instream flow requirements for the mainstem russian river below lake mendocino and for dry creek below lake sonoma.because scwa is legally constrained in maintaining instream flow by the terms of the board decision,the amount of water retained is irrelevant to a discussion of the environmental impact of regulation 
the trial court also faulted the eir for not considering larger releases from the dams in anticipation of predicted frost in its alternatives section.as the board noted in response to a comment,due to the location and operational limitations of the dams,releases from the dams simply can not independently mitigate for the rapid increase in demand for water for frost protection.in other words,the alternative suggested by the trial court would not address the problem targeted by the regulation.a lead agency may structure its eir alternative analysis around a reasonable definition of underlying purpose and need not study alternatives that can not achieve that basic goal.in re bay delta,supra,cal th at.because anticipatory releases would not have solved the problem,the eir was not required to consider such releases as an alternative.
minimum flow levels 
the trial court concluded the discussion of environmental impacts was inadequate because the board had not determined the minimum stream flow necessary to prevent strandings.without knowing the minimum level of stream flow that must be maintained,the court concluded,the board could not determine the extent to which growers would be required to alter their frost protection conduct and therefore could not determine the full environmental impact of the regulation,to the extent environmental impacts were associated with the various corrective actions.
the sacramento plaintiffs make essentially the same argument in contending the eir was deficient because it fails to disclose the conditions necessary to protect salmonids.they argue the eir failed to establish the streamflow conditions sufficient to protect the salmonids,to correlate the amount of water diverted with streamflow reduction rates,and to use this information to determine the type and amount of diversions necessary.like the trial court,they argue the environmental impacts of the regulation can not be understood until these determinations are made.
rather than setting a particular flow level,regulation anticipates that each wdmp will include a determination of the stream stage that should be maintained at each g age to prevent stranding mortality.regulation,subd.c b.as all parties appear to agree,the hydrology of the russian river stream system and its impact on salmonid mortality is insufficiently understood to determine what stream level must be maintained to prevent mortality,or even whether a particular level is necessary.as discussed above,the assumption underlying the board analysis is that sudden declines in flow,rather than low flow per se,are responsible for the strandings.
while the board was unable to determine with specificity the effect of the regulation on grower conduct,the eir did not ignore the issue of the environmental impact of proposed corrective actions.section of the eir calculated a range of the agricultural acreage that might be required to adopt corrective measures.subsequent sections then evaluated the environmental impact of the adoption of such corrective actions as increased groundwater extraction section,expansion of offstream storage section,removal of surface water diversion structures section,installation of wind machines section,installation of heaters section,and installation of stream stage gauges section,as well as other potential actions that may be taken by affected persons that are not anticipated to result in significant impacts to the environment section.the problem identified by the trial court is not that the eir disregarded the environmental impacts associated with corrective actions,but that the eir was hampered in estimating the cumulative effect of these individual impacts because it could not determine to what degree corrective actions would be necessary.in effect,the trial court held that an adequate eir could not be prepared until considerably more study had been done.
the trial court ruling required a legally unnecessary level of precision from the board.in determining the adequacy of an eir,the ceqa guidelines look to whether the report provides decision makers with sufficient analysis to intelligently consider the environmental consequences of a project.citation.the courts have therefore looked not for perfection but for adequacy,completeness,and a good faith effort at full disclosure.citation.citation.the overriding issue on review is thus whether the lead agency reasonably and in good faith discussed a project in detail sufficient to enable the public to discern from the eir the analytic route the agency traveled from evidence to action.california oak foundation regents of university of california th.as stated in california code of regulations,title,section ceqa guideline,the adequacy of an eir is determined in terms of what is reasonably feasible,in light of factors such as the magnitude of the project at issue,the severity of its likely environmental impacts,and the geographic scope of the project.ceqa does not require a lead agency to conduct every test or perform all research,study,and experimentation recommended or demanded by commentors as long as a good faith effort at full disclosure is made in the eir.ceqa guideline,subd.a.
the board discussion of the environmental impacts of the regulation satisfied the requirement of a good faith effort evaluation,based on reasonably available information.the board estimated the number of acres that would be affected by the regulation and described the environmental impacts associated with the various changes that might be associated with implementation of the regulation.the objective was sufficient analysis to permit an intelligent evaluation of environmental consequences.as ceqa guideline notes,an important factor in this equation is the severity of the identified environmental impacts,since greater environmental impact will require a more extensive discussion.the environmental impacts of the corrective actions,as disclosed in the eir,are limited.even if it were possible to provide the greater precision demanded by the trial court,that precision is unlikely to have materially changed the magnitude of the likely environmental consequences.
moreover,it is an open question whether the information sought by the trial court and the sacramento plaintiffs,the stream flow conditions necessary to prevent harm to the salmonids,would lead to a materially more precise estimate of the environmental impacts,given the wide variety of stream types,acreages,and corrective actions available.even if the board had been able to specify with more accuracy the conditions under which corrective action is necessary,those conditions vary widely over the entirety of the stream system.for this reason,it would remain difficult to determine the number and identity of growers required to adopt corrective actions.further,even if those growers could be identified in some manner,it would be impossible to determine which of the several alternative corrective actions they would adopt,and therefore to estimate the environmental impacts with greater precision.the trial court and the sacramento plaintiffs are seeking a level of precision that is,as a practical matter,unavailable and is unnecessary for a good faith and reasonable consideration of the environmental impact of the regulation.
the sacramento plaintiffs contend the lack of such information will result in a large number of environmental impact reports from individual wdmp,resulting in potentially conflicting estimates of environmental impact.we decline to speculate about the necessity for additional environmental impact reports and hold only that,given the reasonably available information,the board eir adequately considered the environmental impact of the regulation.
reasonable mitigation measures 
the trial court ruling that the eir failed adopt adequate mitigation measures was linked to its ruling that the eir was deficient for failing to specify a minimum stream flow.as the court explained,in the absence of that number,the expected reaction or adjustments to frost protection practices can not be reliably predicted.the mitigation measures necessary to the concomitant environmental impacts resulting from those adjustments that are predicted in the eir is unforeseeable and therefore inadequately specified or addressed in the eir.
the mitigation section of the eir,section,separately considered each of the corrective actions discussed in the impacts section,such as increased groundwater extraction,construction of new water storage facilities,and use of alternative frost protection means,and adopted a series of measures to mitigate the environmental consequences found for each corrective action.in other words,it required the corrective actions to be implemented in an environmentally sensitive manner.
if it is feasible to do so,a public agency must mitigate or avoid the significant environmental effects of a project that it carries out or approves.south county citizens for smart growth county of nevada th.ceqa does not require analysis of every imaginable alternative or mitigation measure its concern is with feasible means of reducing environmental effects.citation.feasible means capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time,taking into account economic,environmental,social,and technological factors.citation.mitigation measures that can not be legally imposed or enforced need not be proposed or analyzed.san diego citizenry group county of san diego th.
the trial court did not conclude the measures proposed by the board for the corrective actions would not result in the mitigation of the significant environmental impacts caused by implementation of regulation,nor did it conclude there were additional feasible mitigation measures that were not considered by the board.instead,the court found the discussion of mitigation measures inadequate because the board could not predict what mitigation measures would be necessary until the minimum stream flow was specified.this confused two separate concepts the corrective actions necessary to prevent salmonid mortality and the mitigation measures necessary to minimize the environmental impact from those mitigation measures.while it might not be possible to specify what particular corrective actions must be adopted until the factors affecting stranding are better understood,the same is not true of the mitigation measures necessary to minimize the environmental impact of those corrective actions.because the environmental impacts of the corrective actions are understood,the board was able to specify and adopt appropriate measures to minimize those impacts.when and if it is necessary to implement any particular corrective actions,the mitigation measures will ensure implementation is done in an environmentally sensitive manner.this is all the board was required to do to satisfy its obligation under ceqa to adopt feasible mitigation measures.
other environmental impacts 
the trial court found the eir discussion of environmental impacts inadequate because it did not include a discussion of the impacts caused by growers abandoning agriculture due to the costs associated with compliance with regulation.the eir discussed this possibility land conversion was not considered a feasible method of compliance.the proposed regulation does not restrict operations or financially impact the vineyard or orchard owner at a significant enough level to assume that an owner would forfeit the agriculture business and explore other land use alternatives.the proposed regulation allows for a business to comply with the regulation at the least cost,therefore it is highly unlikely that land conversion would occur.the trial court rejected this conclusion as unsupported,criticizing the board cost estimates and citing comments by growers who anticipated a substantial impact on their operations.
contrary to the trial court finding,the eir conclusion was not unsupported.in reaching this conclusion,the board relied on a page study entitled,economic impacts of the proposed russian river frost regulation.office of research,planning performance,state water resources control,economic impacts of the proposed russian river frost regulation may.one section of the study contained an estimate of the vineyard and pear orchard acreage that would be taken out of production as a result of the implementation of regulation.the study concluded that in the two affected counties,of a total of acres of vineyard and orchard land,or less than percent,would be taken out of production.the study constitutes substantial evidence to support the board conclusion that the environmental impact of farmland conversion will be insignificant.the trial court was not permitted to disregard this evidence merely because commenters disagreed with its conclusions.north coast rivers alliance marin municipal water dist.bd.of directors th.
the sacramento plaintiffs argue,in addition,the eir failed to consider the impact on special status species,which are other plant and animal species threatened or potentially threatened.an appendix to the eir identified some special status plants and special status animals native to riparian habitats in california 
contrary to plaintiffs claims,the eir did discuss the impact of the regulation on some special status species.section of the eir,describing the environmental setting,notes in general terms the existence of such species in the russian river stream system,without identifying particular plants or animals present.in the discussion of environmental impacts,the eir referred several times to the potential for disturbance of special status species and their habitats.in discussing the removal of existing diversion structures,the eir noted it would reduce the available habitat used by species such as the western pond turtle and frog.while the discussion of other species is by no means detailed,the eir notes the potential for adverse impacts on special status species when appropriate.in the absence of evidence the eir ignored specific known risks to such species,the discussion is adequate.
other ceqa arguments 
in addition to seconding the conclusions of the trial court,the lights raise a series of additional ceqa issues either not considered or rejected by the court.
the lights first contend the board adoption of the resolution certifying the eir violated public resources code article x,section,subdivision c,which requires a lead agency to i ndependently review and analyze any report or declaration required by this division,and california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision a,which requires the agency to certify the eir p rior to approving a project.the claim is based entirely on a board member inadvertent reference,in moving adoption of the resolution certifying the eir and adopting the regulation,to the regulation rather than the resolution.
the board considered adoption of regulation at a meeting on september.at the commencement of the meeting,the board chairperson described the purpose of the meeting as consideration of both the proposed regulation and the associated eir.an initial presentation by staff reviewed the process by which regulation was developed,including preparation of the eir.following extended public comment,the board adjourned to allow the staff to confer about any comments they heard today,comments they may need to respond to on the record.when the board reconvened,the members questioned staff about various aspects of the proposed regulation,including aspects of the ceqa process and the eir.at the conclusion of the meeting,a board member moved adoption of the regulation,rather than adoption of the resolution that adopted the regulation and certified the eir.the motion passed unopposed,and the board adjourned.promptly thereafter,while all members of the board were still present,the board counsel clarified that the motion was for adoption of the resolution.the chair responded,yes,yes,while at least one member nodded her head in assent.
we find no merit in any argument based on the board member reference to the regulation rather than the resolution.adoption of a resolution is the procedural vehicle for the adoption of a regulation.the mistaken reference to adoption of the regulation,as opposed to the resolution,was understandable.because the matter on the agenda was presumably the adoption of the resolution,there was no ambiguity in the board action,and any uncertainty was cured by counsel clarification.we also find no basis for the claim of a violation of public resources code section,since the record of the meeting plainly reflects the board conscious consideration of the eir.the lights offer a number of legal theories justifying their presentation of this marginal argument,but they cite no case law holding that a slip of the tongue constitutes a prejudicial procedural error.
the lights also argue that regulation was inappropriate for treatment as a program environmental impact report under california code of regulations,title,section,since a program environmental impact report is intended to control a series of future activities,whereas regulation imposed an immediate and pervasive ban on frost protection diversion not undertaken pursuant to a wdmp.contrary to the lights claim,the board made clear its intent not to enforce the ban in regulation on unregulated diversion until after a period for investigation and adoption of wdmp,during which project environmental impact reports can be prepared,if necessary.the regulation itself does not require growers to cease diversion until a wdmp has been formulated and approved,tit,subd.c,and the resolution adopting the regulation states compliance will not be enforced until at least two years after the regulation becomes effective.we find no abuse of discretion in the board decision to proceed by way of a program environmental impact report 
finally,the lights contend the board findings were inadequate because they did not explain why alternative methods of frost protection were less harmful to the environment than direct diversions.in fact,the board noted the possible impacts of the alternative methods of frost protection,stated they could be subject to a future environmental impact report if undertaken on a significant scale,and found that,taking the effects of these alternative methods into account,the economic,social,and environmental benefits of the regulation outweigh any unavoidable adverse environmental effects.this was sufficient under public resources code section,subdivision b.see,the flanders foundation city of carmel by the sea th.

the orders granting a preliminary injunction and the judgment granting a writ of mandate are reversed,and the preliminary injunction is dissolved.
the life cycles of the three species of salmon differ somewhat,but this general summary is characteristic of all three.
of the total of water rights claims in the russian river watershed,provide for the diversion of water for frost protection.a witness before the board compared air temperature and water flow at a gauge in the russian river over the years prior to and found a correlation between the occurrence of low air temperatures and rapid drawdown.the intensity of the drawdowns had increased significantly in recent years.such drawdowns did not occur in areas without vineyards.
the regulation actually applies only to that portion of the russian river stream system located downstream of the two major dams.regulation,subd.a.because salmon can not migrate past the dams,there is no risk to their safety from water diversion above the dams.the dates were apparently selected because they represent the time during which new plant growth typically coincides with the risk of freezing temperatures.
the sacramento plaintiffs are russian river water users for the environment,an unincorporated association of mendocino and sonoma county residents and entities interested in fruit and winery operations,allan nelson,a sonoma county vineyard owner,billy munselle,an alexander valley grape grower,robert terry rosetti,a grape and pear grower in mendocino county,and redwood ranch and vineyards,lp,which owns vineyard land adjoining the russian river.as a regular part of their business operations,munselle and rosetti draw water from the russian river stream system for frost protection purposes.
