factual and procedural history 
in august,a forest fire named the school fire burned approximately acres in southeastern washington,including acres of the umatilla national forest.soon thereafter,the forest service began preparations for the school fire salvage recovery project to harvest dead and dying trees located within the burned areas of national forest lands after two rounds of public comments,the forest service released the final environmental impact statement eis or school fire eis on july,and issued a record of decision on august.
the school fire eis considered three alternatives alternative a contemplated no action alternative b permitted salvage logging on acres and alternative c permitted salvage logging on acres.the forest service chose alternative b,which includes logging on portions of two uninventoried roadless areas,known informally as west tucannon and upper cummins creek,each of which contains between and acres.
because trees that are damaged or destroyed by fire depreciate in value quickly,the forest service chief issued an emergency situation determination pursuant to.that determination authorized immediate logging in three designated areas,premised on the prediction that a delay would result in a potential loss of value of to the federal government.the three milly,oli,and sun salvage timber located in the most severely burned areas of the forest.together they comprise acres,or slightly more than of the total acreage scheduled for salvage logging under the eis.
on august,one day after the issuance of the record of decision,plaintiffs filed suit,alleging violations of nepa and nfma.the following day,plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction concerning the milly,oli,and sun sales.after briefing and oral argument,the district court denied plaintiffs motion.they immediately appealed to this court,arguing that the district court abused its discretion in denying a preliminary injunction 
standards of review 
a preliminary injunction is appropriate when a plaintiff demonstrates either a likelihood of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury or that serious questions going to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff favor.clear channel outdoor city of los angeles,cir internal quotation marks omitted.these two options represent extremes on a single continuum the less certain the district court is of the likelihood of success on the merits,the more plaintiffs must convince the district court that the public interest and balance of hardships tip in their favor.sw.voter registration educ.project shelley,cir en banc per curiam.alternatively,we have stated the general test as requiring a plaintiff to establish a strong likelihood of success on the merits,the possibility of irreparable injury to plaintiff if preliminary relief is not granted,a balance of hardships favoring the plaintiff,and advancement of the public interest in certain cases.johnson cal.state bd.of accountancy,cir internal quotation marks omitted.

discussion 
nepa claims 
plaintiffs contend that the district court abused its discretion by holding that the forest service adequately analyzed and disclosed the effects of logging in the west tucannon and upper cummins creek roadless areas.according to plaintiffs,nepa requires the forest service to analyze the effects of significant logging on the roadless character of large roadless areas,but the forest service failed to do so with respect to the west tucannon and upper cummins creek roadless areas,each of which encompasses more than acres.although plaintiffs may ultimately succeed on the merits,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs motion for injunctive relief.we therefore affirm the district court denial of a preliminary injunction on this ground.
plaintiffs acknowledge,as they must,that both the west tucannon and upper cummins creek roadless areas are uninventoried and that each area contains less than acres.plaintiffs also concede that the eis prepared by the forest service extensively analyzes the effects of logging generally,includes maps disclosing the locations of the proposed logging,and mentions that logging will occur in roadless areas.plaintiffs point out,however,that the eis does not specifically name the west tucannon and upper cummins creek roadless areas,does not describe the precise extent of logging in roadless areas,and does not analyze the effect of logging on the roadless character of these areas.
roadless areas have been the subject of federal legislation at least since the passage of the wilderness act of wilderness act.in the,two massive inventorying projects roadless area review and evaluation rare i and rare ii were undertaken to catalogue roadless areas for possible inclusion as wilderness areas under the wilderness act.designation as an inventoried roadless area can be a first step to designation as a wilderness area.see generally audubon soc y forest,cir describing the history of inventoried roadless areas.although no additional inventorying projects have been undertaken since rare i and rare ii,roadless areas that meet certain criteria continue to be designated as wilderness areas.one relevant criterion for designation of a wilderness area is the size of the pristine area consideration is appropriate if the area has at least five thousand acres of land or is of sufficient size as to make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition.c.
consistent with that historical background,we have held that nepa may require some consideration of the effects of logging on the roadless character of roadless areas in cases involving inventoried roadless areas,audubon,at,and uninventoried roadless areas that contain more than acres,smith forest,cir.we also have recognized that the decision to harvest timber on a previously undeveloped tract of land is an irreversible and irretrievable decision which could have serious environmental consequences.audubon,at internal quotation marks omit
