facts and proceedings 
plaintiff pal alleges that it is an unincorporated group of citizens who are residents and property owners within stanislaus county and was formed for the purpose of protecting and preserving the environmental resources,including agricultural resources,located within stanislaus county.
the subject matter of this litigation is city proposal to expand its territory to the southwest.the proposed expansion was set forth in the west landing specific plan,a policy document adopted by city to guide the future growth,land use,infrastructure,and public service planning and investment in a acre area that,prior to this litigation,was adjacent to city in an unincorporated part of stanislaus county.the acres are bounded by whitmore avenue on the north,the union pacific railroad on the east,service road on the south,and ustick road on the west.
city acted as the lead agency and prepared an environmental impact report eir for the west landing specific plan.in june,the ceres city council adopted resolutions certifying the final eir for the west landing specific plan.the eir identified significant environmental impacts that could not be eliminated or mitigated to a level of insignificance,including impacts to agricultural land.for example,the eir stated that the proposal would result in the conversion of approximately acres of farmland and the development of approximately acres of land currently under williamson act contracts and there were no feasible mitigation measures that would reduce these impacts to a level of insignificance.the city council adopted a statement of overriding considerations that included a finding that specific economic,legal,social,technological and other anticipated benefits of the project outweighed the significant and unavoidable environmental impacts of the project.
the city council also adopted resolutions approving the west landing specific plan and authorizing the submission of an application to stanislaus lafco for the modification of city sphere of influence and the annexation of the acre area by city.
after city certified the eir,adopted the statement of overriding considerations and approved the west landing specific plan,city filed a notice of determination,triggering the day statute of limitations for ceqa challenges to those actions.pub.resources code,subd.c.pal did not pursue a ceqa claim within that limitations period.
city application to stanislaus lafco requested it to adopt a municipal service review for city,approve the modification to city sphere of influence,and approve the annexation of the acres to city and simultaneous detachment from the westport fire protection district.for purposes of ceqa,stanislaus lafco acted as a responsible agency in connection with the application.pub.resources code.
stanislaus lafco considered city application in two parts the first concerning the municipal service review and sphere of influence modification and the second concerning the proposed annexation.
in february,stanislaus lafco approved the municipal services review and sphere of influence modification and adopted findings regarding the environmental impacts and the statement of overriding considerations,as adopted by the city council.
in march,stanislaus lafco adopted a resolution approving the proposed reorganization and annexation and adopting the findings regarding the environmental impacts and the statement of overriding considerations,as adopted by the city council.
in april,pal filed a petition for writ of mandate containing two causes of action.the first alleged that stanislaus lafco violated ceqa and the second cause of action alleged stanislaus lafco violate the reorganization act.pal prayer for relief requested that stanislaus lafco be ordered to set aside and void its approvals of the project and comply with applicable law prior to further consideration of the project.within days of the filing of its petition,pal had not filed proof that it completed the publication and other notice requirements applicable to reverse validation actions.
in august,defendants filed notice of a demurrer and motion to strike that asserted pal petition failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.defendants contended that,pursuant to section,a lawsuit to set aside the approvals issued by stanislaus lafco must be brought in accordance with the statutes governing validation actions,and that pal failure to comply with the publication of summons procedures deprived the court of jurisdiction to hear the claims.
in september,the trial court held a hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike.after the hearing,the court filed a written ruling that stated the demurrer and motion to strike were untimely and the court,in an exercise of its discretion,would deem the demurrer and motion to strike to be a motion for judgment on the pleadings.the court granted the motion without leave to amend.the court reasoned that it did not have jurisdiction to overturn a completed annexation because pal petition did not name all persons interested in the area subject to annexation or timely comply with the service requirements applicable to reverse validation actions.the court found no good cause under code of civil procedure sections or for pal failure to comply with the procedure applicable to reverse validation actions.to support this determination,the court specifically found that the legal research of pal counsel on these procedural issues was inadequate.in addition,the court overruled pal objections to declarations submitted by defendants and granted defendants request for judicial notice.
in november,the trial court filed a judgment disposing of all claims in pal petition for writ of mandate.pal thereafter filed a notice of appeal.

contentions and issues
