national forest management act 
the panel affirmed the district court summary judgment in favor of the united states in an action alleging that the united states forest service violated the national forest management act by approving either the big thorne logging project or the tongass forest plan under which big thorne was authorized.
plaintiffs alleged that the tongass forest plan unlawfully damages the habitat of the indigenous alexander archipelago wolf,and that the forest service violated its obligation under the plan by failing to ensure the wolf sustainability.the panel held that the plan provision pertaining to sustainability was discretionary.the panel held that because the forest service was only obligated to consider sustainability where possible,there was no law to apply in the agency.the panel held that it was aware of no authority compelling the agency to set a specific standard or benchmark for protecting the viability of a species that was neither endangered nor threatened.the panel noted that the forest service record of decision specifically concluded that the forest plan would sustain viable populations of the alexander archipelago wolf,and the panel concluded that forest service discussion of viability was arbitrary or capricious.the panel further held that the big thorne project was consistent with the forest plan.
in a concurrently filed memorandum disposition,the panel also dismissed plaintiffs claims under the national environmental policy act.
judge gould dissented from the portion of the majority discussion of the issues relating to the national forest management act,and concurred in the court reasoning concerning the national environmental policy act,as presented in the concurrently filed memorandum disposition.judge gould stated that the forest plan presently provides no mechanism to ensure wolf population viability,and that the agency rationale and reasoning process was too summary and conclusory.judge gould would vacate the decision of the forest service and remand for further proceedings,which at a minimum would include both a thorough assessment of the viability of the alexander archipelago wolf if the project proceeds,and an explanation of its reasoning sufficient to satisfy motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto.ins.
kozinski,circuit judge 
big thorne is a logging project in alaska tongass national forest.the united states forest service approved the logging to help revive the lackluster economy of southeastern alaska.but the project has been met with howls of protest from the plaintiffs in this case,who claim that big thorne unlawfully damages the habitat of an indigenous wolf.the district court dismissed all challenges,and we must now decide whether the forest service violated the national forest management act nfma by approving either the big thorne project or the tongass forest plan forest plan under which big thorne was authorized.
big thorne allows timber to be harvested from alaska prince of wales island.the island,which is the size of delaware,is the largest in a chain that makes up alaska alexander archipelago.like most of the archipelago,prince of wales island is covered in rainforest.big thorne authorizes logging on nearly acres and the construction of more than miles of roads.
logging and road construction will trench on the habitat of the alexander archipelago wolf.this rare wolf preys on a species of deer that thrives in the rainforest,which provides suitable shelter and forage during periods of heavy snow.a smaller forest will support fewer deer,which,in turn,will support fewer wolves.the new roads will compound that effect by letting wolf and deer hunters range deeper into the forest.
concerns about the fate of the wolf are not new.this discrete and insular canine is confined to the islands of the archipelago and surrounding coastline,and is thus sensitive to changes in local habitat.in,environmental groups petitioned to have the wolf listed under the endangered species act.the fish and wildlife service denied the petition but nonetheless helped convene a team of scientists to prepare a wolf conservation assessment.the assessment recommended that the wolf be protected by maintaining the deer population and limiting road density.
the forest service used these recommendations in as the basis for two standards and guidelines adopted in the forest plan.the first of these known as the wolf provision encourages the forest service to p rovide,where possible,sufficient deer habitat capability to maintain sustainable wolf populations emphasis added.a sufficient habitat capability is generally considered to equate to deer per square mile.the second guideline the road provision provides that t otal road densities of to mile per square mile or less may be necessary to protect the wolves emphasis added.
even before big thorne was approved,the project area had insufficient habitat capability to support deer per square mile,and road densities were above the recommended maximum.the logging project will further reduce deer habitat capability and increase road density.
the forest service nevertheless put the welfare of local loggers and their families above that of the wolves,and approved big thorne.more concerned with wolves than jobs,plaintiffs filed three lawsuits,pressing a variety of challenges in an attempt to derail the project.the district court consolidated the cases and granted alaska motion to intervene.it then granted summary judgment to the defendants on all claims.plaintiffs appeal.
discussion 
we consider whether the forest service violated the nfma by approving the forest plan or the big thorne logging project this dual inquiry tracks the two tiers of the agency legal obligations.first,the nfma requires that the forest service develop land and resource management plans,commonly called forest plans,that set broad goals and guidelines for each national forest.a,e,g citizens for better forestry dep t of,cir.second,after a forest plan is developed,all subsequent agency actions within that national forest projects like big thorne must comply with both the nfma and the relevant forest plan.i see also lands council mcnair,cir.en banc,abrogated in part on other grounds by winter nat.res.def.council.
the administrative procedure act provides our standard of review.we set aside an agency actions only if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.or.nat.res.council fund goodman,cir.internal quotation marks omitted discussing a.
a.the forest plan 
while generalized harm to the environment is enough to supply standing,the supreme court has emphasized that particularized harm to recreational or even mere esthetic interests is sufficient.summers earth island.we have previously held that a plaintiff has standing to challenge a programmatic agency decision like a forest plan when he suffers harm that is fairly traceable to that program.see cottonwood envtl.law ctr.forest,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
plaintiffs present voluminous declarations amply demonstrating that they are challenging the forest plan as a result of specific applications and not,as defendants claim,on its face.the declarants use sites affected by the forest plan for fishing,hunting,and to enjoy the solitude available only in remote,undeveloped areas on the tongass.unlike the single individual affidavit before the supreme court in summers,at which was inadequate to establish standing these declarations are sufficient to show that actions approved under the forest plan will cause particularized injury to the plaintiffs.
the nfma regulations at the time of the forest plan required that national forests be managed to maintain viable populations of existing native and desired vertebrate species.emphasis added this regulation defined a viable population as one with enough reproductive individuals to insure its continued existence is well distributed in the planning area.id.so our question is whether the forest service unlawfully concluded that its forest plan would safeguard the continued and existence of the alexander archipelago wolf.
some plaintiffs argue that this is the wrong question.they claim that the wolf provision of the forest plan in fact mandates a sustainable wolf population,not merely a viable one.sustainability is the more demanding standard,and plaintiffs claim that the forest service violated its obligation by failing to ensure sustainability.
the difference between sustainability and viability is not sharply defined,and is made fuzzier still by the parties,who occasionally conflate the two as when they refer to sustaining viable wolf populations,or repeatedly if obscurely ponder the forest ability to sustain wolves.we need not map the precise contours of these concepts,however,because the forest plan provision that mentions sustainability is discretionary it states only that the service p rovide,where possible,sufficient deer habitat capability to maintain sustainable wolf populations emphasis added.this is an aspiration,not an obligation.because the forest service is only obligated to consider sustainability where possible,there is no law for us to apply in the agency.see heckler chaney,construing a.we agree with the district court that the provision gives the service the kind of flexibility and discretion that is consistent with its mission of balancing competing objectives.
plaintiffs argue that such broad discretion must itself be a problem if the sustainability provision merely expresses an aspiration,the forest plan must violate the nfma by failing to provide any enforceable mechanism for maintaining population minimums that comply with the viability regulations.the argument appears to be that the forest plan must set hard viability minimums like deer per square mile below which the service may not go.
this argument is neither viable nor sustainable.we aware of no authority compelling the agency to set a specific standard or benchmark for protecting the viability of a species that is neither endangered nor threatened.this makes sense when we consider our constellation of federal statutes the nfma is fundamentally different from the endangered species act,which has a focus on protecting species that are near extinction.because the alexander archipelago wolf is not entitled to such protection despite the best efforts of environmental groups its treatment is guided by the less nfma.the nfma is about managing competing uses,none to the exclusion of others.see e.
as the dissent notes,the forest plan does incorporate a superseded regulation requiring the agency to maintain viable populations of native vertebrate species.see see also supra note.but,contrary to the dissent suggestion,we have repeatedly and emphatically stressed that the service is not required to identify a specific mechanism for securing viability.we have rejected the idea that the service must assess population viability in terms of actual population size,population trends,or the population dynamics of other species even if such methods are desirable,they are flatly not required.inland empire pub.lands council forest,cir.indeed,we are especially deferential when questions of scientific methodology are involved,like how to protect viability.id.at.more recently,our en banc opinion in lands council mcnair again made clear that courts may not require a particular type of proof that a project would maintain a species population.at.instead,an agency need only supply a rational connection between the facts found and the conclusions made.or.nat.res.council fund brong,cir.citation and quotation marks omitted.this rational connection can be supplied with studies or models or experts or really any legitimate evidence,so long as the agency describes a reasonable fit between its means and ends.
there no question that the agency understood and met this obligation.the record of decision specifically concludes that the forest plan will sustain viable populations of the alexander archipelago wolf.the service outlined a strategy for protecting the wolf,which included providing core habitats with low road density,maintaining wolf harvest within sustainable limits through regulations,and providing adequate deer habitat to support an abundant and stable deer population.the service extensively discussed the management and modeling concerns of alternative forest plans,and concluded that all alternatives had between a moderately high and very high probability of protecting wolf viability.the service record of decision specifically incorporates this discussion,along with a longer discussion in the forest plan.could the service discussion have been longer,better,or different perhaps.but we decline to substitute our own policy wisdom for the agency 
in short,the service met its legal obligations,and plaintiffs remaining challenges to the forest plan a potpourri of contentions that the service misinterpreted one thing or failed to consider another amount to the sort of quibbling that ca overcome our deferential standard of review.san luis water auth.jewell,cir.the forest service discussion of viability was arbitrary or capricious.
the nfma gives the forest service flexibility because the service has many different goals conservation,commerce,recreation,and so on.see e mcnair,at.the statute reflects a congressional judgment that balancing these goals calls for policy judgments judgments that often require among worthy objectives,such as wolves and logging jobs.congress left such judgments to a politically responsive agency with relevant expertise.see am.jur.public lands t he proper mix of uses within an area is left to the discretion of the forest service.depending on the circumstances,lumber might be more important than wolves.and even when wolves are more important than lumber,it might be better to build fewer roads rather than allow for more deer.courts are not to police the substance of these judgments.instead,we employ procedural tools in a nutshell,the agency must rationally explain why it did what it did.or.nat.res.council fund,at.this is the only way to structure a modern administrative state,and its emphasis on procedure will produce results that some despise.but we have an administrative procedure act,not an administrative policy act.
b.the big thorne project 
even if the forest service lawfully implemented the forest plan,it must also ensure the big thorne project is consistent with that plan.i mcnair,at.
plaintiffs claim the service failed to do this.but almost all of their arguments proceed from the same false premise as their objections to the forest plan namely,they assume that it a sustainable population that counts,rather than a viable one.and the premise is wrong for the same reason the sustainability provision of the forest plan is discretionary.the forest service must consider protecting sustainable populations where possible.if the service decides that a sustainable wolf population conflicts with other appropriate forest goals,the service has discretion to pursue those goals instead.
and that just what the forest service did.it repeatedly emphasized that it was expanding timber supply from the tongass in the service of its mandate.the service also pointed out that none of big thorne proposed land met the forest plan suggested sustainability minimums thus,these goals would have been met even in the absence of a logging plan.in the end,the service chose jobs over wolves.we have no authority to that judgment.see supra.
big thorne environmental impact statement does contain scattered references to both sustainability and viability.but plaintiffs are in suggesting that a few scattered references to sustainability a common term that deployed incautiously throughout the record and briefs can transform the service legal obligation,which is to protect viability alone to conclude that the service intended to saddle itself with an extra obligation would require us to overlook the agency numerous references to viability in the documents approving big thorne as when it concluded in its impact statement that the plan was designed to ensure the maintenance of viable populations of all vertebrate species in the tongass by means of a comprehensive approach.
because that conclusion accurately described the service legal obligations and was rationally
