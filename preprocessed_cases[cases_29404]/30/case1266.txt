in,the united states forest service approved a project to treat trees in utah fishlake national forest.its approval was made pursuant to a categorical exclusion,a streamlined process allowing minor projects to be quickly implemented so long as they have no significant effect on the environment.as a result of this decision,utah environmental congress uec appealed to the district court arguing that the project violated a number of environmental and regulatory provisions.we agree with the district court that the forest service properly implemented this project under a categorical exclusion.

background 
statutory and regulatory.national environmental policy act 
the national environmental policy act nepa requires federal agencies such as the forest service to analyze environmental consequences before initiating actions that potentially affect the environment in conducting this analysis,the forest service must prepare one of the following an environmental impact statement,an environmental assessment,or a categorical exclusion.an environmental impact statement involves the most rigorous analysis,and is required if a proposed action will significantly affect the quality of the human environment.c.
if an agency is uncertain whether the proposed action will significantly affect the environment,it may prepare a considerably less detailed environmental assessment.an environmental assessment provides sufficient evidence and analysis to determine whether a proposed project will create a significant effect on the environment.id.if so,the agency must then develop an environmental impact statement if not,the environmental assessment results in a finding of no significant impact,and no further agency action is required.id.
in certain narrow instances,however,an agency is not required to prepare either an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement.this occurs when the proposed action falls within a categorical exclusion,those actions predetermined not to individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment.id.the forest service has created a list of such categories see forest service handbook environmental policy and procedures handbook,ch,last visited march,hereinafter forest service handbook.examples include small acreage and harvesting,as well as the construction of trails,utility lines,and meteorological sampling sites.see id.
federal law limits categorical exclusions in one critical respect a proposed action is precluded from categorical exclusion if extraordinary circumstances exist such that a normally excluded action may have a significant environmental effect.extraordinary circumstances may exist,for example,where a proposed small in affects inventoried roadless areas,archaeological sites,flood plains,or federally listed threatened or endangered species habitat.forest service handbook,ch.
national forest management act 
under the national forest management act of nfma,the forest service must develop a land and resource management plan,commonly known as a forest plan,for each unit of the national forest system.a,e,g b.the forest service manages each forest unit at two different levels programmatic and project.envtl.coal.dombeck,cir.
at the programmatic level,the forest service creates general,planning goals memorialized in a forest plan.because the forest service must account for a variety of different interests,each forest plan envisions the forest will be used for multiple purposes,including outdoor recreation,range,timber,watershed,wildlife and fish,and wilderness.e.at the same time,the forest plan provides for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area.id.g b.
at the project or level,the forest service implements the forest plan by approving or disapproving particular projects using an environmental impact statement,an environmental assessment,or a categorical exclusion.projects must comply with the applicable forest plan.silverton snowmobile club forest,cir see i.
implementing regulations 
before a forest plan may be created,nfma explicitly requires the secretary of agriculture to issue regulations that set out the process for the development and revision of land management plans for units of the national forest system,and regulations that establish management planning standards and guidelines.of particular concern in this case are planning rules the forest service adopted in and revised in,codified at,which govern forest service management at both the programmatic and project levels.see generally id.in november,the forest service substantially amended these regulations,known as the planning rules,replacing them with the planning rules,codified at.
the planning rules were not immediately promulgated.instead,the new regulations contained transition provisions which provided that,beginning on november,until the promulgation of the new,final rule,the forest service should consider the best available science in implementing a forest plan.a,d.these transition provisions remained on the books until january when the new rules were finally implemented.to.the rules retained the best available science standard,requiring the responsible official to take into account the best available science by document ing how the best available science was taken into account in the planning process,and evaluating and disclosing substantial uncertainties and risks in that science.a emphasis added.
b.the seven mile project 
the seven mile spruce beetle management project seven mile project or project sitting within the acres of the fishlake national forest in utah,is located approximately miles east of richfield,utah.because it sits within the fishlake national forest,the seven mile project is governed by the fishlake forest plan the forest plan or plan.see dep t of,forest service region,land and resource management plan for the fishlake national forest,http last visited march,hereinafter forest plan.the project involves a selective harvest of mature,dead,diseased,or dying englemann spruce timber stands covering approximately acres.by implementing the project,the forest service plans to prevent an epidemic infestation of spruce beetle from spreading into adjacent stands and killing the spruce.in so doing,the forest service hopes to protect mature stands,preserve wildlife habitat,and reduce the risk of wildfire.
the forest service ultimately approved the seven mile project under categorical exclusion category in.however,consideration of this particular project had begun over five years earlier.beginning in june,the seven mile project was approved under another timber harvest categorical exclusion known as category.when a federal district court in illinois invalidated category later that year,heartwood,forest,d,the forest service opted to prepare an environmental assessment for the seven mile project,which was completed in june.the regional forester deemed this environmental assessment inadequate consequently,another draft environmental assessment for the project was prepared in september.at the same time the forest service was completing this revised environmental assessment,a new set of categorical exclusions was adopted by the department of agriculture,which included category.
category applies to small acreage projects.specifically,it excludes from nepa review commercial and noncommercial sanitation harvest of trees to control insects or disease not to exceed acres,requiring no more than mile of temporary road construction,including removal of trees and adjacent live trees as determined necessary to control the spread of insects or disease.forest service handbook,ch.
finding category would apply to the seven mile project,the fishlake national forest district ranger issued a decision memorandum in may.he concluded that category is appropriate in this situation because there are no extraordinary circumstances related to the proposed action.the district ranger replaced the original decision memorandum in october with a new memorandum,but left the project largely unmodified 
in sum,the local forest officials found that the spruce beetle infestation in the seven mile project area has escalated substantially during the past years and at least percent mortality will occur in spruce in the absence of thinning.id.at.the district manager assured that three snags per acre will be retained as well as snags containing nest cavities or offering potential nesting opportunities to provide for foraging and nesting for woodpeckers although no sensitive species are known to occur in the project area,and suitable habitat has not been found,local forest rangers will continue to survey the project area for all sensitive species during pre and activities and if any goshawk are discovered during the ongoing surveys being conducted for the northern goshawk,the forest service will act appropriately to conserve this species.id.at.
decision below 
following the forest service authorization of the seven mile project,uec filed suit in district court,alleging the forest service authorization of the seven mile project violated nepa,nfma,and the administrative procedures act apa.in april,the district court found in favor of the forest service on all claims.the district court concluded that the forest service did not act arbitrarily in applying category.furthermore,the court found that the forest service adequately monitored the management indicator species in accordance with the fishlake forest plan.in reaching these conclusions,the court held that the planning rules were not applicable to the seven mile project and instead applied the planning rules.

iii.analysis 
uec appeals the district court approval of the seven mile project raising three primary allegations of error the forest service acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to consider the cumulative impact of the seven mile project on fish and wildlife the district court improperly used the forest service transition provisions,as opposed to the planning rules,to evaluate the seven mile project and the forest service failed to collect adequate data for management indicator species in violation of the fishlake national forest plan and nepa.we discuss,and reject,each of uec contentions in the following sections.
categorical exclusion of the seven mile project 
we first address uec argument that the forest service acted arbitrarily and capriciously by authorizing the seven mile project pursuant to category exclusion.uec raises two separate claims the seven mile project should not have been categorically excluded because use of an exclusion is appropriate only when the forest service first conducts a preliminary analysis determining that the proposed project will have no significant or cumulative effects on the environment,and the existence of extraordinary circumstances here precludes categorical exclusion of the seven mile project 
cumulative impact 
uec first claim is that in order for an agency to determine whether a project may be categorically excluded,the agency must definitively determine,based on cumulative effects,whether categorical exclusion is appropriate.aplt.br.specifically,uec asserts the seven mile project should not have been categorically excluded because the forest service conducted an inadequate analysis of the project cumulative effects on the forest.uec points to three specific omissions by the forest service,which it contends,demonstrate the failure to conduct an adequate cumulative impact analysis.the forest service failed to analyze the project effect on management indicator species create an appropriate cumulative effects boundary encompassing the entire project area and areas adjacent to the project where the project effects could be perceived and analyze the project effect on sensitive species located outside the project area but nonetheless still within the cumulative effects boundary as well as analyze the impact of other projects occurring within the cumulative effects boundary.in addressing this argument,the forest service counters that uec argument would effectively render useless the purpose of categorical exclusions generally.we agree.
federal regulations define the term categorical exclusion as 
a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a federal agency in implementation of these regulations any procedures under this section shall provide for extraordinary circumstances in which a normally excluded action may have a significant environmental effect.
emphasis added.by definition,then,a categorical exclusion does not create a significant environmental effect consequently,the cumulative effects analysis required by an environmental assessment need not be performed.that assessment has already been conducted as a part of the creation of the exclusion,which uec does not challenge in this action.
because the seven mile project fell within the general confines of category,a point that uec also does not dispute,the project was predetermined to have no significant effect.under the regulation,only if extraordinary circumstances were present would the forest service need to perform further analysis in the form of an environmental assessment.see trust for historic preservation dole,noting that b y definition,categorical exclusions are categories of actions that have been predetermined not to involve significant environmental impacts,and therefore require no further agency analysis absent extraordinary circumstances.
we agree that it may be conceptually possible for a large number of small projects to collectively create conditions that could significantly effect the environment.but the regulation itself contains a provision to address that concern,namely the extraordinary circumstances exception.and the extraordinary circumstances is more than capable of addressing specific harms allegedly created by specific projects,which we turn to next.
accordingly,the forest service did not act arbitrarily in failing to conduct any cumulative effects analysis unrelated to the existence of extraordinary circumstances 
extraordinary circumstances 
uec next claims that even if the forest service was not required to do a preliminary cumulative effects analysis,the forest service nonetheless exhibited a clear error in judgment in failing to find extraordinary circumstances.to determine whether extraordinary circumstances exist,the forest service must consider if the proposed action may have a potentially significant impact on certain resource conditions.forest service handbook,ch.the resource conditions are defined in the forest service handbook as follows 
a federally listed threatened or endangered species or designated critical habitat,species proposed for federal listing or proposed critical habitat,or proposed critical habitat,or forest service sensitive species.
b floodplains,wetlands,or municipal watersheds.
c congressionally designated areas such as wilderness,wilderness study areas,or national recreation areas.
d inventoried roadless areas.
e research natural areas.
f american indians and alaska natives religious or cultural sites.
g archaeological sites,or historic properties or areas.
here,uec claims subpart a is triggered because the seven mile project will have guaranteed effects on the woodpecker and the northern goshawk.aplt.br.therefore,uec argues,the forest service was required to perform an environmental assessment.in particular,uec claims the forest service,while finding no impact on the northern goshawk,conceded in its decision memorandum that the project may affect the woodpecker.in light of the forest service uncertainty,uec argues,it should invoke the extraordinary circumstances exception.the forest service,on the other hand,interprets the applicable regulations to require a significant environmental effect,not just any effect as asserted by uec.
the regulatory language guides our analysis.in general,environmental regulations do not place a heavy burden on federal agencies to detail actions which will have only insignificant effects on the health of the environment.for example,a detailed statement by the responsible official on the environmental impact of a proposed action is required only for federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment c emphasis added see,july,noting that the forest service scarce resources should be concentrated on major federal actions and not expend ed analyzing agency actions where experience has demonstrated the insignificance of effects emphasis added.
the analysis is no different with regard to the forest service use of categorical exclusions.as we already discussed,the presence of an extraordinary circumstance precludes the application of a categorical exclusion.and such a circumstance exists only where a proposed action may have a significant environmental effect.emphasis added forest service handbook,ch.zero code,see defining categorical exclusion as a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment emphasis added.
this language plainly requires that an action first may produce a significant effect before a federal agency engage in further analysis.this is only logical given the substantial analytical and evidentiary burdens triggered when a project is ineligible for categorical exclusion.by relying on categorical exclusions,the forest service promotes efficiency in its nepa review process while avoiding unnecessary analysis.see fund for animals babbitt,cir noting that t he counsel on environmental quality has authorized the use of categorical exclusions to promote efficiency in the nepa review process.
uec contends that despite this provision,an effect need not be significant,but merely predicted by the forest service,to trigger extraordinary circumstances.thus,even a de minimis effect on a threatened species would bar application of the exclusion.in support of this proposition,it cites two statements from the forest service handbook.first,the handbook notes that t he mere presence of one or more resource conditions does not preclude use of a categorical exclusion instead,i t is the degree of the potential effect of a proposed action on these resource conditions that determines whether extraordinary circumstances exist.forest service handbook,ch,emphasis added.second,the handbook requires the forest service to prepare an environmental assessment if,based on its evaluation,it is uncertain whether the proposed action may have a significant effect on the environment.id.emphasis added see noting that the term significantly as used in nepa requires consideration of both context and intensity one intensity factor considered is the degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks.
while it is true that the handbook refers to the degree of the potential effect of a proposed action on a resource condition,the regulation itself requires the potential for a significant environmental effect.we must interpret the language found in the handbook in light of the entire regulation and its accompanying policy.see united states shewmaker,cir quoting mastro plastics nlrb.in expounding a statute,we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but look to the provisions of the whole law,and to its object and policy.we must also be careful not to disrupt the plain language of the regulation itself.see hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d w hen the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.internal quotation marks omitted.considering the purpose of categorical exclusions in light of these factors and affording the agency interpretation substantial deference,we conclude that an extraordinary circumstance is found only when there exists a potential for a significant effect on a resource condition.see citizens comm.to save our canyons forest,cir when reviewing an agency interpretation and application of its categorical exclusions under the arbitrary and capricious standard,courts are deferential.
in this light,we review uec contention that the forest service erred in evaluating whether the seven mile project would significantly affect the woodpecker and the northern goshawk.the forest service found that although the seven mile project will have no impact on the northern goshawk,it may affect,but is not likely to result in a trend toward federal listing or loss of viability for the woodpecker.
although uec argues the forest service expressed uncertainty with regard to the two species,the forest service decision can hardly be construed to express such doubt.in evaluating the seven mile project effect on the northern goshawk,the forest service relied on helicopter and ground surveys documenting and confirming the lack of goshawk habitat in the proposed area.id.at.explaining the lack of effect on the woodpecker,the forest service stated that while it may impact individuals,individual territories,and cause displacement within the project area,the project would not contribute to a trend towards federal listing or a loss of population viability,id.at,since adequate woodpecker habitat would be preserved throughout the forest,and the project would provide some habitat improvements where intermediate harvesting or occurred.id.at.
these conclusions were based on a review of the species and habitat conducted as a part of the analysis leading to the agency decision memorandum,including a biological evaluation of both species.id.at.additionally,the species monitoring performed by the forest service,although not consistently conducted on an annual basis,was more than ample to determine whether extraordinary circumstances existed.see id.at helicopter surveys of goshawk nests for years id.at surveys for goshawk for years,and id.at surveys for woodpeckers for years,id.at survey for woodpeckers for year 
in sum,although the forest service found some possible effects,none were potentially significant.as the handbook clearly states,t he mere presence of one or more of these resource conditions does not preclude use of a categorical exclusion.because we afford the forest service substantial deference in interpreting its own regulations and because the agency exhibited no clear error of judgment in its factual determinations,we find that the forest service has not acted arbitrarily in concluding the seven mile project did not trigger a finding of extraordinary circumstances.
accordingly,the forest service did not violate the apa when it categorically excluded the seven mile project.
and nfma regulations 
we next address uec contention that the district court should have applied the planning rules,instead of the transition provisions,when reviewing the forest service compliance with the regulations species monitoring requirements.uec argues two points the transition provisions were not effective at the time of the project implementation and even if the transition provisions were in effect,the fishlake forest plan incorporates the regulations for purposes of projects considered in the fishlake national forest.the forest service disputes both arguments,contending the transition provisions were effective for purposes of the project and that the forest plan species monitoring program is independent of the rules.
deciding whether the regulations apply to the project,either of their own accord or by virtue of the forest plan,is important because the regulations and the transition provisions contain key differences governing species monitoring.the rules,for example,require the forest service to monitor the p opulation trends of the management indicator species and determine relationships to habitat changes.a.and we have held that these obligations apply to project level as well as plan level management actions.uec i,at.conversely,the transition provisions contain no such explicit language governing monitoring but merely require the responsible official to consider the best available science in implementing a forest plan.a,d.see generally utah envtl.cong.bosworth,cir uec ii quoting forest watch forest,cir,for the proposition that the standards of the rules and the transitional rule.
implementation of the transition provisions 
we begin with uec first argument the transition provisions,although implemented in november,are nonetheless inapplicable to the seven mile project.
to be sure,courts have expressed considerable confusion in applying the transition provisions.see.they have reached varying conclusions regarding the applicability of the provisions to projects approved during the transition period.see,uec ii,at,applying the rules because the forest service conceded their applicability the court noted it did not resolve the question of the transition provisions applicability forest watch,at holding that the plain language of the transitional rule requires that projects implemented during the transition period must comply with the best available science standard natural res.def.council forest,cir holding that the applicable nfma planning regulations are those in effect at the time the plan revisions challenged in this lawsuit were prepared defenders of wildlife johanns,wl,at,unpublished opinion applying natural resources to conclude that the interpretative rule may continue to be applied in cases where the challenged action was taken during the interpretative rule effective period clinch coal.damon,d,suggesting the planning rule would apply to a decision shawnee trail conservancy nicholas,d,noting that o n november,the department of agriculture made wholesale changes to the relevant regulations,making prior citations obsolete.
in an attempt to address this confusion,the forest service issued an interpretative rule on september.introducing the rule,the forest service explained 
i t is clear that decisions entered into during the transition period are not to comply with the substantive provisions of the planning rule.this interpretative rule clarifies that until a new final rule is promulgated,the transition provisions of the planning rule,as amended by the may interim final rule remain in effect 
the interpretative provision emphasized that responsible officials consider the best available science in implementing national forest land management plans and,as appropriate,plan amendments.id.
as to the continuing vitality of the provisions 
t he planning rule may continue to be used only for plan amendments and revisions upon election of the responsible official.appropriate plan amendments and projects proposed during the transition period should be developed considering the best available science in accordance with paragraph a 
id.as we explained in uec ii,the regulations rendered the rule inoperative for decisions made after november.the interpretative rule stated that,during the transition period between november and promulgation of a final rule,the forest service should use the best available science under a for project decisions.uec ii,at.
we afford an agency interpretation of its own regulations substantial deference,olenhouse,at,except in those instances where such interpretation is unreasonable,plainly erroneous,or inconsistent with the regulation plain meaning.bar mk ranches,at.we recognize,of course,that although interpretative rules can inform our decision,they do not have the force and effect of law in the adjudicatory process.shalala guernsey mem l,d.
in conducting our analysis,then,we are guided primarily by the plain meaning of the transition provisions as well as the forest service interpretative rule however,before looking at this language,it is important to distinguish the terms used to define a forest plan generally from those used to define specific projects implemented under a forest plan.this distinction is crucial because the transition provisions endorse different standards for forest plans generally and individual projects in particular.thus,when the forest service employs the term plan,as in plan amendments and revisions,plan refers to forest plans generally.on the other hand,when the forest service uses the term project or implementing the plan,the term refers to individual projects.
with this distinction in mind,we turn to the text.the transition provisions mandate that d uring the transition period,the responsible official must consider the best available science in implementing the current plan.a emphasis added b if,as of november,a plan revision or amendment has been initiated under the planning regulations the responsible official may complete the amendment or revision process under the regulations emphasis added.this language is the sole direction to the forest service regarding actions.nonetheless,it leaves little doubt that the forest service is limited to consideration of the best available science when approving a project during the transition period.the interpretative rule confirms this interpretation,stating in no uncertain terms that projects proposed during the transition period should be developed considering the best available science,emphasis added.while it is true that interpretative rules are not legally binding on this court,an agency interpretation should be given substantial deference unless the interpretation is plainly erroneous.here,the interpretative rule clearly concludes the rules are no longer applicable for projects proposed during the transition period.thus,any projects proposed during the transition period must conform with the best available science standard set forth in the transition provisions.
while there may be many different interpretations for the term proposed,under any definition we would conclude that the seven mile project was proposed during the transition period.the district ranger gave his final approval to the project in october,well within the transition period.but even if we looked to the time the forest service issued its first decision memorandum,that takes us back only to may.to be sure,initial evaluation of the project began in.but this initial evaluation is irrelevant to the ultimate discretion exercised by the forest service.the forest service previous two attempts to create the seven mile project,first by categorical exclusion and later by environmental assessment,both unequivocally rejected by the regional forester,do not bear on the decision.category was not created until.the forest service did not begin a proposal under category until april.because the agency action arose from a categorical exclusion not developed until and because the transition provisions were clearly in place at that time,the rules are not applicable.
as a final matter,the interpretative rule would have constrained the forest service conduct in this instance.the interpretative rule was issued on september.the final authorization of the seven mile project occurred in october.as the interpretative rule clarifies,t he provisions of the planning rule may continue to be used only for plan amendments and revisions upon election of the responsible official.appropriate plan amendments and projects proposed during the transition period should be developed considering the best available science,emphasis added see,noting that the interim rule allowed forest service managers to elect to continue preparing plan amendments and revisions under the planning rule emphasis added.while our court may not be bound by the interpretative rule,certainly the agency itself is.in this respect,then,beginning on september,the date the interpretative rule was issued,the forest service was obligated to consider the best available science,and not the rules,in its implementation of the seven mile project.in other words,the section of the rules which imposed an obligation on the forest service to monitor management indicator species over the life of a project,see uec i,at,simply could not have any effect as to those actions taken after the interpretative rule was issued.
effect of the fishlake forest plan 
finally,uec argues that the fishlake forest plan incorporated the regulations as its governing provision,as evidenced by the forest plan detailed species monitoring requirements.the regulations,uec argues,must therefore be followed even if they have been subsequently repealed or modified.we disagree.
no party disputes that the forest plan envisions a species monitoring program for the fishlake national forest.it identifies,for example,several management indicator species and states in its implementation chapter that the forest service will use population trends for management indicator species monitoring.however,the forest plan does not explicitly require that the forest service comply with the monitoring requirements of the rules.nor can such an obligation be reasonably implied.according to the fishlake forest plan,it was developed under implementing regulations of title,code of federal regulations,part record of decision for fishlake national forest plan,at.yet,an extensive search of the forest plan reveals that it does not explicitly reference or adopt of the rules,concerning the selection and monitoring of management indicator species therefore,we can not read the forest plan to adopt the rules.
that is not to say,however,that the forest plan does not include some requirements related to monitoring.it does.and the forest service must comply with the fishlake forest plan during the transition period.see i resource plans and permits,contracts,and other instruments for the use and occupancy of national forest system lands shall be consistent with the land management plans.ohio forestry ass sierra club,d opining that before the forest service can begin a project,it must ensure that the project is consistent with the applicable plan see also f for units with plans in effect prior to november,the responsible official may comply with any obligations relating to management indicator species by considering data and analysis relating to habitat unless the plan specifically requires population monitoring or population surveys for the species,requiring p rojects implementing land management plans to be consistent with the provisions of the governing plan.but,it is only those requirements that arise solely from the forest plan,not from the rules,to which the forest service must adhere.
in sum,the planning rules are not applicable to the seven mile project.instead,the project is subject to the transition provisions of the planning rules as interpreted by the forest service.accordingly,in implementing a project under the forest plan,the forest service must consider the best available science.a since uec does not argue that the forest service failed to consider the best available science when it implemented the seven mile project,we find no error in the district court order affirming the agency decision.
c.the fishlake forest plan monitoring program 
finally,we address uec challenge alleging the forest service failed to comply with the fishlake forest plan because it neither conducted annual population trend surveys nor collected adequate population trend data for multiple management indicator species.in essence,uec argues that the forest plan requires the collection of annual population trend data as a condition precedent to the approval of the seven mile project.
although conceding that individual projects must be consistent with the applicable forest plan,the forest service contends it was not required to monitor management indicator species as a condition precedent to approval of the project.it justifies this assertion with two separate arguments a court may only review a claim of inadequate species monitoring under a forest plan if some relationship exists between the required monitoring and the challenged project and the fishlake forest plan does not require data collection at the.in any event,the forest service argues,the compiled population trend data satisfied the monitoring obligations under the plan.
we agree with the forest service that monitoring of management indicator species was not a condition precedent to approval of the seven mile project.in so holding,we conclude that the fishlake forest plan does not require the application of its monitoring requirements to a categorically excluded project,and in any case,the forest service conducted mis monitoring as set forth in the plan.
application of a forest plan monitoring requirements to a categorically excluded project 
as we have already noted,our jurisdiction in this case arises under the apa,since neither nepa nor nfma provide uec a private cause of action.under the apa,a case may only be ripe for review if the federal conduct at question constitutes a final agency action.farm bureau fed forest,cir.
ordinarily,a forest plan monitoring program is not subject to judicial review because it does not constitute final agency action.ecology,forest,cir see also norton utah wilderness alliance,d holding that bureau of land management failure to implement an vehicle monitoring program was not a final agency action.in limited circumstances,however,we may review a monitoring program to the extent it bears on the approval of a particular project.see ecology,at concluding that plaintiff may raise claims pertaining to inadequate monitoring by bringing an apa challenge to a final decision neighbors of cuddy mountain alexander,cir of course,not all practices may be challenged on the coattails of a action there must be a relationship between the lawfulness of the action and the practice challenged.in other words,if a project approval is conditioned upon the fulfillment of certain monitoring obligations,a plaintiff may bring a claim of deficient monitoring.without such a relationship,a claim of deficient monitoring simply is not cognizable.
uec has not shown a connection between the monitoring program and the seven mile project.more fundamentally,no showing has been made that the applicable forest service regulations and directives conditioned approval of the seven mile project,a project proposed pursuant to a categorical exclusion,on the successful monitoring of management indicator species at either a or project level.
a categorical exclusion,by definition,only covers projects that will have no significant or cumulative effect on the environment.as such,relatively little analysis is required of the forest service once it determines that a project fits within the four corners of a categorical exclusion.this is because the forest service previously did the heavy lifting when it created the categorical conducted an extensive environmental analysis and determined that any project approved under a categorical exclusion would not produce a significant or cumulative effect on the environment in the absence of extraordinary circumstances.see.wild forest,cir explaining that the forest service performed,assessments of the sample projects environmental effects in order to determine whethe
