on april,pursuant to the above authorization,newhall filed a combined petition and complaint against castaic and other defendants in the los angeles county superior court.no.
on june,castaic attorney sent newhall a letter asserting that the newhall board violated sections and.castaic contended the newhall board violated the brown act on march,because none of newhall meeting agendas preceding the filing of the april,lawsuit provided public notice that the newhall board would be meeting in closed session pursuant to subdivision d of section.castaic letter also contended the newhall board violated the brown act by failing to properly disclose in an open meeting the item s to be discussed in closed session and by failing to properly report the action taken during the closed session castaic letter demanded that the newhall board cease and desist its alleged violations of the brown act and cure or correct the violations by dismissing the lawsuit filed april.
on july,the newhall board posted another notice and agenda of regular meeting of the board of directors of newhall county water district,notifying the public that the newhall board planned to hold a regular meeting on july.the july,notice contained,inter alia,items i and 
item i thereof provided closed session.conference with legal counsel anticipated litigation significant exposure to litigation pursuant to paragraph of subdivision d of section one case threat of litigation in june,letter from castaic counsel.conference with legal counsel pursuant to government code section d,paragraph to discuss pending litigation newhall county water district castaic lake water agency,et,los angeles county superior court case no.

at the july,meeting,the newhall board voted to ratify its decision to initiate the lawsuit against castaic.
proceedings.
castaic petition to invalidate the newhall board decision in closed session on march,which authorized the filing of the underlying lawsuit against castaic.
on july,castaic commenced the instant action by filing a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive relief alleging violations of the brown act.castaic sought a determination that newhall decision to initiate the underlying lawsuit,and the resulting petition and complaint filed april,were null and void due to noncompliance with the act.castaic sought to enjoin newhall from taking any further action in that litigation except for the filing of a request for dismissal.
newhall motion to dismiss castaic lawsuit.
on september,newhall filed a motion to dismiss castaic petition for writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive relief.newhall contended its decision to initiate its lawsuit was a valid action under the brown act and not subject to being determined null and void because newhall subsequently cured or corrected any alleged failure to give proper notice of its closed session to authorize the lawsuit by placing the matter on a subsequent agenda for open session,with full notice to the public of the action to be considered and an opportunity for public comment,before taking any action.therefore,newhall urged that castaic action should be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to section,subdivision e 
castaic opposition to the dismissal motion.
in opposition,castaic argued the cure for actions taken in violation of the brown act is to declare the action null and void.to allow newhall to continue an action taken in violation of the brown act without declaring the action null and void defies logic.newhall creative yet illogical attempt to ratify actions taken in violation of the brown act is contrary to public policy and eviscerates the purpose and enforceability of the brown act.
trial court ruling.
on december,the matter came on for hearing.the trial court granted newhall dismissal motion,ruling that newhall adequately cured and corrected its technical violation of the brown act.the trial court reasoned although section of the brown act does not specify how a legislative body is to go about curing and correcting an alleged brown act violation,the court does not agree with castaic narrow interpretation of subdivision e s cured and corrected requirement.here,newhall failed to comply with the technical requirements of sections a and of the brown act when the newhall board indicated on its march,notice that it intended to meet in closed session pursuant to section c as opposed to d,even though the march,notice indicated that the closed session meeting was to be held to discuss potential litigation in all other respects,item h of the march,notice satisfied the requirements of sections a and of the brown act after receiving the demand letter from castaic counsel,the newhall board decided it would attempt to cure and correct the march,notice deficiency by issuing the july,notice,which cited the proper subdivision of of the brown act,and holding an open session meeting with public comment to determine whether the newhall board would ratify and go forward with its decision to initiate litigation against castaic.
castaic contends the only way newhall could have cured the violation was to declare the march,action null and void and reinitiate the process of determining whether to bring a lawsuit against castaic.in making this argument,castaic relies on moreno city of king th,d,where the court held that a city council did not properly cure and correct its brown act violation by attempting to post notice of a closed session meeting for the first time after the brown act violation occurred.this court does not find that the decision in moreno requires a finding that newhall failed to properly cure the technical brown act violation at issue here.
the trial court further found that the agendas and minutes for the march,and july,meetings notified the public that newhall intended to,and did,meet in closed session to discuss potential litigation at the march,regular meeting newhall actions not only provided adequate notice of the newhall board intent to reconsider the march,action taken in closed session,but they also provided castaic with the opportunity to voice its objection to the newhall board decision to file a lawsuit against castaic,an opportunity castaic would not have had if newhall conducted the closed session proce
