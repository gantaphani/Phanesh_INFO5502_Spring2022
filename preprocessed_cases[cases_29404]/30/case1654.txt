plaintiff residents against specific plan appellant appeals from a judgment denying its petition for a writ of mandate challenging the decision of the county of riverside county to approve development of a community put forward as specific plan by real party in interest,hanna marital trust.
the county commissioned an environmental impact report eir on the project,which determined all potentially significant environmental impacts except noise and air quality impacts would be reduced below the level of significance after mitigation.the final eir responded to public comments on a draft eir requesting further mitigation before the county approved the project.the riverside county board of supervisors board of supervisors requested modifications of the plan before approving it and determined the changes did not require revision and recirculation of the eir.after the revisions were codified,the board of supervisors certified the final eir and approved the plan.the county then posted a public notice of its determination which included a description of the project containing errors about certain project details.
appellant sought a writ of mandate in the trial court asserting the county failed to comply with procedural,informational,and substantive provisions of the california environmental quality act ceqa.pub.resources code,et the trial court denied the petition in its entirety and entered judgment in favor of the county and the hanna marital trust.
on appeal,appellant contends we should reverse the judgment and direct the trial court to grant its petition on the grounds the county substantially modified the project after approving it approved the project without concurrently adopting findings,a statement of overriding consideration,and a mitigation plan failed to recirculate the final eir after modifying the project certified the final eir despite inadequately analyzing the impacts of the development of the mixed use planning area issued an erroneous and misleading notice of determination after approving the project and failed to adopt all feasible mitigation alternatives proposed in comments on the draft eir.we affirm.
factual backgrounda.overview of the keller crossing project 
the keller crossing specific plan project project proposes a community with residential,mixed use,commercial,and open space components on approximately acres of land in the french valley region of riverside county.the site is undeveloped approximately percent is used for agricultural purposes and the rest supports native and naturalized vegetation.state route borders the project to the east,pourroy road to the west,and foothills to the north.keller road runs through the southern portion of the site.
residences occupy the area to the south and west of the site.residences and agricultural land occupy the area to its east.the area to the north is undeveloped,but approved for residential development and some mixed uses under a different specific plan.
the hanna family has owned the site since.in february,the hanna marital trust trust began the approval process to allow development of homes,retail shops,a family entertainment center,a neighborhood commercial center,medical offices,a medical center,and space.
the project,as approved by the board of supervisors on november,includes a general plan amendment gpa,a change of zone cz,and a specific plan specific plan.gpa amended the riverside county general plan land use element by changing the riverside county general plan foundation component designation from rural foundation to community development and the land use designation from rural residential to commercial retail,mixed use,residential,residential,residential,and open space conservation.cz changed the zoning classification to those required to implement specific plan.
specific plan,as approved,divides the site into seven geographical sections planning areas or pas,which include three residential units,residential units,residential units,acres of mixed uses,up to square feet of commercial uses,acres of dedicated open space,and acres for roads and supporting infrastructure.figure shows the final approved disposition of uses.

b.the draft eir and the notice and comment period 
on july,the riverside county planning department planning department announced the release of a draft eir,describing the project and notifying interested parties where copies of the draft eir and supporting documents would be available.the planning department set a public review period from august to september,and indicated written comments received during the review period would be included in the final eir.
the draft eir evaluated a version of the plan which proposed breaking the site into eight planning areas,with areas dedicated to commercial offices,commercial retail establishments,and residential units.one planning area was dedicated to mixed uses,including both residential and commercial uses,and another set aside land for open space conservation.the draft eir specified the acreage for each planning area and allocated uses among them as set out in table.
table area use acres units footage pa commercial office,pa commercial retail pa commercial office pa low density residential pa medium density residential pa mixed use pa commercial retail pa open space conservation roads totals 
the draft eir incorporated an analysis of the proposed project potentially significant environmental impacts and proposed measures to mitigate them.the report concluded w ith the exception for air quality and noise,all significant impacts would be reduced to below a level of significance following implementation of the mitigation measures.with respect to air quality,the draft report concluded emissions from project construction would exceed regional criteria pollutant thresholds for certain kinds of emissions.the report identified measures to mitigate those effects,but concluded the air quality effects during construction and operation would be significant and unmitigable.
the planning department received comment letters during the public review period.the letters came from public agencies,native american tribes,and public utilities.the planning department responded to the comments and in some instances incorporated changes in the final report.among those letters,were comments from the south coast air quality management district scaqmd and the city of temecula.
scaqmd expressed concern about the project air quality impacts and requested the planning department require mitigation that reduces local resident exposure to construction related emissions and reduces the project operational emissions from new vehicular trips generated by the project.scaqmd asked for revisions of mitigation measure,which required contractors to use california air resources board carb tier equipment or better for dozers,loaders,and scrapers.scaqmd asked instead that,between january,and december,construction equipment greater than horsepower meet tier emissions standards,construction equipment be outfitted with best available control technology devices,and emissions control devices achieve emissions reductions not less than what could be achieved by a level diesel emissions control strategy for a similarly sized engine as defined by carb regulations.after january,scaqmd requested construction equipment greater than horsepower meet the tier emission standards,where available.
the city of temecula also requested additional measures designed to further mitigate air quality impacts.temecula pointed out mitigation measure specifies the project will be required to exceed the title energy codes,but suggested it should comply with current california energy code and should also consider,as reasonable mitigation measures,compliance with the california green building standards to further reduce the impacts of the proposed project.additionally,the proposed project should consider prescriptive mitigation measures such as attic fans,whole house fans,and photovoltaic,solar water heaters.
c.the final eir 
the county released the final eir in january.the final eir included the following map figure showing the allocation of land uses among the planning areas.
tabular or graphical material not displayable at this time.
the final eir evaluated a version of the plan in its basics identical with the plan evaluated in the draft eir.the plan proposed breaking the same acre project site into the same eight planning areas.like the plan evaluated in the draft eir,it dedicated acres to commercial office uses in planning areas and,acres to commercial retail uses in planning areas and,acres to residential uses in planning area,acres to residential uses in planning area,acres to mixed uses in planning area,acres to open space conservation in planning area,and acres to roads.also as in the draft eir,the residential area would accommodate residential units,the residential area would accommodate residential units,and the mixed use area would accommodate residential units,for a total of residential units.the plan also provided for the same square feet of commercial retail space and square feet of commercial office space,for a total of square feet dedicated to commercial uses.
the final eir describes the kind of development allowed in each planning area.in planning areas and,t he commercial office designation would allow for a variety of administrative and professional office uses,including,but not limited to,business,law,medical,dental,chiropractic,architectural,engineering,and real estate offices.in addition,commercial office areas would be suitable for health and exercise centers or gyms hotels and motels restaurants banks and financial institutions day care centers and churches,temples,and other places of religious worship.other uses may be permitted at the discretion of the county planning director.planning area is anticipated to develop as a series of smaller office buildings,rather than a large office park.planning area would be appropriate for development of a contiguous office park however,the planning area could be further divided into smaller parcels to accommodate a variety of smaller office complexes.
in planning areas and,t he commercial retail designation would allow for the development of commercial retail uses at a neighborhood,community or regional level,as well as for professional office and commercial uses.planning area is anticipated to be developed with a neighborhood shopping center that may include a grocery store,drug store,and other locally serving shops.planning area is intended to accommodate development at a community or regional level,as well as professional office and commercial uses.other uses,such as hotels,recreation and amusement facilities,and those outlined in the commercial tourist land use designation of the riverside county general plan,would be permitted.
in planning area,the residential designation would allow for the development of up to dwelling units on acres proposed residential units would be comprised of,detached homes minimum lots.intensive would be discouraged within the low density residential land use designation however,limited agriculture would be permitted.the foothill trail would traverse the northern portion of this planning area within the interface and fuel modification zone,between the proposed developed areas and planning area.enclosure fences and signs would be installed along the interface where residential development abuts open space.
up to,detached residences on minimum lots would be allowed in planning area planning area would include an activity center near planning area.the activity center may consist of one or more of the following community gardens,picnic tables,barbeques,a dog park,a play area or tot lot,shade structures.in addition,the foothill trail would traverse the northern portion of this planning area within the interface and fuel modification zone,between the proposed residences and planning area.
planning area would be designated as mixed use.it may provide for the development of a ccrc continuing care retirement community,which would allow seniors to age in place,with flexible accommodations that are designed to meet their health and housing needs as such needs change over time.the final eir specifies the ccrc may include independent living units,assisted living units,a skilled nursing facility with beds,and a memory care facility with beds.the final eir notes planning area is not required to develop as a ccrc.should this planning area not be developed with a ccrc,other commercial or residential land uses may be developed if they are compatible with the adjacent planning areas,and if no additional environmental impacts would occur based on review by the county.
finally,the final eir says in planning area acres percent of the specific plan area would be designated as open space conservation and would remain as permanent natural open space.planning area would contribute open space land to proposed constrained linkage of the western riverside county habitat conservation plan.the proposed project has received a habitat acquisition negotiation strategy hans determination letter from the regional conservation authority rca,concurring with the partial conservation proposed by the specific plan.vegetation communities to be preserved within planning area include riversidean sage scrub,grassland,and agricultural land.no trails,hiking,or biking would be permitted within planning area.
like the draft eir,the final eir concluded the plan mitigation measures would reduce all environmental impacts below a level of significance,except for air quality and noise impacts.the final eir concluded emissions from project construction would exceed regional criteria pollutant thresholds for emissions of volatile organic compounds vocs,nitrogen oxides nox,particulate matter that is microns or smaller,and particulate matter that is microns or smaller.the report also concluded emissions during the operation of phases and of the project would exceed pollutant thresholds for vocs,co,and nox,and during the operation of phase would also exceed the threshold for.the report also concluded emissions from construction activities would exceed the localized pollutant thresholds for and at receptors located within and feet from construction activities.though the plan set out several mitigation measures for each problem,the report concluded each would remain significant even after mitigation.
regarding the noise impacts,the final eir concluded i mplementation of the project would result in temporary noise impacts related to construction equipment and activities.the plan includes several mitigation measures.however,the final eir concluded the noise impacts would remain significant and unmitigable,even after taking those measures into account.
the final eir incorporated the comments discussed in part,ante,and included responses to each.first,scaqmd recommended the planning department revise mitigation measure to require contractors to use construction equipment meeting tier and later tier emission standards instead of tier standards.the county responded mitigation measure reflects the construction equipment that is anticipated to be reasonably available at the time of project construction.as the applicant does not anticipate the reasonable availability of equipment meeting the more stringent requirements proposed by scaqmd,these have not been incorporated into the required mitigation measures.
second,the city of temecula recommended the project comply with california energy code.the county agreed the project will need to comply with the california energy code in effect at the time of construction,and responded t his standard requirement does not conflict with mitigation measure requirement that the project exceed the california title,part energy efficiency standards by a minimum of percent.as such standards are rapidly evolving,the code was chosen as the basis of comparison,rather than requiring conformance to a code that is likely to be out of date when the project is constructed.
third,the city of temecula recommended the plan require compliance with the california green building standards and prescriptive mitigation measures,such as attic fans,whole house fans,and photovoltaic,solar water heaters.the planning department said a performance standard was adopted,rather than prescriptive mitigation measures to allow the applicant to tailor implementation to best fit the final project design and technology available at construction.
modifications to specific plan after the final eir 
planning commission modifications 
on april,the riverside county planning commission planning commission took up specific plan and the final eir.
at the hearing,commissioner petty proposed several changes.after hearing these proposals and other plan matters,the planning commission voted to continue the hearing on the project to allow revisions.the trust revised the land use plan to address some of those issues,and on october,planning staff and the trust presented the revisions.
the revised plan included changes to four planning areas.planning area,which had been designated for development of square feet of commercial office space,would be designated for residential development specifically six lots.planning area would keep its designation for development of commercial office space,but all buildings in its southern portion abutting keller road would be limited to two stories in height.planning area would keep its designation for residential development,but lots at the western edge of the area,next to pourroy road,would be no more than half an acre in size,no smaller than feet wide,and would not have access to pourroy road.planning area would remain designated for mixed use development,but unrestricted development would not be allowed.retail uses would be restricted to small shops,such as a pharmacy,sandwich shop,or stationery store,to service the neighborhood.instead of requiring a buffer of residential development on the edge of planning area next to the open space conservation zone,the revised plan proposed to include a fuel modification zone.
planning staff and the trust presented a report by the county environmental consulting firm analyzing whether the changes to the plan required recirculating the final eir.the report says the modifications would not change the project effects on agricultural,biological,cultural or paleontological resources,or geology and soils because they do not change the project footprint.it says reduction in the scale of development would reduce aesthetic impacts,greenhouse gas emissions,impacts related to the compatibility between the project and existing uses,as well as incrementally decrease impacts on air quality,utility use,and traffic.finally,it says water quality impacts would be the same or slightly reduced and noise impacts would be consistent with those previously described in the final eir.
the report concludes the modifications would not create new significant environmental impacts or substantially increase the severity of environmental impacts,and would reduce the severity of some environmental impacts.it also concludes there were no additional considerably different feasible project alternatives or mitigation measures that would lessen significant environmental impacts.as a result,it concluded the county was not required to recirculate the final eir.
after the presentation,the planning commission voted to recommend approval of the plan with the modifications to the board of supervisors.
board of supervisors modifications 
the board of supervisors took up the revised specific plan,gpa,and cz on december.
the day before the meeting,more than a year after the comment period for the draft eir,counsel for appellant submitted a letter containing comments on the final eir and specific plan with numerous recommendations and complaints about the project and the final eir.relevant to this appeal,it reiterates the air quality mitigation proposals in the comments submitted by the scaqmd and the city of temecula.appellant also proposed to mitigate the noise impacts of project construction by installing temporary noise barriers,using only electric construction equipment where feasible,prohibiting construction vehicles from idling for longer than three minutes,resurfacing roads,banning trucks near vibration sensitive uses,and using rubberized asphalt.
at the hearing,after additional public comment,supervisor stone recommended further plan modifications.the board of supervisors voted to have planning staff implement those changes and return to present the revised plan a week later.
planning staff and the trust made revisions to the plan affecting five of its areas.planning area was redesigned to reduce the number of lots.planning area was designated for residential development,allowing for the development of to homes.planning area would remain residential,accommodate up to homes with lots of half an acre or larger,and lots at its western edge two acres or larger with no access to pourroy road.planning areas residential and mixed use would be combined and the new planning area would be designated for mixed use development.reductions in allowable development in planning areas,and could be transferred to the new planning area.
these modifications did not change the footprint of the project or alter the number of residential units or the allowable square footage for commercial development analyzed in the final eir.the purpose and effect of the modifications was to move denser development away from existing residential areas by moving it from the western and southern edges of the project into the center of the project.
a report by the county environmental planning consultant again analyzed whether the changes to the plan required recirculating the final eir.the report says the modifications would not change the project effects on agricultural,cultural or paleontological resources,hazardous materials,or geology and soils because the modifications do not change the project footprint or scope of uses.it also says the modifications would not result in a new significant impact or change in the severity of impact related to population projections,housing element consistency,public services,and recreation because the modifications would not change the number of allowable residential units or space allotted to commercial development.the report says relocating denser uses adjacent to existing residential areas to the center of the site would reduce the aesthetic and land uses compatibility impacts of the project.
the report indicates the modifications would not change greenhouse gas emissions,impacts on air quality,noise,or traffic,and would leave unchanged or slightly reduce impacts on hydrology and water quality.finally,the report says the potential use in the northwestern portion of the development area would be modified from medium density residential to mixed use,which would be consistent with the use previously analyzed adjacent to the central portion of the linkage.adjacency requirements identified in the western riverside multiple species habitat conservation plan would continue to apply,minimizing potential indirect impacts.thus,the proposed modifications would not change the eir conclusion that biological resource impacts would be significant but mitigable.
the report concludes the proposed modifications would cause no new significant environmental impacts,would not substantially increase the severity of existing impacts,and in some cases would reduce their severity.it also concludes there are no additional feasible project alternatives or mitigation measures that would clearly lessen significant environmental impacts.as a result,the report concludes,the county was not required to recirculate the final eir.
after the presentation,the planning staff recommended approval of the project with those changes incorporated.the board of supervisors voted to accept the planning department recommendation to tentatively certify the final eir,approve specific plan,gpa,and the change of zone.
e.the specific plan after modification and final project approval 
between december and may,the trust and planning staff worked together to finalize the modifications to the plan.during that period,planning staff responded to inquiries about the status of the project from counsel for appellant,telling them they were working with the trust to redraft the final exhibits before the board of supervisors acted to amend the general plan,certify the final eir,adopt the specific plan,and amend the zoning ordinance.
in may,the trust submitted the final version of specific plan to the county.the final plan incorporated the changes presented at the december,hearing.it combined former planning areas and,located at the center of the project site,and increased the density of development allowed in the new,expanded planning area.it designated planning area for residential development vldr,permitting only three lots,and reinstated the square feet of commercial office space originally designated for planning area to the new planning area.the revised plan also changed the designation of planning area from commercial office to residential development mdr.
the changes to specific plan had the primary effect of relocating denser uses to the center of the project site,creating a buffer of residential uses for existing residential areas to the south and west of the project.table compares the project as analyzed in the final eir with the final plan as submitted to the board of supervisors for approval.the changes do not alter the footprint of the site.nor do they change the number of residential units or the square footage of commercial development.instead,they reduce development at the periphery of the site green highlighted rows by increasing development at the center of the site orange highlighted rows.

on november,the final eir,specific plan,gpa,and cz came before the board of supervisors.the board of supervisors approved the plan as submitted by adopting i resolution certifying the final eir and adopting specific plan,ii resolution amending the general plan to adopt gpa,and iii ordinance amending ordinance to accept cz and zone the project site for development as provided in specific plan.the eir resolution included findings of fact,a mitigation monitoring and reporting plan,and a statement of overriding considerations.
notice of determination 
the same day,the planning department filed a notice of determination notice with the county clerk in compliance with section which requires an agency approving a project to file a notice of the approval within five working days.the notice informed the public the project will have a significant effect on the environment and that an environmental impact report was prepared.it also certified the final eir was available to the general public at the planning department offices.
the notice also included a description of the project.however,the planning department used an description.the notice says the project proposes up to dwelling units,square feet proposed for commercial use and acres proposed for conserved open space within eight planning areas.the specific plan proposes square feet of commercial retail uses,square feet of commercial office uses,residential uses up to dwelling units,residential uses up to dwelling units,mixed use up to housing units,open space conservation,and master plan roadways.there are acres proposed for residential uses,acres proposed for commercial uses,acres proposed for mixed use,acres proposed for open space and acres for master plan roadways.the notice therefore inaccurately described the final project in several particulars.
trial court proceedings 
on november,appellant filed a petition for a writ of mandate in the trial court alleging the county failed to comply with the same procedural and substantive requirements of ceqa at issue in this appeal 
the trial court held a hearing on the petition on february.on february,the trial court issued a written ruling denying the petition on all grounds asserted.on march,the trial court entered judgment in favor of the county and the trust and against appellant.appellant timely appealed.
discussion 
ceqa and the regulations implementing it embody california strong public policy of protecting the environment.the basic purposes of ceqa are to inform governmental decision makers and the public about the potential,significant environmental effects of proposed activities.identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced.prevent significant,avoidable damage to the environment by requiring changes in projects through the use of alternatives or mitigation measures when the governmental agency finds the changes to be feasible.disclose to the public the reasons why a governmental agency approved the project in the manner the agency chose if significant environmental effects are involved.tomlinson county of alameda cal th.
to achieve these goals,where the public agency determines a proposed development not subject to an exemption may have a significant effect on the environment,ceqa and its implementing regulations require a public agency to prepare an environmental impact report before approving the project.id.at.the environmental impact report is the heart of ceqa whose purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made.thus,the eir protects not only the environment but also informed.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal th,laurel heights.

b.the timing of the county approval of specific plan 
the county properly approved the project after the plan was modified 
appellant contends the board of supervisors approved the project on december,when it voted to certify the final eir and approve specific plan,gpa,and cz.appellant contends this act was an abuse of discretion because the trust and the county substantially modified specific plan thereafter.
we disagree with appellant characterization of the events for two reasons.first,the board of supervisors vote of december,gave only tentative approval of the eir,specific plan and associated documents.it gave its final approval on november,after planning staff and the trust had codified the plan changes discussed at the december,hearing.second,the board of supervisors requested and the staff incorporated the late plan modifications about which appellant complains before the tentative approval.the administrative record makes both these points clear.
at a hearing on december,the board of supervisors made specific requests for additional modifications to the plan and continued the matter for one week to allow planning staff to implement the changes.on december,planning staff presented the requested modifications.at the end of the presentation,planning staff said,with these changes incorporated,staff recommends certification of the eir,approval of the sp,the general plan amendment and the change of zone.supervisor stone then moved to approve the project in accordance with the planning staff recommendation and the board of supervisors voted for the motion.minutes of the hearing state the matter is tentatively approved as recommended,and staff is directed to prepare the necessary documents for final action.thus the december approval was tentative and final approval was explicitly conditioned on successful codification of the changes presented at the december,hearing.
planning staff worked with the trust in subsequent months to finalize specific plan.during that period,planning staff corresponded with counsel for appellant,informing them they were redrafting the final exhibits before the board of supervisors acted to amend the general plan,certify the final eir,adopt specific plan,and amend the zoning ordinance.the trust submitted the final version of specific plan to the county in may.
the final plan incorporated the changes staff presented at the december,hearing.the board of supervisors requested planning area be designated residential development,planning area be changed from commercial office development to residential development,and planning areas residential and mixed use be combined and the new combined planning area designated for mixed use development.reductions in allowable development in planning areas and were to be transferred to the new mixed use area.the final plan made those changes.thus,planning staff simply incorporated the plan modifications presented to the board of supervisors before the tentative approval.
the record also shows the board of supervisors approved the plan as modified on november.it did so by adopting i resolution certifying the final eir and adopting specific plan,ii resolution amending the general plan to adopt gpa,and iii ordinance amending ordinance to accept cz and zone the project site for development as provided in specific plan.the eir resolution included findings of fact,a mitigation monitoring and reporting plan,and a statement of overriding considerations.the planning department filed a notice with the county clerk in compliance with section on the same day.it was those actions which commit ted the agency to a definite course of action in regard to the project and constituted project approval.guidelines,subd.a save tara city of west hollywood cal th.
there is therefore no merit to the claim the county approved the project before making substantial changes to the plan.as a result,we conclude the county did not abuse its discretion.
the county properly adopted findings,a statement of overriding considerations,and a mitigation plan concurrently with its approval 
appellant also contends the county failed to comply with section of ceqa by approving the project without concurrently adopting findings of fact,a statement of overriding considerations soc,and a mitigation,monitoring,and reporting plan mmrp.we disagree.
appellant position again rests on the contention the board of supervisors certified the eir and approved the plan on december.though the county did not,at that time,adopt findings of fact,an soc,or mmrp,that fact is immaterial.as we discussed in part,ante,the board of supervisors did not certify the eir or approve the plan until november,at which time the county did adopt findings,an soc,and mmrp.because only the final action by the county approved the project,the county did not fail to comply with section.appellant objection has no merit.
c.the notice of determination 
appellant contends the county filed an inadequate notice because it does not accurately describe the project as approved.
after a local agency decides to approve a project for which an eir has been prepared,it must file a notice with the county clerk,subd.a guidelines,subd.d.among other things,the agency must ensure the notice contains a brief description of the project,information identifying the project and its location,a statement that an eir was prepared and certified under ceqa,the agency conclusion whether the project will have a significant effect on the environment,whether it adopted mitigation measures and a mitigation monitoring program,and where the public may examine the final eir and the record of project approval.guidelines,committee for green foothills santa clara county bd.of supervisors cal th,green foothills.the agency must file the notice within five working days of project approval.guidelines,subd.a.
the notice triggers the running of a statute of limitations on ceqa challenges.to be timely,an action challenging the adequacy of an eir must be commenced within days after the county clerk posts the notice of determination that the project lead agency has filed with it.citations.sierra club city of orange th,see also,subd.c guidelines,subd.g green foothills,supra,cal th at.t he limitations period does not begin to run if the notice of determination is substantively defective in failing to properly describe the lead agency actions.citations.a notice of a determination adequacy is governed by the substantial compliance doctrine which means actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute even though it may contain technical imperfections of form.sierra club city of orange,at.
here,the parties agree the notice sets out a description of the project which contains errors.the notice erroneously describes the project as comprising planning areas instead of,square feet of commercial office development instead of,residential units instead of,residential units instead of,residential units in a mixed use area instead of,acres for residential uses instead of,acres for commercial uses instead of,and acres for mixed uses instead of.in effect,the notice incorporates elements of a description of the project as it existed after the planning commission changes of october,but before the board of supervisors changes of december.
we conclude these errors do not justify unwinding the county approval of the project.in the first place,the notice substantially complies with the informational requirements of ceqa.it correctly identifies the project and its location.it notifies the public an eir was prepared and certified under ceqa.it states the agency conclusion the project will have a significant effect on the environment.it says mitigation measures were made a condition of approval and that there is a mitigation monitoring program.it also provides the name and phone number of the county contact person on the project and the address where the public may examine the final eir and the record of project approval.
moreover,though the brief description of the project contains errors,much of the description is correct.for example,though the notice erroneously says the project will have only square feet of commercial office space along with square feet of retail space,it correctly states it will allow for square feet of commercial development overall.we conclude the notice description of the project is close enough to the project as approved that it provided the public with the information it needed to weigh the environmental consequences of the county determination,seek additional information if necessary,and intelligently decide whether to bring a legal challenge to the approval within the limitations period.green foothills,supra,cal th at.
perhaps more importantly,appellant can not show the errors in the notice were prejudicial.appellant filed its ceqa challenge to the project approval on november,thirteen days after the county filed the notice and well before the statute of limitations had run.the remedy where a notice is insufficient to provide the public notice is to hold the statute of limitations does not apply.latinos unidos de napa city of napa th.that remedy provides no relief to appellant.moreover,appellant ceqa challenge targets the plan as approved,not the plan as described in the notice.thus,the erroneous description interfered with appellant ability to make an informed decision whether to pursue legal action no more than it interfered with its ability to bring a timely challenge.neighbors for smart rail exposition metro line construction authority cal th.we conclude the erroneous elements of the project description were not prejudicial error.
decision not to recirculate the eir 
appellant contends the county abused its discretion by failing to revise and recirculate the final eir after making changes to the plan,claiming the decision not to recirculate was not based on substantial evidence.we disagree.
section provides that when a lead agency adds significant new information to an eir after completion of consultation with other agencies and the public citations but before certifying the eir,the lead agency must pursue an additional round of consultation.vineyard,supra,cal th at.new information is significant only if the eir is changed in a way that deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon a substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an effect.laurel heights,supra,cal th at accord,guidelines,subd.a.
recirculation is not mandated under section when the new information merely clarifies or amplifies the previously circulated draft eir,but is required when it reveals,for example,a new substantial impact or a substantially increased impact on the environment.vineyard,supra,cal th at.a significant environmental impact includes both substantial and potentially substantial adverse changes in the environment.vineyard,at.we review an agency determination whether a newly disclosed impact is significant and warrants recirculation for substantial evidence in the record.laurel heights,supra,cal th at.
here,appellant challenges the changes to specific plan made after the board of supervisors heard comments on the plan on december.the differences between the plan described in the final eir and specific plan as approved have to do with the details of the allocation and arrangement of uses within the project site,not the kinds of uses permitted or the overall extent or density of the proposed development.the footprint of the project remains the same.the same acres remain designated for open space conservation.as table ante,part at shows,the project as approved permits the same amount of retail development in the same planning areas,the same amount of commercial office development,and the same number of residential units as the version of the plan analyzed in the final eir.
the primary change is the final plan swaps commercial office development in the southern portion of the site with residential development in the center portion of the site below the conservation area.the square feet of commercial office space formerly permitted in planning areas and has been moved north into planning area formerly planning areas.planning area will no longer contain square feet of commercial office development,but instead three residential units.planning area will no longer contain square feet of commercial office development,but instead residential units.meanwhile,planning area comprises acres,is designated for mixed uses,and may contain residential units of those in an assisted living facility and square feet of commercial office space.previously the same area was split between residential development acres and mixed use development acres,and permitted residential units of those in an assisted living facility 
appellant contends the final eir absolutely failed to address the impacts of changing the former planning area from residential to combine with the former planning area into one,mixed use planning area as approved by the county.appellant posits the change from residential to mixed use in planning area may cause a significant increase in trip generation and related effects above those evaluated and disclosed in the eir,t raffic would also likely increase and traffic patterns would change with the redesigned project,and biological impacts may result from drainage,lighting,and noise from the project interface.
the county expert consultants addressed these questions in evaluating whether the final eir had to be revised and recirculated.regarding the traffic effects of the revised plan,both the county traffic and environmental experts concluded no change would occur to the amount of traffic.the basis for their conclusion was the project as analyzed in the final eir and the revised project permit exactly the same number of residential units and exactly the same amount of commercial development.we conclude the county determination was supported by enough relevant information and reasonable inferences specifically that the number of trips is controlled by the number of residential units and the square footage of commercial development that a fair argument can be made to support its conclusion.appellant additional contention the eir should have been revised and recirculated to take into account changes in traffic patterns due to the redistribution of uses within the project site is not well taken.as the traffic and environmental experts explain,such circulation patterns are not analyzed at the eir stage.
the county environmental expert also concluded no new or substantially increased biological impacts would result from increasing the length of the interface between mixed use development and the conservation area.the expert acknowledged the potential use in the northwestern portion of the development area would be modified from medium density residential to mixed use,but concluded this would be consistent with the use previously analyzed adjacent to the central portion of the linkage and a djacency requirements identified in the western riverside multiple species habitat conservation plan would continue to apply,minimizing potential indirect impacts.in other words,the county determined recirculation was not required because the final eir already analyzed the effects of mixed use development adjacent to the conservation area and found the biological impacts significant but mitigable.former planning area was designated for mixed use development and the changes merely extended the adjacency further to the northwest.the county concluded mitigation measures that met the conservation plan for the shorter span would be adequate to do so over the longer span.we conclude the county determination was based on enough information and reasonable inferences to withstand review.
appellant also contends the change from commercial office development to residential development in planning area may subject residences to noise from keller road and at at keller road which may therefore be greater than those disclosed in the eir.according to appellant,there is no evidence the mitigation required is adequate to mitigate such impacts.the county environmental consultant reached the contrary conclusion,explaining the eir identifies anticipated noise levels adjacent to project roadways and requires mitigation measures and additional analysis prior to the issuance of building permits to ensure that exterior and interior noise impacts at potentially affected residences would comply with the applicable ordinances.these existing mitigation measures would ensure that impacts would be reduced to below a level of significance.again,this information provided the county with an adequate factual basis for determining the changes did not result in a new or significantly increased impact requiring recirculation.
finally,appellant contends the redistribution of land uses within the project may create potential land use inconsistencies.however,appellant does not identify the potential inconsistencies.the county environmental consultant concluded relocating denser uses from the areas adjacent to existing residential areas to areas in the center
