plaintiff and appellant,the san diego unified school district the district,brought this action on numerous contractual and equitable theories against defendant and respondent the county of san diego the county,in the factual context of environmental problems and remediation costs incurred at district property,due to the ongoing effects of an inactive landfill that was operated in the by the county,which leased the district property.the district seeks reimbursement of a share of its expenses for remedial work at the landfill site that was required to be performed by several regulatory agencies,pursuant to environmental legislation enacted in the,et,the water quality control act the act health,regulating nonvehicular air pollution.
the district appeals a summary judgment that was granted in favor of the county on the ground that all causes of action in the district amended complaint filed in are barred by the statute of limitations applicable to latent construction defects.code civ.the trial court reasoned that all the district theories,including breach of contract,equitable indemnity,declaratory relief,nuisance,and so forth,were based on the underlying premise that the landfill is an improvement on the district property,constructed by the county within the meaning of section,subdivision a,and therefore any action seeking damages for latent defects in the property had to be brought against the county within years of completion of the improvement,which occurred in.
on appeal,the district contends the trial court erred in its application of section,because the district is not suing upon any claim for damages based on defective construction,design or operation of the landfill,but instead is seeking monetary reimbursement of costs incurred by the district,as a property owner,in achieving compliance with environmental regulations of groundwater and other substances affected on an ongoing basis by the closed landfill.the district points out that the county was designated by a regulatory agency,the san diego regional water quality control board the regional board,as an operator of the landfill,but the county has refused to perform certain allocated tasks to remedy some of the environmental problems of the landfill mainly groundwater monitoring 
in response,the county argues that section protects landfill improvers such as the county from defect liability,and that such protection should not be lost where a plaintiff,such as the district,is seeking repayment of modernization costs for a old landfill,to meet current maintenance standards as now set forth in environmental regulation.gaggero county of san diego th,d gaggero.
our review of the causes of action of the operative complaint persuades us that the trial court erred as a matter of law in deciding that the latent construction defect limitations period,as set forth in section,was dispositive of all the district contractual and indemnification theories.the district is relying on the language of the lease between the parties and their sharing agreement,which they entered into for allocation of their expenses for environmental regulatory compliance,and the district seeks breach of contract damages.it also relies on claims of statutory duties that the county has violated,to its damage,and these theories are distinct from construction defect allegations.
further,triable issues of fact remain on alternative grounds on which the county sought summary judgment,the different limitations bars of section,subdivision and government code section.the trial court did not reach those issues,and it can not now be determined as a matter of law whether the complaint was timely filed based on the relief sought,as money or damages within the purview of the government tort claims act,or the contractual claims against the county.
we also conclude that other noncontractual causes of action by the district,such as nuisance and trespass,are not subject to the bar of section.the district pled sufficient grounds and supplied a sufficient factual showing to allow it to pursue proceedings on the merits on its requests for declaratory and other relief under theories of nuisance,trespass,or inverse condemnation,and summary judgment was improperly granted on limitations grounds.we reverse the judgment for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
background lease and sharing agreement 
a subsidiary portion of this dispute was previously before this court in san diego unified school district san diego regional water quality control board,wl nonpub.opn,hereafter prior opn,an appeal by the district of a demurrer ruling in favor of the regional board on the only cause of action pled against the regional board,declaratory relief regarding the manner in which the regional board carried out its regulatory functions.prior opn.finding no error by the trial court in declining to entertain requests for declaratory relief regarding the rights and duties between the regional board and these parties.we now adopt the relevant factual background as set forth in that prior opinion,although those issues did not deal directly with the rights of the district versus the county 
the amended complaint generally alleges numerous disputes between the school district and the county about their respective responsibilities for remediation of environmental problems at the landfill site.these problems stemmed from a lease by the school district to the county,allowing the county to open a sanitary landfill on the subject property.the landfill remained in operation until.in,the school district constructed bell junior high school on the property.
pursuant to environmental legislation enacted in,the regional board designated the county to be the operator of the landfill site,which was now inactive,and in,required the county to prepare a solid waste air quality assessment test swat.health.this was not done at the time.the regional board also required the county to conduct wastewater tests also entitled swat,solid wastewater quality assessment tests.
as further background here,we note that under section,subdivision a,the state board,before january,was required to rank all solid waste disposal sites,based upon the threats they posed to water quality.it then required the operators of such sites,including this one,to submit a swat to the appropriate regional board for its examination pursuant to subdivision d.under that subdivision d,the regional boards then examined the reports submitted and determined whether the test wells and soil testing had detected any hazardous waste conditions.the regional board could then order a monitoring program and take corrective action at the solid waste disposal site,regarding water safety,pursuant to chapter commencing with.
in,the city of san diego solid waste local enforcement agency lea,issued a notice of violation to both the county operator and the school district owner for the lack of monitoring or cleanup at the site.the school district and the county entered into a sharing agreement,attached as an exhibit to the amended complaint,providing for their division of responsibilities for such tasks.further requirements were imposed by the regional board in on both the county and the school district.the school district carried out repairs and improvements at considerable expense.the county did so also,and allegedly caused further damage to the school district property.
in,the school district filed this action against the county,seeking damages of million and injunctive relief.
first amended complaint 
the operative first amended complaint amended complaint was filed in may and pleads several sets of allegations.in the first three causes of action,the district is pursuing breach of contract theories under both the lease and the sharing agreement attached as exhibits,to seek damages of million,for breach of contractual duties or quantum meruit recovery.the lease included a hold harmless clause as follows 
county,so far as it may lawfully do so,shall hold district harmless from any or all liability for injury to person or damage to property arising directly or indirectly from any act or omission of any employee or officer of county or any person occupying the demised premises under or pursuant to this agreement.
in the november sharing agreement,the parties agreed to a reservation of rights as follows 
the terms of this agreement are intended to facilitate responsible management of the property in accord with all environmental regulatory requirements.however,nothing in this agreement is intended to and shall not be construed to relieve either party from any legal duties or liabilities each may or may not have under state or federal law,or under any hold harmless or indemnification provisions contained in any lease or other written agreement between school district and county.
although the district had filed a governmental tort claim against the county in,requesting that the county take corrective action pursuant to a notice of violation of orders issued by the lea,the parties apparently did not pursue the claim,because they entered into the sharing agreement.under that agreement,the county agreed to maintain and pay for the landfill gas control and monitoring system,while the district agreed to maintain the surface of the playground and slopes and drainage structures on the property in accord with directives from all environmental regulatory agencies,such as the lea.they also agreed to split the facility fees and site security costs and obligations,such as fencing.however,the obligations to monitor and treat the groundwater at the site,which is affected by gas migration,remain in dispute in this action.in,the county proposed an amendment to the sharing agreement that would have addressed that groundwater issue,but the district did not accept it,instead bringing another claim against the county and then this action.
in the contract claims,the district further alleges that both the regional board and the lea have designated the county as an operator of the site,within the meaning of the environmental regulations,and the agencies have sought to impose duties upon the county to install groundwater monitoring wells and complete a swat investigation,health.although notices of violations were issued,the county has refused to perform these duties,causing the district to incur expenses,which it seeks to recover in several ways,in reliance on the lease or sharing agreement,or on its statutory obligations as a property owner in light of those contractual arrangements.
next,in the fourth through sixth causes of action,theories of express and implied indemnity and contribution are pled,based on the lease agreement hold harmless provision,and based on obligations allegedly owed by the county to the district under the sharing agreement,and based on its obligations to comply with environmental regulations.the district has incurred expenses and sought reimbursement,which has not been paid despite demands.
in the seventh through ninth causes of action,damages for nuisance,trespass,and inverse condemnation are sought for the county alleged interference with the district use and benefit of the site as a school and playground.the condition of the site required installation of monitoring wells and equipment for methane gas and other contamination of this site,which created problems at the school.
in the,and causes of action,injunctive and declaratory relief is sought to require the county to address its past,present and future legal and contractual responsibilities with respect to the landfill.the requested orders include a declaration of the comparative liability between the county and the district,with regard to costs incurred for environmental cleanup,both past and future,due to enforcement of federal,state and local laws and regulations.the county is alleged to have failed and refused to comply with regional board order and the addendum,concerning its obligations as an operator of the landfill,and to have wrongfully declined to accept any legal or contractual responsibility for the costs of compliance with all applicable laws concerning the landfill site.
the district request for declaratory relief will allegedly avoid a multiplicity of actions that would result if the district were required to defend the claims by governmental agencies,and then bring a separate action against the county for indemnification of sums that the district may be compelled to pay as a result of any enforcement action taken against it 
motion for summary judgment 
in,shortly before the scheduled trial date,the parties filed for summary judgment or adjudication.the district filed a motion in april that sought only summary adjudication and declaratory relief that the county had the contractual duty to indemnify it under the lease and its hold harmless clause,for expenses the district had incurred to comply with environmental regulation.
next,the county filed its own summary judgment or adjudication motion on several grounds,including the bar of the statute of limitation for latent construction defects.providing in pertinent part that a no action may be brought to recover damages from any person,or the surety of a person,who develops real property or performs or furnishes the design,specifications,surveying,planning,supervision,testing,or observation of construction or construction of an improvement to real property more than years after the substantial completion of the development or improvement for any of the following any latent deficiency in the design,specification,surveying,planning,supervision,or observation of construction or construction of an improvement to,or survey of,real property injury to property,real or personal,arising out of any such latent deficiency.
in addition to contending that the filing of the action was untimely under section,because the landfill amounted to an improvement to real property which had been completed in,the county sought summary judgment based on several alternative arguments.first,it argued that the action was based on the contractual statute of limitations,section,subdivision,and the governmental claims requirements of government code section,subd.j,due to knowledge by the district about slope erosion and settlement problems at the property,which the county refused to pay for in.the county also contended it had governmental immunity against trespass allegations,and the nuisance and trespass claims were vitiated by the district previous consent to the county operation of a landfill on the property,subd.a.further,the county argued the lease agreement hold harmless clause did not create a duty to indemnify the district for environmental response costs that were unknown at the time,so the parties did not intend any such coverage.
in the rulings,the trial court first resolved the district own motion by determining that no summary adjudication of indemnity rights was appropriate because the requested declaration of indemnity rights was too broad and sweeping,in light of the evidence raising triable issues on several topics the intent of the parties regarding the coverage of the lease agreement hold harmless clause the effect of the district own actions that related to the property,that occurred after the county work on the landfill and regardless of the district consent to the landfill arrangement,the court questioned whether it was equitable to require only one party to bear the burden of what was arguably a joint endeavor.further,the court stated that the regional board orders and instructions were subject to interpretation and did not permit resolution of the indemnity request as a matter of law,subd.f.
two weeks later,after oral argument on the county summary judgment motion,the trial court confirmed its tentative ruling on that motion,finding that the entire matter was,because the landfill is an improvement within the meaning of ccp a.the court relied on gaggero,supra,th,d,to support its conclusions that in this case,no matter how penned,the district expenditures and basis for this action result from actions to address physical defects of the landfill,and this is supported by the allegations of the fac.finally,the undisputed evidence shows that the landfill at issue was a activity that was complete in the.citation.district assertions that the purported failure and refusal of county to comply with its statutory and contractual duties does not qualify as an action to recover damages for latent defects are unsupported and a matter of semantics.there is absolutely no evidence presented to indicate either party intended that the landfill be considered county land or property,or that county contracted with district to keep building or to continue construction.while problems came about after the fact,which largely stemmed from newly implemented environmental laws,the evidence is undisputed that the landfill was a activity that was complete in the.accordingly,the motion is granted on this ground.in issuing its ruling,the trial court noted that this was a complex case with a fair amount of money involved,based on a complicated series of events that took place over a long time,so that appellate resolution of the questions of law presented would be welcome.
the district appeals.
discussion 
although the district amended complaint pleads a variety of theories to justify an award of damages or costs or other relief,through reliance on the lease,on the sharing agreement,or on statutory duties imposed upon the parties,the summary judgment granted by the trial court was grounded solely on the definitions found in section.the trial court ruled that,as a matter of law,all of the district claims for expenditures result from actions to address physical defects of the landfill.
our standards of review of a summary judgment are well settled,and may simply be repeated here from this court opinion in gaggero,supra,th at page,d 
summary judgment may be granted only when a moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,subd.c.in aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar,the supreme court clarified the law courts must apply in california in ruling on motions for summary judgment.where the motion is brought by a defendant,the defendant will bear the burden of persuasion one or more elements of the cause of action in question can not be established,or that there is a complete defense thereto.citations.in aguilar the supreme court established summary judgment law in california does not require a defendant conclusively negate an element of the plaintiff cause of action.rather,in accordance with federal law all that the defendant need do is to show that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established by the plaintiff.citation.
limitations issues may be resolved on summary judgment if the facts are uncontradicted and susceptible of only a single legitimate inference.clark baxter healthcare th,d.
to analyze whether the county was properly entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law under section,we will first examine the nature of this limitations provision and its definitions,and then assess their application to the allegations of the amended complaint.we are mindful that these limitations principles must be applied to a rather complex set of facts,in which the district asserts rights to relief under the lease,the sharing agreement,the environmental statutes dating from the that gave rise to the specific orders of regulatory agencies that were rendered here,from through and beyond.after dealing with the limitations issues,we will address the other arguments raised on appeal.
scope of section 
section,subdivision a prohibits the bringing of any action to recover damages from any person who develops real property or performs or furnishes the design or construction of an improvement to real property more than years after the substantial completion of the development or improvement for any of the following any latent deficiency in the design or construction of an improvement to real property.injury to property,real or personal,arising out of any such latent deficiency.b as used in this section,latent deficiency means a deficiency which is not apparent by reasonable inspection.
breaking down this statute,it does not allow a an untimely action for damages b based on a latent deficiency in construction of an improvement,c or based on property injury arising out of any such latent deficiency.we next look to how this statute has been interpreted in similar circumstances.
nature and purpose of statute 
generally,for limitations purposes,construction defect allegations may be treated as arising under a contractual theory of breach of warranty,subd.or as claims of tortious injury to property,subds.b,c.inco development superior court th,d inco liptak diane apts.d.however,section treats construction defects differently.in inco the court discussed authorities that have characterized section as a statute of repose,which is a particular kind of limitations provision that should be distinguished from garden variety limitations statutes that simply provide for various periods for the commencement of specified actions.inco,supra,at,d.thus 
a statute of repose has nothing to do with the date of injury,but bars all suits after the expiration of a specified time from the manufacture or delivery of a product or a transaction.citations.it does not cut off an existing right of action,but rather provides that nothing which happens thereafter can be a cause of action.id.at,d.
when interpreting section,the courts do not determine when the particular construction defect claim accrued,but rather,the courts measure the timeliness of a cause of action by the date of substantial completion of the improvement.inco,supra,th at,d.this approach is consistent with the authority of chevron superior court th,d chevron,in which the court characterized section as a statute of repose created by the legislature fixed starting point and outer limit for latent construction defects.ibid.
in gaggero,supra,th,d,this court relied on supreme court authority as follows t he purpose of section has been stated as to protect developers of real estate against liability extending indefinitely into the future.citation.we have noted that a contractor is in the business of constructing improvements and must devote his capital to that end the need to provide reserves against an uncertain liability extending indefinitely into the future could seriously impinge upon the conduct of his enterprise.citation.martinez traubner cal d.
application of statute 
for purposes of applying section,the type of cause of action pled is not dispositive,but instead the nature of the injury or loss alleged will govern.the courts have found this limitations period will apply to bar a number of types of claims,so long as they allege damage from latent construction defects,within the meaning of the statute.for example,section will bar an untimely filing of an action that involves latent construction defects,although it pleads them in terms of breach of contract.moseley abrams d.there,the plaintiff complaints alleged theories of negligence and breach of contract,in the form of improper or substandard construction of apartment balconies,and substandard design by the architects,causing latent defects that were not discovered within the period.the court in moseley analyzed section,stating nothing in the language of the section itself suggests that contract actions are exempt from its scope t he section provides in essence that no action,except one based on willful misconduct or fraudulent concealment,may be brought beyond the limitation to recover damages for any latent deficiency or any resulting injury to real or personal property.that working definition fits contract as well as tort actions moseley,supra,d at.italics added.
likewise,in chevron,supra,th,d,the facts were that chevron sold and installed on disalvo property certain underground fuel storage tanks,which,over time,contaminated the soil.disalvo sued chevron for reimbursement of money already spent and to be spent to complete the environmental cleanup required by county authorities,contending the contamination was caused by defective installation of the tanks years earlier.those causes of action were based on theories of negligence,breach of contract,continuing nuisance,continuing trespass,and indemnity.the court held that the allegations of a continuing nuisance that was caused by a latent construction defect must be filed within the statute of limitations.the court said it is consistent to apply section to continuing nuisance and continuing trespass causes of action,because this furthers the legislature goal of setting an outside limit to protect contractors from extended liability.chevron,supra,at,d.the court in chevron further explained that when the complaint alleges a latent construction defect leading to a continuing nuisance or trespass,the first step is to determine whether the action is timely under continuing nuisance or trespass principles.has it been filed before abatement of the nuisance or trespass or within three years after abatement if so,the second step is to determine whether the action has been filed within ten years of the date of substantial completion of the improvement.id.at,d.
also in chevron,supra,th,footnote,d,the court commented the legislature failure specifically to address the problem of pollution caused by construction did not engraft a pollution exception upon the broad terms of section.
in lantzy centex homes cal th,d,the supreme court decided that the limitations period in section for bringing an action for latent defects in construction involving real property,design or manufacturing defects in the window systems that leaked and caused damage to the homes is not subject to any equitable tolling during repair efforts by the potential defendants.also see stoneson development superior court d.holding that product liability claims of latent defects may be barred under.
in gaggero,supra,th,d,the landowners had purchased the property from another landowner,who bought it in an condition from the defendant county,which had constructed and operated a landfill on it.when the current landowners,gaggero,discovered there was subsidence on the property due to the ancient landfill,causing damages to structures,they filed a claim and then a complaint against the county the complaint alleged causes of action for inverse condemnation,nuisance,negligence,trespass and for recovery of toxic waste response costs.in particular,the complaint alleged the county was negligent in the manner in which the landfill was planned,designed,owned,occupied and maintained.id.at,d.the gaggeros contended that methane gas releases from the landfill and consequent subsidence were the proximate cause of their losses,due to defective construction.
in upholding a grant of summary judgment for the county on limitations grounds,this court held in gaggero that the county construction and operation of the landfill was an improvement within the meaning of section.gaggero,supra,th at,d.we reasoned that the term improvement in the statute has been broadly construed,and the nature of the work analyzed in other construction defect case law was similar to the work performed by the county in constructing and operating the landfill,so that section governed the allegations of those plaintiffs that their purchased land was defective because of subsidence from the improperly constructed landfill under it.while the county primary goal may not have been to obtain a profit from eventual sale of the landfill,in filling it,covering it and selling it,the county was engaged in making the real property suitable for further use by others.section and the cases which have interpreted it make it clear,in enacting the statute,the legislature unambiguous intention was to put a temporal limit on liability for individuals and entities engaged in these sorts of purposeful alterations to and transfers of real property.gaggero,supra,at,d.however,we do not interpret this general statement regarding transfers of real property as limiting the scope of coverage of section to fact patterns in which the subject property has been transferred.
this court also rejected an argument by the gaggeros that even if the county activities in constructing and operating the landfill are governed by section,the landfill is continuing to produce methane gas,which in turn creates the soil subsidence,and is therefore a continuing nuisance.the gaggeros reason that the landfill,as a continuing nuisance,continually gives rise to causes of action.citation.however,the continuing nature of a nuisance does not extend the limit imposed by section.citations.the continuing nuisance or trespass theory allows for deferral of the starting date of the statute of limitations in much the same way as does the discovery rule.neither theory or rule may override the statute of repose created by the legislature fixed starting point and outer limit for latent construction defects t he event which triggers the period is the date of substantial completion of the improvement.citations.gaggero,supra,th at,d,citing chevron,supra,th at,d.this reasoning applies where the defective construction is the proximate cause of the plaintiff losses.gaggero,supra,at,d.
having set forth these examples of the applicability of section,we next turn to the factual and legal context of our case.
current causes of action nature of rights to relief asserted by district 
as outlined above,the term improvement in section has been given a very broad interpretation in that factual context.gaggero,supra,th,d.we agree with county that this landfill amounts to an improvement within the meaning of section,but that characterization alone is not dispositive.we still must inquire into the nature of the claims that the district is alleging,first contractual,then statutory,to determine the essential character of the rights it is seeking to vindicate,for purposes of analyzing the appropriate limitations period.
in witkin,california procedure ed.pleading,section,page,the authors set forth rules for analyzing the rights asserted by a cause of action.the focus should be on the injury to the plaintiff,and not the particular legal theory of the defendant wrongful act.ibid.likewise,analysis of a cause of action must distinguish between the assertion of the particular primary right and duty and their violation,and the remedy or relief that is sought to vindicate the right or duty.the violation of one primary right may sometimes give rise to two or more remedial rights,entitling the plaintiff to two or more remedies or forms of relief.the fact that several forms of relief are sought,whether legal or equitable or both,does not mean that there is more than one cause of action.citations.id.at.moreover 
where a single right and injury are involved,there is only one cause of action even though the complaint seeks distinct legal or equitable remedies,an action to abate a nuisance and to recover damages an action to quiet title and to declare void the instrument under which the defendant claims title an action to reform a contract and to have it specifically enforced or damages awarded in lieu of enforcement.citations.witkin,cal.procedure,supra.
with these rules in mind,we may analyze the claims pled by the district to determine whether the only rights asserted are those arising out of a latent construction defect,whether they were pled in terms of contract or tort.if so,section may provide a bar for an action brought more than years after the substantial completion of the improvement.alternatively,if the district is not contending the landfill was a defectively constructed improvement,the district may be able to plead rights arising out of some other kind of legal entitlement,separate from the manner of construction of the improvement.the gravamen of a complaint and the nature of the right sued upon rather than the form of the action or relief demanded,determine which statute of limitations applies.embarcadero municipal improvement dist.county of santa barbara th,d hensler city of glendale cal th,d,see also mcleod vista unified school dist.th,d.
we first take note of a potential problem regarding the relief requested in the complaint,damages.the statutory language of section prohibits the bringing of an action to recover damages from the developer or constructor of an improvement,based on latent deficiencies in the real property improvements or consequential property injury arising out of a latent deficiency.the district is bringing an action to recover damages,but it also seeks other kind of relief,such as declaratory relief regarding indemnity or contractual rights and duties.in its reply brief,the district seeks to recharacterize the monetary relief sought as reimbursement for past and future expenditures that were required to comply with regulatory requirements of the of inactive landfills,regardless of how those landfills were designed,operated,or constructed.thus,the district emphasizes it is not claiming the landfill fell below the applicable standards of care at the time,and it contends the parties would have had to incur some of these environmental compliance costs later on,even if the landfill had been perfect in every respect at the time.
even if we assume the district will be able to establish some rights to equitable or express indemnity,or declaratory relief to that effect,and assuming the district is entitled to a monetary award of damages on some basis,section would not be a bar to such alternative forms of monetary recovery,if such recovery or damages were not proximately caused by or did not arise out of the latent deficiency identified in the property.thus,we do not interpret section as barring all actions for damages in property damage cases as compared to construction deficiency cases,filed more than years after the improvement was completed,if the recovery is sought on some other legal basis not identified in this statute.gaggero,supra,th at,d.we accordingly turn to the theories actually being pursued by the district,to identify the rights it is asserting.
current causes of action contractual and indemnity rights asserted by district 
in its contract claims,the district alleges that both the regional board and the lea have designated the county as an operator of the site,within the meaning of the applicable environmental regulations.those agencies have joined the district in unsuccessfully requesting that the county install groundwater monitoring wells and complete a swat investigation at the closed landfill site,health.the district has incurred million expenses in performing those duties,and the district relies on the lease and sharing agreement,in its breach of contract claims and for quantum meruit.in particular,the lease contains a hold harmless clause,and the sharing agreement contains a reservation of rights,to the effect that the sharing agreement did not affect any existing legal duties or liabilities each party may or may not have under state and federal law,or under the lease provisions.to the extent that such specific contractual rights are asserted,we do not think that the district is merely relying on the manner of construction of the landfill,as a disguised construction defect cause of action alleging a latent deficiency in the property.
it has not yet been established whether the lease hold harmless clause remains viable,and that matter can not be resolved by labeling the landfill controversy a construction defect case.moreover,the sharing agreement was entered into years after the landfill was closed,in light of subsequent physical developments at the site,but also in light of recently enacted,universally applicable legislation and regulation.the district also relies upon the statutory obligations of the county as an operator of the former landfill,as giving rise to some kind of right of reimbursement,whether contractual or equitable.we must accordingly turn to the theories that go beyond breach of contract to determine if only latent deficiencies in property are alleged.
in its fourth through sixth causes of action,the district pleads theories of express and implied indemnity and contribution,based on the lease agreement hold harmless provision,and based on individual obligations allegedly owed by the county to the district under the sharing agreement,and based on its obligations to comply with environmental regulations.the district has incurred expenses and sought reimbursement,which has not been paid despite demands.the basic rules for evaluating indemnity claims require us to treat an express indemnity provision as creating contractual rights.if those expressly stated rights are well founded,the courts do not resort to implied rights stemming from the independent doctrine of equitable indemnity.the indemnitor undertaking may not be extended by implication beyond the terms of his or her agreement.however,this rule does not apply where the indemnity provisions of the contract were not intended to apply to the incident that resulted in the loss.d contribution and indemnification,fns.omitted.the statutory definition of indemnity is a contract by which one engages to save another from a legal consequence of the conduct of one of the parties or of some other person.id.at.
at this point in the litigation,the scope of coverage of the indemnity or hold harmless clause has not been determined.the authorities are not in agreement whether the terms indemnify and hold harmless are synonymous.see d,supra,contribution and indemnification,indemnify is an offensive right allowing an indemnitee to seek indemnification,and hold harmless is defensive,the right not to be bothered by the other party itself seeking indemnification.in the district companion motion for summary adjudication of indemnity rights,the trial court correctly noted that the requested declaration of indemnity rights was too broad and sweeping,in light of the evidence raising triable issues about the intent of the parties,the effect of the district own actions that related to the property,occurring subsequent to the county work on the landfill,and the equities of requiring one party to bear the burdens of what was started out as similar to a joint endeavor.
in any case,an indemnity obligation may apply either to indemnity against loss or to indemnity against liability.whether an instrument embodies an agreement to indemnify against actual loss only,against liability only,or against both is determined from an examination of the instrument,with a view to ascertaining the intent of the parties.thus,a contract indemnifying against loss,damages,or expenses that one may sustain or for which one may become liable in consequence of a certain act is an agreement to indemnify against liability as well as against actual loss,because the words are apt and unmistakable and must receive their natural meaning.however,the language of an instrument may be such that the indemnity described may be construed as covering not only liability,but also loss or damages in the alternative,so that where a right is lost under one interpretation a remedy remains under the other.d,supra,contribution and indemnification,fns.omitted.the distinction is between contracting that an event will not happen and contracting to indemnify against the consequences of the event if it should happen,fns.omitted.
with these principles in mind,we return to the question of whether these claims are confined to allegations that the county work at the landfill constituted or created a latent deficiency in real property.we are also mindful that the district,and causes of action seek injunctive and declaratory relief to require the county to address its past,present and future legal and contractual responsibilities with respect to the landfill.these allegations are broad enough to encompass theories of both express or implied equitable indemnity.as such,the district has not grounded all of its alleged contractual rights in the manner of construction of the landfill,and section does not clearly bar the entirety of this complaint.as the court explained in inco supra,th at,d,section is correctly viewed as a statute of repose that does not apply traditional concepts of accrual of a claim,but is tied to an independent,objectively determined and verifiable event,the date of substantial completion of the improvement.
here,the circumstances of this landfill,showing an evolving and changing set of conditions involving methane gas development and water contamination,together with the circumstances of environmental legislation and regulation designed to address such problems,make it inappropriate to view the district allegation
