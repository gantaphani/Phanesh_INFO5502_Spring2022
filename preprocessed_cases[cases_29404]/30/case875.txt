rosemere neighborhood association rosemere appeals the district court dismissal of its action against the environmental protection agency epa on mootness grounds.we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing the case,because the voluntary cessation exception to mootness applies.we therefore reverse.
factual and procedural background 
rosemere is a community organization in clark county,washington.it works to improve the provision of municipal services in communities,and has had a contentious relationship with the city of vancouver,washington the city over these issues.
in,rosemere filed an administrative complaint against the city with the epa office of civil rights ocr.the epa established the ocr to investigate complaints of discrimination in the use of federal funds,pursuant to title vi of the civil rights act of.see pt.in its complaint,rosemere alleged that the city failed properly to utilize epa funds to address lingering environmental problems in and minority communities in the city.
according to the regulations governing the ocr,any party may file a complaint alleging discrimination which the ocr will review for acceptance or rejection within days.d i.if the ocr accepts the complaint,it shall issue preliminary findings within days of the beginning of the complaint investigation.c.
shortly after rosemere filed its complaint,the city opened an inquiry into rosemere that eventually culminated in the revocation of rosemere status as a formal neighborhood association.rosemere then filed a second complaint with the ocr in december,alleging retaliation by the city the ocr did not accept or reject this second complaint within twenty days as the regulations require,ostensibly because of severely limited office resources and a substantial volume of competing programmatic demands.in fact,some eighteen months lapsed with no action by the ocr,until rosemere filed suit in federal district court in june against the epa,seeking to compel the ocr to accept or reject the retaliation complaint.about six weeks later,the ocr notified rosemere that it had accepted the complaint for investigation.the epa then moved to dismiss rosemere action as moot.the district court granted the motion,concluding that the delay was nothing more than an isolated instance of untimeliness and oversight,and there was no evidence that the epa failure to act was a practice the epa might resume in the future.
following the ocr acceptance of the complaint,the parties by all accounts worked together to pursue the investigation.by february,however,some eighteen months after accepting the complaint,the ocr still had not issued preliminary findings or recommendations,and rosemere filed the present lawsuit under the administrative procedure act apa to compel action see.rosemere sought a declaratory judgment that the epa had violated the regulatory deadlines of,as well as an injunction compelling the epa to complete the investigation.about ten weeks later,on april,the ocr completed its investigation into the complaint and sent a notification letter to rosemere.the ocr concluded that the timing of the city actions against rosemere was suspicious,but did not amount to impermissible retaliation,thereby closing the complaint.the epa then moved to dismiss rosemere action as moot.
rosemere conducted limited discovery into the ocr history of handling complaints in responding to the epa mootness argument.that discovery uncovered data suggesting that the ocr had missed its regulatory deadlines in almost every complaint filed with the agency in recent years.
on november,rosemere filed an amended complaint in the action,adding a claim for injunctive relief to compel the epa to process all rosemere complaints filed in the next five years within the regulatory deadlines.rosemere stated that it intended to refile its original title vi complaint against the city in the near future,with better documentation of the funding nexus between the city and the epa.on the basis of this stated intention,as well as the evidence of the pattern of delay obtained through discovery,rosemere argued that the case was not moot and that,in any event,the voluntary cessation exception to mootness applied.the district court rejected these arguments and granted epa motion to dismiss.it concluded that,in the absence of any pending complaints by rosemere with the ocr,rosemere could not establish the sufficient likelihood of future delays necessary to invoke the voluntary cessation exception.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court dismissal of an action for mootness de novo.native vill.of noatak blatchford,cir.federal courts lack jurisdiction to consider moot claims.church of scientology united states,d.a claim is moot if it has lost its character as a present,live controversy.am.rivers marine fisheries,cir.in general,when an administrative agency has performed the action sought by a plaintiff in litigation,a federal court lacks the ability to grant effective relief,and the claim is moot.see pub.util.comm ferc,cir.courts have long recognized,however,a voluntary cessation exception to mootness.under this doctrine,the mere cessation of illegal activity in response to pending litigation does not moot a case,unless the party alleging mootness can show that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d citation omitted.without such an exception,the courts would be compelled to leave t he defendant free to return to his old ways.porter bowen,cir alterations in original quoting united states concentrated phosphate exp.ass n,d.
the party alleging mootness bears a heavy burden in seeking dismissal.laidlaw,at.it must show that it is absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior will not recur if the lawsuit is dismissed.see id.in the case at bench,this requirement means that the epa must demonstrate that rosemere will not encounter further regulatory delays in the processing of its complaints.epa could plausibly satisfy this burden in one of two ways first,by showing that it is extremely unlikely that rosemere will file another complaint and thus come before the agency again or,second,by showing that,even if rosemere does file such a complaint,the epa will meet its regulatory deadlines in resolving it.
before this court,the epa has chosen to rely on the first alternative argument it contends that,because rosemere has no pending complaints before the agency,the prospect of further delay is merely speculative.to defeat mootness,the epa further argues,rosemere must show to a certainty that it will file another complaint.
there are several problems with the epa argument.for one,it impermissibly attempts to shift the burden to rosemere to defeat mootness.as we have stated,it is the epa that bears the heavy burden in this case.see id.the epa can not meet this burden solely by claiming that rosemere has not done enough to show the likelihood of further delays.see ftc affordable media,llc,cir noting that the assertion that the plaintiff did not offer any admissible evidence that the defendants were likely to repeat any wrongful conduct is not sufficient to satisfy the defendants burden to show mootness.rather,the epa must demonstrate why repetition of the wrongful conduct is highly unlikely,luckie epa,cir finding mootness because the permanent relocation of residents exposed to an asbestos dump meant there was very little chance the plaintiffs would encounter a second asbestos dump and again be subjected to epa regulatory and enforcement scheme.
put another way,the burden is not on rosemere to show it will file another complaint.the burden is on the epa to show that rosemere will not do so.the epa attempt to reverse this burden is insufficient to show mootness.see affordable media,at see also armster dist.court,cir the bare assertion by the justice department in its mootness motion that this situation will not recur is not sufficient to deprive this court of its constitutional power to adjudicate this case.more importantly,when there is an argument about whether a plaintiff will again encounter a challenged activity,this court
