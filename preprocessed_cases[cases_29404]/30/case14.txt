on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
we consider whether michael and chantell sackett may bring a civil action under the administrative procedure act,et,to challenge the issuance by the environmental protection agency epa of an administrative compliance order under of the clean water act.the order asserts that the sacketts property is subject to the act,and that they have violated its provisions by placing fill material on the property and on this basis it directs them immediately to restore the property pursuant to an epa work plan.
the clean water act prohibits,among other things,the discharge of any pollutant by any person,without a permit,into the navigable waters,which the act defines as the waters of the united states,if the epa determines that any person is in violation of this restriction,the act directs the agency either to issue a compliance order or to initiate a civil enforcement action.a.when the epa prevails in a civil action,the act provides for a civil penalty not to exceed per day for each violation.d.and according to the government,when the epa prevails against any person who has been issued a compliance order but has failed to comply,that amount is increased to up to for the statutory violation and up to an additional for violating the compliance order.
the particulars of this case flow from a dispute about the scope of the navigable waters subject to this enforcement regime.today we consider only whether the dispute may be brought to court by challenging the compliance order we do not resolve the dispute on the merits.the reader will be curious,however,to know what all the fuss is about.in united states riverside bayview homes,we upheld a regulation that construed the navigable waters to include freshwater wetlands,at,themselves not actually navigable,that were adjacent to waters.later,in solid waste agency of northern cook cty.army corps of engineers,we held that an abandoned sand and gravel pit,which seasonally ponded but which was not adjacent to open water,at,was not part of the navigable waters.then most recently,in rapanos united states,we considered whether a wetland not adjacent to waters fell within the scope of the act.our answer was no,but no one rationale commanded a majority of the court.in his separate opinion,the chief justice expressed the concern that interested parties would lack guidance on precisely how to read congress limits on the reach of the clean water act and would be left to feel their way on a basis.at concurring opinion.
the sacketts are interested parties feeling their way.they own a tlrdivsl residential lot in bonner county,idaho.their property lies just north of priest lake,but is separated from the lake by several lots containing permanent structures.in preparation for constructing a house,the sacketts filled in part of their lot with dirt and rock.some months later,they received from the epa a compliance order.the order contained a number of findings and conclusions,including the following 
the sacketts property contains wetlands within the meaning of b the wetlands meet the criteria for jurisdictional wetlands in the federal manual for identifying and delineating jurisdictional wetlands.
the site wetlands are adjacent to priest lake within the meaning of c.priest lake is a navigable water within the meaning of section of the act,and waters of the united states within the meaning of.
in april and may,at times more fully known to the sacketts,they persons acting on their behalf discharged fill material into wetlands at the site.they filled approximately one half acre.
by causing such fill material to enter waters of the united states,the sacketts have engaged,and are continuing to engage,in the discharge of pollutants from a point source within the meaning of sections and of the act,and.
the sacketts discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states at the site without a permit constitutes a violation of section of the act.app.
on the basis of these findings and conclusions,the order directs the sacketts,among other things,immediately to undertake activities to restore the site in accordance with an restoration work plan and to provide obtain access to the site and access to all records and documentation related to the conditions at the site to epa employees their designated representatives.at.
the sacketts,who do not believe that their property is subject to the act,asked the epa for a hearing,but that request was denied.they then brought this action in the united states district court for the d
