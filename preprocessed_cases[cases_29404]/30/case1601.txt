paul conti is a swordfisherman.along with conti corporation,he filed suit in the united states court of federal claims seeking compensation under the taking clause of the fifth amendment.in his complaint,conti alleged that the government prohibition on drift gillnet swordfishing in the atlantic swordfish fishery had deprived him of all economic value in his swordfishing permit,his vessel,the providenza owned by conti corporation,and his swordfishing gear.the court of federal claims granted the government motion to dismiss the complaint under its rule b for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.conti united states,fed.cl.the court held that the swordfishing ban did not deprive conti of the possession of his vessel and swordfishing gear and thus did not constitute a compensable taking of that property.id.at.the court also held that conti swordfishing permit did not give rise to a property interest cognizable under the fifth amendment and that it therefore could not be the subject of a taking.id.at.conti now appeals the court decision because we conclude that the swordfishing ban did not take any of conti property,we affirm.
background 
the following facts either are undisputed or are taken from conti complaint.swordfish are caught using drift gillnets,longlines,or handgear.the drift gillnet technique,utilized by conti,consists of deploying specially designed nets pelagic drift gillnets.the nets are attached to a vessel and are deployed to catch swordfish by entangling them.
conti began his swordfishing career in the pacific ocean in.complaint of paul conti and conti corporation hereinafter complaint at.that year,he acquired and launched the providenza,which was specifically designed for driftnetting.id.six years later,he moved his base of operations from seattle,washington,to gloucester,massachusetts,and deployed his vessel and gear off the atlantic coast.id.at.between his arrival in massachusetts in and the government permanent ban on drift gillnets in,conti harvested swordfish in the atlantic swordfish fishery using the providenza.according to conti,drift gillnet fishing for swordfish accounted for of his income.
during the period that he fished in the atlantic swordfish fishery,conti faced a regulatory regime that increasingly restricted his activities.pursuant to the act,msa,the secretary of commerce possesses the power to regulate fisheries within an exclusive economic zone eez that extends from to miles off the united states coast the secretary manages the fisheries by approving fishery management plans,which may prohibit,limit,condition,or require the use of specified types and quantities of fishing gear,fishing vessels,or equipment,b,in order to effectuate the msa purpose of preserving the fisheries health,stability,and fish stocks.see a a.regulations implementing fishery management plans,often promulgated by the national marine fisheries service nmfs,have the force and effect of law.see alaska factory trawler ass baldridge,cir.
despite the government broad de jure power to regulate the atlantic swordfish fishery under the msa,conti alleges that he harvested swordfish without de facto regulatory interference until,when nmfs enacted regulations which had the effect of requiring him to apply for a revocable,permit.see atlantic swordfish fishery.subsequent regulations that were promulgated pursuant to the and other statutes,including the atlantic tunas convention act,the marine mammal protection act,and the endangered species act,created an increasingly onerous regulatory environment.many of these regulations were specifically directed to reducing drift gillnet fishing,which had aroused national and international concern on account of that fact that drift gillnets ensnare significant numbers of sea turtles and marine mammals,including whales.see,taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations atlantic large whale take reduction plan regulations.july.
in,the united nations banned the use of drift gillnets in international waters,which led congress to enact the driftnet act amendments of.res,gaor,plen,doc.the amendments provided for implementing the international moratorium on the use of drift gillnets of a certain length beyond the eez and for the imposition of sanctions against nations whose vessels or nationals were not in compliance.in,the government began to implement increasingly severe quotas that limited each fisherman catch using drift gillnets,see atlantic swordfish fishery,and the nmfs closed the atlantic swordfish fishery entirely from december of through july of.see atlantic swordfish fishery drift gillnet emergency closure,atlantic swordfish fishery extension of drift gillnet emergency closure.june,north atlantic swordfish fishery closure.finally,in its ongoing effort to reduce bycatch and preserve the swordfish stock,the nmfs issued a final regulation in january of,prohibiting the use of drift gillnet gear entirely in the atlantic swordfish fishery.atlantic swordfish fishery management of driftnet gear,a,e.the object of the ban was to reduce marine mammal and sea turtle catch while conserving swordfish and other marine resources.see.at.since the regulation permitted the harvesting of swordfish in the fishery using methods other than drift gillnet fishing,the nmfs sought to mitigate the ban economic impact by allowing permit holders,for the first time,to sell permits for use with gillnet gear.see d.
in december of,conti brought suit in the court of federal claims,alleging that the january ban on harvesting swordfish using drift gillnets constituted a regulatory taking of his fishing permit,the providenza,and his gillnet gear without just compensation,in violation of the fifth amendment.complaint at.conti asserted that the ban had inversely deprived him of the economically viable use and enjoyment of his property.complaint at.
in due course,the government moved under rcfc b to dismiss conti complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.addressing the motion,the court of federal claims applied the test for regulatory takings claims that is set forth in m j coal united states.that test requires a claimant to establish a compensable property interest that the government took through regulation.after considering the several property interests asserted by conti,the court concluded that none of them could form the basis for a viable taking claim.conti,fed.cl.at.the court first considered conti fishing vessel and drift gillnet gear.while the court acknowledged that conti ownership of the providenza and its gear has traditional characteristics of personal property,the court concluded that the drift gillnetting ban did not take that property.id.at.the court reasoned that conti continuing ability to sell the vessel and the gear,fish in a different fishery,or put both the nets and the vessel to other uses precluded a finding that a regulatory taking had occurred.id.at.as for conti efforts to characterize the right to use the permit and his vessel and gear to earn a living as the relevant property interest taken by the regulation,the court of federal claims determined that continued use of conti property for harvesting swordfish with drift gillnets did not constitute a compensable property interest.therefore,the court held,the right could not qualify as an interest that could be the subject of a fifth amendment taking claim.finally,in the setting of the pervasive regulatory environment circumscribing conti ability to harvest swordfish using drift gillnets in the atlantic swordfish fishery,the court viewed the interest conferred by the swordfishing permit as resembling a revocable license instead of a compensable property right.id.at.

the fifth amendment provides,in pertinent part,as follows nor shall private property be taken for public use,without just compensation.const.amend.v,cl.the language of this clause and the jurisprudence interpreting it evince a policy of prohibiting the government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which,in all fairness and justice,should be borne by the public as a whole.penn central transp.new york city,d quoting armstrong united states,d.while a taking often occurs as a result of a physical invasion or confiscation,the supreme court has long recognized that if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.pennsylvania coal mahon.real property,see lucas south carolina coastal council,d,tangible property,see andrus allard,d,and intangible property,see ruckelshaus monsanto,d,all may be the subject of takings claims.
as the court of federal claims recognized,this court has developed a test to evaluate claims that a governmental regulation constitutes a taking of private property without just compensation.see m j coal,at karuk tribe ammon.first,a court must evaluate whether the claimant has established a property interest for purposes of the fifth amendment.see m j coal,at.second,once a court has determined that a property interest exists,it must determine whether a taking occurred.in that regard,we have stated that it is often important to determine at the outset whether a particular claimed taking was categorical or not.rith energy,united states.a categorical taking has been defined as one in which all economically viable use,all economic value has been taken by the regulatory imposition.palm beach isles assocs.united states.a categorical taking is distinct from a taking that is the consequence of a regulatory imposition that prohibits or restricts only some of the use that would otherwise be available to the property owner but leaves the property owner with substantial economic use.id.when a taking is determined to be,the court must embark on a inquiry in which it applies the standard promulgated by the supreme court in penn central to evaluate whether the governmental action at issue constituted a cognizable taking of the property interest at issue.rith energy,at.the penn central analysis involves several factors that have particular significance.at.those factors are the character of the governmental action,the economic impact of the action on the claimant,and the extent to which the action has interfered with the claimant distinct,expectations.id.however,if a claimant fails to demonstrate that the interest allegedly taken constituted a property interest under the fifth amendment,a court need not even consider whether the government regulation was a taking under the analysis set forth in penn central.m j coal,at karuk tribe,at.
at the outset,it is important to understand the precise nature of the taking claim that conti is asserting.in his complaint,conti points to three items of property that allegedly have been taken by the ban on drift gillnet swordfishing i his swordfish permit ii his vessel,the providenza and iii his gillnets and related gear.conti acknowledges that these items were not physically taken from him.after the ban on drift gillnets,his permit remained valid for other types of swordfishing,and he maintained possession of the providenza and his gear.rather,what conti alleges in his complaint is that b oth his property and his business have been taken by government regulation,which has inversely deprived him of the economically viable use and enjoyment of his property.complaint at.conti states that he has been economically deprived of the use and value of his vessel,nets,gear,and permit and that he has been forced out of the swordfishing business and left with no alternatives for employment.he explains his predicament in of his complaint 
by reason of a combination of unique factors,including but not limited,to plaintiff age,his economic limitations,his acquired fishing skills,the relatively small size of the providenza,the design of the vessel and its gear,the mesh size and configuration of plaintiff nets,the limited permits issued to him by nmfs,the season and location for the harvesting of swordfish,and the average annual days at sea,or plaintiff historical fishing effort,and the moratoriums,closures and limits placed by nmfs on other fisheries,plaintiff can not transfer or convert either his personal effort or his vessel and gear to any other fishery,and is therefore dependent for his livelihood on the atlantic swordfish driftnet fishery.
in short,conti contends that,while he still is in possession of his permit,the providenza,and his gear,there has been taken from him the ability to use those things in a particular way to fish for swordfish in the atlantic swordfish fishery using drift gillnets.according to conti,because of his unique circumstances,that is the only livelihood that he is capable of pursuing.it is in that respect that he argues his property has been taken.armed with this understanding of conti taking claim,we turn now to the analysis mandated by m j coal.
our first task under the m j coal analysis is to determine whether conti has established a property interest for purposes of the fifth amendment.we begin with the swordfishing permit.
a.the constitution neither creates nor defines the scope of property interests compensable under the fifth amendment.bd.of regents of state colleges roth,d.instead,existing rules and understandings and background principles derived from an independent source,such as state,federal,or common law,define the dimensions of the requisite property rights for purposes of establishing a cognizable taking.lucas,at.these existing rules often involve and define the citizen relation to the physical thing,as the right to possess,use and dispose of it.united states motors.
applying these principles,courts have held that no property rights are created in permits and licenses.see,united states fuller,d alves united states.in fuller,the government condemned acres of the respondents fee lands.at.the respondents also held grazing permits for certain nearby lands.the permits were issued under the taylor grazing act.during the condemnation proceeding,the parties disputed whether the value accruing to the fee lands as a result of their actual or potential use in combination with the taylor grazing act permit lands was compensable.fuller,at.in addressing the question,the supreme court focused on the revocability of the grazing permits and the clear congressional expression in that the issuance of a permit under the act shall not create any right,title,interest,or estate in or to the lands.the court noted that section makes clear the congressional intent that no compensable property be created in the permit lands themselves as a result of the permit.id.at.under these circumstances,the court held that the fifth amendment does not require the government to pay for that element of value based on the use of respondents fee lands in combination with the government permit lands.id.at.this was the case even if this element of value would warrant a higher selling price for the fee lands on the open market than if the fee lands were offered for sale without it.
in alves,we adjudicated a petitioner claim that his grazing preference,which accorded a priority position for procuring a grazing permit under the taylor grazing act,constituted a property interest compensable under the fifth amendment.see defining a grazing preference.relying on the supreme court holding in fuller and the
