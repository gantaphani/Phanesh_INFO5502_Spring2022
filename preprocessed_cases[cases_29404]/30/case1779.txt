defendant jeffrey tarris appeals from judgment entered following jury convictions for unlawful disposal of hazardous waste health,subd.b count,unlawful transport of hazardous waste health,subd.c count,and littering in commercial quantities,a misdemeanor,subd.h count.
the trial court suspended defendant sentence and placed him on months probation,conditional upon defendant serving days in county jail.defendant was also assessed court security fees,under penal code section in fines and penalty assessments,and in fines and penalty assessments under health and safety code section,subdivision e.in addition,defendant was ordered to pay a restitution fee of to the riverside county department of environmental health,hazardous materials management division hmmd and to the riverside county department of transportation.the court also imposed an restitution fine under penal code section,subdivision b,and a probation revocation restitution fine under penal code section,which was stayed.
defendant contends the evidence was insufficient to support his unlawful transport conviction count and the trial court did not have authority to require defendant to pay a restitution fee of for the costs of investigation.in addition,defendant asserts remand is necessary because the trial judge failed to provide a breakdown of the fees,fines and penalty assessments imposed on each count.
after defendant filed his opening brief,the trial court provided a breakdown of the fees,fines and penalty assessments imposed.as to counts and,the court assessed a base fine of,plus in penalties and assessments as to each count.
after the court provided the breakdown of fines,defendant filed a supplemental appellate brief with this court,arguing that under penal code section,the court was barred from imposing restitution fines on both the disposal count count and the transport count count.defendant also argues the trial court improperly imposed excessive court security fees and a court construction fund fee.
we conclude there was sufficient evidence to support defendant convictions and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering defendant to pay hmmd for the costs of investigation as a condition of probation.
the trial court erred,however,in imposing restitution fines under health and safety code section,subdivision e,as to both counts and,without staying the fine as to one of the two counts.imposing duplicate fines constituted multiple punishment for the same act or course of conduct in violation of penal code section.in addition,the court erred in imposing excessive court security fees and in assessing a court construction fee.we affirm defendant convictions but reverse his sentence,and order the matter remanded for resentencing.
defendant leased space to six families on his undeveloped parcel of land off agate street in riverside.the families lived on the land in motor homes or trailers.in may,one of defendant tenants,martha sanders,went on vacation out of state.her boyfriend,herdo ramirez,also known as jerry,remained at martha motor home.
jerry kept outside martha home a metal shelving unit,where jerry stored cans of paints and other chemicals.martha explained at trial that jerry scrapped.he collected and saved items that could be used,sold or given away.he kept containers of chemicals and paints on metal shelves outside her motor home.
on june,defendant asked a county road crew working in the area if the road crew was going to be cleaning up agate street.the crew chief told defendant the crew would clear debris only if it was on county property.at that time the crew chief was aware there were only a couple of items that needed to be cleared.he had not seen any hazardous waste there.
later,at the end of that day,the road crew returned to the same area by the water channel,off the side of agate street,and discovered there was a truckload of trash.because there was too much to clear,the crew decided to clear the trash the next day.
martha brother,gilbert sanders,gilbert and gilbert son,gilbert sanders,junior,who also lived on defendant property,testified that on june,they saw defendant use his bobcat loader to move jerry and martha possessions off defendant land.gilbert and junior saw defendant driving his bobcat down a dirt road off defendant property toward agate.junior also noticed property belonging to martha on the side of agate street as well.the pile of trash had increased from the day before.there was a camper shell,which defendant had loaded up with jerry and martha possessions and transported on the bobcat to the side of the road.the trash on the side of the road also included jerry chicken coop,doghouse,car battery,and the metal shelving unit with paint and chemicals.
on june,the riverside county transportation department received an anonymous call reporting that trash was blocking agate street.in response,county assistant district road maintenance supervisor,jeffrey lewellen,went out to the site that same day.he found a pile of trash,including containers of paint and chemicals,dumped in the road,blocking part of a lane.lewellen called kelly winters at riverside county department of environmental health.
hazardous materials management specialist,kelly winters,testified that a county road department supervisor called him and told him about the pile of trash to cubic yards of trash and waste,which appeared to include hazardous waste.winters went out to the site.the debris was located on the side of the road,about feet from a water channel.the debris included and latex paints,resin hardener,carpet cement,two containers of waste oil,rust primer,pipe cement,and lock tight cement.some of the containers were unlabeled and some had warning labels.some of the contents in the containers were tested and found to contain hazardous waste.
riverside county district attorney investigator,joseph asbury,who was assigned to the environmental crimes unit,testified that on june,he responded to a call from winters,requesting asbury to come out to agate street.asbury observed the pile of debris.
asbury spoke to defendant that same day.asbury explained to him that he was investigating the illegal dumping of trash and hazardous waste on the roadside and was curious as to how the trash got there.defendant said he had moved the trash off his property onto his neighbor adjacent property.defendant was in the process of cleaning up his property in response to county code enforcement telling him to remove the trash from his property.
defendant told asbury on june,that he had talked to someone from the county road department the day before about removing trash left on the side of the road.the road department crew said they were going to remove the trash.defendant asked about also removing the trash on his neighbor property.the road crew said they could not remove trash from private property.as a consequence,defendant moved the trash on his neighbor property to the roadway so the county would pick it up.defendant neither admitted to asbury nor denied dumping the hazardous waste.
defendant testified that martha told him she intended to stay in kansas and hoped jerry would join her.defendant decided to evict martha and jerry.at the beginning of june,after defendant was cited for code enforcement violations,defendant told all his tenants,including jerry,to move off the property.defendant told jerry he needed to remove his property as soon as possible.jerry said he would take care of things when he got back from picking up some scrap metal but jerry did not return to pick up his belongings.
around june,defendant evicted jerry and martha.he loaded most of their belongings into their motor home and used his bobcat to push the motor home onto defendant neighbor property.defendant admitted moving jerry shelving unit with the containers of paint and chemicals off defendant property,but claimed he deposited it next to martha motor home located on the neighbor property.
around the first of june,defendant saw two cans of used motor oil abandoned in the flood channel along agate street.defendant did not know who put the cans of oil there.a neighbor,susan powers,who lived near the water channel,testified that the cans of oil showed up several weeks before the other trash.
defendant testified that on june,he called the county and reported there was a lot of trash on the side of agate street,including a doghouse and chicken coop that belonged to jerry.three or four days earlier,defendant had moved the doghouse and chicken coop to his neighbor property.when defendant saw the county road crew on june,he thought they could remove the trash on the side of the road in the flood channel.defendant asked one of the workers if he was going to clean up the trash.the crew member said that,after finishing up at another site,he planned on picking up the trash on the north side but not the south side of the culvert.
defendant asked the crew member what would happen if he moved the trash from the south to the north side.the crew worker said he would take it.defendant then went home,got his bobcat,loaded it with a black truck bed liner full of trash and deposited the trash on the north side of the culvert.defendant denied moving jerry shelves and cans of paint and chemicals to the north side of the culvert.the last time defendant saw those items,they were on his neighbor property,where defendant had moved them.
defendant noticed that the next day,june,the pile of trash had grown and someone had added jerry shelving unit and containers of chemicals.defendant called the county again on june and asked when the county was going to clean up the trash.
sufficiency of evidence 
defendant contends there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for unlawful transport of hazardous waste,subd.c count.
in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence,we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses evidence that is reasonable,credible,and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.citations.reversal on this ground is unwarranted unless it appears that upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to support the conviction.citation.people bolin cal th,d.
section,subdivision c,states it is unlawful for a ny person who knowingly transports or causes the transportation of hazardous waste defendant contends the items he transported were not yet hazardous waste within the meaning of section,subdivision c,because they had not yet been discarded and,thus,were not waste when transported.
hazardous waste is defined by the state department of toxic substances control pursuant to its regulatory authority under sections and,subd.q,tit,et california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision a,adopted in,defines hazardous waste in principal part as a waste that pose s a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when it is improperly treated,stored,transported,disposed of or otherwise managed waste means any discarded material of any form,tit,subd.a see also section.
defendant does not dispute that the transported materials were hazardous.rather,citing section,he argues that they did not constituted waste until after defendant transported and discarded them.section states handling means the transporting or transferring from one place to another,or pumping,processing,storing,or packaging of hazardous waste,but does not include the handling of any substance before it becomes a waste.italics added.
the issue here is thus whether there was substantial evidence establishing that when defendant transported the hazardous materials,they constituted waste under section,subdivision c.there was ample evidence supporting such a finding that the cans of opened and unopened house paint,oil,thinner,tubes of cement glue,and other chemical products constituted waste.even though the discarded materials belonged to defendant tenant,jerry,defendant had evicted jerry and told him to remove his belongings from defendant property and move off the property.rather than complying with defendant demand,jerry left and said he would do it later.according to defendant,jerry did not do so.
because defendant had been cited and told by a county code enforcement officer to clean up his property prior to reinspection,defendant proceeded to clean up his property and told his tenants to remove their belongings,move off the property,and clean up their mess immediately.since jerry failed to do so,defendant removed jerry property,which included hazardous materials.
under such circumstances,there is overwhelming evidence that,because jerry had not removed his belongings from defendant property as requested,defendant considered the property waste and decided to dispose of it by loading it on his bobcat and transporting jerry property to the side of the road and dumping it where defendant assumed the county would clean it up.
defendant argues that jerry property did not constitute waste because jerry had intended to keep and use the property.but a reasonable juror could conclude defendant considered the property trash and proceeded to treat it as such by removing it from his property and dumping it on the street.as the saying goes,one person trash is another person treasure.here,there was ample evidence that,when defendant transported and dumped jerry property,including the hazardous materials,defendant considered it trash.
cost of investigation 
defendant contends the trial court erred in ordering him to reimburse hmmd for the costs of investigation of the hazardous waste offenses.hmmd deputy director paul tavares submitted an invoice to the probation officer requesting reimbursement of,the cost of investigating defendant offenses of transporting and dumping hazardous waste on county property.the trial court ordered defendant to reimburse hmmd for this expense as a condition of probation.
we review the trial court restitution order for abuse of discretion.citation.a restitution order that is based on a demonstrable error of law constitutes an abuse of the trial court discretion.citation.people woods th,d woods.
citing people baker d.baker and people torres th,d torres,defendant argues reimbursement for investigation and prosecution costs is improper.as explained in baker,penal code section creates and limits the trial court power to grant probation.citation.it provides in part that the trial court may in connection with granting probation provide for reparation in proper cases and may impose and require other reasonable conditions,as it may determine are fitting and proper to the end that justice may be done,that amends may be made to society for the breach of the law,for any injury done to any person resulting from such breach and generally and specifically for the reformation and rehabilitation of the probationer the courts interpret the term reparation in penal code section to mean reimbursement to the victims of crime for actual loss flowing from the charged offense or from related misconduct.citations.the government may be the beneficiary of that reimbursement if it has incurred actual loss due to the crime,as in the instance of tax evasion or theft of government property,but reparation does not include the general costs of prosecuting and rehabilitating criminals.baker,supra,d at.
penal code section,which implements the constitutional right to restitution,further provides that a victim of crime who incurs any economic loss as a result of the commission of a crime shall receive restitution directly from any defendant convicted of that crime,subd.a.
subdivision a b of penal code section requires the court to order the defendant to pay r estitution to the victim or victims,if any,in accordance with subdivision f.subdivision f of penal code section provides that in every case in which a victim has suffered economic loss as a result of the defendant conduct,the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order,based on the amount of loss claimed by the victim or victims or any other showing to the court.
in discussing restitution to a crime victim,the court explains in woods,supra,th,d,that the penal code section limitation does not apply in the context of gran
