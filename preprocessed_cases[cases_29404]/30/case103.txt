limar shipping limar and omi corporation omi,appeal a grant of summary judgment in favor of the the united states,in a case alleging,inter alia,that the united states was negligent breached warranties in the surveying of the boston harbor and the dissemination of nautical charts that failed to accurately depict the depth of the harbor.plaintiffs claim that the erroneous chart resulted in the grounding of and subsequent damage to their vessel,the limar.plaintiffs raise two main issues on appeal,namely,that the district court erred in finding that there is an implied discretionary function exemption in the suits in admiralty act and applying the discretionary function exemption as it did to the facts of this case.after careful review,we affirm the district court ruling for the reasons stated below.
on the morning of march,the steel hulled tanker vessel limar,owned by limar and operated by omi,approached boston,massachusetts.under massachusetts law,foreign vessels the size of the limar must employ a harbor pilot when entering boston harbor see.laws ch.accordingly,the limar took aboard a harbor pilot,lawrence cannon,who undertook navigation of the ship through the boston harbor shipping channel.
the main shipping route in the boston harbor includes inbound and outbound channels,which are maintained by the army corps of engineers army corps.congress allocates funds to maintain federal shipping channels at certain authorized depths and widths.in,the army corps was authorized to dredge the boston harbor inbound channel to a depth of feet below mean low water,and was also authorized to maintain the outbound channel at a depth of not more than forty feet.both of these channels could be maintained up to feet wide.
the army corps conducts periodic surveys of the shipping channels to determine their actual depths,as opposed to the authorized depths,and to discover any unexpected debris or shoaling.the results of these surveys are made known to the public through results of survey reports and the coast guard local notice to mariners publications.relevant to this matter,the last periodic survey of the disputed area of the inbound channel was completed in.the results of the boston harbor survey appeared in a results of survey report dated july,and they were published in the first coast guard district local notice to mariners,number,on august.they also appeared in a book entitled the port of boston,massachusetts,port series,issued in.in each of these sources,the survey reported the controlling depth of the channel,which is the shallowest point at any place as compared to mean low water.
cannon,a harbor pilot with years of experience at the time of the grounding,knew these survey results,and did not bring a nautical chart with him.although he had never been aboard the limar,he familiarized himself with the ship,and asked the limar crew for the draft of the ship before directing the ship through boston harbor.
while cannon piloted the vessel,the limar crew observed the movement of the ship.third mate rodolfo arcilla took periodic position fixes of the vessel location and plotted them on the limar copy of nautical chart,edition,dated june.the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa created this chart using information from several sources,including the army corps survey mentioned above 
at,the limar scraped the boston harbor floor near red nunn buoy,at approximately n and w.according to the nautical chart produced by noaa,the water depths nearest to the position of the groundings are and feet,which allegedly should have accommodated the limar feet,nine inch draft.the vessel grounded on the starboard right side forebody,but was still able to reach its berth.however,the damage to the hull and the ensuing steps taken to prevent oil pollution are alleged to have cost limar and omi in excess of.
limar and omi sued the government under the suits in admiralty act saa,appx,alleging that the misrepresentation of the water depth on the chart caused the damage to the limar.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the united states,finding that the discretionary function exception applied and that the united states was entitled to dismissal of the complaint on grounds of sovereign immunity.

iii.discussion 
this case involves allegations of negligence on the part of the united states in the production and dissemination of a nautical chart.in order to avoid confusion,we highlight several key facts.the army corps conducted a survey of the boston harbor,which was later used by noaa to create a nautical chart of the harbor.the plaintiffs argue that the chart failed to accurately depict the depth of the harbor,and the limar grounding was a result of this inaccuracy.instead of following what the plaintiffs allege are mandatory standards,the army corps followed its own guidelines in conducting the survey.the plaintiffs contend that the chart inaccuracy could have been prevented if noaa had based the chart on a survey that was conducted in accordance with noaa standards for hydrographic surveys.specifically,the plaintiffs argue that if the nautical chart had been based on a survey conducted in compliance with noaa guidelines,it would have been more accurate because those guidelines require measurements on tighter sounding intervals and line spacing than those called for by the army corps guidelines.according to the plaintiffs,the army corps should have followed the noaa requirements in conducting its initial survey because it knew that noaa would rely on the survey in creating nautical charts.noaa did in fact use the army corps survey,in conjunction with other sources,to create the chart.thus,plaintiffs allege two grounds of liability the army corps decision to follow its own guidelines rather than the noaa guidelines in conducting the survey and noaa decision to create a chart based on that survey.
plaintiffs urge us to hold that the united states has completely waived sovereign immunity in the saa,and consequently that no discretionary function exception exists in this context.in the event we find that there is such an exception,plaintiffs argue that the exception should not apply to the decisions made by the army corps and noaa,and that the united states should be subject to suit,because the decisions were.the final argument offered by plaintiffs is that even if noaa decision to rely on the army corps survey was a discretionary decision,once that decision was made,the government entity had a duty of care to create the chart accurately.plaintiffs argue that since mariners regularly rely on such charts for navigation,misrepresentation as to the depth of the harbor is grounds for liability.
in response,defendants argue that the actions by both the army corps and noaa are discretionary decisions that fall within the implied discretionary function exception to the saa.thus,defendants argue the united states is protected from suit by sovereign immunity.
existence of the implied discretionary function exception 
we begin with the threshold issue of whether a discretionary function exception should be implied in the context of the saa.unless such an exception can be implied,waiver of sovereign immunity by the united states would allow the plaintiffs suit to proceed.
the united states,as sovereign,is immune from suit unless it waives its sovereign immunity and consents to be sued.see,united states thompson.absent express waiver of sovereign immunity,federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over suits against the united states.united states sherwood.in the saa,the united states waives its sovereign immunity from suit for maritime torts committed by its agents.see appx.gercey united states,cir.
the saa contains no express exceptions to the waiver of sovereign immunity.in contrast,the federal torts claims act ftca,b,which waives sovereign immunity for tort claims against the united states,contains an express exception to shield the discretion of the executive or administrator to act according to one judgment of the best course.dalehite united states.this discretionary function exception serves to prevent judicial of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social,economic,and political policy.united states empresa de viacao aerea rio grandense varig airlines,d.this court has held that a similar discretionary function exception is to be implied into the saa see gercey,at.
we decline plaintiffs invitation to reconsider our decision in gercey,and reaffirm the principles set forth therein.congress did not intend,by passing the saa,to create a system wherein all administrative decisions concerning maritime matters are and subject to judicial review.gercey,at.absence of an express congressional directive to the contrary will not be read as a green light for federal courts to assume power to review all administrative and legislative decisions concerning the public interest in maritime matters.id.the district court did not err in applying law implying a discretionary function exception to the saa.
applicability of the implied discretionary function exception 
given that there is an implied discretionary function exception to the saa,we turn to the argument that the district court misapplied the exception to the facts of the case at bar.as in the ftca context,the implied discretionary function exception to the saa insulates the government from liability if the action challenged in the case involves the permissible exercise of policy judgment.berkovitz united states,d.plaintiffs suggest that the actions of the army corps and noaa fail to meet the discretionary function exception applicability test and that the united states is therefore subject to suit.
in berkovitz,the supreme court set forth a test to determine whether the discretionary function exception bars a suit against the united states at.first,a court must determine if the challenged conduct involves an element of judgment,meaning that the action is a matter of choice for the acting employee.id.at.second,a court must determine whether that judgment is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield,meaning it involved governmental actions and decisions based on considerations of public policy.id.
applicability of the discretionary function exception to the army corps survey 
it is well established that the discretionary function exception will not apply when a federal statute,regulation,or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow.see berkovitz,at.however,if there is no mandatory regulation that requires a particular course of action,then the discretionary function exception can apply.id.here,plaintiffs argue that the army corps failed to follow mandatory internal procedures requiring its survey of the boston harbor to be conducted in accordance with noaa guidelines.because they contend that compliance with the noaa guidelines was mandatory,plaintiffs claim that the discretionary function exception can not protect the united states from suit.we disagree.
no mandatory internal procedures or directives required the army corps to adhere to the noaa guidelines in conducting its survey of the boston harbor,thus the element of judgment prong of the berkovitz test is met.the army corps generally follows its own manual when it performs oceanic surveys,and there is no dispute that the army corps hydrographic surveying engineer manual army corps manual applies to hydrographic surveys planned and performed by the army corps and sets forth the applicable procedures.army corps manual at stating that manual establishes standard procedures,minimum accuracy requirements,instrumentation and equipment requirements,and quality control criteria for hydrographic surveys.the army corps manual states 
this manual is intended to cover only those engineering and construction survey activities which support typical river,harbor,harbor approach channel,or inland waterway projects it does not cover classical hydrographic surveying functions which are more traditionally associated with the preparation of nautical charts.these procedures are detailed in the noaa hydrographic manual.
army corps manual at b.here,the parties agreed and the district court found that the army corps conducted the boston harbor survey as a condition survey,which is a periodic survey carried out to determine the present condition of navigation channels and underwater features,but is not a survey in conjunction with the preparation of a nautical chart.army corps manual at.there is no mandatory language in the army corps manual indicating that the army corps must follow the noaa guidelines when carrying out a condition survey,even if it is aware that such a survey may be used by other agencies to prepare nautical matters is the purpose of the survey at the time it is conducted by the army corps since the purpose of the survey at the time it was conducted was to determine the condition of the harbor rather than to chart its depth,the army corps was under no obligation to comply with noaa guidelines.
having found that the choice to conduct the condition survey according to the army corps guidelines constituted a discretionary choice,we now turn to the second part of the berkovitz test and consider whether that decision is of the type the discretionary function exception was designed to protect.berkovitz,at.
where a regulation allows the employee discretion,the very existence of the regulation creates a strong presumption that a discretionary act authorized by the regulation involves consideration of the same policies which led to the promulgation of the regulations.united states gaubert,d.plaintiff bears the burden of rebutting this presumption and demonstrating that the conduct at issue is not.see wood united states,cir.here,the plaintiffs fail to meet this burden.indeed the corps decision to follow its own less stringent guidelines is most likely a choice aimed to maximize efficient use of resources,and is thus.see,varig airlines,at.recognizing the efficient allocation of agency resources as a policy choice.
applicability of the discretionary function exception to noaa use of the army corps survey in creating the chart 
this leaves only the argument that once noaa made the decision to create a chart,it had a duty to produce it accurately in indian towing united states,the supreme court held the united states liable for negligently maintaining a lighthouse built by the coast guard.id.at.mariners relied on the lighthouse for navigation and plaintiff ship was damaged when it ran aground because the light went out.id.at.the indian towing court indicated that once the coast guard exercised its discretion to operate the lighthouse,it was under an obligation to do so with reasonable care.id.at.we find that indian towing can be distinguished from the instant case because there the government conceded that the discretionary function exception did not apply.id.at.in this case,however,the government vigorously argues,and we agree,that the decision by noaa to use the corps data to create the chart was discretionary and was thus the type of decision the discretionary function exception was meant to protect 
the element of judgment prong of the berkovitz test is satisfied because noaa decision to use the army corps survey in fact contains an element of judgment.as stated above,the discretionary function applies unless a federal statute,regulation or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow.berkovitz,at.accord wood,at.nowhere in noaa hydrographic manual are employees directed to use as the basis for charts only surveys conducted by noaa or by other entities following noaa guidelines.in fact,the manual only stipulates that if noaa itself conducts a survey,it must conform with the manual specific directives.here,noaa did not conduct the survey of the boston harbor which formed the basis for the chart.since there is no specific regulation,and thus no mandatory language either directing the cartographer as to the surveys that ought to be used when making a chart,or prohibiting use of conforming su
