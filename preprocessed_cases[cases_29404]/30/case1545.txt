the rogers corporation the company petitions for review of the decision of the environmental appeals board assessing a penalty of for violation of section of the toxic substances control act.the company challenges the decision on a variety of grounds.suffice it to say,the company contends that the board affirmance of the grant of the agency motion for partial accelerated decision,which requires a finding that no genuine issue of material fact exists,a,was arbitrary and capricious.we agree,and,accordingly,we grant the petition and remand the case to the board for further proceedings.
the parties stipulated to the following facts the company,a massachusetts corporation that has its principal place of business in connecticut,owns and operates a manufacturing facility that produces polyurethane elastomers and foams.during the relevant time period,the company used a heat transfer system known as hts,which was located in a basement room.the hts used oil as a heat transfer medium,and oil occasionally dripped or wept from the pump bearings and then collected on the concrete floor beneath the hts in a shallow concrete berm.from time to time,the company pumped the oil from the berm under the hts into drums,sampled the contents of the drums for hazardous waste constituents,and shipped the drums for disposal.from at least to at least march,analysis of the samples of residual heat transfer fluid taken from the berm did not reveal concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs equal to or greater than parts per million ppm.in april,however,sampling of drums of waste oil revealed pcbs in excess of ppm in nine drums.the company was notified of the excessive pcbs in june,and the sixteen drums were shipped for disposal in september.in december,the connecticut department of environmental protection inspected the company,found pcbs in excess of ppm in two of five samples of oil taken from the hts room,and cited the company.four months later,the department ordered the company to conduct certain studies and to take remedial actions.in response,the company continued to investigate the source of the excessive pcbs and undertook remedial actions.
in september,the environmental protection agency the agency charged the company with improper disposal of pcbs from june,until on or around december,in violation of and of the toxic substance control act,and proposed a civil penalty of.the company filed an answer in october,and,pursuant to c,requested a hearing.in its prehearing memorandum,the company stated that it would offer evidence that it had not used any pcb containing heat transfer fluids since,and that the only logical source of the pcbs in the residual heat transfer fluid was the concrete floor and soil underneath the hts.in a supplemental prehearing memorandum,the company proffered robert potterton as an expert witness who would provide an opinion as to the basis for the unexpected appearance,in or about,of pcb concentrations equal to or greater than ppm in the fluid that was pumped from the bermed containment area in the vicinity of hts potterton would also testify about remediation efforts by the company.
just short of three years after the agency filed its charge,on september,the company filed a motion for an accelerated decision,pursuant to a.the company sought application of the agency historic waste exemption for fluids placed in a disposal site prior to february.anticipating that the agency would rely on in the matter of standard scrap metal company,tsca appeal.lexis,wl,the company argued that the phrase disposal site did not refer to a narrow subcategory of places for containing spilled or released prior to february.the company pointed to agency regulations proposed december,clarifying that pcbs disposed of prior to april,do not require further disposal action unless a regional administrator finds that such historic waste presents a risk to health or the environment from exposure.see disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls,fed.reg.proposed,codified at b.the company asserted that this court had acknowledged the validity of the proposed rule as a statement of agency policy in general electric epa,and that the environmental appeals board had relied on the proposed rule as support for the respondent position in in re cwm chemical services,tsca appeal.lexis,wl may.as evidentiary support for application of the historic waste exemption,attached to the company motion for accelerated decision was an affidavit of gerry langelier,an engineer at the company for years,stating that the company had ceased using oil in,and that,since then,oil seepage from the wet seals into the bermed containment area under the hts had never before the tests contained pcb concentrations above ppm.
the agency filed an opposition to the company motion for accelerated decision,a motion to file an amended complaint to increase the duration of the charged violation and the proposed penalty to based on evidence that the spill remained from june,until march,or later,as well as its own motion for a partial accelerated decision on liability.the company opposed the agency motion for a partial accelerated decision,renewed its argument based on the agency interpretation of its regulations as reflected in the proposed regulations,and also argued that the agency inference that a disposal took place in was unwarranted in light of the undisputed fact that there was no ongoing source of pcbs in the hts.asserting that the question of why pcbs suddenly showed up in berm samples was a matter of speculation,the company stated that question was irrelevant because there was no evidence of any spill or leak at the company in.an attached affidavit from its engineer stated that no piping containing pcb had been connected to the hts after the system was drained of pcb oils in and that,upon cleaning the hts room floor and the discovery of cracks in the sump area,the company discovered pcb contaminated soil underneath the floor.
by order of november,an administrative law judge alj granted the agency motions to amend the complaint and for partial accelerated decision on liability.the alj denied the company motion for accelerated decision,and the company request for oral argument,inasmuch as the company had not set forth a basis for the request other than its generalized assertion that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law in this matter.order on liability at.the alj summarized the stipulated facts and observed that the parties disagreed as to the legal inferences to be drawn therefrom.noting that the company had offered no direct evidence showing when the uncontrolled discharges at issue took place or how these discharges were caused,the alj concluded that the only plausible explanation for the presence of pcbs at regulated levels in after years of lower levels is that there was an uncontrolled discharge in.id.at.because the company failed to dispose of the oil in the prescribed manner,the alj found that there was an ongoing violation of the disposal requirements of a.the alj rejected the company attempt to invoke the historic waste exemption because the berm under the hts was not a disposal site within the meaning of the exemption and the company had failed to carry its burden of showing that the pcb spill occurred prior to february.of the two causation theories suggested to the alj upon review of the evidence,the alj concluded that the company theory,whereby pcbs had leached up from the concrete floor and soil into the oil in the berm,strains the imagination to envision,while the agency theory that increased production had dislodged residual pcbs remaining inside the hts appears far more likely.id.at.the alj accordingly found that there were no genuine issues of material fact,and,upon rejecting the company statute of limitations and due process arguments,concluded that the agency was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on liability.
during the penalty phase of the proceedings in april,the company attempted to introduce new,exculpatory evidence that would show that the excessive pcbs in resulted from contamination of the samples by pcbs that had collected in the concrete and soil beneath the berm.the company proffered,consistent with the alj ruling that the new evidence would be considered only with regard to the penalty,expert evidence relevant to the duration of the violation.the proffered evidence was twofold that,contrary to the agency theory that oil continued to drip and come into contact with oil in the berm,which under the provision results in a violation,the state sampling method in december entrained into the sample concrete,resulting from the previous use of pcbs at the facility and their release into the berm and that,to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty,potterton opined that the company change in its method of collection of oil,from one type of pump to a more efficient vacuum system,which was a more aggressive collection procedure,directly resulted in pcb levels over ppm by entraining concrete particles and dust and introducing oils from cracks in the immediate surface of the slightly porous,concrete.the alj imposed a penalty of.
the environmental appeals board board,upon de novo review,affirmed the order on liability and the penalty.the board rejected the company contention that the board should consider all the evidence in the administrative record including its new evidence explaining the source of the pcb concentrations in excess of ppm,ruling that its review of an accelerated decision will generally be limited to the evidence and arguments in the administrative record at the time the accelerated decision was made.the board also rejected the company contention that the alj had erred in refusing to consider relative to liability the new evidence proffered at the penalty hearing,ruling that the law of the case doctrine permitted the alj to reject the company new exculpatory evidence once liability had been determined.the board further ruled that the company had failed to meet its burden of production and persuasion to show as an affirmative defense that the historic waste exemption applied.based on the evidence that pcb contamination had been found in the waste oil in previous years and that production had increased significantly in,and in view of the company failure to carry its burden of showing that the pcbs were released prior to february,the board concluded that the alj had reasonably inferred that the excessive pcbs came from oil weeping from the hts rather than pcbs leaching up from the concrete and soil beneath the floor.finally,the board declined to apply the regulations effective august,because the complaint had been filed and liability determined before the new regulations became effective.the board did not rule on the alj alternative holding that the company was not entitled to the historic waste exemption because the berm was not a proper disposal site.
on appeal,the company contends that the alj erred in granting the agency motion for accelerated decision on liability by making,with no supporting evidence,a technical inference that pcbs must have spilled in,and then blocking all contrary evidence that the company sought to put in the record.the company maintains that the alj reliance on the agency inference was not only contrary to the nature of accelerated decisions,which the agency acknowledges are like summary judgment,but also contrary to the agency own regulatory scheme,which presumed that oil would flush completely from the company heat transfer system within three months of the introduction of oils.the company also contends that the agency could not shift its burden of proof as to its prima facie case,as was done in standard scrap,nor penalize the company for historic pcb contamination in the face of undisputed evidence that its source was pcb oil.the company further maintains that the agency clarification of its regulations on the historic waste exemption applies ab initio,citing supreme court and agency precedent.finally,the company contends that the agency impermissibly blocked subsequent key evidence,and that it was a violation of the company due process right to fair notice to penalize the company for an historic spill.
the toxic substances control act act,provides for regulation of the use and disposal of toxic substances prior to their manufacture,processing,distribution,and use in order to protect human health and the environment.section goes so far as to bar,with only limited exceptions,the manufacture of a new chemical substance or new use prior to notice to the administrator who,upon finding that there is a reasonable basis to conclude such action presents or may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment,may prohibit or place restrictions on its manufacture,processing,or distribution.the act gives special attention,however,to pcbs in view of the seriousness of their threat to human health and the environment.see envtl.def.fund,epa.section sets forth a detailed scheme to dispose of and phase out pcbs,and directs the administrator to promulgate rules within six months after january,the act effective date,prescribing methods of disposal and marking of pcbs.e.as relevant here,identifies prohibited acts,including failing to comply with the administrator rules and orders.id.the act authorizes the assessment of civil penalties not to exceed for each violation as well as criminal prosecution for knowing or willful violations,and requires prior written notice of a proposed civil penalty for violation of a prohibited act and a hearing in accordance with of the administrative procedure act.
in,the agency promulgated the first of two sets of regulations to carry out e.see envtl.def.fund,at.the first regulations,the disposal regulations,covered pure pcb compounds as well as materials contaminated with at least ppm of pcbs.id.explaining that it chose this regulatory cutoff in order to regulate disposal of most pcbs as soon as possible,preamble to final disposal regulations,fed.reg,the agency warned that it was considering a new cutoff possibly in the range of ppm or below for the proposed ban regulations.id.in june,the agency proposed regulations with a ppm cutoff,see fed.reg,and this cutoff remained in the final rule.see polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs manufacturing,processing,distribution in commerce,and use prohibitions,fed.reg.
as amended,the regulations in effect in also contained a ppm cutoff,and defined disposal to mean intentionally or accidentally to discard,throw away,or otherwise complete or terminate the useful life of pcbs.subpart d set forth the disposal requirements,defining s pills and other uncontrolled discharges of pcbs at concentrations of ppm or greater to constitute the disposal of pcbs.id.d.a prefatory note to subpart d stated that pcb items that have been placed in a disposal site are considered to be in service for purposes of subpart d,and that subpart d does not require removal of pcbs and pcb items from service and disposal earlier than would normally be the case.id.pt,subpart d prefatory note.subpart g,regulating spill cleanup,requires the cleanup of pcbs within hours of notice or awareness of a spill.id.c.
the board interpreted the prefatory note in subpart d of the disposal regulations in standard scrap.lexis,wl.the case involved a civil enforcement proceeding under a of the act charging violations of and.id.at.the board stated that f rom the unexplained presence of pcbs in the soil,it can be inferred that one or more uncontrolled discharges of pcbs took place.id.at.under d of the regulations,the board ruled,such a discharge amounts to an improper disposal.id.standard scrap argued that the pcbs at issue fell within the historic waste exemption provided in the prefatory note to subpart id.at.the board disagreed.the board stated that the historic waste exemption is available only as an affirmative defense,and that the respondent bears the initial burden of production and the ultimate burden of persuasion on the applicability of the exemption.see id.at.because standard scrap had failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the pcbs in the soil samples were placed in a disposal site prior to february,the board ruled that it could not avail itself of the exemption.id.at.in the alternative,the board held that a disposal site is s
