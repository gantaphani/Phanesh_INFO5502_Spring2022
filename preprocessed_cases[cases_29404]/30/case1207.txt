defendant southwest marine,appeals from the district court judgment for plaintiffs natural resources defense council nrdc,san diego baykeeper,and kenneth moser,in their citizen enforcement action under a of the clean water act cwa,a.in response to defendant challenge,we hold plaintiffs have standing to bring this action,plaintiffs notice letter was adequate,defendant violations were ongoing,the district court injunctive measures were not an abuse of discretion,and the district court civil penalty was not an abuse of discretion.accordingly,we affirm.
facts and procedural background 
defendant operates a large shipyard on san diego bay.its principal business is repairing and maintaining marine vessels.among other things,defendant shipyard removes old paint from ships and then repaints them.defendant commonly removes old paint by blasting the ships hulls with abrasive grit,composed primarily of particles of copper,that is conveyed on streams of compressed air.defendant uses about million pounds of copper grit per year for blasting old paint from ships and generates about pounds of paint waste per year.
defendant repaints ships with antifouling paints,which are paints that are formulated to prevent the growth of aquatic organisms,such as barnacles and algae,on the bottoms of ships.those paints contain compounds that are toxic to aquatic life.
defendant shipyard contains five piers,at which ships are moored while they are being repaired,and two floating drydocks,on which ships rest,out of the water,to allow repair,blasting,and repainting of parts that are normally underwater.when plaintiffs filed their complaint,defendant also was operating a marine railway,which is a device that is used to pull ships onto the shore for repair.
shipyards like defendant generate large amounts of wastes and pollutants,including paint chips and abrasive grit.those wastes and pollutants are discharged into adjacent waters other water runoff,tidal action,leaks,spills,and overspray.a report by the california regional water quality control board showed elevated concentrations of copper,tributyltin,and of which are present in the materials used and the wastes generated at defendant the sediments adjacent to the shipyard.the report concluded that defendant appeared to have discharged copper,tributyltin,and zinc into san diego bay,that defendant management practices appeared to be inadequate to prevent such discharges,and that the discharges might have negative effects on the water quality of the bay and on its suitability for human use.
defendant had applied for and received a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit from the california regional water quality control board in.in,defendant had obtained coverage under the state water resources control board general industrial permit for storm water discharges.that permit supplemented defendant npdes permit the storm water permit applied to discharges of pollutants through storm water,and the npdes permit applied to other discharges.
both permits required defendant to develop and implement plans to limit its discharges of pollutants into the bay.rather than relying on specific numerical effluent limitations,the permits required defendant to create and follow best management practices bmps defendant adopted a written bmp plan on january.
the storm water permit also required defendant to develop and implement a storm water pollution prevention plan swppp and a storm water pollution monitoring plan swpmp.the permit specified that the swppp was required to include,among other things 
a description of sources that might add significant quantities of pollutants to storm water discharges 
a detailed site map 
a description of materials that had been treated,stored,spilled,disposed of,or leaked into storm water discharges since november 
a description of the management practices that defendant employed to minimize contact between storm water and pollutants from vehicles,equipment,and materials 
a description of existing structural and measures to reduce pollutants in storm water discharges 
a description of methods of storage and disposal of significant materials 
a description of outdoor storage,manufacturing,and processing activities 
a list of pollutants likely to be present in significant quantities in storm water discharges and an estimate of the annual amounts of those pollutants in storm water discharge 
a record of significant leaks or spills of toxic or hazardous pollutants to storm water 
a summary of existing data describing pollutants in storm water discharge 
a description of defendant storm water management controls,including good housekeeping procedures,preventive maintenance,and measures to control and treat polluted storm water and 
a list of the specific individuals responsible for developing and implementing the swppp.
defendant submitted its swppp in december.the swppp required defendant,among other things,to perform daily inspections to ensure that its shipyard was complying with the requirements of its bmp plan,and to maintain records of those inspections.
on april,plaintiffs sent defendant a notice letter,as required by b a,advising defendant that it was violating the cwa and that plaintiffs intended to sue under the cwa citizen enforcement provisions.a copy of the notice letter and its attachments appears as an appendix at the end of this opinion.
as discussed below,a party who wishes to sue under the cwa citizen enforcement provisions may not commence an action until at least days after giving notice of intent to sue.on august,more than days after sending their notice letter,plaintiffs filed this action.four days earlier,on august,defendant had submitted a revised swppp and swpmp.those revised plans addressed,and attempted to correct,many of the shortcomings described in plaintiffs notice letter.
in september,defendant moved to dismiss this action,arguing that plaintiffs notice letter did not comply with the cwa requirements and,in particular,that the letter was not specific enough to inform defendant of what standards it allegedly had violated.the district court denied defendant motion in a published opinion.natural res.def.council,southwest marine.
defendant then moved for summary judgment,arguing that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiffs allegations of ongoing violations were neither made in good faith nor based on reasonable investigation that,even if the district court had subject matter jurisdiction,summary judgment was appropriate because plaintiffs could not prove ongoing violations at trial and that plaintiffs claims were moot.
after continuing the motion to allow more time for discovery,the district court denied summary judgment in an unpublished order.in denying defendant motion,the court concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiffs had alleged continuing violations in good faith that there were disputed issues of material fact as to whether defendant a had developed an adequate swppp and monitoring plan,as required by its storm water permit,and b had adequately implemented or was adequately implementing such plans and that plaintiffs action was not moot.
while district court proceedings were pending,defendant permits were revised twice.first,defendant storm water permit was superseded by a new storm water permit,which took effect may.second,both the storm water permit and defendant npdes permit were superseded by a new npdes permit.that permit was issued on october,but was stayed on march,by the superior court of the county of san diego.the superior court lifted that stay later in,and the revised permit became effective at that time 
defendant also revised a number of its practices related to storm water while this matter was before the district court.among other things,defendant revised its bmp plan,as required by its most recent npdes permit installed a storm water diversion system covering most but not all of its facility hired a new environmental compliance manager installed a roof to prevent storm water from reaching hazardous materials and removed polluted sediments from the area of its marine railways.
this action was tried to the court between november and december.both sides presented evidence and expert testimony about conditions at defendant facility,and the district court made three visits to the facility.
on march,the district court found in plaintiffs favor in an unpublished order.after reaffirming its earlier rulings that plaintiffs had standing and that the notice letter was adequate,the court concluded that defendant swppp and monitoring plan,as revised in august,were adequate but that defendant had failed to implement those plans adequately,thereby violating its permit and the cwa.the court imposed injunctive relief and a civil penalty of.
the district court then asked plaintiffs to prepare proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.plaintiffs submitted proposed findings on may,and defendants filed objections thereto.the district court held hearings on july and august,to consider defendant objections.defendant argued,among other things,that the district court proposed injunction was too broad and too costly.to address those arguments,the district court asked the parties to submit additional evidence concerning the proposed injunction.
on september,the district court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law.the court found that plaintiffs had presented convincing evidence that defendant had not made the required inspections that it claimed to have made that,even accepting defendant statement that it had made the required inspections,defendant had not maintained adequate records of those inspections,with the result that a large number of inspection reports were missing that the reports that defendant had provided demonstrated a pattern of poor housekeeping at defendant facility and showed that violations,when reported,were not always remedied in a timely manner that defendant inadequate implementation of its plans had led to significant contributions of pollutants to defendant leasehold that defendant leasehold within the bay was devoid of life that the evidence conclusively demonstrated that substantial quantities of pollutants from defendant operations had entered san diego bay in defendant storm water discharges that defendant failure to implement its storm water plans adequately was contributing to and perpetuating the contamination of its marine leasehold and that the harm to defendant leasehold could be remedied by defendant with improved practices.based on those findings,the court concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the action that plaintiffs had standing that defendant had violated,and was continuing to violate,the relevant permits and plans and that defendant failure to implement its plans adequately was the result of systemic problems and overall inadequacies in implementation,rather than mere snapshots of isolated violations.
the district court findings of fact and conclusions of law also reiterated the injunctive relief and civil penalties that the court had imposed in its earlier order.in response to defendant objections,the court entered a limited stay governing several provisions of the injunction,to allow the parties to submit further studies and evidence.on march,the district court held its final hearing regarding the limited stay.after making minor changes to the injunction,the court lifted the stay in an unpublished order dated march.
in its injunction,the court ordered defendant to test its storm water discharges for significant pollutants before releasing them into the bay to sweep,after every shift,uncontained areas in which operations may have caused deposits of debris and to provide mats and air hoses so that workers could clean their shoes after leaving such areas to make daily inspections of its facilities except when the shipyard is not operating and keep records of those inspections to test the water column around each vessel that is being blasted or painted to determine if those operations are contributing to pollution in the bay to correct conditions that might allow pollutants to enter the bay,within four hours if feasible to repair or replace shrouds that are in poor repair to capture all storm water coming off its piers the district court allowed defendant months to comply with this condition and to erect and maintain concrete berms in areas of the facility from which runoff might enter the bay.the court rejected plaintiffs argument that defendant should be required to remediate the contamination of the sediments in its marine leasehold.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
defendant challenges the district court rulings on standing,the adequacy of plaintiffs notice letter,ongoing violations,the terms of the injunction,and the civil penalty.we will address each of those issues in turn.
first,defendant argues that the district court erred in holding that plaintiffs had standing to bring this action.we review de novo the question whether a party has standing to bring an action.lso,stroh,cir.
in order to satisfy article iii standing requirements in a cwa citizen enforcement action,a plaintiff must show it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d.an association like nrdc has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right,the interests at stake are germane to the organization purpose,and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.id.
defendant argues that plaintiffs can not satisfy any of the three requirements for article iii standing.we disagree.
first,plaintiffs showed injury in fact.the supreme court has held that environmental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened by the challenged activity.id.at quoting sierra club morton,d.here,members of the plaintiff organizations,and individual plaintiff kenneth moser,testified that they have derived recreational and aesthetic benefit from their use of the bay including areas of the bay next to defendant shipyard,but that their use has been curtailed because of their concerns about pollution,contaminated fish,and the like.those averments are sufficient to satisfy the injury in fact component of article iii standing.
second,the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged activity.this requirement,more precisely,is that there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not th e result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.lujan defenders of wildlife,d quoting simon eastern.welfare rights,d.plaintiffs presented evidence that the sediments in defendant marine leasehold contained elevated concentrations of pollutants,that defendant had discharged the same pollutants,and that defendant marine leasehold was devoid of life.that evidence was sufficient to demonstrate that plaintiffs injury was fairly traceable to defendant conduct.as the fourth circuit has noted,the threshold requirement of traceability does not mean that plaintiffs must show to a scientific certainty that defendant effluent caused the precise harm suffered by the plaintiffs in order to establish standing.friends of the earth,gaston copper recycling,cir en banc citations and internal quotation marks omitted.to satisfy this requirement,r ather than pinpointing the origins of particular molecules,a plaintiff must merely show that a defendant discharges a pollutant that causes or contributes to the kinds of injuries alleged in the specific geographic area of concern.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also sierra club cedar point oil,cir to the same effect public interest research group of new jersey,powell duffryn terminals,cir same.plaintiffs made that showing in this case.
third,plaintiffs demonstrated that a favorable decision would redress their injuries.a plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief satisfies the requirement of redressability by alleging a continuing violation or the imminence of a future violation of an applicable statute or standard.see steel citizens for a better env t,d.plaintiffs alleged that defendant was continuing to violate its permits what is more,as discussed below,they proved continuing violations at trial.because they sought an injunction to halt those continuing violations,plaintiffs satisfied the requirement of redressability.
in sum,the district court did not err in holding that plaintiffs had standing to bring this action.
ii.matter jurisdiction 
next,defendant argues that plaintiffs notice letter was insufficient.under the cwa,
no action may be commenced 
under subsection a of this section 
a prior to sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice of the alleged violation i to the administrator,ii to the state in which the alleged violation occurs,and iii to any alleged violator of the standard,limitation,or order 
b.the applicable regulation provides that the notice 
shall include sufficient information to permit the recipient to identify the specific standard,limitation,or order alleged to have been violated,the activity alleged to constitute a violation,the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation,the location of the alleged violation,the date or dates of such violation,and the full name,address,and telephone number of the person giving notice.
if a party seeking to bring a citizen enforcement action has not complied with the cwa notice requirement,then the district court in which that action is brought lacks subject matter jurisdiction and must dismiss the action.washington trout mccain foods,cir see also hallstrom tillamook county,d requiring strict compliance with notice requirement for citizen enforcement action under the resource conservation and recovery act.in practical terms,the notice must be sufficiently specific to inform the alleged violator about what it is doing wrong,so that it will know what corrective actions will avert a lawsuit.atlantic states legal,stroh die casting,cir.we review de novo the district court conclusion that plaintiffs notice was adequate.see washington trout,at.
the district court treated plaintiffs notice letter as alleging two separate,but related,violations concerning the pollution prevention plans required by its permits and the cwa.the first was defendant failure to prepare adequate plans the second was defendant failure to implement adequate plans.
with regard to those issues,plaintiffs notice letter clearly satisfies some of the requirements of notice.the letter was mailed to the appropriate entities.see a.it identified the persons giving notice and the persons responsible for the alleged violation.although the letter did not identify a specific date,or a specific location within southwest marine facility,it nevertheless satisfied those requirements as well.see id.plaintiffs were not alleging that a particular discharge from a particular pipe on a particular day had violated the cwa.rather,they were alleging that defendant had failed to prepare and implement plans that were required by its permit.as the district court correctly noted,the failure to develop and implement pollution prevention plans are violations occurring at the facility in general.southwest marine.at.moreover,the deficiencies in these plans are ongoing,so there is no specific date that can be alleged as the date of the violation.id.
the parties dispute before us centers on the specificity of the notice letter.see a requiring that a notice letter include sufficient information to permit the recipient to identify the specific standard,limitation,or order alleged to have been violated,and the activity alleged to constitute a violation.the notice letter generally raises the issues of the preparation and implementation of an adequate swppp.our first question is whether the notice letter raised those issues adequately to satisfy the requirements of the cwa.
as to the alleged failure to prepare an adequate plan,the notice letter was clearly adequate,and we do not understand defendant to argue otherwise.the letter charged,among other things,that defendant had failed to prepare an swppp that complied with the specific requirements of defendant storm water permit identified the source of the requirement that defendant prepare an adequate swppp and explained the ways in which defendant swppp did not comply with the storm water permit.
defendant argues,however,that the notice letter was not sufficient with regard to plaintiffs allegation that it failed to implement an adequate plan.specifically,defendant asserts that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs allegations of poor housekeeping.the notice letter alleges that defendant failed to implement an adequate swppp,including a good housekeeping provision.good housekeeping was required under defendant storm water permits.defendant acknowledges that the court reference to poor housekeeping does arguably correspond to plaintiffs reference to storm water controls and good housekeeping in attachment of the notice letter.see appendix a at attachment,page.
nevertheless,defendant argues that plaintiffs failed to refer to,or identify,the good housekeeping provision of its revised swppp and,thus,failed to provide any information about how defendant had violated that specific plan provision.the difficulty with that argument is that the notice letter predates the plan provisions to which defendant refers.plaintiffs mailed their notice letter in april.the good housekeeping provision to which defendant refers,and which defendant cites in its brief,is contained in defendant revised swppp,which was filed in august.although we require strict compliance with the cwa notice requirement,we do not require to refer to provisions of plans that do not exist.
we hold that the notice letter was sufficient,on the date it was mailed,to allow the district court to exercise jurisdiction over plaintiffs good housekeeping claims.defendant was operating under a storm water permit that was designed to prevent discharges of toxic pollutants through storm water.that permit required defendant to prepare and implement an swppp that included a good housekeeping provision.the permit explained that g ood housekeeping requires the maintenance of clean,orderly facility areas that discharge storm water.material handling areas shall be inspected and cleaned to reduce the potential for pollutants to enter the storm water conveyance system.plaintiffs notice letter sufficiently alleged that defendant had failed to prepare and implement such a plan.
and defendant obviously understood at least some of the alleged violations.in response to plaintiffs letter,defendant completely revised its swppp and swpmp within four months,adding sections that specifically made reference to the requirements that plaintiffs had identified.see atlantic states,at concluding that notice was sufficiently specific where the defendant,after receiving notice,took immediate steps to cure the problems identified in the notice letter.and,as noted,defendant made substantial changes to its facility and operations during the pendency of this litigation,concededly in an attempt to remedy some of the inadequacies of which plaintiffs had complained.
the second and more theoretical question that defendant argument raises is what,if any,effect defendant alterations of its plans and facilities had on the adequacy of the notice letter.if a defendant receives a proper notice letter alleging that it has failed to prepare and implement an adequate plan and,in response,prepares a new plan and begins to implement it before the complaint is filed,is the otherwise proper notice letter defective for failing to identify and discuss the new plan and its implementation in those circumstances,must a send a new notice letter we think not.subject matter jurisdiction is established by providing a notice that is adequate on the date it is given to the defendant.the defendant later changes to its operations and plans may affect standing,see steel,at.the question of ongoing violations or remedies,see gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay,d or mootness,see laidlaw.at but such changes do not retroactively divest a district court of jurisdiction under b.
defendant also cites washington trout and hallstrom in support of its argument that notice was inadequate.those cases are distinguishable from this one.in washington trout and hallstrom,the plaintiffs had failed to comply with the facial requirements for notice set out in the applicable statutes and regulations.
in washington trout,the plaintiffs mailed the defendant a letter alleging improper discharges of pollutants however,the letter did not provide the address and phone number of the named plaintiff,nor did it furnish the identity,address,and phone number of the other plaintiffs.at.further,the notice failed to specifically identify the dates of the allegedly unlawful discharges.id.this court held that those failures to comply with a precluded the district court from assuming jurisdiction over any part of the plaintiffs action.id.at.
in hallstrom,the plaintiffs filed a citizen enforcement action under the resource conservation and recovery act,which contains a notice provision that is substantively identical to the cwa notice provision.see b.the supreme court held that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs action because the plaintiffs had failed to give any notice to the epa or to the appropriate state agency as b requires.see hallstrom,at.
those cases establish that the cwa notice requirement is strictly construed and that compliance with the notice requirement is a prerequisite to a citizen enforcement action.but this case presents a different problem.unlike in washington trout and hallstrom,the question in this case is not whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over any part of plaintiffs action defendant does not contest that the notice was adequate as to the allegation that it had failed to prepare an adequate swppp.rather,the question is whether the district court exercised jurisdiction over particular issues that were not raised in the notice letter and,thus,were beyond the scope of the court jurisdiction.
we have resolved that question in plaintiffs favor.as discussed above,we hold that plaintiffs letter gave defendant adequate notice of all the claims over which the district court exercised jurisdiction.accordingly,the district court did not err in concluding that plaintiffs notice letter satisfied the requirements of b.
iii.evidence of ongoing violations 
next,defendant argues that the district court erred in concluding that it had committed ongoing violations of requirements in its storm water permit.we review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.russian river watershed prot.comm.city of santa rosa,cir.we review de novo a district court interpretation of an npdes permit when its terms are unambiguous.id.at.
the cwa does not permit citizen suits for wholly past violations rather,the statute confers jurisdiction over citizen suits when the make a allegation of continuous or intermittent violation.gwaltney,at.here,the district court properly concluded that plaintiffs had made such allegations and thereby had satisfied gwaltney threshold requirement for jurisdiction.
to prevail at trial,a must prove that ongoing violations actually have occurred.a citizen plaintiff may prove ongoing violations either by proving violations that continue on or after the date the complaint is filed,or by adducing evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find a continuing likelihood of a recurrence in intermittent or sporadic violations.sierra club union oil,cir quoting chesapeake bay,gwaltney of smithfield,cir.this court also has adopted the fourth circuit conclusion that i ntermittent or sporadic violations do not cease to be ongoing until the date when there is no real likelihood of repetition.chesapeake bay,at emphasis added.id.
defendant groups three arguments under this heading.first,defendant argues that the district court erred in holding that it had violated any condition of its storm water permit.we disagree.as noted,the district court found that defendant had failed to had failed to keep records daily inspections of its facility.those daily records of the required by defendant and swppps.the swppps,in turn,were required by defendant storm water permit,which contemplated that defendant would inspect its facility and keep records of its inspections.the district court also found that the inspection reports that defendant did produce revealed a pattern of poor housekeeping.defendant own inspection reports showed that the good housekeeping standard was not met uniformly and that violations were not always remedied quickly.
moreover,the district court found that defendant failure adequately to implement its swppp led to significant contributions of pollutants to the bay from defendant discharges.the court further found that those discharges contributed to the contamination of defendant marine leasehold and that the leasehold is devoid of life.those findings are supported by evidence and,accordingly,are not clearly erroneous.each of defendant successive storm water permits has specifically prohibited discharges that cause adverse effects on the environment.for example,defendant current storm water permit prohibits discharges that degrade marine communities,cause adverse effects on the environment,or result in harmful concentrations of pollutants in marine sediments.because the district court found that defendant failure to implement its storm water plans led to discharges that violated those standards,the court conclusion that defendant violated its storm water permit was not error.
second,defendant argues,e ven assuming arguendo that southwest marine did not,at some point in time,implement its stormwater plans adequately,it was legal error for the district court to find an ongoing violation of that permit requirement.emphasis in original.as a threshold matter,we reject defendant argument that we review this question for legal error.the district court conclusion that defendant violations were ongoing was a finding of fact,which we must affirm unless clearly erroneous.see union oil,at stating that a plaintiff could prove a continuing violation by adducing evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find a continuing likelihood of a recurrence in intermittent or sporadic violations.
here,the district court found that defendant had failed to implement its plans adequately even after plaintiffs filed their complaint.as the district court noted,there is evidence of incidents of poor housekeeping during the pendency of this action.defendant argues that the district court finding of an ongoing violation improperly combines several discrete and unrelated workplace incidents.but the district court found that the ongoing violations present ed a picture of overall inadequacies,not mere snapshots.notwithstanding defendant argument,we may not disturb that finding if it is supported by evidence.and it is the evidence on which the district court relied was sufficient to permit a reasonable trier of fact to find a continuing likelihood of a recurrence in intermittent or sporadic violations.union oil,at.accordingly,the district court finding of a continuing violation was not clearly erroneous.
third,defendant argues that,even if there is sufficient evidence in the record to establish an ongoing violation of the permit,we should nevertheless remand for the district court to explain further the factual and legal basis for its decision.because we conclude that the district court has provided sufficient factual and legal support for its decision,we do not agree that remand is necessary or appropriate.
iv.the injunction 
next,defendant argues that the injunction was improper.district courts have broad latitude in fashioning equitable relief when necessary to remedy an established wrong.alaska ctr.for the env t browner,cir.we review a district court decision to issue an injunction und
