cavel international,the plaintiff in this case,owns and operates the only facility in the united states for slaughtering horses.until recently it was one of three such facilities,but the other two,both in texas,stopped slaughtering horses after the fifth circuit upheld a texas law similar to the illinois law challenged in this case.empacadora de carnes de fresnillo,de curry,cir.
cavel slaughterhouse,located in dekalb,illinois,near chicago,has some sixty employees and slaughters some to horses a year,out of a total of about horses that either are killed or die of natural causes in the united states annually.cavel buys its horses for about apiece from brokers who obtain them at auctions.the company has been in operation for years and has some million in annual revenues.
horses are the only animals that cavel slaughters,and it represented to us without contradiction that if it loses this case it will have to shut down.the texas slaughterhouses were more slaughtered,besides horses,such sources of atypical meat products as bison and ostrich.but they too represented to the courts that if forbidden to slaughter horses they would have to shut down,though it appears that after a brief shutdown they reopened,adding cattle to their menu,as it were.illinois house bill,bill for an act concerning horses,general assembly april,statement of representative molaro.
in the united states,horses are killed in slaughterhouses only when the horses flesh is destined for eating by human beings or a detail to be considered later zoo animals.the flesh of horses that is intended for pet food is obtained from the corpses hauled to rendering plants for disposal the plants also produce glue and other products from the carcasses.all these businesses are in terminal decline.jeffrey mcmurray,some horses left to starve as market for meat shrivels,chi.tribune.unlike cavel slaughterhouse,a rendering plant methods of producing meat from dead horses do not have to comply with the requirements that the federal meat inspection act,prescribes for the production of meat,expressly including horse meat,j,w,intended for human consumption.the act is fully applicable to cavel,see,even though cavel entire output is exported to such countries as belgium,france,and japan.indeed,cavel is the subsidiary of a belgian company.
on may of this year,the illinois horse meat act,ilcs,was amended to make it unlawful for any person in the state either to slaughter a horse if that person knows or should know that any of the horse meat will be used for human consumption,a,or to import into or export from this state,or to sell,buy,give away,hold,or accept any horse meat if that person knows or should know that the horse meat will be used for human consumption.b.prior to the amendment,the statute merely required a license to slaughter horses and imposed various inspection,labeling,and other regulatory restrictions on licensees.the prohibition has made these provisions academic.cavel claims that the amendment violates both the federal meat inspection act and the commerce provision in article i,section,of the federal constitution that in terms merely empowers congress to regulate interstate and foreign commerce but that has been interpreted to limit the power of states to regulate interstate and foreign commerce even in the absence of federal legislation inconsistent with the state regulation.willson creek marsh,pet.marshall,united haulers ass n,solid waste management authority,d.
cavel moved for a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the amendment.the district court declined to issue it,on the ground that cavel had failed to make a strong showing that it was likely to prevail on the merits.cavel appealed,and we enjoined the application of the amendment to cavel pending our decision of its appeal,cir,chief judge easterbook dissenting.
the challenge based on the meat inspection act need detain us only briefly.cavel points to the act preemption clause requirements within the scope of this act with respect to premises,facilities and operations of any establishment at which inspection is provided under title i of this act including facilities at which horses are slaughtered,d,j which are in addition to,or different than those made under this act may not be imposed by any state or territory or the district of columbia,argues that it signifies congress decision to sweep aside any state law that would render the federal requirements inapplicable to cavel slaughterhouse by forbidding horses to be slaughtered.the argument confuses a premise with a conclusion.when the meat inspection act was passed and indeed to this day,it was lawful in some states to produce horse meat for human consumption,and since the federal government has a legitimate interest in regulating the production of human food whether intended for domestic consumption or for meat unfit for human consumption would be highly damaging to the nation foreign was natural to make the act applicable to horse meat.that was not a decision that states must allow horses to be slaughtered for human consumption.the government taxes income from gambling that violates state law that does mean the state must permit the gambling to continue.given that horse meat is produced for human consumption,its production must comply with the meat inspection act.but if it is not produced,there is nothing,so far as horse meat is concerned,for the act to work upon.
of course in a literal sense a state law that shuts down any premises,facilities and operations of any establishment at which inspection is provided is different from the federal requirements for such premises,but so literal a reading is untenable.if despite its title the meat inspection act were intended to forbid states to shut down slaughterhouses,it would have to set forth standards and procedures for determining whether a particular slaughterhouse or class of slaughterhouses should be shut down and it does not.the act is concerned with inspecting premises at which meat is produced for human consumption,see,rather than with preserving the production of particular types of meat for people to eat.empacadora de carnes de fresnillo,de curry,supra,at.
the more difficult question is whether the amendment violates the commerce clause as interpreted to prohibit state regulations that unduly interfere with the foreign commerce of the united states.cavel fastens on subsection b of the illinois amendment,which forbids the importing and exporting of horse meat for human consumption.but that provision is not addressed to cavel it is addressed to a middleman who having procured horse meat from cavel tries to export it,or that imports horse meat to illinois hoping to induce americans to eat it.we assume that the terms import and export refer to bringing horse meat into illinois from another state,or shipping it to another state,as well as to importing horse meat from and exporting it to a foreign country.the provision directed at cavel is subsection a,which forbids the slaughtering of horses for human consumption.if that subsection is valid,cavel loses its case.
the clearest case of a state law that violates the commerce clause is a law that discriminates in favor of local firms,chemical waste management,hunt,d bendix autolite midwesco enterprises,d american trucking ass ns scheiner,d baldwin seelig.cardozo.suppose a state passed a law that forbade the importation of wild baitfish.that would be a discrimination against interstate and foreign commerce.this would not make the law unconstitutional per se,because the state might be able to prove that it needed the law in order t
