in our previous opinion,we held that the district court had jurisdiction to review the claims of the center for biological diversity and central arizona paddlers club together the center under of the administrative procedure act apa,because under the wild and scenic rivers act wsra,d,the united states forest service forest service had a mandatory duty to consider potentially eligible rivers in planning for the use and development of land resources,and the forest service failed to act pursuant to this mandatory duty.ctr.for biological diversity veneman,cir.our conclusion relied on our holding in montana wilderness association,united states forest service,cir,that the forest service duty to maintain potential wilderness study areas in their presently existing wilderness character under the montana wilderness study act was a nondiscretionary,mandatory duty that the service could be compelled to carry out under of the apa.id.at.
after our opinion was filed,the supreme court held in norton southern utah wilderness alliance,d suwa,that a claim under can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take.id.at.the court also vacated montana wilderness,on which we relied extensively in reaching our decision in this case,and remanded that case to this court for further consideration in light of suwa.veneman.wilderness ass n,d.because the court explained in suwa that a failure to consider certain issues while planning for the use and development of land resources is not a failure to take discrete agency action,as required for standing under,we now conclude that the center has not alleged a failure to take a discrete agency action.
we have jurisdiction under,and we hold that the district court did not err in granting the forest service motion to dismiss for lack of standing.we reverse,however,the district court denial of the center motion for leave to amend,and remand with instructions to permit the center to amend its complaint.
background 
the wsra created a national system of rivers to be permanently administered as wild,scenic,or recreational rivers by state agencies.see.a river is eligible for protection under the wsra if it is and possesses at least one of the outstanding remarkable values set forth in the statute,b.the wsra requires the secretaries of agriculture and the interior to conduct specific studies and investigations to discover rivers eligible for inclusion in the national wild and scenic rivers system wsrs.d.rivers are designated for inclusion in the wsrs through an act of congress or an application by a state governor acting pursuant to an act of the state legislature.a.
in,in response to a request by the arizona congressional delegation,the forest service conducted three studies of arizona rivers,identifying those streams and river segments that satisfied the statutory requirements for inclusion in the wsrs.the service published its findings in a report the report,which identified rivers and streams that qualified as potential additions to the wsrs and which provided all of the necessary information to determine which arizona streams or river segments met the wsra criteria for designation.
in,the center commenced this action for the forest service alleged failure to comply with d,which directs the government to take rivers and streams that qualify for inclusion in the wsrs into account while planning for the use and development of federal land.because the wsra does not provide for a private right of action,the center asserted standing under of the apa,which provides relief for agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.see.
the district court concluded that the center failed to meet the requirements of because the center could not show that the forest service unlawfully withheld agency action.it reasoned that the forest service had no statutory duty to perform a systematic d review before the revision of a forest plan.the district court therefore dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.in addition,concluding that the wsra imposes no statutory duty to perform a systematic d review before the revision of a forest plan,the district court denied the center request for leave to amend its complaint,reasoning that any amendment would be futile.it further noted that any particular determinations would be more appropriately brought in a new lawsuit if plaintiffs wish to proceed.the center timely appealed.
standard of review 
we review de novo a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see luong circuit city stores,cir city of san diego whitman,cir.we also review de novo a dismissal without leave to amend.see thinket ink info,sun microsystems,cir.denial of leave to amend is improper unless it is clear that the complaint could not be saved by any amendment.id.
discussion 
the forest service argues that the report is not an study that inventories eligible rivers under the wsra,and the center has no standing under.the center argues that the district court erred in denying its motion for leave to amend its complaint.we address each of these arguments in turn.
i.the report 
the report provides resource information for potential wild,scenic,and recreational rivers on six national forests in arizona.in a similar passage,the report states that its purpose is to provide information on those rivers that the forest service determine s to be potentially eligible for inclusion in the national wild and scenic rivers systems.the report conforms to the dictates of the wsra by expressly identifying the two statutory characteristics of an eligible river first,that it is free flowing,and second,that it possesses at least one outstanding remarkable value.see,b.furthermore,the rivers included in the report have been listed on the nationwide rivers inventory,a register of river segments that potentially qualify as national wild,scenic or recreational river areas maintained by the national park service in partial fulfillment of d.nationwide rivers inventory,available at.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the report constitutes an inventory of arizona rivers potentially eligible for inclusion in the nationwide wsrs.
ii.failure to act under of the apa 
the forest service argues that the consideration of potentially eligible rivers in project plans is neither a discrete agency action,nor an action that the service is legally required to take under the wsra.we limit our consideration to the center discrete agency action claim.
in suwa,the plaintiffs asserted that the bureau of land management blm failed to comply with the federal land policy and management act of flpma,which requires the secretary of the interior to manage designated wilderness study areas in a manner so as not to impair the suitability of such areas for preservation as wilderness.at.at quoting c.because flpma does not provide a private right of action,the plaintiffs sought relief under of the apa.see suwa,at.at.
the court concluded that a claim under can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take.id.at.first,the court explained that the term failure to act,as used in,is a failure to take an agency is,a failure to take one of the agency actions including their equivalents earlier defined in.id.at.the court noted that of the apa defined agency action by listing five categories of decisions made or outcomes implemented by an agency agency rule,order,license,sanction or relief.id.at quoting.
all of those categories involve circumscribed,discrete agency actions,as their definitions make clear an agency statement of future effect designed to implement,interpret,or prescribe law or policy rule a final disposition in a matter other than rule making order a permit or other form of permission license a prohibition or taking of other compulsory or restrictive action sanction or a grant of money,assistance,license,authority,or recognition of a claim,right,immunity,or taking of other action on the application or petition of,and beneficial to,a person relief.
