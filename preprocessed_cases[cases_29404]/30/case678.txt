in this appeal,the klamath siskiyou wildlands center ks wild challenges the district court dismissal of its claim against the forest service for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court concluded that ks wild notice of intent to sue under the endangered species act was deficient.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
background 
under the citizen suit provision of the endangered species act esa,a private citizen may bring suit to remedy a violation of the act,provided that it gives written notice of the alleged violation or violations upon which the suit is based at least sixty days before suit is filed.g a i no action may be commenced prior to sixty days after written notice of the violation has been given to the secretary,and to any alleged violator.the notice requirement is jurisdictional.sw.ctr.for biological diversity bureau of reclamation southwest center,cir.a failure to strictly comply with the notice requirement acts as an absolute bar to bringing suit under the esa.id.
this suit arises in the context of recreational suction dredge mining conducted under the general mining law of and the organic administration act of.under these statutes,if a mining operation might cause significant disturbance of surface resources,the miner must submit to the forest service a notice of intent to operate noi.a emphasis added.after receiving the noi,the forest service has fifteen days to notify the miner if the planned operation will likely cause significant disturbance of surface resources,which would require the miner to submit a more detailed plan of operations.id.emphasis added.a plan of operations must be approved by the forest service before mining may take place.id.a.
in karuk tribe of california forest service,cir en banc,recreational suction dredge miners submitted nois to the forest service for mining in the klamath river.under section of the esa,the forest service is required to engage in consultation with the appropriate wildlife agency either the fish and wildlife service,the national marine fisheries service nmfs,or both in order to insure that any contemplated federal action is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined to be critical.a.we held in karuk tribe that the forest service review of nois under a constituted agency action subject to the consultation requirement of section of esa.at.
on june,following our en banc decision in karuk tribe,ks wild sent the forest service a letter as a notice of intent to sue under the esa.the letter alleged that the forest service had permitted suction dredge mining in the rogue river siskiyou national forest the national forest,which provides designated critical habitat for coho salmon,without consulting with nmfs,in violation of section.see describing critical habitat as all river portions within the salmon historic range that can still be occupied and are not impassable.
the letter alleged generally 
the forest service and its officials have authorized,approved,or otherwise acquiesced to suction dredge placer mining operations in rivers,streams,and other waters on the forest that provide habitat for fish listed under the esa,including coho salmon of the oregon coast evolutionarily significant unit esu and coho salmon of the southern california sonc sic esu.
the letter then described the esa consultation requirement,noted that nmfs has designated critical coho salmon habitat within the national forest,and described the effect of suction dredge mining on coho salmon and their critical habitat.the letter stated 
in,and,the forest service received numerous notices of intent from miners seeking to practice suction dredge placer mining operations in rivers,streams,and other waters on the rogue river siskiyou national forest that provide habitat for coho.on at least may,april,april,april,march,march,march,february,january,january,october,august,august,july,july,june,april,march,march,march,march,march,february,february,january,and january,the forest service notified miners that they would not be required to submit a proposed plan of operations for their proposed suction dredge mining operations in rivers,streams,and other waters on the rogue river siskiyou national forest that provide habitat for coho.these suction dredge placer mining operations commenced and continue,and will continue in the foreseeable future.
emphasis added.the letter alleged that the forest service had failed to consult with nmfs before approving suction dredge mining pursuant to these numerous notices of intent.two days later,on june,ks wild sent another letter,amending the earlier letter to add rogue riverkeeper as a party to the letter.
on august,robert macwhorter,the forest supervisor for the rogue river siskiyou national forest,responded to ks wild notice letter.he noted that ks wild letter did not provide specific information about which mining operations are of concern,such as names of miners or mining claims,locations,or dates of mining operations.however,he stated that he had matched thirty letters from district rangers concerning mining on this forest to the dates in your letter.he stated that only five of those letters responded to nois that were within designated critical habitat,and of those five,one responded to a request to mine using hand tools rather than suction dredging.he then stated 
as you can tell from the above information,each mining operation is a unique matter to be considered in light of karuk tribe.the forest is working on addressing the karuk case by reviewing the facts and legal holding against similar mining activities on the rogue river siskiyou national forest.
i am deeply concerned about this issue and am interested in working with you on suction dredge activity that has a potential effect on listed coho salmon.we are evaluating the identified mining claims and our authorities to proceed with consultation.
on august,after receiving forest supervisor macwhorter letter,members of ks wild and rogue riverkeeper and an attorney employed by the western environmental law center met with macwhorter and forest service staff members to discuss nois for suction dredge mining and the requirements of the esa.on october,ks wild,along with the cascadia wildlands project and rogue riverkeeper,sent the forest service a letter with an updated list of suction dredge placer mining projects that adversely affect listed wild coho or its critical habitat on the rogue river siskiyou national forest,for which the forest service failed to consult with nmfs.as to several of the nois listed in the june notice letter,the october letter asserted that macwhorter was mistaken in his statement about the degree to which suction dredge mining was taking place in esa critical habitat.the october letter included an appendix identifying by date and location the claims on the updated list.the list included mining operations that corresponded with fourteen dates provided in the june notice letter added claims corresponding with seven additional dates that were not provided in the notice letter and omitted eleven of the dates provided in the june notice letter.
ks wild filed a complaint in federal district court on october,more than sixty days after its june letter but less than sixty days after its october letter.ks wild bases its allegation of subject matter jurisdiction solely on the notice provided in the june letter.
the complaint made only a general allegation,echoing the language of the june notice letter,that o n numerous dates in,and,the forest service received notices of intent from miners to conduct suction dredge placer mining in critical habitat for wild sonc sic coho on the rogue river siskiyou national forest.ks wild filed an amended complaint on december.in the amended complaint,ks wild specifically identified a number of nois,not limited to those corresponding to the dates in the june notice letter,that the forest service had allegedly approved without engaging in the consultation required under section of the esa.
the forest service moved to dism
