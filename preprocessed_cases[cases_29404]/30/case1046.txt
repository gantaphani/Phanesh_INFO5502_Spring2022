the placer county air pollution control district the district is charged under state law with the responsibility of enforcing state and national air quality standards within its region.the district is part of the larger state and federal scheme to meet air quality standards under the federal clean air act.
jacob beentjes beentjes was a former employee of the district as an air pollution control specialist.this case arose when the district terminated beentjes after he was diagnosed with a serious pulmonary disease and efforts to accommodate his condition were unsuccessful.beentjes sued the district alleging that the district actions violated title i of the americans with disabilities act.beentjes sought damages and injunctive relief.
the district ultimately moved for summary judgment on the ground that,as an arm of the state,it was entitled to sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment.the district court,employing the test that we adopted in mitchell los angeles community college district,cir,and reaffirmed in belanger madera unified school district,cir,determined that the district was not entitled to sovereign immunity and denied the motion.
in this interlocutory appeal,the district challenges the district court ruling on the ground that the court failed to recognize the district unique status as an enforcement agency under california implementation plan for the federal clean air act.in failing to do so,the district argues that the court misapplied the test.we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal under the collateral order doctrine,see savage glendale union high,cir,and we affirm.we hold that the district is not an arm of the state and therefore is not entitled to sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment.
in,jacob beentjes began working at the placer county air pollution control district as an ex officio employee on loan from placer county.after being diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in,beentjes was terminated from his position as an air pollution control specialist.he sought an accommodation under the americans with disabilities act ada,and was given another position with placer county.he later quit this position.
beentjes subsequently filed suit for damages and injunctive relief against the district in the eastern district of california,alleging that the district discriminated against him on the basis of his disability and that the district failed to reasonably accommodate him,in violation of title i of the ada.as noted above,the district moved for summary judgment on the ground that it was an arm of the state that qualified for eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.the court denied the motion.the district then moved for reconsideration of the court ruling.the court denied the motion for reconsideration,again ruling that the district was not entitled to sovereign immunity.the district filed a timely interlocutory appeal.
we review de novo a district court ruling on a motion for summary judgment.holz nenana city pub.sch,cir.although the district appeals from the denial of its motion for reconsideration,a ruling that we review for an abuse of discretion,the basis for the ruling was the court determination that the district was not entitled to sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment,which is a question of law that we review de novo.see savage,at.

the decision to extend sovereign immunity to a public entity turns on whether the entity is to be treated as an arm of the state partaking of the state eleventh amendment immunity,or is instead to be treated as a municipal corporation or other political subdivision to which the eleventh amendment does not extend.healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.in the ninth circuit,we employ a test to determine whether an entity is an arm of the state 
whether a money judgment would be satisfied out of state funds,whether the entity performs central governmental functions,whether the entity may sue or be sued,whether the entity has the power to take property in its own name or only the name of the state,and the corporate status of the entity.
belanger,at quoting mitchell,at hereinafter mitchell test we must examine these factors in light of the way california law treats the governmental agency.id.at.
state funds 
the first prong of the mitchell a money judgment would be satisfied out of state the predominant factor.id.this factor is given additional weight because the impetus of the eleventh amendment is the prevention of judgments that must be paid out of a state treasury savage,at.here,a review of the applicable state law and the funding scheme for air pollution control districts leads us to conclude that the state is not responsible for paying a money judgment against the district.
first,as a local public entity under california law,the district,and not the state,must pay money judgments against it.california health safety code provides that all claims for money damages against air pollution control districts are governed by parts and of division of the california government code,which pertain to claims and actions against public entities.in turn,the definitional provisions of part of division of the government code define a local public entity to include a district,distinguish a local public entity from the state,and specify that the state is responsible for paying money judgments against the state.cal.gov t code providing that a local public entity includes a county,city,district,public authority,public agency,and any other political subdivision or public corporation in the state,but does not include the state emphasis added id.defining state as the state and any office,officer,department,division,bureau,board,commission or agency of the state claims against which are paid by warrants drawn by the controller emphasis added.taken together,these provisions establish that under california law,local public entities,including air pollution control districts,are responsible for paying their own money judgments.
this conclusion is bolstered by additional provisions of the government code pertaining to the payment of judgments against local public entities.see id.local public entity includes a county,city,district,public authority,public agency,and any other political subdivision or public corporation in the state,but does not include the state or any office,officer,department,division,bureau,board,commission or agency of the state claims against which are paid by warrants drawn by the controller.emphasis added id.providing that a local public entity shall pay any judgment in the manner provided in this article and giving a judgment creditor the right to obtain a writ of mandate to compel a local public entity to pay a judgment against it.
although the district does not dispute that it must pay a judgment obtained against it,the district emphasizes that it has two million dollars in liability insurance coverage that would suffice to satisfy a judgment in this case.however,it is the entity potential legal liability,rather than its ability or inability to require a third party to reimburse it,or to discharge the liability in the first instance,that is relevant.regents of the of,at.
nonetheless,the district claims that a money judgment against it would be paid out of state funds because state revenue constitutes a significant portion of the district annual budget,from which it pays its insurance premiums.this claim is misleading,however,because the bulk of the monies demarcated as state revenue in the district annual budget comes from a vehicle surcharge that does not actually represent state funds.although this surcharge is collected by the state through the department of motor vehicles,see cal.health safety code,it is imposed at the discretion of the district,levied against vehicles registered within the district,and returned to the district to further its goal of reducing air pollution.see id.a.the district court properly determined that the state vehicle surcharge is more appropriately considered a local tax.
further,a former district officer testified that the next largest source of district revenue,the air toxics hot spots information and assessment act,is taken from local industries and therefore is not state funding.taking these undisputed facts into account,between and,local funds accounted for the vast majority of the district annual budget,while funds from the state treasury comprised no more than of its annual budget.
the district,relying on belanger,argues that local funds that are commingled with even a small amount of state funds should no longer be deemed local in nature.see belanger,at holding that a judgment against a school district would be satisfied from state funds.state funds,however,comprised of the school district budget in belanger,id.t he bulk of the school district budget comes directly from the state school fund,whereas here they accounted for only a small percentage of the district budget.
in addition,in belanger we emphasized that the state of california exerts substantial control over the budgets of school districts.for example,the state imposes a revenue limit for each school district,determines the maximum amount of funding each district receives and spends on students,and provides the necessary funds.id.therefore,it was not commingling per se,but rather the unique level of state control over the budgets of school districts that led us to conclude in belanger that local funds were interchangeable with state funds.id.in belanger,it was the fact that the state controlled the budget and would be required to make up any budgetary shortfalls that made the state treasury vulnerable.savage,at.by contrast,the district is required by california law to turn to local cities and counties,and not the state of california,to make up any budgetary shortfalls.cal.health safety code b stating that expenses not met by funding sources shall be provided by an assessment on cities that have a member on the district board and on counties within the district see also id.a explaining that an air pollution control district funds may be appropriated from local counties and deposited in the district treasury.
moreover,the district has the discretion to replenish its budget by leasing,selling,or disposing of any property that it no longer uses and paying any resulting proceeds into the district general fund.id.e.with the authority to raise its own funds,the district bears a closer resemblance to the entities in holz and healthy than the school district in belanger.in holz,the fact that alaska provided a set amount of state funds to local school districts suggested that the school districts could supplement those funds with their own revenues and,therefore,that a money judgment would not necessarily be paid with state funds.at.in healthy,the supreme court held that the local school board was not an arm of the state,despite receiving a significant amount of money from the state of ohio,because it had extensive powers to issue bonds and to levy taxes.at.see also hess port auth,d noting the fact that the port authority generated its own revenues in concluding that it was not an arm of the state vierling celebrity cruises,cir holding that an entity that was financially,generate d its own revenues,and pa id its own debts was not an arm of the state.the authority to raise independent revenue is a relevant consideration because the fact that the state has given the entity the authority to generate revenue provides compelling evidence that the state has created an autonomous entity rather than an alter ego or instrumentality that operates at the state behest and relies exclusively on state appropriations.alex rogers,note,clothing state governmental entities with sovereign immu nity disarray in the eleventh amendment doctrine,colum.
the district finally argues that,even if it has other sources of funding,the state of california is ultimately responsible in the event that a money judgment threatens the district survival.the district relies on two cases in which we held that the first mitchell factor weighed in favor of finding sovereign immunity even though the state was not legally responsible for a money judgment against the entity.see aguon commonwealth ports,cir concluding that the commonwealth ports authority cpa was an arm of the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands even though the commonwealth was not directly liable for a judgment against the cpa alaska cargo,alaska,cir holding that a railroad was an arm of the state despite a state law providing that the railroad,and not the state,was liable for a judgment against it 
in alaska cargo,however,we relied on a state statute that required the railroad to seek funding from the state legislature if a particular service was not.at.furthermore,w e emphasized the unique role of the alaska railroad as the system for thousands of alaskans that made it a central governmental function.holz,at quoting alaska cargo,at.likewise,in aguon,we noted that the commonwealth would be forced to pay an unsatisfied money judgment against the cpa to protect its island economy because the cpa provided essential seaport and airport services.aguon,at.we also noted that the function of the cpa in the commonwealth was equally indispensable to the role of the railroad in alaska.id.at.
unlike in alaska cargo and aguon,here the first mitchell factor weighs against a finding of sovereign immunity because the district is not a single,unique entity upon which a great part of the state depends for its lifeline,and there is no comparable structure of compulsion thrusting the state into the role of real,substantial party in interest.holz,at distinguishing the railroad at issue in alaska cargo from the public school district at issue in holz.we held in holz that in the absence of a showing that money used to pay a judgment will necessarily be replaced with state funds,we adhere to our basic proposition that the fact that the state may ultimately volunteer to pay the judgment is immaterial the question is whether the state treasury is legally obligated to do so.id.quoting durning citibank,cir internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.because here,the applicable state law provides that the state has no legal obligation to pay a money judgment against the district,and because there is no evidence that the state would replace funds used to satisfy a judgment the first mitchell one given most a finding that the district is not an arm of the state.
central governmental function 
in assessing the second mitchell the entity performs a central governmental evaluate whether the district addresses a matter of statewide rather than local or municipal concern,see belanger,at,and the extent to which the state exercises centralized governmental control over the entity.savage,at.the district contends that it performs a central governmental function because it was created by the state of california to enforce statewide and nationwide air pollution standards.
it is true that air pollution control districts are the mechanism through which the state meets and maintains state and federal air quality standards under the federal clean air act and california law.see a a requiring each state to submit a plan specifying how
