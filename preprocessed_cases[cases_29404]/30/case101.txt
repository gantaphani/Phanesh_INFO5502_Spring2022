in this appeal,corporation seeks relief pursuant to.b from a declaratory judgment finding it liable under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,et,for future cleanup costs associated with a release of trichloroethylene at a facility of its subsidiary,stamina mills.united states.i.asserts that the supreme court decision in united states bestfoods,d,renders the prospective application of the declaratory judgment no longer equitable within the meaning of rule b.reviewing the i judgment in light of bestfoods,the district court concluded that the principles of direct and derivative liability under cercla articulated in bestfoods would not have altered that original judgment.united states,d ii.appeals that determination,and we affirm.
factual background 
we draw these background facts from i.during the time relevant to this litigation,stamina mills was a subsidiary of along with another subsidiary and other corporations,stamina mills was also part of crown division,a designation created for internal organization purposes only.
stamina mills ran a textile manufacturing operation in the village of forestdale,in the city of north smithfield,rhode island the forestdale mill building had been located on the north side of the branch river for decades.at one time,the textile production at the forestdale facility used a soap scouring system to remove oil and dirt from fabric.as a result of complaints about discharge and pollution into the branch river,the soap scouring method was replaced with a system using trichloroethylene tce in march.during one delivery of tce before november,an indeterminate amount of tce spilled onto the stamina mills property.in addition to this accidental release,there was evidence that stamina mills would deposit used quantities of tce bottoms in a landfill on its property.one witness at trial testified that he saw a truck back up to the landfill to dump a purplish fluid with oily texture.that witness also testified that the odor of tce emanated from stamina mills building.
in the rhode island department of health determined that residential wells near the stamina mills site in the forestdale community contained elevated levels of tce.in september,the environmental protection agency conducted a hydrogeological study and identified the stamina mills site as the source of the tce.the site was subsequently added to the national priorities list for cleanup funding.the epa costs related to remedial measures at the residential wells and the stamina mills site,as well as enforcement,totaled.the department of justice incurred an additional in enforcement costs.
declaratory judgment 
in,the united states filed an action the action against pursuant to a seeking reimbursement of its response costs and a declaration that would be liable for any additional response costs incurred in the future relating to the stamina mills site it asserted,among its six liability theories,that was liable as an operator and an owner under cercla.judge boyle found liable under both theories.see i.at.
operator liability 
judge boyle interpreted the standard for operator liability of a parent corporation as follows the parent corporation control over the subsidiary management and operations is an essential element of proving operator liability on the parent part.id.at.accordingly,judge boyle focused on whether exercised control over stamina mills management and operations sufficient to find that was a de facto operator.id.
based upon the evidence heard at a bench trial,judge boyle determined that was liable as an operator under cercla.id.he specifically found the following 
exercised pervasive control over stamina mills through,among other things its total monetary control including collections of accounts payable its restrictions on stamina mills financial budget its directive that contact,including environmental matters,be funneled directly through its requirement that stamina mills leasing,buying or selling of real estate first be approved by its policy that approve any capital transfer or expenditure greater than and finally,its placement of personnel in almost all stamina mills director and officer positions,as a means of totally ensuring that corporate policy was exactly implemented and precisely carried out.these are only examples of practical total control over stamina mills operations.
id.as further evidence of control,judge boyle made findings specific to actions with regard to environmental matters affecting stamina mills 
illustrative of control are its actions with regard to environmental matters affecting stamina mills.had the power to control the release or threat of release of tce,had the power to direct the mechanisms causing the release,and had the ultimate ability to prevent and abate damage.knew that stamina mills employed a scouring system that used tce indeed,approved the installation of that system after mandating that a study be made by stamina mills.not only had the capacity to determine the use of tce but also was able to direct stamina mills on how the tce should have been handled.there are other examples of participation in stamina mills environmental.evidence was introduced that issued a directive to its subsidiaries,including stamina mills,requiring that legal department be notified of any governmental agency or court contact regarding environmental matters.furthermore,when stamina mills was sued in by the united states for an illegal waste water discharge into the branch river,the final decision on settlement was made by directors.
id.at footnote omitted.
owner liability 
in addition,judge boyle concluded was liable as an owner under a veil piercing theory,based upon analysis of the factors relevant to piercing stamina mills veil,and mindful of the liberal construction cercla must be afforded so as not to frustrate probable legislative intent.id.at.recognizing the preliminary issue as to whether state or federal common law standards should apply,judge boyle recited the factors required under each regime.see id.at.however,he ultimately left the issue unaddressed,on the basis that the distinction between state law and a federal rule of decision is of little practical difference.id.at.judge boyle then found that many of the factors applicable to the operator liability inquiry were also relevant to owner liability 
has exhibited overwhelming pervasive control over stamina mills.many of the same factors used in holding liable as an operator are relevant.control over environmental matters its policy of approving all capital expenditures of greater than its stranglehold on income and expenses its practice of placing personnel in stamina mills director positions,thereby precluding other stamina mills executives from significant daily and its overwhelming control over stamina mills financial and operational structure add flesh to the skeletal proposition that corporate existence should be disregarded.accordingly,stamina mills veil should be pierced to hold liable,not only because public convenience,fairness,and equity dictate such a result,but also due to the all encompassing control which had over stamina mills as,in fact and deed,an owner.any other result would provide too much solace to deliberate polluters,who would use this device as an escape.
id.at footnote omitted.
as a result of his liability determination,judge boyle entered judgment against in january for nearly million in response costs previously incurred by the epa and interest.in addition,he issued a declaratory judgment declaratory judgment holding liable for all further response costs incurred by the united states related to the stamina mills site.
on appeal,we affirmed judge boyle decision as to operator liability.united states,cir.we specifically held that t o be an operator a t a minimum requires active involvement in the activities of the subsidiary,and that the degree of control described in judge boyle opinion was more than sufficient to impose operator liability on.id.as the operator liability issue was dispositive,we did not address liability as an owner under principles.id.at.
cost recovery action 
in march,the united states filed before judge torres a second cost recovery action the action against,seeking million in additional response costs incurred after the period covered by the judgment and million in interest.in its complaint,the government relied on the declaratory judgment finding liable for future response costs.
shortly after the filing of this second cost recovery action,the supreme court decided united states bestfoods,d discussed infra.consequently,filed a motion under.b for relief from the liability determination in the declaratory judgment as grounds therefor,argued that bestfoods changed the cercla liability standards applied by judge boyle and thus rendered prospective application of his declaratory judgment unjust.
at oral argument before judge torres,explained that the relief sought under rule b would give the opportunity to have its liability determined anew under current law in the action before judge torres.we share that understanding of the effect of rule b relief in this setting.relief,if granted,would not exonerate from liability with any finality,but rather would release from the prior declaratory judgment to the extent that this judgment imposes liability for future response costs.the issue of liability under cercla would be back on the table,giving an opportunity to litigate its liability under current law in the context of the cost recovery action.
in considering request for relief,judge torres found that the declaratory judgment,applied to for future response costs,would have prospective effect and would inflict undue hardship on,two requirements for relief under rule b see ii,d at.however,judge torres denied relief from judgment under rule b because of his conclusion that remained liable as both owner and operator under bestfoods.id.at.addressing operator liability first,judge torres reasoned 
judge boyle expressly found that directed stamina mills activities with respect to environmental matters,in general,and operation of the facility utilizing tce,in particular.judge boyle also found that had directed activities at the site.consequently,bestfoods would not alter judge boyle determination of operator liability as affirmed by the first circuit.
id.at.as to owner liability,judge torres held that bestfoods did not undermine judge boyle analysis and upheld the determination that was liable as an owner.id.at.the denial of the motion for relief under rule b prompted the instant appeal.
b empowers federal courts,in certain instances,to vacate judgments whenever such action is appropriate to accomplish justice.teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen and helpers union,local superline transp,cir quoting klapprott united states.in the application of this rule,we must recognize,inter alia,the importance of finality as applied to court judgments.id.we have identified certain criteria to determine whether relief from judgment is appropriate under rule b timeliness,the existence of exceptional circumstances justifying extraordinary relief,and the absence of unfair prejudice to the opposing party.id.at.in addition,to obtain relief under rule b,a litigant must give the trial court reason to believe that vacating the judgment will not be an empty exercise in any new proceedings.id.although the movant need not show an ironclad claim or defense which will guarantee success at trial,it must at least demonstrate that it possesses a potentially meritorious claim or defense which,if proven,will bring success in its wake.id.at lepkowski united states dep t of treasury.purely conclusory allegations are not sufficient to establish the rule b precondition.teamsters,at.
while the above principles govern rule b relief generally,the precise contours of the applicable standard will depend on the particular subsection involved and the nature of the underlying judgment from which relief is sought here,that subsection is rule b,which provides for relief from judgment in situations where it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.courts have granted rule b relief from a prior judgment on the basis of a significant change in the decisional law upon which that judgment relied.see,agostini felton,d rufo inmates of suffolk county jail,d requiring moving party to show a significant change either in factual conditions or in law.specifically seeks rule b relief from the prospective effects of the declaratory judgment on account of a change in law under bestfoods.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure at ed.relief seems to be possible under rule b from the prospective operation of a declaratory judgment.as we explain herein,the teamsters criteria set forth above provide an analytic framework to this circumstance.
courts invoking the teamsters criteria for rule b motions have typically done so in the context of default judgments,where the merits were arguably never considered.see,teamsters,at grant of unopposed motion for summary judgment de la torre continental ins,cir same key bank of maine tablecloth textile,cir coon grenier,cir motion to remove entry of default compton alton,cir.the declaratory judgment,the product of a bench trial,is far different than a default judgment.nevertheless,the inquiry here on the meritorious defense element of rule b relief is similar in two respects.first,the merits of the declaratory judgment have not yet been considered under bestfoods.second,as with vacating default judgments,the request to vacate the declaratory judgment contemplates a subsequent litigation to determine liability under current law.see supra.hence,we deem it appropriate to employ the teamsters criteria when relief is sought from prospective operation of a declaratory judgment on account of a change in law.
argues that the teamsters criteria cited by judge torres should not apply here because the motion for relief in teamsters was filed under rule b,not rule b.that argument is unpersuasive.we contemplated that the teamsters criteria would be generally applicable to rule b motions,not just those under rule b.teamsters,at noting that relief from judgments under the aegis of rule b generally required that movant demonstrate identified criteria.further,as already noted,see supra,the teamsters criteria are to the motion at issue here,namely,one for relief from the prospective effect of a declaratory judgment on account of a change in law.
also argues that,even if the teamsters criteria are applicable,judge torres improperly displaced the teamsters potentially meritorious claim or defense formulation with a more stringent standard requiring definitive proof of an ironclad defense.id.at.cites as evidence of this burden the following statement in judge torres opinion must establish that it should be relieved from any further liability under current law.ii,d at.we note,however,that judge torres also concluded that bestfoods would not alter judge boyle determination of operator liability as affirmed by the first circuit.id.at.that conclusion is tantamount to a determination by judge torres that can not establish a potentially meritorious defense to cercla liability under current law.the district court formulation of the rule b standard was not a legal error.
we now probe the heart of this appeal.asserts that united states bestfoods,d,altered the law of parent liability under cercla and now potentially may afford with a defense to liability,rendering prospective application of the judgment unjust.to evaluate the merits of this argument,we must first examine the bestfoods decision.
before delving into the supreme court analysis in bestfoods,we must look for context to the lower court opinions in that case.the united states brought suit in federal district court under cercla against numerous entities,including two parent international cpc and costs related to cleanup of industrial waste generated by each parent respective subsidiaries.the district court held that operator liability attaches to a parent corporation 
only when it has exerted power or influence over its subsidiary by actively participating in and exercising control over the subsidiary business during a period of disposal of hazardous waste.a parent actual participation in and control over a subsidiary functions and creates operator liability under cercla a parent mere oversight of a subsidiary business in a manner appropriate and consistent with the investment relationship between a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary does not.
cpc int l.applying these principles to the facts of the case,the district court found cpc and aerojet liable as operators.id.
in a rehearing en banc,the sixth circuit,affirming in part and reversing in part,held that 
where a parent corporation is sought to be held liable as an operator based upon the extent of its control of its subsidiary which owns the facility,the parent will be liable only when the requirements necessary to pierce the corporate veil under state law are met.in other words,under the circumstances of this case,whether the parent will be liable as an operator depends upon whether the degree to which it controls its subsidiary and the extent and manner of its involvement with the facility,amount to the abuse of the corporate form that will warrant piercing the corporate veil and disregarding the separate corporate entities of the parent and subsidiary.
united states,cir.because the record failed to support veil piercing under michigan law,the court of appeals reversed the district court findings of operator liability for cpc and aerojet.id.at.
the supreme court granted certiorari in bestfoods to resolve a conflict among the circuits over the extent to which parent corporations may be held liable under cercla for operating facilities ostensibly under the control of their subsidiaries.at.the court vacated the appellate decision and remanded the case to the district court.id.in doing so,the unanimous court recognized that cercla liability may turn on operation as well as ownership,and nothing in the statute terms bars a parent corporation from direct liability for its own actions in operating a facility owned by its subsidiary.id.at.to clarify the scope of direct operator liability under cercla,the court addressed separately derivative or indirect liability for a parent corporation based on corporate veil piercing and direct liability based on the parent corporation active operation of a facility 
derivative indirect liability 
the court began the analysis by affirming in a cercla context the general rule that a parent corporation is not liable for acts of its subsidiary.see id.at.n othing in cercla purports to reject this bedrock principle,and against this venerable backdrop,the congressional silence is audible.thus,the court rejected the notion that owner liability could attach to a parent corporation simply because its subsidiary owned a polluting facility.see id.at.
however,the court also recognized an equally fundamental principle of corporate law that the corporate veil may be pierced to hold a parent corporation liable for acts of a subsidiary.id.at.finding n othing in cercla that purports to rewrite this rule,the court held that a parent may be charged with derivative cercla liability for its subsidiary acts only when the corporate veil may be pierced id.at.
direct operator liability 
the court then addressed the circumstances under which a parent company would be directly liable for its own actions in operating a facility owned by its subsidiary.rejecting the sixth circuit view,the court held that corporate is not a prerequisite to holding a parent directly liable as an operator 
under the plain language of the statute,any person who operates a polluting facility is directly liable for the costs of cleaning up the pollution.this is so regardless of whether that person is the facility owner,the owner parent corporation or business partner,or even a saboteur who sneaks into the facility at night to discharge its poisons out of malice.if any such act of operating a corporate subsidiary facility is done on behalf of a parent corporation,the existence of the relationship under state corporate law is simply irrelevant to the issue of direct liability.
id.at.citation omitted.
at the outset of the discussion,the court defined operator under cercla as someone who directs the workings of,manages,or conducts the affairs of a facility.id.at.it also,however,set forth a definition more specific to activities at the facility 
to sharpen the definition for purposes of cercla concern with environmental contamination,an operator must manage,direct,or conduct operations specifically related to pollution,that is,operations having to do with the leakage or disposal of hazardous waste,or decisions about compliance with environmental regulations.
id.at.later in the opinion,the court also recited the broader definition of operator,noting that congress use of the word to operate means something more than mere mechanical activation of pumps and valves,and must be read to contemplate operation as including the exercise of direction over the facility activities.id.at.
applying these definitions,the court identified two flaws with the district court treatment of direct operator liability.first,the court rejected the district court erroneous fusion of direct and indirect liability.id.at.rather,to keep direct and derivative liability distinct,the court focused the direct operator liability inquiry not on the parent interaction with the subsidiary,but rather on the parent interaction with the facility the question is not whether the parent operates the subsidiary,but rather whether it operates the facility,and that operation is evidenced by participation in the activities of the facility,not the subsidiary.control of the subsidiary,if extensive enough,gives rise to indirect liability under piercing doctrine,not direct liability under the statutory language.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted quoting lynda oswald,bifurcation of the owner and operator analysis under cercla.
second,the bestfoods court noted that,i n addition to and perhaps as a reflection of the erroneous focus on the relationship,the district court assumed erroneously that the actions of the joint officers and directors were necessarily attributable to the parent cpc.id.at.in doing so,the district court failed to recognize that it is entirely appropriate for directors of a parent corporation to serve as directors of its subsidiary,and that fact alone may not serve to expose the parent corporation to liability for its subsidiary acts.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the court stated that,
s ince courts generally presume that the directors are wearing their subsidiary hats and not their parent hats when acting for the subsidiary,it can not be enough to establish liability here that dual officers and directors made policy decisions and supervised activities at the facility.the government would have to show that,despite the general presumption to the contrary,the officers and directors were acting in their capacities as parent officers and directors,and not as subsidiary officers and directors,when they committed those acts.
id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the court described examples of activities that would be sufficient to find a parent directly liable as an operator of a polluting facility.the first example,identified by the sixth circuit,occurs when the parent operates the facility in the stead of its subsidiary or alongside the subsidiary in some sort of joint venture.id.at.citing,at.another occurs when 
a dual officer or director might depart so far from the norms of parental influence exercised through dual officeholding as to serve the parent,even when ostensibly acting on behalf of the subsidiary in operating the facility.
id.in a third scenario,an agent of the parent with no hat to wear but the parent hat might manage or direct activities at the facility.id.
to distinguish a parental officer oversight of a subsidiary from control over the operation of the subsidiary facility,norms of corporate behavior undisturbed by any cercla provision are crucial reference points.id.elaborating on the general contours of these norms,the court noted that liability would not arise out of activities involving the facility but consistent with the parent investor status,such as monitoring of the subsidiary performance,supervision of the subsidiary finance and capital budget decisions,and articulation of general policies and procedures.id.at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted thus,t he critical question is whether,in degree and detail,actions directed to the facility by an agent of the parent alone are eccentric under accepted norms of parental oversight of a subsidiary facility.id.
the court found some evidence that cpc engaged in just this type and degree of activity at the plant in question.id.specifically,a cpc agent played a conspicuous part in dealing with the toxic risks emanating from the operation of the plant.id.the district court found that this agent,williams williams,served in the capacity of cpc governmental and environmental affairs director and became heavily involved in environmental issues at cpc subsidiary.drawing no ultimate conclusions,the court nevertheless found these findings sufficient to raise an issue of cpc operation of the facility and therefore remanded to the district court for a reevaluation of cpc agents role in operating the facility at issue.id.at.
standard of review 
before assessing judge torres application of bestfoods to request for rule b relief,we need to explain the standards of review we apply to his decision.rule b rulings are generally reviewed for abuse of discretion.see,agostini,at.king greenblatt,cir alexis lichine lichine estate selections,cir theriault smith,cir.if,however,the district court exercise of discretion is premised on an erroneous legal principle,we review that legal error de novo.see koon united states,d noting that the district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.see also agostini,at.t he exercise of the discretion in a rule b context can not be permitted to stand if we find it rests upon a legal principle that can no longer be sustained.alexis lichine,at i n reviewing the actions of the trial court,we may reverse only for error of law or abuse of discretion.
here,there is an important interplay between the decisions of judge boyle and judge torres.judge torres interpreted bestfoods and applied that interpretation to judge boyle findings of fact to reach the conclusion that lacks a meritorious defense to operator liability under bestfoods.that conclusion amounts to a legal determination closely akin to a substantial likelihood of success ruling in the context of a motion for preliminary injunctive ruling which courts often treat as a legal conclusion subject to de novo review we do the same here,reviewing de novo judge torres conclusion that bestfoods would not alter judge boyle determination of operator liability as affirmed by the first circuit.ii,d at.however,we review for abuse of discretion judge torres ultimate determination that the motion for rule b relief should be denied because continued application of the declaratory judgment is not unjust recognizing that his assessment of the meritorious defense element of the b calculus was of primary importance in reaching his ultimate determination 
potentially meritorious defense 
argues that it possesses a potentially meritorious defense to cercla liability under these bestfoods principles sufficient to give a court reason to believe that vacating the judgment will not be an empty exercise.teamsters,at.focusing only on operator liability,as we did in our first decision in this case see at,we disagree.
in i,judge boyle held that t he parent corporation control over the subsidiary management and operations is an essential element of proving operator liability on the parent part.at.under bestfoods,this reading of cercla is incorrect.instead,the supreme court focused on the relationship between the parent and the facility itself the question is not whether the parent operates the subsidiary,but rather whether it operates the facility,and that operation is evidenced by participation in the activities of the facility,not the subsidiary.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the court defined an operator as 
someone who directs the workings of,manages,or conducts the affairs of a facility and must manage,direct,or conduct operations specifically related to pollution,that is,operations having to do with the leakage or disposal of hazardous waste,or decisions about compliance with environmental regulations.
in its formulation of operator liability,we face an arguable ambiguity in the bestfoods decision.the court appears to link the operational inquiry to the environmental matters noted above.at other times,the court articulates the relevant relationship more broadly,suggesting an inquiry beyond the parent direct involvement in activities at the plant.see id.at.noting the term operation to include the exercise of direction over the facility activities.
whatever the ambiguity created by these references,we think it is clear that direct operator liability requires an ultimate finding of the parent involvement with operations having to do with the leakage or disposal of hazardous waste,or decisions about compliance with environmental regulations.id.at.indeed,at the end of bestfoods the court attention to facts specific to the involvement of cpc and its agent williams in its subsidiary environmental matters indicates that the focus is controlling.see id.at.this reading is consistent with that of other courts interpreting cercla liability since bestfoods.see,lumber dixie distrib,cir reading bestfoods in arranger liability context to require active involve ment in the arrangements for disposal united states green,d,requiring participation in management of facility pollution control operations for operator liability to attach.
judge boyle cited pervasive control over stamina mills environmental affairs,specifically at the forestdale facility.his findings place squarely within the supreme court definition of direct operator liability.specifically,judge boyle found that 
i llustrative of control are its actions with regard to environmental matters affecting stamina mills knew that stamina mills employed a scouring system that used tce indeed,approved the installation of that system after mandating that a study be made by stamina mills there are other examples of participation in stamina mills environmental.evidence was introduced that issued a directive to its subsidiaries,including stamina mills,requiring that legal department be notified of any governmental agency or court contact regarding environmental matters.furthermore,when stamina mills was sued in by the united states for an illegal waste water discharge into the branch river,the final decision on settlement was made by directors.
i.at.judge boyle also found that 
essentially was in charge in practically all of stamina operational decisions,including those involving environmental concerns.made the ultimate decision to acquire the dry cleaning process using tce.moreover,issued a directive requiring stamina mills to notify the legal department of any correspondence with courts or governmental agencies regarding environmental matters.the only autonomy given the officers of stamina mills was that absolutely necessary to operate the facility from day to day such as hiring and firing hourly employees and ordering inventory.stamina was in fact and effect the serf of.
id.at.based on these findings,we conclude as did judge torres that judge boyle expressly found that directed stamina mills activities with respect to environmental matters,in general,and operation of the facility utilizing tce,in particular.ii,d at.
reliance on judge boyle findings of control over operations at stamina mills forestdale mill might be questionable if judge boyle premised these findings upon evidence of actions of joint directors or officers of and stamina mills,thereby assuming that these actions were automatically attributable to.that attribution would be in conflict with bestfoods.however,the record made before judge boyle reveals control by in the manner required by bestfoods 
there is evidence that an agent of hinerfeld,executive of exerted operational control over environmental matters at the forestdale facility.hinerfeld was nei
