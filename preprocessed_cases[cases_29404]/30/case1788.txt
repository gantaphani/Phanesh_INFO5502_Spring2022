introduction 
a trade group,the national paint coatings association,has brought this action against the south coast air quality management district,challenging the district amendments to its rule limiting the amount of volatile organic compounds allowed in various kinds of paint and coatings in southern california 
the challenged rule basically says here a list of the maximum levels of volatile organic compounds that paint manufacturers may have in different kinds of paint and coatings,with the effective levels kicking in at various times the rule also has an averaging provision,similar to federal car mileage standards,which allows manufacturers to average the actual cumulative emissions of their paints and coatings so that the total emission can be under a hypothetical compliance limit,even if some of their paints and coatings are not.
the paint association challenge is also conceptually simple enough it asserts that the district has exceeded the authority given it by the statutes governing its authority to promulgate air pollution regulations,because the rule specifies limits that are not actually available and achievable.see health,subd.b 
as we explain below,the paint association challenge fails as to all of the categories of paints and coatings governed by the rule,except for two.in a word,if it exists,it both available and achievable,even if there is not much of it by way of variety or market penetration.there is substantial evidence that there are floor coatings,industrial maintenance coatings,high temperature industrial maintenance coatings,nonflat coatings,primers,sealers and undercoaters and quick dry primers,sealers and undercoaters which both exist and comply with even the most recent limits effective july required under the rule.that is,technology complying with the limits is both available and achievable.
however,the administrative record shows there are em,that comply with the most recent limits in two categories enamels and rust preventative coatings.we have no evidence that,in these categories,the technology is both available and achievable to comply with the district amended limits we have only speculation that one day in the future the technology will exist to comply with the limits.
we will therefore affirm the trial court in denying the paint association requested writ of administrative mandate as to everything but these two categories.we will direct the writ to be granted as to enamels and rust preventers,but with this proviso recognizing that,as we write in working with an administrative record largely based on information existing in late and there a reason for the long lag time,as will soon be apparent,instead of directing that the rule be vacated as to these two categories,the writ will conditionally give the district the opportunity to show,based on current technology,that enamels and rust preventers can be made which comply with the most recent limits.only if,after a hearing on remand,the district can not show availability and achievability based on existing coatings in these two categories should a writ issue requiring the amended rule to be rolled back to earlier limits 
ii.the history of the litigation 
national paint association i 
as mentioned,the rule was first promulgated in.the rule was amended in.the amended rule put very restrictive limits on volatile organic compounds.those amendments were quickly challenged,as exceeding the district enabling statutes,by the paint association in the orange county superior court,then later in this court.
the challenge resulted in an unpublished decision,national paint coatings association,south coast air quality management district june,unpub.opn wl national paint association i.in national paint association i,this court reversed a judgment denying the requested writ of administrative mandamus on procedural grounds.we noted that,at the very last is,within about days before the hearing at which the district considered the amended district announced two significant exceptions.one exempted essential public services from certain interim limits.the other allowed small manufacturers to average their emissions.see id.at.
those exceptions contravened section,requiring days public notice of a new rule.as we explained,the timing of the exceptions served to sandbag the opposition to the amended rule in three ways they effectively bought off opposition to the rule from public agencies like caltrans and metropolitan water district both of which have a need for coatings relatively high in volatile organic compounds because they last longer they made it more difficult for opponents of the limits to rally opposition and,they even precluded opponents of any exemptions from being heard.national paint association i,wl at.we directed a writ of mandate to command the district to vacate its amendments,so as to allow the amended rule the required time to circulate before adoption.id.at.
in our unpublished opinion,we stated that we did not reach the merits of the paint association challenge to the rule.we did observe in that regard,though,that,for certain heavy duty public uses such as electrical transformers and water pipelines,there is a serious question as to whether there are now any low volatile organic paints available as substitutes.national paint association i,supra,wl at fn.
national paint association ii 
by the end of december,that is,within less than seven months of the filing date of national paint association i,the district promulgated an amended rule,this time avoiding the procedural mistake of inserting exemptions at the last minute.paint association filed suit in orange county superior court,again asserting that the amended rule let call this the rule violated the district enabling statutes.
not to put too fine a point on it,the district lawyers quickly outmaneuvered the paint association lawyers into what was no doubt perceived to be a more favorable forum for their side.they had the case removed to federal court 
the details here are interesting the district notice of removal was based on the theory that there had been a consent judgment in an unrelated federal case going back to which gave the district a colorable federal defense to the paint association lawsuit after the notice of removal to federal court,the paint association responded with a motion to remand back to state court.federal trial court judges typically have enough federal work to do without having to unnecessarily kibitz matters of state law,and,in,the federal court granted the paint association motion to send the case back to state court.
but the district appealed that order,and,if one reads the ensuing unpublished ninth circuit opinion,one finds that the federal judge remand order was reversed because the paint association counsel filed its remand request too late 
in short,but for a procedural mishap by the paint association counsel,the case would have gone back to state trial back in,and then on to presumably this appellate court by or maybe.instead,the ninth circuit did not issue its decision reversing the remand order until summer,requiring federal district court judge dean pregerson to undertake the arduous task of deciding the merits of the paint association challenge.
the task was accomplished in may,resulting in a published decision,national paint coatings association south coast air quality management district d,or national paint association ii.significantly,the decision was decided as a matter of the federal court diversity jurisdiction,looking solely to california precedent and statutes to best ascertain how our state highest court would rule.see id.at.when one reads the decision one discovers that,despite the supposedly federal basis for the original remand request,there is no federal law component in the national paint association ii opinion.so much for that colorable federal defense.
the federal trial court decided to deny the paint association requested writ in national paint association ii.we will mostly agree federal trial court decision national paint association ii below in parts.and.of this opinion.our sole disagreement is with national paint association ii decision not to consider one of the statutes in the scheme.it should be noted here,though,that the point on which we agree with the paint association concerning the two categories of paints and coatings for which there is no evidence of availability or achievability was itself not specifically addressed in national paint association ii.
national paint association iii 
however,the paint association lawyers had been completely outmaneuvered.during the case sojourn in the federal courts,the state case continued in fits and starts.remember that the federal trial court had decided the case should be sent back to state court by early,so,from the state trial court point of view,for the period through,it had in front of it a case where remand to federal court had been rejected.
the state court was going to try the paint association suit in three phases the legal authority of the district to propound the rule other claims by the paint association,that the district had not engaged in an adequate socioeconomic impact assessment and the district own affirmative defenses.phase,dealing with the issue of the district authority,was tried to the court in september.after that,however,there appears to have been a hiatus in the state court of about a year,until april,when the district proposed a statement of decision.the paint association objected to that proposed statement in june.in july,before the trial court decided the matter,the ninth circuit reversed the federal court decision to reject the remand to federal court.in the period august through may,national paint association ii was being litigated in the federal trial court.after the may decision by the federal trial court,the paint association dismissed its claims not associated within the scope of the district authority,that is,not otherwise covered by phase.the dismissals left no causes of action in the state case for judgment,and finally,in january,the trial court issued its statement of decision as to phase proposed back in april 
the statement of decision noted the evidence in the administrative record that a number of compliant paints and coatings were present on the market,and further referenced a assessment by eastern michigan university on the state of technology for low volatile organic compound coatings.the assessment concluded that low volatile organic compound technology should witness major progress over the next to years.the assessment further concluded that by the year,there will be volatile organic compound coatings commercially available in a number of categories which,of course,also suggests that they would not be available in at least some others.
the statement of decision also pointed to four escape routes that address the paint association feasibility concerns.one was the averaging provision discussed above.the second was an extension of compliance deadlines for small niche paint manufacturers that may be unable to utilize averaging.the third were requirements that the district staff conduct technology assessments to evaluate industry progress in meeting the limits and report back to the board as to the appropriateness of maintaining future volatile organic compound limits.finally,the statement of decision pointed to the statutory product variance process as set out in section et.
with the statement of decision,a judgment ensued denying the paint association petition.a timely notice of appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
collateral estoppel public interest exception 
the paint association appeal is not foreclosed by the federal trial court decision in national paint association ii.the reason is the public interest exception to the doctrine of collateral estoppel.see kopp fair pol.practices com.cal th,d,refusing to apply public interest exception to collateral estoppel and res judicata doctrines where ninth circuit had upheld federal trial court decision declaring parts of california campaign finance reform initiative unconstitutional city of sacramento state of california cal d,prior decision adversely affected taxpayers or,alternatively,affected receipt of federal funds either way,public interest required definitive decision greenfield mather cal d,recognizing public interest exception to res judicata modesto city schools education audits appeal panel th,d courts recognize an exception to the rule of collateral estoppel where there is a prior ruling on a question of law and the issue concerns a matter of public interest.
as the california supreme court pointed out in kopp,state courts are the principal expositors of state law kopp,supra,cal th at,d,quoting moore sims,d and federal courts lack jurisdiction authoritatively to construe state legislation kopp,supra,cal th at,d,quoting united states photographs,d.
the need for authoritative state construction of state legislation is illustrated in arcadia unified school dist.state of education cal th,d,arcadia.there,a prior state appellate decision was unpublished and thus could not be cited as legal authority.id.at,d.because of the void,our high court thus applied the public interest exception.
arcadia is a template for the case before us.as otherwise persuasive or helpful as it might be,national paint association ii is not binding on any california trial court.and of course the matter is of significant public interest.everyone breathes.and everyone has some contact with paint or coating,even if only to rely on electric transformers and water lines that need rust proofing.
ironically,the need for an authoritative state court interpretation of the district best available technology statutes was itself underscored by the federal trial court in national paint association ii.judge pregerson made a point of noting that the california courts have thus far declined to rule on the scope of the district authority.national paint association ii,supra,d at.
this case also seems particularly appropriate for application of the public interest exception given that the removal to federal court was based on federal issues,yet federal issues did not play any role in the federal trial court decision in national paint association ii.in point of fact,the only reason the federal court was burdened with the job of interpreting state law in the first place was a procedural mishap the lack of a timely filing by the paint association.
standard of review 
a word on the standard of review.the subject has already been well covered in yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,yamaha,in both the majority and concurring opinions.as the yamaha majority explained,when dealing with controlling statutes in one respect,our opinion in wallace berrie state bd.of equalization cal d,may overstate the level of rules are reviewed independently for consistency with controlling law.a court does not,in other words,defer to an agency view when deciding whether a regulation lies within the scope of the authority delegated by the legislature.the court,not the agency,has final responsibility for the interpretation of the law under which the regulation was issued.yamaha,supra,cal th at,fn,d,italics added.even so,the court still accords great weight and respect to the administrative construction.id.at,d.
and,as justice mosk wrote,concurring in yamaha in the case of regulations,the court has essentially two tasks.the first duty is to determine whether the agency exercised its authority within the bounds of the statutory mandate.t his is a matter for the independent judgment of the court.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of mosk,italics added.
as we read these rules,it is an independent question of law for this court whether the amendments exceeded the district statutory authority.as justice mosk wrote for a unanimous court in association for retarded citizens department of developmental services cal d,the scope of judicial review of administrative action is well settled to be valid,such administrative action must be within the scope of authority conferred by the enabling statute.we have long recognized,of course,that the construction of a statute by officials charged with its administration,including their interpretation of the authority invested in them to implement and carry out its provisions,is entitled to great weight nevertheless,w hatever the force of administrative construction,final responsibility for the interpretation of the law rests with the courts.italics added.
c.the controlling statutes 
overview and relevantstatutory text 
in california,the regulatory agency with authority over vehicular air pollution is the california air resources board.a series of regional regulatory districts have authority over non vehicular air pollution.the legislature finds and declares that local and regional authorities have the primary responsibility for control of air pollution from all sources,other than emissions from motor vehicles.the control of emissions from motor vehicles,except as otherwise provided in this division,shall be the responsibility of the state board.the most prominent of these regional districts,given southern california smog problem,is of course the south coast air quality control district.see 
the district rule making authority is delineated in section.while we quote the entirety of the statute in the margin the critical text is in subdivisions a and b,which we quote here 
a the south coast district board shall adopt rules and regulations that carry out the plan and are not in conflict with state law and federal laws and rules and regulations.upon adoption and approval of subsequent revisions of the plan,these rules and regulations shall be amended,if necessary,to conform to the plan.
b the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to subdivision a shall do all of the following 
require the use of best available control technology for new and modified sources and the use of best available retrofit control technology for existing sources.
the phrases best available control technology and best available retrofit control technology have been specifically defined in sections and the definitions part of the statutory scheme setting up the district respectively.section provides in its entirety 
a as used in this chapter,best available control technology means an emission limitation that will achieve the lowest achievable emission rate for the source to which it is applied.subject to subdivision b,lowest achievable emission rate,as used in this section,means the more stringent of the following 
the most stringent emission limitation that is contained in the state implementation plan for the particular class or category of source,unless the owner or operator of the source demonstrates that the limitation is not achievable.
the most stringent emission limitation that is achieved in practice by that class or category or source.
b lowest achievable emission rate shall not be construed to authorize the permitting of a proposed new source or a modified source that will emit any pollutant in excess of the amount allowable under the applicable new source standards of performance.
section provides in its entirety as used in this chapter,best available retrofit control technology means an emission limitation that is based on the maximum degree of reduction achievable,taking into account environmental,energy,and economic impacts by each class or category of source.
california cases on the controlling statutes 
while a number of california appellate decisions have involved challenges to air pollution regulations promulgated by the district as we have noted above,the federal trial court in national paint association ii stated california courts had thus far declined to rule on the scope of the district authority.national paint association ii,supra,d at.
the federal trial court statement,however,was not quite accurate.two published appellate decisions have certainly dealt with the scope of the district authority in the context of pondering just what the legislature intended when it wrote the words,best available in the context of new or retrofit technology.
first,in upholding district regulations limiting the amount of small particulate matter that refineries may emit,the western petroleum case dealt with the problem of exactly what is meant by the word achievable.see western states,supra,th at,d.the western petroleum court took the common sense view that if something had already been done,it achievable,and on that basis reasoned that if one out of six refineries had been able to meet the district small particulate matter standard,that standard was achievable by the five others.see id.at,d rejecting notion that a given refinery achievements were not a fair indication that the other refineries could also meet the standard.
second,security environmental,supra,d,had occasion to comment on the meaning of best available control technology in the context of permits for a hazardous waste incineration facility based on what had been a negative declaration as to environmental effects.in that case,the district wanted to condition construction of the incineration facility on its using the best available control technology at the time of construction,even though permits had already been granted more than two years previously.the security environmental court observed the best available control technology has progressed since the original permits and new information is available in the form of technology for controlling acid gases,particulates and their associated dioxins and furans.it has further been determined that a previously known selective catalytic reduction nitrogen oxide control system is cost effective now due to new information,thus qualifying its use on hazardous waste incinerators as technologically feasible best available control technology.thus the new information raising the possibility of substantially increased health risk and the availability of new emission control technology which may lessen that risk require an environmental impact report to set forth the present significant environmental effects of the proposed project and any mitigating measures to minimize the significant environmental effects and alternatives to the proposed project.security environmental,supra,d at,italics added.
the passage is significant.like the western petroleum court,the security environmental court treated the phrase best available control technology in the common,ordinary sense of the words best and available as something that than something that might one day be expected to exist.
source versus application 
the core of the paint association challenge to the rule may be summarized this way while compliant paints and coatings may exist in various categories,there is no evidence in the administrative record that those compliant paints and coatings are suitable for all applications or uses of those paints.thus,for example,there is nothing to show that any of the paints or coatings used for,say,applications like electric transformers or street lights,are suitable for such a use.
on this point,the district has the better part of the argument.the key word in the statute is in sources of applications.the cornerstone statute,section,is framed in terms of the district responsibility for control of air pollution from all sources italics added while the more detailed subdivision b of section is similarly framed in terms sources of pollution require the use of best available control technology for new and modified sources and the use of best available retrofit control technology for existing sources.italics added.
as the federal trial court we think correctly divined in national paint association ii,the number of possible applications is infinite.national paint association ii,supra,d at reference to every conceivable application.
put another way you can slap paint on anything.it is therefore unreasonable to believe that the legislature intended to think of the object receiving the paint or coating as a regulated source of pollution the natural reading of the word is that the paint or coating itself is the regulated source,particularly when one realizes that it is paint or coating that is the source of any obnoxious fumes from an object that might escape into the air.it follows then that if the district rule directed at the paint or distinct from whatever the paint or coating is put within the authority of the statute,that is enough to comply with the statute.any other conclusion would mean that no paint or coating could ever be limited in emissions,because one could always dream up a heavy duty application for which the limit would be,as the doctors say,counterindicated.
state of the art 
the analysis so far 
based on what we have noted so far,we uphold the rule as it applies to all but two categories of regulated paints and coatings.the administrative record contains a table of currently available compliant coatings that shows that there are at least some compliant coatings compliant with the limits in all categories except,as we have noted,enamels and rust preventative coatings.
to be sure,in some categories the total percentages of coatings compliant with the limits are pretty low only eight percent of primer sealer undercoaters are shown compliant with the limits,only percent of industrial maintenance coatings are compliant,and only three percent of nonflat coatings are compliant.
even so,in the ordinary sense of the words,it means that there are best available paints and coatings,in existence,that meet the rule.obviously such coatings are achievable they have been,in fact,achieved.applying the western petroleum it has been already been done,it is clear that the rule is within the bounds of as regards these categories.
beyond state of the art 
strawless bricks versus godot 
we now turn to the issue as to whether the limits on two categories,enamels and rust preventative for which there are no known compliant coatings in existence at least in this record,are within the scope of the district statutory authority.
the parties proffer two different models of the statute,basically dividing on whether the district statutory authority is limited to requiring state of the art technology,or extends to requiring technology that is beyond current state of the art.
which brings us to a topic that is generally referred to in the literature as technology forcing.unfortunately,the phrase technology forcing is not always clear.at its mildest,it appears to connote technology redirection,in which the law seeks to shape technology into existent low or zero emission approaches,even if,for example,those approaches are relatively expensive.at its most extreme,technology forcing connotes an attempt to decree a technological result by legal ukase.
two competing literary tropes exemplify technology forcing in this extreme sense.on the positive side,we have the comment of the federal appellate court for the district of columbia in a occupational safety case,suggesting that if the legislative goal is sufficiently important,that fact overrides what does,or does not,exist as state of the art.the goal,as the court said,simply can not wait for the godot of scientific certainty.united steelworkers of america,marshall,united steelworkers.
godot was the subject of samuel beckett absurdist play about two characters waiting for a compatriot here the punch arrives perhaps a more popular trope for the technology forcing approach would be captain picard line to his immediate subordinate in the second star trek series,make it so,number one.in the godot model,the regulatory agency need only show that modern technology has at least conceived some industrial strategies or devices that will be likely to be capable of meeting the regulatory requirement.united steelworkers,supra,at,italics added.
the other literary trope is of somewhat older origin that beckett play.it is pharaoh venting of his displeasure with the israelite slaves by making them gather their own straw to make bricks,yet maintaining the same quota for brick production.needless to say,that was a bit of a hardship it was not feasible to make bricks without straw,or at least,given the technology of the day,decent bricks of the sort that a ruler like pharaoh would require for some building project like his tomb in the brickless straw model,the limits of the agency authority do not extend beyond what currently exists.
when all else fails read the relevant statutes 
these competing images,however,can only serve as images of competing legislative models,they can not tell what our legislature actually intended.to do that,we must actually examine the words of the relevant statutes.
plain meaning 
we now parse the relevant statutes,sections,and.
the operative grant of authority to the district is found in section,subdivision b where the district is mandated to adopt rules that require the use of best available control technology for new and modified sources and the use of best available retrofit control technology for existing sources.beyond that sections and define best available control technology and best available retrofit control technology respectively in terms of an emission limitation that will achieve the lowest achievable emission rate for the source to which it is applied or an emission limitation that is based on the maximum degree of reduction achievable.
we first notice the first operative word in the operative phrase best.best is a comparison word good,better,best,and thus implies a choice of things existing.competing speculative technologies or what is merely conceivable do not lend themselves to easy comparison.
we next notice the word available.the word similarly indicates something that exists in a way that things that are merely conceivable do not.cold fusion is conceivable.it is not,today,available.
what about achievable the word achievable has the distinction of having one of the shortest definitions one is likely to encounter in the oxford english dictionary.it is literally one phrase capable of being achieved.and the definition of achieved is similarly short,consisting of four synonyms,all in the past tense completed accomplished attained,won.oxford eng.dict.ed at.
the past tense in the variations on the word achievable indicate that it refers to a thing or process that currently exists,as distinct from what is speculative or merely theoretical.when construed together with the words best and available,the conclusion becomes inevitable the district has authority to require the best of what exists,not what might conceivably come on the market.
what about the able in achievable surely the choice of the word achievable as distinct from achieved is some indication that the district may require at least something,even if it does exist as such,can be readily put together 
indeed we agree.it is said,for example,while some nations do not possess atomic weapons as such,they can put them together on a moment notice.the technology for them already is simply a matter of the will to assemble the component parts.
so,the fact that there are no existing compliant coatings at,say time one,does not necessarily mean such coatings could not be achieved at,say,time one plus almost immediately thereafter.that is,even if something does not currently exist,it is achievable in the sense that it can be readily assembled out of things that currently do exist.using lemon juice instead of pesticides in your kitchen to kill ants is certainly achievable,even if you do have any lemon juice on hand.
this opinion should therefore not be read as restricting the district authority to promulgate a rule requiring what is achievable when based on existing technology.
thus,the fact that there are no compliant enamels or rust preventers that are compliant with the limits is not absolutely dispositive.however,as shown by the trial court own statement of decision referencing the eastern michigan university assessment of the state of technology for low volatile organic compound coatings,there was no evidence of any sort of achievability.that assessment simply prophesied that there would be major progress over the next to years and predicted,wells style,that there would be compliant coatings by the year.
science fiction is not substantial evidence.a trend line does not achievability make.there is the logical fallacy of extrapolation,which assumes that the future will be like the past,only more so.see rahdert,of impressionists and rohrschach blots,indeed,professor friedman warns us early on not to indulge in the extrapolation fallacy the usually erroneous assumption that the future will be just like the pr
