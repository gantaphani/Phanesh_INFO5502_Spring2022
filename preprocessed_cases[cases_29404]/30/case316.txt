michael eugene hillyer pled guilty to two federal environmental crimes involving illegal dredging in north carolina croatan sound.the government appeals hillyer sentence of three years probation,contending that the district court erred both in calculating the advisory guideline range and in imposing a or variance sentence.we conclude that the guideline range was improperly calculated because the departure granted under for aberrant behavior was unwarranted.we therefore vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.
we recount the facts as established by the guilty plea and presented without objection in the presentence report and at the sentencing hearing.in march the army corps of engineers the corps granted a permit to the north carolina department of transportation dot to build a mile bridge across the croatan sound from manns harbor to manteo.the bridge would be named the virginia dare memorial bridge.in april dot awarded a million construction contract to balfour beatty construction,balfour.the contract required balfour to comply with the corps permit,which was issued under the rivers and harbors act of,et,and the clean water act,et.construction began in,but by the project was over budget and far behind schedule.moreover,the project had an abysmal safety record.in june balfour,in an effort to salvage the job,brought in hillyer as project manager.hillyer had supervised some of the largest and most complicated bridge projects in the country.he had earned a reputation for competence and for being a hardnosed and sometimes bullheaded manager who demanded quality work from his employees.as the project new manager,hillyer assumed responsibility for balfour compliance with all applicable permits and the federal environmental laws that they incorporated.
the original permit from the corps prohibited the excavation of material from,and the fill or disposal of material within,the affected waters and wetlands,except as authorized by the permit or any modification.in at balfour request,dot obtained a permit modification to allow construction of a temporary trestle or bridge to be built on pilings driven into the bottom of the croatan sound.the permit authorized balfour to the pilings into the bottom of the sound it did not authorize prop washing or jetting,techniques used to dredge and displace material from the bottom of a water course.dredged soil is a pollutant under the clean water act.the trestle,completed in the fall of,extended feet into the water and was feet wide.it facilitated the transport of construction materials from the shoreline to barges out in the water.
the virginia dare memorial bridge opened august,on schedule.hillyer had completely rehabilitated the project,reducing costs,ensuring a timely finish,and garnering an award for the safest project on the east coast.the positive run of events began to turn,however,the day before the bridge opened.on august,hillyer directed his employees to dump fill material from the project into wetlands at a nearby marina site,in violation of the permit and applicable federal laws.dot requested that balfour cease dumping material at the marina site,but the company refused.a corps representative for regulatory matters then met with hillyer to advise him that depositing fill material was impermissible and would require permit modification.he further instructed hillyer on how to contact the corps directly for guidance and authorization on regulatory compliance matters.hillyer,however,responded with profanity and essentially told the corps representative that it was his hillyer fill and he hillyer would do what he hillyer wanted.id.
after the bridge opened,balfour began efforts to remove the trestle so that it could be transported and reassembled at another bridge project,where it was urgently needed.balfour tried using a crane to extract the trestle pilings,but sediment around the pilings blocked the crane from getting close enough for the extraction.in late october hillyer directed his employees to excavate a channel around the trestle to facilitate crane access.hillyer first instructed the employees to use a clam bucket,but was promptly notified by dot that this activity constituted dredging and was impermissible under existing permits.on october,hillyer directed employees to use another dredging technique,specifically prop dredging or prop washing with tugboat propellers,to displace material from the sound bottom.the following day,upon discovering the prop dredging,dot faxed hillyer a letter notifying him once again that he was violating existing permits and must cease all dredging unless and until a permit modification was obtained.in response,hillyer sent dot a request that it seek permit modification from the corps.
without waiting for the necessary modification,hillyer ordered more prop dredging.he assembled the workers at on sunday,october,at a nearby marina and arranged for them to be shuttled by boat to the site,where they resumed the prop dredging.he ordered his crew to shut down the dredging operation early the next two days,around or,only to return at night and resume the work under cover of darkness,with the tugboat navigation lights turned off.hillyer took these unusual steps in an obvious attempt to conceal the unpermitted activity from dot.the concealment effort failed,however.a balfour employee on board the tugboat the night of october called hillyer to report that dot was watching and videotaping the activity.hillyer,who was under considerable pressure from balfour to remove the trestle as quickly as possible,became irate and instructed the crew to continue the prop dredging.
the dredging continued until october,when removal of the trestle was completed.dot thereafter sent three letters to balfour notifying it that the prop dredging was a permit violation.in late december the corps issued a notice of violation against balfour for the unauthorized dredging.in january,at dot request,balfour removed hillyer from all bridge projects and eventually fired him because of his inability to follow the reasonable direction of the dot resident engineers and his violation of the permit and applicable environmental laws.dot determined that the unauthorized dredging displaced roughly cubic yards about dump truck loads of sound bottom and disturbed acres of shallow water habitat designated as high quality.to mitigate the damage and facilitate restoration,dot deposited several tons of oyster clutch material at the dredge site.
balfour pled guilty in may to a criminal information charging violations of the rivers and harbors act of and the clean water act.the company was sentenced to a fine and five years probation,which included a condition that its project managers attend annual training on regulatory compliance.as required by the plea agreement,balfour also paid dot mitigation costs in full,totaling about.in april and may two balfour employees who had worked under hillyer during the prop dredging pled guilty to criminal informations charging violations of these same statutes.the two were sentenced to probation and hours of community service.
hillyer,for his part,pled guilty in october to two counts of a indictment conspiring to violate the rivers and harbors act of and the clean water act,see count one and violating the rivers and harbors act of and aiding and abetting the violation,see,and count two.before downward adjustments,hillyer offense level was,which included a increase for ongoing,continuous,and repetitive discharge and release of a pollutant.see b a.the government moved for a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,two separate downward departures based on the lack of permanent environmental harm and the lack of public health risk,comment.nn,and a upward adjustment for obstruction of justice.the court expressly granted the first request and expressly rejected the last it did not rule on the second request,but implicitly granted it by lowering hillyer offense level to.hillyer moved,over the government objection,for a downward departure under on the ground that his conduct constituted aberrant behavior.the court did not expressly rule on the motion at the sentencing he
