the fishery conservation and management act,act,or the act,creates a national program for the conservation and management of the fishery resources of the united states.id.a.the act establishes eight regional fishery management councils,each of which shall prepare a fishery management plan fmp for each fishery under its authority that requires conservation and management.id.a,h.the secretary of commerce,acting through the national marine fisheries service nmfs,then reviews each fmp or amendment of a plan to determine whether it is consistent with the act national standards,the other provisions of this chapter,and any other applicable law,a.see or.trollers ass gutierrez,cir.
the issue for decision is whether nmfs can exempt a fishery under its authority that requires conservation and management from an fmp because the agency is content with state management.the district court held that it could.we disagree,and reverse.
background 
factual and legislative background 
cook inlet is one of the nation most productive salmon fisheries.its salmon are anadromous,beginning their lives in alaskan freshwater,migrating to the ocean,and returning to freshwater to spawn.
in,the united states entered into the international convention for the high seas fisheries of the north pacific ocean.in response,congress enacted the north pacific fisheries act of the act,authorizing the secretary of the interior to promulgate regulations governing fisheries contiguous to alaskan waters.see pub,stat,previously codified at.the secretary then issued a regulation prohibiting salmon net fishing in the western waters of alaska,but excepting cook inlet and two other areas where net fishing had historically been permitted under alaska law in those areas,federal regulation was to mirror existing alaskan regulation.repealed.
before,the united states asserted authority only over waters up to twelve nautical miles from the coastline,and there was substantial concern that foreign fishers were depleting american fisheries.see mark zilberberg,a legislative history of the fishery conservation management act of legislative history.in,congress enacted the fishery conservation and management act the act,pub,stat codified as amended at,later renamed the act.the act extended federal jurisdiction to miles from the coastline,id.codified as amended at,and regulated foreign fishing in that area,id,codified as amended at.states retained jurisdiction over the first three miles from the coast,id.a codified as amended at,and the federal government had jurisdiction over the next miles,originally called the fishery conservation zone fcz and later named the exclusive economic zone eez,id.codified as amended at.see also b exclusive economic zone of the united states of america,fed.reg.
the federal government manages its waters through eight regional councils.during the debate on the act,senator gravel of alaska criticized the concept of federal management on one side of the line and state management on the other,because fish freely travel across the boundary.legislative history.senator gravel suggested that a state should manage its federal waters under a plan approved by the federal government.id.at.senator stevens of alaska,one of the bill managers,offered an even broader proposal,which provided for exclusive state management of t hose fisheries capable of being managed as a unit,which reside principally within the waters of a single state.id.at.but,congress instead approved a more modest substitute offered by the bill other manager,senator magnuson,directing councils,if possible,to incorporate state management measures in fmps.act c codified at.
in,nmfs promulgated an fmp for salmon fisheries near alaska.see fishery management plan for the high seas salmon,fed.reg.june,the salmon fmp.the salmon fmp divided alaskan federal waters into east and west areas cook inlet is in the west area.id.at.with respect to the west area,the fmp tracked the regulations promulgated under the act prohibiting commercial salmon fishing except in the three historic areas,including cook inlet,which the state would continue to manage.id.these fisheries are technically in the fcz,but are conducted and managed by the state of alaska as inside fisheries.the decision to leave these fisheries in the hands of the state was not based on a finding that they were in good health to the contrary,the salmon fmp found that a ll salmon species are at historic low levels in the cook inlet management area,with chinook stocks seriously depleted.id.at.
in,congress amended the act to specify that a council need only prepare an fmp with respect to a fishery that requires conservation and management.pub,stat,codified as amended at h.the conference report explained this amendment was intended to clarify that the function of the councils is not to prepare a fishery management plan fmp for each and every fishery within their geographical areas of authority.rather,such plans are to be developed for those fisheries which require conservation and management.conf,at.
alaska had proposed to amend the act to direct the secretary of commerce to delegate authority of a domestic fishery in the fcz to the adjacent state if the fishery does not cross interstate boundaries and the state is capable and willing to provide conservation and management consistent with the national standards.omnibus authorization bill for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration hearings before the comm.on commerce,sci,serial,cong.hereinafter hearings statement of ronald skoog,commissioner,alaska department of fish and game.but,this proposal was not enacted.see pub,stat.
the salmon fmp was revised in.the revised fmp stated that,under the regulation implementing the act,salmon net fishing in the west area was prohibited,with the exception of the three historic areas,which technically extend into the eez,but are conducted and managed by the state of alaska as nearshore fisheries.
in,a new international convention prohibited all fishing for anadromous fish beyond the eez.convention for the conservation of anadromous stocks in the north pacific ocean,art.i,iii.congress promptly implemented that convention and repealed the act.north pacific anadromous stocks act of,pub,stat.codified at.the secretary of commerce then concluded that regulations promulgated under the act,including,no longer had statutory support,and repealed them.removal of regulations,fed.reg.but,the salmon fmp was not revised,and alaska continued to manage the three historic net fisheries.
in,a fishing vessel,mister big,engaged in a massive unregulated harvest of scallops in the federal waters of prince william sound.see trawler diane marie,brown.that scallop fishery was not covered by an fmp,but the act provided that a state could regulate fishing vessels in federal waters that were registered in that state.id.at,see pub,stat,a state may not directly or indirectly regulate any fishing vessel outside its boundaries,unless the vessel is registered under the law of that state.the mister big set sail from seattle,renounced its alaska registration,and began fishing for scallops in the sound.trawler diane marie.at.by january,the quota that alaska set for the area,pounds of scallops,had been harvested,so alaska closed the scallop season and boats returned home.id.but,the mister big continued to dredge,eventually harvesting pounds of scallops before the secretary of commerce approved an emergency closure of the fishery.id.at.the north pacific council had drafted an fmp which addressed the possibility that an unregulated vessel might fish for scallops in the federal waters off alaska,but had not adopted it because of the belief that all vessels fishing in the eez would be registered in alaska and thus bound by the state regulations.id.at.
the following year,congress revised the provision regarding state authority to regulate fishing vessels in federal waters.see sustainable fisheries act,pub,stat.after that amendment,the act now provides,in relevant part 
a state may regulate a fishing vessel outside the boundaries of the state in the following circumstances 
a the fishing vessel is registered under the law of that state,and i there is no fishery management plan or other applicable federal fishing regulations for the fishery in which the vessel is operating or ii the state laws and regulations are consistent with the fishery management plan and applicable federal fishing regulations for the fishery in which the vessel is operating.
b the fishery management plan for the fishery in which the fishing vessel is operating delegates management of the fishery to a state and the state laws and regulations are consistent with such fishery management plan.
a.the version of the bill reported out of the house committee on resources would have authorized alaska to enforce its regulations in federal waters even absent an fmp,at.but,that version was not enacted.pub.
ii.amendment 
the north pacific council has jurisdiction over the federal waters of cook inlet.six of its voting members are from alaska and the remainder are from washington and oregon.a g,b,b c.
in,the north pacific council began a comprehensive review of the salmon fmp.as a result,nmfs realized that cook inlet was not exempt from the fmp as previously assumed.council staff prepared a discussion paper,which summarized the situation as follows 
the fmp is vague on the function of the fmp in these areas.though the fmp broadly includes these three areas and the salmon and fisheries that occur there within the fishery management unit and states that management of these areas is left to the state under other federal law,the fmp does not explicitly defer management of these salmon fisheries to the state.the fmp does not contain any management goals or objectives for these three areas or any provisions with which to manage salmon fishing.the fmp only refrains from extending the general fishing prohibition to those areas,where,as the fmp notes,fishing was authorized by other federal law,which has since been repealed.therefore,the fmp reference to other federal laws may no longer be fully effective.
the north pacific council circulated a draft environmental assessment,held five public meetings,and took testimony.in,the north pacific council unanimously voted to remove the three historic net fishing areas from the salmon fmp.in april,nmfs solicited comments on this change,amendment,and proposed implementing regulations.fed.reg,fed.reg.
two groups of commercial fishermen,the united cook inlet drift association and the cook inlet fishermen fund collectively,united cook,submitted comments urging the rejection of amendment.the comments cited a decline since in the commercial catch of sockeye salmon.united cook attributed this decline to two management failures by alaska.first,united cook argued that the state had failed to address the introduction of carnivorous northern pike into nearby lakes and streams.second,united cook argued that alaska was not properly managing the escapement of salmon in cook inlet.the act requires limits on the number of fish caught.a.in contrast,alaska manages commercial salmon fishing through escapement goals,the number of salmon allowed to escape past a fishery to spawn.according to united cook,the state misses the high end of its escapement goal targets as much as of the time,leading to a massive unharvested supply of fish,and has no escapement goals at all for many runs in cook inlet.
in june,nmfs issued a final environmental assessment,finding that the state is the appropriate authority for managing alaska salmon fisheries given the state existing infrastructure and expertise,and that the state escapement based management system is a more effective management system for preventing overfishing than a system like the federal one that places rigid numeric limits on the number of fish that may be caught.nmfs also issued a finding that amendment would have no significant impact on the environment because it would not change the management of the fisheries.nmfs approved amendment,and,in december,promulgated implementing regulations.see fisheries of the exclusive economic zone off alaska pacific salmon,fed.reg,definition of west area.
iii.procedural background 
united cook filed this action in,challenging amendment and its implementing regulations as contrary to the act requirement that a council prepare an fmp for each fishery under its authority that requires conservation and management,h.united cook also alleged that amendment was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to the national environmental policy act,c.the district court granted alaska motion to intervene as a defendant,and entered summary judgment for the government.united cook timely appealed.
discussion 
the act requires that e ach council shall,in accordance with the provisions of this chapter for each fishery under its authority that requires conservation and management,prepare and submit to the secretary a a fishery management plan h.thus,the usual initial question is whether the fishery at issue even needs conservation and management.see anglers conservation network pritzker,d.we review that administrative decision under the traditional arbitrary and capricious standard.id.but we need not tarry over that issue here the government concedes that the cook inlet fishery requires conservation and management.
but,the government argues that the act only requires an fmp for fisheries that need federal conservation and management,and that cook inlet is in good hands with alaska.the district court found the act ambiguous,gave chevron deference to the government interpretation,and found not arbitrary and capricious the agency decision that federal involvement was not necessary.
we determine whether to afford chevron deference to an agency interpretation of a statute under a analysis.first,we consider whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,nat.res.def.council,d.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter.id.only if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,do we go to step two,which considers whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
we start,as always,with the language of the statute.williams taylor,d.section h of the act provides that a council shall prepare an fmp for a fishery under its authority that requires conservation and management.the government concedes that cook inlet is a fishery under its authority that requires conservation and management.but it argues that an fmp is only mandated by the act when federal conservation and management is required.thus,the government asks us to insert the word federal into h before the phrase conservation and management.
w e ordinarily resist reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face,bates united states,d,and the government never persuasively explains why we should deviate from that rule here.see pac.coast fed of fishermen ass ns blank,cir.rejecting a reading of the act which requires inserting the word only or solely into subsection c see also stanton.assocs.lohrey,cir.stating that courts lack power to read into the statute words not explicitly inserted by congress.in arguing that we should insert the word federal into h,the government relies heavily on what it calls the deferral provision of the act,a a i,which allows a state to regulate vessels in federal waters when no fmp exists.the government argues that this provision assumes that nmfs can cede regulatory authority to a state over federal waters that require conservation and management simply by declining to issue an fmp.but,a a i does not create an exception to the general obligation to issue an fmp when a fishery requires conservation and management rather,the provision only restates the longstanding principle that a state can regulate vessels registered under its laws in federal waters absent federal law to the contrary.this principle dates at least to.see act a no state may directly or indirectly regulate any fishing which is engaged in by any fishing vessel outside its boundaries,unless such vessel is registered under the laws of such state.
the amendment to the act did not expand that traditional state authority,but rather limited state jurisdiction over vessels
