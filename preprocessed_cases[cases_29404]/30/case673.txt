this case concerns defendant appellee fish and wildlife service fws decision to enter into a memorandum of agreement moa with several entities who were subject to a nevada state order mandating a groundwater pump test.fws anticipated that the pump test may affect an endangered species,the moapa dace,and worked with the parties to obtain an agreement to implement a variety of conservation measures in advance of the groundwater pump test.fws conducted a formal consultation under the endangered species act esa,et,and determined in a biological opinion biop that fws execution of the moa would not jeopardize the moapa dace.plaintiff appellant center for biological diversity cbd challenged the biop and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of fws and intervenors defendants appellees southern nevada water authority snwa and coyote springs investment,llc csi.
in this opinion,we resolve a challenge by fws and intervenors to cbd standing.because we conclude that cbd does have standing,we also resolve cbd claims that the biop was arbitrary and capricious because it unlawfully relies on conservation measures that are inadequate and unenforceable it was not based on the best available scientific information and it failed to evaluate all foreseeable consequences of the proposed action.we reject cbd challenges to the biop and affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
background 
a.the statutory scheme 
the esa is a comprehensive scheme with the broad purpose of protecting endangered and threatened species.ctr.for biological diversity bureau of land,cir hereinafter blm citation and internal quotation marks omitted.this case centers on two provisions central to the esa protections section,which imposes a blanket prohibition on the take of any endangered species a b,and section,which imposes an affirmative duty to prevent violations of section upon federal agencies.cattle growers ass fws,cir citing a.
section a of the esa requires every federal agency to insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat of such species.a a.to achieve this substantive requirement,section and its implementing regulations impose specific procedural duties on federal agencies.each federal agency shall review its actions at the earliest possible time to determine whether any action may affect listed species or critical habitats.a.if the agency determines that its action may affect a listed species or habitat,it must engage in informal or formal consultation with the secretary of the interior or his designee in this case,fws san luis delta mendota water auth.jewell,cir see also a.if informal consultation results in a written agreement between the action agency and the consultation agency that the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect any endangered or threatened species,no further action is necessary.b.however,if at any point fws concludes that the proposed action is likely to adversely affect a listed species or critical habitat,formal consultation is required.jewell,at.
during formal consultation,the fws is obligated to use the best scientific and commercial data available,a,to evaluate the effects of the proposed action on the survival of the species and any potential destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.wildlife fed marine fisheries,cir citing b.at the conclusion of the formal consultation process,fws must provide a biological opinion setting forth a summary of the information on which the opinion is based,a detailed discussion of the effects of the agency action on the listed species,and an opinion as to whether the proposed agency action,taken together with cumulative effects,is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.b a g,h.if jeopardy is found,fws shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which it believes would not violate a and can be taken by the applicant in implementing the agency action.b b a.if it is determined that neither jeopardy nor adverse modification is likely,fws can issue an incidental take statement which,if followed,exempts the action agency from the prohibition on takings found in section of the esa.wildlife fed n,at footnote omitted b.
b.the moapa dace 
the moapa dace is a small,thermophilic fish found only in the muddy river,and particularly in the warmer waters of the upper springs and tributaries of the warm springs area in southeastern nevada.biop at.reproduction occurs and is confined to the upper,tributaries where water temperatures vary from to degrees fahrenheit.id.at.juveniles are found almost exclusively in the tributaries,whereas adults,who have the greatest tolerance to cooler water temperatures,are also found in the mainstream of the muddy river.id.
the moapa dace,a member of the north american minnow family,cyprinidae,was listed as endangered under the endangered species preservation act of on march,and has been protected by the esa since its inception in.native fish wildlife.though critical habitat has not been designated for the species,fws has assigned the moapa dace the highest recovery priority because it is the only species in the genus moapa,there is high degree of threat to its continued existence,and there is a high potential for its recovery.biop at.primary threats to the dace include fishes,parasites,habitat loss from water diversions and impoundments,fire due to encroaching plant species,and reductions to surface resulting from groundwater development,which reduces spawning,nursery habitats,and the food base for the dace.id.at.
in,acres of springs and wetlands located in the warm springs area of the upper moapa valley were designated as the moapa valley national wildlife refuge mvnwr for the protection of the endangered moapa dace.id.at.the thermal headwaters of the springs on the mvnwr are some of the most productive moapa dace spawning habitat in the area.id.at.the mvnwr consists of three units encompassing the major spring groups the pedersen unit,the plummer unit,and the apcar unit also known as jones spring.id.in,it was estimated that throughout the approximately miles of habitat in the upper muddy river system,the population of dace was about.id.at.approximately of this total population occurs within one major tributary that includes miles of spring complexes that emanate from the three major spring groups and their tributaries.id.about percent of the moapa dace population was located on the mvnwr,while approximately percent occupied the refuge stream,which is supplied by the spring complexes emanating from the mvnwr.id.the refuge stream reach accounted for the highest density of moapa dace,with the plummer,pedersen,and apcar units containing the second,third,and fourth highest densities,respectively id.at.
c.the parties,their water rights,and the state order 
cbd is a corporation actively involved in species and habitat protection issues throughout north america and the pacific.its members and staff live,work,visit,and recreate in areas of nevada that serve as moapa dace habitat.
fws is a federal agency that is part of the department of the interior.its responsibilities include implementing the esa and administering the national wildlife refuge system.pursuant to permit,fws owns a nevada state water right certificate the fws water right for a flow rate of not less than cubic feet per second cfs as measured at the warm springs west flume for maintenance of the habitat of the moapa dace and other wildlife purposes.the priority date for the fws water right is august.
several entities own permitted water rights with appropriation priorities senior to the fws water right.snwa is a political subdivision of the state of nevada,which owns acre feet per year afy of water rights the snwa water rights with points of diversion within the coyote spring valley hydrographic basin under permit,and.csi is a private landowner that owns afy of water rights the csi water rights with points of diversion within the coyote spring valley hydrographic basin under permit and.the moapa band of paiute indians the tribe owns afy of water rights the tribe water rights with a diversion rate of cfs within the california wash hydrographic pursuant to permit.
on march,the nevada state engineer issued order,which held in abeyance all applications for additional groundwater appropriation from coyote spring valley pending a study of the impacts of pumping groundwater pursuant to water rights.in particular,the state engineer ordered that several entities owning water rights in the area,including snwa,csi,and the moapa valley water district mvwd engage in a minimum study during which at least of the water rights currently permitted in the coyote springs valley groundwater basin are pumped for at least consecutive years.pump test participants were required to provide data on a quarterly basis regarding the rate of water diversion,as well as a report on impacts to groundwater and surface water resources upon conclusion of the study 
d.the memorandum of agreement 
prior to and after the issuance of order,fws was concerned that groundwater pumping in arrow canyon by mvwd,in the coyote springs valley hydrographic basin by snwa and csi,and in the california wash hydrographic basin by the tribe,was causing or would cause spring flows to decline in the warm springs area,creating potentially negative effects for the moapa dace.in,fws began meeting with the various holders to identify conservation measures to aid moapa dace survival in light of the anticipated pump test.on april,fws,snwa,csi,mvwd,and the tribe executed the moa at issue in this case,based on their share d common interest in the conservation and recovery of the moapa dace and its habitat,as well as in each signatory right to the use and enjoyment of its water rights and entitlements.in furtherance of this common interest,the moa contains a variety of monitoring,management and conservation measures,which can loosely be grouped into two categories measures designed to reduce pumping and dedicate water rights for moapa dace conservation and measures designed to restore and improve moapa dace habitat.
in the first category of conservation measures,the moa signatories agreed that mvwd jones water right will be dedicated to maintaining flows in the apcar stream afy of the csi water rights,plus of any future water rights obtained by csi,will be dedicated to the survival and recovery of the moapa dace and its habitat and pumping would be slowed or ceased at various sites if water flow,as measured at the warm springs west flume,fell below certain trigger ranges.in the second category of conservation measures,the moa signatories agreed to provide funding for moapa dace habitat restoration and recovery measures,including from snwa to restore moapa dace habitat on the apcar unit from both fws and snwa to investigate effects of habitat change on the ecology of the moapa dace from snwa to construct fish barriers to help eliminate predatory fish from moapa dace habitat from snwa to implement programs to eradicate fish in the warm springs area and per year for four years from csi to fws for restoration of moapa dace habitat outside the boundaries of the mvnwr.the parties additionally agreed to establish a recovery implementation program rip to identify,prioritize,and fund measures designed to protect the moapa dace and facilitate its recovery to establish a hydrologic review team to coordinate and ensure accuracy in monitoring and data collection that a portion of the tribe greenhouse facility would be dedicated to cultivating native vegetation for use in habitat restoration that the tribe would permit access to its reservation for the construction of at least one fish barrier to identify and obtain additional land and water rights to aid in moapa dace recovery and to cooperate in carrying out additional activities targeted at recovery of the moapa dace as further data becomes available.the moa also provided that,so long as all parties were in compliance with the moa terms,fws would not assert injury to the fws water rights unless flow rates at the warm springs west flume fell below cfs.outside of fws agreement in this regard,the moa explicitly does not waive any of the authorities or duties of any of the parties from complying with any federal laws,including the esa,nor does it waive any obligation by fws to consult or under the esa.
the moa provides that the parties desire that fws engage in consultation and prepare a formal biological opinion under esa prior to execution of the moa.although the moa neither authorizes nor approves any groundwater pumping,it nonetheless states that fws consultation shall consider the effects on the moapa dace from the pumping of afy under the shwa water rights,afy under the csi water rights,and afy by the tribe together with the implementation of the monitoring,management and conservation measures identified in the moa.
e.the fws programmatic biop 
on january,fws issued a document entitled intra service programmatic biop for the proposed muddy river memorandum of agreement regarding the groundwater withdrawal of acre feet per year from the regional carbonate aquifer in coyote spring valley and california wash basins,and establish conservation measures for the moapa dace,clark county,nevada the biop.the biop provides 
this biological opinion evaluates,as the proposed action,the execution of the moa by fws.none of the activities included in the moa will be implemented absent project or activity specific consultations.since the moa contemplates future groundwater development of up to afy,this total withdrawal and the potential effects to the moapa dace are evaluated in this biological opinion.as part of the proposed action,the following biological opinion will evaluate the effects of the cumulative groundwater withdrawal of afy from two basins within the regional carbonate aquifer to the federally listed as endangered moapa dace at a programmatic level in light of the conservation measures proposed in the moa.
due to the number of impending actions by different entities included in the proposed action,fws employed a approach in preparing its biop.id.at.thus,the required consultation was intended to take place in two stages the first stage the january,biop would evaluate effects,while a series of later biops would result in the completion of documentation that addresses the specific effects of each individual project.id.at.under this approach,consultations performed for specific action items in the moa would tier to the document by incorporating portions of it by reference.id.at thus each action has its own individual consultation document that is supported by the programmatic document.noting that signatories to the moa have proposed various actions to offset effects of groundwater pumping to the moapa dace the biop provides that it will only evaluate the effects of the moa cumulative groundwater withdrawal of afy and their minimization measures to the endangered moapa dace.biop at.
consistent with its stated approach,the biop analyzes anticipated effects on the moapa dace from the cumulative withdrawal of afy from the coyote spring valley and the california wash,finding that the moapa dace will be directly affected by the proposed groundwater withdrawals since those actions are likely to affect the spring flows upon which the dace depends.id.at.among other things,the biop opines that,if inflow at the warm springs gauge drops to cfs due to groundwater pumping,the result could be loss of spawning habitat at the important pedersen unit,though much of the available spawning habitat on the plummer and apcar units,and the refuge stream would not be as affected by groundwater pumping since they are lower in elevation and would continue to provide adequate spawning habitat.id.at.additionally,reductions in temperature from loss of flow in the pedersen unit could also extend downstream and further impact moapa dace by restricting its reproductive potential and make it more vulnerable to catastrophic events such as wildfire.id.
the biop next analyzes the anticipated effectiveness of the conservation measures in the moa,noting that such measures include the removal of fishes,enhancing,and restoring habitat and restoring instream flows apcar unit to increase the amount of habitat available for use by all life stages of the species.id.at.the biop predicts that the moa conservation measures will,among other things,increase thermal habitat and the reproductive potential of the species in the apcar and refuge streams,reduce potential for fire and restore the overall spawning and rearing habitat sufficient to sustain several hundred moapa dace on the apcar unit of the mvnwr,provide more secure habitat should water flows decline from groundwater development activities in the future,improve habitat throughout the range of the species,reduce the species vulnerability to catastrophic events,and expan d the species within its range and increase its current population size.id.at see also id.at the overall expected outcome of these measures is an increase in the species distribution and abundance throughout the range of the species.the biop explains that since the moa provides that most of the conservation measures would be implemented before significant groundwater pumping was to occur,the moapa dace population would likely respond positively,increasing in its distribution and abundance above current conditions.therefore,the conservation benefits to the species would be realized prior to and would the effect of groundwater development.id.at.
in conclusion,the biop states as follows it is fws biological opinion that fws becoming signatory to the moa,as proposed and analyzed,is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the endangered moapa dace.id.at.regarding an incidental take statement its,the biop provides 
no exemption from section of the act is issued through this biological opinion.the cumulative withdrawal of afy from coyote spring valley and california wash is likely to adversely affect listed species.however,the proposed action of signing the moa,in and of itself,does not result in the pumping of any groundwater,and is one of many steps in the planning process for proposed groundwater withdrawal projects identified in the moa and in the action area.therefore,the service has taken a approach in an attempt to analyz e the effects of the action.this programmatic biological opinion does not authorize any incidental take for programmatic impacts associated with the activities included in the moa.the likelihood of incidental take,and the identification of reasonable and prudent measures and terms and conditions to minimize such take,is anticipated to be addressed in future consultations second stage.these would incorporate conservation measures outlined in the moa at the specific project level.any incidental take and measures to reduce such can not be effectively identified at the programmatic level of the proposed action because of the number of impending actions by different entities and its regional scope.incidental take and reasonable and prudent measures may be identified adequately through subsequent actions subject to section consultation,and tiered to this programmatic biological opinion.future projects that are in the description of the proposed action section and identified in the moa would require additional section consultation second stage that would be tiered to this programmatic biological opinion.
proceedings in district court 
on august,cbd filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against fws and sally jewell asserting claims under of the esa,the national environment policy act,the national wildlife refuge system improvement act,and the constitution property clause.snwa and csi intervened in the action.on september,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on all of cbd claims,concluding that w hether the action fails for lack of standing or for lack of merit,the actions simply may not stand because cbd challenges an agreement designed to aid,not harm,the moapa dace.
cbd appeals only the district court grant of summary judgment on its esa claim.in particular,cbd maintains that fws biop violated of the esa by failing to ensure against jeopardizing the continued existence of the moapa dace failing to consider the best available scientific information and failing to evaluate all consequences of the action it purports to review.

iii.discussion 
fws,shwa,and csi challenge our jurisdiction to hear the present appeal,arguing that cbd lacks standing.as the plaintiff in the underlying action,cbd has the burden of proving the existence of article iii standing at all stages of the litigation.see org.for women,scheidler,d.to fulfill this obligation,cbd must demonstrate the existence of an that is concrete and particularized,and actual or imminent the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct and the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable court decision.salmon spawning recovery alliance gutierrez,cir citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
to satisfy the requirement of article iii,a plaintiff asserting a procedural injury must show that the procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of his that is the ultimate basis of his standing.salmon spawning,at quoting citizens for better forestry dep t of,cir.here,cbd alleges that its members have scientific,aesthetic,personal,spiritual and interests in the continued survival of the moapa dace and other species with habitats in the mvnwr.they are concerned that if the moapa dace population is imperiled or permitted to decline,these interests will be harmed.we have previously held that the consultation procedures of esa are designed to protect concrete interests such as those asserted by cbd by advanc ing the esa overall goal of species preservation,and thus the groups specific goals as to species preservation,by ensuring agency compliance with the esa substantive provisions.salmon spawning,at see also lujan,u.at of course,the desire to use or observe an animal species,even for purely esthetic purposes,is undeniably a cognizable interest for purpose s of standing.
while appellees do not dispute that cbd has alleged an,they argue that causation and redressability are lacking.specifically,appellees assert that any threat to the moapa dace survival is caused exclusively by entities pumping groundwater pursuant to a pump test order,not by the conservation measures in the moa,which were designed to protect the species.as to redressability,appellees claim that cbd injury is not redressable because the pump test,and its correspondent negative effects on the moapa dace,could continue unabated even if the biop and moa were vacated.
a showing of procedural injury lessens a plaintiff burden on the last two prongs of the article iii standing inquiry,causation and redressibility.salmon spawning,at citing lujan,at.thus,because cbd is asserting a procedural injury,it must show only that it has a procedural right that,if exercised,could protect its concrete interests.id.emphasis in original quoting defenders of wildlife epa,cir.plaintiffs alleging procedural injury can often establish redressibility with little difficulty,because they need to show only that the relief requested that the agency follow the correct procedures may influence the agency ultimate decision of whether to take or refrain from taking a certain action.this is not a high bar to meet.id.at internal citation omitted.nonetheless,the redressibility requirement is not toothless in procedural injury cases.id.at.
while we agree that groundwater pumping is an ultimate cause of cbd injury,cbd more broadly claims that a legally deficient biop caused fws to execute an moa that contained inadequate conservation,monitoring,and mitigation measures to ensure the continued existence of the moapa dace in the face of such groundwater pumping.cbd contends its injury is redressable because if the biop and moa are vacated,fws would be obligated to reinitiate consultation.according to cbd,this consultation,if conducted in compliance with the esa procedures here challenged,may influence fws ultimate decision as to whether to participate in the moa,and on what terms.moreover,cbd contends that the moa federalizes groundwater withdrawals by parties and that those withdrawals harm the moapa dace and its members interests in the species.we agree with cbd that it has sufficiently demonstrated standing under these circumstances.see natural res.def.council jewell,cir en banc because plaintiffs allege a procedural violation under section of the esa,they need only show that,if the bureau engages in adequate consultation,the dmc contracts could better protect plaintiffs concrete interest in the delta smelt than the contracts do currently.alliance for the wild rockies dep t of,cir concluding that an environmental group had standing to challenge federal agencies approval of helicopter flights that might harass yellowstone grizzly bears.
challenges to the biop 
enforceability of conservation measures 
cbd contends that the moa fails to ensure against jeopardy to the moapa dace because the conservation measures outlined in the agreement are not enforceable under the esa.during formal consultation,fws is required,among other things,to e valuate the effects of the action and cumulative effects on the listed species,and f ormulate its biological opinion as to whether the action,taken together with cumulative effects,is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species.g.an action refers to all activities and programs carried out,in whole or in part,by federal agencies in the united states,whereas the e ffects of the action refers to the direct and indirect effects of an action on the species or critical habitat,together with the effects of other activities that are interrelated or interdependent with that action.id.interrelated actions are those that are part of a larger action and depend on the larger action for their justification.id.interrelated actions include conservation measures,which the esa handbook defines as actions to benefit or promote the recovery of listed species.blm,at.cumulative effects are those effects of future state or private activities,not involving federal activities,that are reasonably certain to occur within the action area of the federal action subject to consultation.
in blm,we held that the esa statutory scheme requires that a conservation agreement entered into by the action agency to mitigate the impact of a contemplated action on listed species must be enforceable under the esa to factor into a biological opinion jeopardy determination.blm,at.in that case,ruby pipeline ruby sought a to build a gas pipeline that would cross several thousand acres of federal land supporting numerous endangered and threatened fish species.id.at.fws analysis of the pipeline project determined it would adversely affect multiple endangered species and critical habitats.id.fws then evaluated several voluntary conservation actions ruby had indicated it would facilitate implementing,which were contained in a conservation action plan the cap measures.id.at.although the cap measures contained no binding time line for implementation and were expressly not incorporated into the pipeline project plan fws deemed them cumulative effects that were reasonably certain to occur and found that they would eventually contribute to the conservation and recovery of these fishes.id.in reliance on the cap measures,fws concluded that the pipeline project was not likely to jeopardize the continued existence or adversely modify or destroy designated critical habitat of listed species and it issued an its exempting the take of certain species from liability under esa.id.at.
we concluded that the cap measures were not cumulative effects instead,they were unequivocally interrelated to the pipeline project in that the promises regarding the conservation measures were dependant on approval of the project.id.at.in fact,the cap measures fit squarely within the definition of conservation measures in the esa handbook.id.at.since interrelated actions are,by definition,part of the effects of the action,we set aside the biological opinion as arbitrary and capricious 
m iscategorizing mitigation measures as cumulative effects rather than conservation measures incorporated in the proposed project profoundly affects the esa scheme.any such miscategorization sidetracks the fws,the primary esa enforcement agency precludes reopening the consultation process when promised conservation measures do not occur and eliminates the possibility of criminal penalties and exposure to citizen suit enforcement incorporated in the esa to assure that listed species are protected 
severing the conservation action plan measures from the proposed action and instead treating their anticipated benefits as cumulative effects of independent origin insulated the action agencies from consultation requirements under section,and ruby from the esa penalties for unlawful take under section in the event that the measures never materialized.
the biological opinion therefore unreasonably relied on the cap measures as cumulative effects and took them into account in the jeopardy determination,when reliance on them would have been proper only if they were included as part of the project and so subject to the esa consultation and enforcement provisions.
the present case is plainly distinguishable from blm.here,the conservation measures in the moa are not only included as part of the project consulted upon they actually are the project consulted upon.indeed,pursuant to the esa regulations,the only activity reviewed in the biop that even arguably qualifies as an action is fws becoming signatory to the moa.see action means all activities or programs of any kind authorized,funded,or carried out,in whole or in part,by federal agencies in the united states examples include,but are not limited to a actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat.moreover,the biop expressly provides that reinitiation of formal consultation is required where there is a failure to meet any of the measures or stipulations in the moa.biop at.thus,this is simply not a case where there is no esa recourse whatsoever if a party fails to implement its promised conservation actions.see blm,at.under these circumstances,it is apparent that the moa is enforceable under the esa,as required by blm id.at.
in applying blm to the present case,we also reject cbd unsupported assertions that fws federalized the groundwater extraction and made it a part of the action consulted upon merely by entering into an moa in an attempt to proactively offset potential negative effects to the moapa dace from groundwater pumping.the pump test does not fit within the definition of action because it is not authorized,funded,or carried out,in whole or in part,by federal agencies in the united states.because the groundwater pumping is not an action,as defined by the esa,its negative effects on the moapa dace are not considered effects of the action because they are not direct or indirect effects of an action on the species.id.emphasis added.
the negative effects of groundwater pumping also do not qualify as effects of the action by virtue of being interrelated or interdependent with the action.indeed,the record does not support a conclusion that would satisfy the but for test of interrelatedness,but for the federal project execution of the moa these activities groundwater pumping would not occur.blm,at quoting sierra club marsh,cir interrelated actions are those that are part of a larger action and depend on the larger action for their justification.neither is there any evidence that the groundwater pumping has no independent utility apart from the action under consideration,as required to be interdependent.it appears then,perhaps somewhat ironically in light of cbd reliance on blm,that the effects of groundwater pumping are best characterized as cumulative effects,they are effects of future state or private activities,not involving federal action,that are reasonably certain to occur within the action area of the federal action subject to consultation.id.
best available science 
the esa requires an agency to use the best scientific and commercial data available when formulating a biop.a g.this standard does not require the agency to conduct new tests or make decisions on data that does not yet exist.san luis delta mendota water authority locke,cir citing am.wildlands kempthorne.rather,t he best available data requirement merely prohibits an agency from disregarding available scientific evidence that is in some way better than the evidence it relies on.kern cnty.farm bureau allen,cir quoting sw.ctr.for biological diversity babbitt,see also locke,at moreover,if the only available data is weak,and thus not dispositive,an agency reliance on such data does not render the agency determination arbitrary and capricious quotations and citations omitted.an agency complies with the best available science standard so long as it does not ignore available studies,even if it disagrees with or discredits them.locke,at kern,at essentially,fws can not ignore available biological information.quoting conner burford,cir.
cbd argues that the biop fails to satisfy the best science requirement because fws has conceded that the conservation measures flow reduction trigger scheme the foundation for the biop no jeopardy finding is based not on science but on expediency.in support of this claim,cbd cites a statement by fws office field supervisor bob williams that the flow reduction triggers in the moa were negotiated,not biologically based,and believed to be reasonable for the purpose of the affects to the species.we reject this argument because it fails to differentiate between fws role as the action agency and fws role as the consulting agency.the esa does not require that a federal agency design or plan its projects using the best science possible.rather,the esa requires that,once a federal action is submitted for formal consultation,the consulting agency must use the best scientific and commercial evidence available in analyzing the potential effects of that action on endangered species in its biological opinion.see a.thus,cbd objection that the terms of the moa were negotiated simply can not support a conclusion that the biop analysis of those terms failed to satisfy the requirements of the esa.see,selkirk conservation alliance forsgren,cir holding that fws did not violate its duty to rely on the best scientific data available when it concluded that negotiated conservation terms would sufficiently mitigate expected harm to a species.
effectiveness of conservation measures 
cbd argues that the biop is arbitrary and capricious because the record does not support a conclusion that the moa conservation measures are effective or adequate to insure against jeopardy to the moapa dace.cbd also asserts that we owe no deference to the biop conclusions because fws failed to address its own scientists unanswered and uncontroverted concerns regarding the effectiveness of the moa conservation measures in avoiding jeopardy to the moapa dace before conducting our analysis,we briefly recount cbd criticisms of the biop no jeopardy conclusion.
first,cbd criticizes the moa flow triggers,and particularly the lowest cfs flow trigger,which if reached,requires the moa signatories to reduce pumping in the coyote spring valley and the california wash to afy and afy,respectively.cbd points out that in a separate consultation relating to construction of a pipeline the pipeline project in the mvnwr,fws hydrologist tim mayer expressed strong doubt about whether even a higher cfs minimum flow threshold would adequately protect the moapa dace or support a determination,stating biologically,do the flows proposed by snwa protect the dace does it support a opinion we have no evidence that they do,since they have not been that low previously.our proposed flows of cfs seek to protect existing conditions so we assume that it wo jeopardize the species.cbd also points out that the fws water right was already being impacted by groundwater pumping,and that even the intermediate flow triggers of the moa,ranging from to cfs,permit more groundwater to be pumped than was pumped prior to the moa.
cbd second critique of the biop is that it assumes,without any support,that reducing or halting groundwater pumping will address any observed decline in spring flows.according to cbd,this conclusion is the linchpin of the biop no jeopardy conclusion because if moapa dace habitat will continue to be lost after the cessation of groundwater pumping,the conservation measures of the moa are ineffective.cbd points to three draft comments by fws scientists in this regard that it claims were not addressed in the final biop.first,hydrologist tim mayer stated i do want to be put in a position of saying that the flows are going to stop declining at cfs this seems to be the conclusion of our bo and our basis for the although the hydrological analysis does say anything like that.second,mayer stated in a comment on the pipeline project that stopping pumping at cfs does mean the flow reductions cease springs may continue to decline even without pumping.third,rick wadell,whose position with fws is unclear,stated in comments to the biop that i mpacts to the dace population may occur more rapidly than the water supply can be.
finally,cbd urges that the other conservation measures of the moa,those unrelated to flow triggers,are of limited effectiveness in avoiding loss of high quality moapa dace habitat in the higher elevation pedersen unit spring complex.for instance,one fws scientist expressed concern that mvwd dedication of cfs to the apcar unit was being oversold.another fws scientist noted that it was unclear how csi dedicating afy would benefit the dace unless it could be transferred to rights for dace the small reduction in pumping from carbonates that this dedication might represent would only delay the impact a short time.
a.the biop did not ignore the concerns of fws scientists 
we disagree with cbd assertion that the biop fails to address or assuage mayer concerns that even a cfs flow rate would be insufficient to protect the moapa dace.the comment itself makes clear that fws did not possess definitive data supporting a conclusion on the matter either way,given that flow levels have never actually fallen so low.see locke,at stating that the best science requirement does not require an agency to conduct new tests or make decisions on data that does not yet exist.in light of this lack of data,fws projected the likely effects of a cfs flow rate on moapa dace habitat by providing an exte
