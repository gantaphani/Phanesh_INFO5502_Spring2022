in the late,congress declared it a national goal to improve air visibility in federal parks and forests.a see also et listing all national parks,national monuments,and wilderness areas congress sought to protect.to achieve that goal,congress sought to reduce emissions of various pollutants through a new regulatory scheme codified in section of the clean air act caa.b.that scheme required each state with emissions impacting protected federal lands to create a state implementation plan sip describing how the state intended to make reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal.id.a,b.if the state submitted either a deficient sip or none at all,the caa required the epa to promulgate its own plan called a federal implementation plan fip to force compliance with congress mandate.id.c.
this extensive litigation arose when arizona a state containing twelve wilderness areas subject to section,see clashed with the epa over its sip submitted in.although the sip listed proposals to manage and reduce emissions from various industrial sources operated within the state,the epa determined that arizona could do better in improving visibility.the epa disapproved certain aspects of arizona sip and issued its own fip that imposed enhanced measures.
the epa actions spawned a series of legal challenges from arizona and several private companies subject to epa regulation collectively,petitioners.we have rejected most of those challenges in two prior decisions,concluding that the epa acted within its authority when it disapproved portions of arizona sip that it deemed problematic.arizona ex rel.darwin epa arizona i,cir.phoenix cement epa,cir.all that remains before us now are petitioners objections to several sections of the epa most recent fip those issued to replace certain rejected portions of arizona sip which petitioners claim constitute invalid agency action.
we hold that several of petitioners objections to the fip are not properly before us because they were not first presented to the epa during the period.see d b only an objection to a rule or procedure which was raised with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment including any public hearing may be raised during judicial review.as to the remaining objections that are ripe for our consideration,we conclude that the epa measures are not arbitrary or capricious and thus constitute valid agency rulemaking.accordingly,we dismiss in part and deny in part the consolidated petitions for review 
regulatory background 
in the twentieth century,our nation experienced a significant degradation of visibility in its most treasured wilderness areas.see regional haze regulations,fed.reg,july.the air pollution,congress found,was primarily due to the emission of sulfur dioxide,oxides of nitrogen,and particulate matter from poorly regulated industrial sources.id.citing,at.to tackle the problem,congress adopted section of the caa,and the epa promulgated implementing regulations to require states to improve visibility by adopting certain emission controls.b.two categories of such emission controls are relevant to the issues before us best available retrofit technology bart and what the epa sometimes refers to as reasonable progress rp controls.b a b,g f promulgation of air quality implementation plans arizona regional haze and interstate visibility transport federal implementation plan,fed.reg,hereinafter final fip.
best available retrofit technology 
bart is a term of art used to describe technology that can be installed on an industrial source to control its emissions or make those emissions cleaner.b a,g.congress directed bart to be implemented on older stationary sources that emit any air pollutant which may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility in protected federal lands.id.b a see also defining a source as an existing stationary facility built between and that has the potential to emit tons per year or more of any air pollutant.if there are such sources within a regulated state,the state must not only submit an implementation plan containing emission limitations representing bart,e,but do so for each pollutant those sources emit,id.
in determining the appropriate bart to install,states must engage in a analysis by balancing five factors the costs of compliance,the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of compliance,any existing pollution control technology in use at the source,the remaining useful life of the source,and the degree of improvement in visibility which may reasonably be anticipated to result from the use of such technology.g.because the balancing is source specific,it could lead a state to adopt stringent bart regulations,none at all,or something in between.see final fip,fed.reg.at recognizing that analyses could reasonably lead to various degrees of bart regulations.if the epa is dissatisfied with a state bart determination,it can issue a fip containing its own analysis in accordance with section.c.
reasonable progress controls 
similar to bart,rp controls serve to limit emissions of harmful pollutants that degrade visibility in protected wilderness areas.although rp controls,as such,are not mentioned in section,they are an outgrowth of congress mandate to make reasonable progress toward meeting the national visibility goal.b.the epa has construed that mandate as requiring each regulated state to establish reasonable progress goals rpgs that depend on how much of that state current haze would have to be eliminated each year to achieve natural,pristine conditions by the year.d i b.if a state believes that it is unable to conform with the reduction rate or the glidepath,as it is known in regulatory nomenclature its sip must explain why achieving the rate is not reasonable,while its proposed rpgs are.id.d ii 
after a state calculates its rpgs,it must determine whether to implement rp controls to reach those rpgs.see id.d.in making that determination,the state may take into account existing control measures including bart as well as the visibility impact of controls established through other programs under the caa.see id.d.if the existing control measures do not cut it,the state must consider four factors to determine whether additional measures are warranted the costs of compliance,the time necessary for compliance,and the energy and quality environmental impacts of compliance,and the remaining useful life of any existing source subject to such requirements.g see also d i a.should a state fail to conduct an accurate balancing,the epa can correct the state errors in a fip.d v see also c.
one characteristic of rp controls is worth emphasizing they apply not just to some but to all stationary sources that impede reasonable progress.take,for instance,a cement kiln emitting sulfur dioxide built in.although the kiln would not be subject to bart regulation because it was not in existence as of,see b a,it might nonetheless be required to adopt additional measures because limiting its pollution would help its home state achieve rpgs.in essence,then,rp controls fill a regulatory gap that would have existed if the epa were not able to regulate cement kilns,smelters,and other emission sources threatening to deteriorate visibility.
ii.procedural background 
in,arizona submitted a sip to the epa outlining its rpgs and describing the steps it intended to take to limit air pollution within its state.see arizona i,at.the epa deemed several portions of arizona sip inadequate and issued a fip to correct what it perceived to be arizona noncompliance with section and related regulations.id.at phoenix cement.at.because the validity of that fip is the primary issue in this action,we first outline the steps the epa took in preparing that document.
a.the proposed fip 
the portions of arizona sip that the epa rejected consisted of bart control analyses and determinations for multiple stationary sources,rpg analyses and determinations,and strategies for making reasonable progress.see promulgation of air quality implementation plans arizona regional haze and interstate visibility transport federal implementation plan proposed rules,fed.reg,hereinafter proposed fip.here is what the epa proposed,in relevant part,to replace those rejected sections 
reasonable progress goals 
in a short,narrative section,the epa proposed a set of rpgs consistent with a combination of control measures that include those in the approved portions of arizona sip as well as the proposed fip.id.at.the epa did not express those rpgs numerically,explaining that although it would prefer to quantify these proposed rpgs,it lacked sufficient time and resources to do so.id.at.instead,the epa simply noted that i n total,these final and proposed controls to meet the bart and rp requirements will result in higher emissions reductions and commensurate visibility improvements beyond what was in arizona plan.id.
calportland cement kiln 
the epa next considered whether calportland cement kiln should be subject to additional rp controls.id.at.although arizona had identified that kiln as a source that might contribute to visibility impairment,it failed to conduct the requisite analysis in its sip.see approval and disapproval of air quality state implementation plans arizona regional haze and interstate transport requirements,fed.reg,july.the epa therefore balanced the four factors itself and proposed that calportland install an technology called selective reduction sncr with a percent sncr.proposed fip,fed.reg.at.the epa sought comment,however,on whether a different sncr control efficiency is appropriate.id.at.
copper smelters 
the epa also discussed limiting emissions from petitioner asarco and,copper smelters.id.at.because both smelters are subject to bart controls,the epa considered whether to impose bart to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides an issue applicable to both smelters on this appeal as well as particulate matter and sulfur dioxide an issue applicable only to asarco smelter.id.at.since the epa had rejected arizona bart analysis,it engaged in its own balancing of the five factors listed in section.id.
here is what the epa proposed.as to nitrogen oxides emissions,the epa determined that the estimated level of visibility improvement from additional bart controls was not worth the cost.id.the epa therefore proposed only an annual emission limit of tons per year tpy which it found to be consistent with current emissions of nitrogen oxides from the smelters.id.at.such measures were presumably necessary to ensure that the copper smelters would not drastically increase their emissions beyond tpy after the fip were finalized.
as to particulate matter emissions,the epa proposed a similar scheme to regulate asarco smelter.id.because asarco had been already implementing bart to control those emissions in accordance with another program under the caa,the epa determined that it made most sense to set an emission limit consistent with that program.id.the epa therefore proposed to incorporate emission limitations and associated compliance requirements from the national emission standard for hazardous air pollutants neshap for primary copper smelting at cfr part,subpart qqq hereinafter subpart qqq.id.
finally,the epa addressed sulfur dioxide emissions from asarco smelter.the epa conducted the required analysis,considered available options,and proposed a technology a double contact acid plant that asarco had been already using.id.at.to determine what emission limit to impose,the epa relied on asarco written representation that its technology could capture percent of the sulfur dioxide vented to it.id.at.the epa thus proposed a control efficiency of about percent on a rolling average.id.at.
affirmative defense for malfunctions 
finally,the epa included an affirmative defense for malfunctions in the proposed regulations appended to the narrative section of the proposed fip.see id.at,proposing k,a regulation titled affirmative defense for malfunctions that incorporated certain provisions of arizona administrative code excusing excess emissions due to malfunctions at calportland kiln id.at,proposing l,a similar regulation excusing excess emissions due to malfunctions at asarco smelter.nowhere in its proposed fip did the epa mention that it was considering deleting this affirmative defense in the final fip.
b.the epa final fip 
after notice and comment,the epa promulgated its final fip that differed from the earlier proposal in several important respects.
reasonable progress goals 
in response to several comments criticizing the epa decision to express rpgs qualitatively rather than quantitatively,the epa reversed its course and promulgated a set of numerical goals.final fip,fed.reg.at.those new rpgs were then compared to the rpgs outlined in arizona rejected sip to devise something called a fip effect,or the increase in visibility between the effects of controls mandated by arizona sip and those promulgated by epa final fip.id.at.the fip effects at the various protected areas in arizona generally came in at about deciviews.id.
calportland cement kiln 
during the period,calportland objected to the proposed fip imposition of a percent control efficiency using sncr and asserted that only percent control efficiency may be achievable.id.at.the epa accepted calportland argument and agreed that percent reflects an appropriate estimate of the degree of control achievable with sncr at calportland kiln.id at.it therefore revised its proposed regulation and imposed a percent control efficiency.
copper smelters 
with a few tweaks,the final fip largely repeated the bart measures set forth in the proposed fip.as to nitrogen oxides emissions,the epa rejected arizona contention that facilities emitting fewer than tpy like asarco and copper smelters should be excluded from mandatory bart regulations under e ii c.see id.at.the epa explained that even though the smelters were not currently emitting more than tpy,there were no federally enforceable physical or operational limitations that would cap its ability to emit more than tpy in the future.id.at.if the rule were otherwise,the epa pointed out,emissions could increase to a level where additional controls would be warranted for bart,but no mechanism would exist to require such controls.id.at.
as to particulate matter emissions,the epa finalized its proposal to import limitations from subpart qqq.id.at.although asarco asserted that its particulate matter controls were not based on the requirements of subpart qqq,the epa quoted asarco direct statements to the contrary.id.given that asarco relied on the subpart qqq requirements,the epa reasoned,inclusion of these requirements in the fip was appropriate.id.at.
the epa was equally unpersuaded by asarco and arizona arguments against the proposed sulfur dioxide limitations.the concerns over the technical feasibility of the proposed double contact acid plant were unsubstantiated,the epa determined,because such a plant was already in use at asarco smelter and was therefore presumed to be an applicable technology.id.at.the epa did,however,revise the time period over which the control efficiency rate would be calculated,crediting asarco assertion that the figure it had provided to the epa could be achieved using only a rolling average rather than the average promulgated in the proposed fip.id.at.switching to the rolling average,the epa continued,would also alleviate asarco worry that the control efficiency figure would not allow sufficient breathing room for startup,shutdown,and malfunction,or ssm,occurrences.id.at.
affirmative defense for malfunctions 
the final fip eliminated the affirmative defense for excess emissions due to malfunctions that the epa had inserted into the proposed fip.id.at.the epa recognized that it did not receive any comments about the inclusion of an affirmative defense,but explained that a recent circuit opinion in natural resources defense council epa,cir,ma de it clear that the caa does not authorize promulgation of an affirmative defense provision by epa.id.the epa noted that the court did not address whether such an affirmative defense provision could be properly included in a sip,but nonetheless maintained that the logic of the court decision foreclosed the epa inclusion of the defense in its final fip.id.
after the epa promulgated the final fip,arizona,phoenix cement company,calportland,and asarco filed this consolidated appeal.
iii.standard of review 
we may invalidate the final fip if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.d.this familiar standard is,of course,highly deferential.a regulation should be deemed arbitrary and capricious in only limited circumstances,such as when 
t he agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.
motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto.ins.courts must be particularly careful in reviewing questions involving a high level of technical expertise because such matters are normally best left to the experience and judgment of the agency.parks conservation ass epa,cir.citation omitted see also baltimore gas nat.res.def.council,when examining an agency scientific determination,as opposed to simple findings of fact,a reviewing court must generally be at its most deferential.
when the challenge to a regulation is based on an alleged procedural error,our standard of review under the caa is even stricter.not only must the petitioners in such circumstances demonstrate that the rule was arbitrary or capricious,but also that the alleged procedural errors were so serious and related to matters of such central relevance that there is a substantial likelihood that the rule would have been significantly changed if such errors had not been made.d.
iv.discussion 
petitioners make a wide variety of contentions that challenge four aspects of the final fip the promulgation of numerical rpgs the imposition of sncr to control calportland cement kiln the emission limits regulating asarco and copper smelters and the decision to eliminate the affirmative defense for malfunctions as we discuss below,all arguments falling into the first and last of those categories are not properly before us because they have not been presented to the epa.and as to the remaining contentions,nothing about the epa regulations of the cement kilns and copper smelters was arbitrary or capricious.
judicial challenges to a fip must be first exhausted before the epa 
using perhaps the most unambiguous language possible,congress has limited judicial review of epa rules by requiring all potential petitioners to present their challenges first to the epa itself.d b.only an objection to a rule or procedure which was raised with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment,congress provided,may be raised during judicial review.id.i f the grounds for such an objection arose after the period for public comment but within the time specified for judicial review,and if such objection is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule,the epa shall convene a proceeding for reconsideration of the rule.id.and if the epa declines to do so,the potential petitioner may seek review of such refusal in the united states court of appeals for the appropriate circuit.id.
this congressional framework promotes regulatory efficiency by ensuring that the epa as the entity with greatest expertise in environmental matters takes the first shot at resolving all issues with its regulations.the potential efficiency gains are not merely theoretical,and one need not look further than this case to see why.one of the original issues the parties briefed and argued before us concerned certain demonstration requirements the epa imposed on phoenix cement and calportland.see supra note.although the issue was both difficult and technical,petitioners had not raised it to the epa during the period because the demonstration requirements were not mentioned anywhere in the proposed fip.fortunately,petitioners requested the epa to reconsider the rule,see d b,and the epa agreed to replace it with mutually acceptable regulations.see supra,note.by following the exhaustion rules and presenting their grievances to the entity most capable of resolving them,petitioners avoided wasting both our resources and their own.
but the same can not be said of two other claims petitioners make on this appeal.for the first of those claims,petitioners argue that the epa rpgs are arbitrary and capricious because arizona residents will directly or indirectly have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to improve air visibility by deciviews,an amount of improvement petitioners dub trivial.in their second claim,they assert that the epa decision to eliminate the affirmative defense for malfunctions was both procedurally and substantively invalid.we may not consider either of those claims under d b.nothing in the record indicates that petitioners have raised their arguments before the epa at all,let alone with the requisite reasonable specificity.see d b.
petitioners concede as much with respect to their claim seeking to reinstate the affirmative defense for malfunctions.indeed,petitioners must concede that they could not have protested in their comments on the proposed fip the epa decision to eliminate the affirmative defense provision from its proposal,because the epa removed it spontaneously.the epa had,in the proposed fip,proposed including the affirmative defense,not removing it,so it is no wonder that petitioners did not file comments objecting to its removal.nevertheless,the caa is clear the petitioners remedy is to explain to the epa that it was impracticable to raise such an objection and ask the epa to convene a proceeding for reconsideration of the rule.d b.
with respect to petitioners objections to the rpgs,petitioners claim that certain statements during the period put the epa on notice of their arguments.we find that assertion not only wrong but close to frivolous.it was simply not possible to point out any disparities between the costs and benefits of the final fip numerical rpgs during the period because no numerical rpgs were in existence at that time.commentators never made any argument but instead urged the epa to issue numerical rpgs in the first place.see final fip,fed.reg.at.that commentary on which petitioners now rely to avoid the exhaustion requirement could not have possibly apprised the epa of the claim petitioners now make.
faced with this reality,petitioners make two arguments one doctrinal,the other in an attempt to save their unexhausted claims from dismissal.neither of the arguments,however,has merit.first,petitioners rely on a line of cases from the circuit finding an exception to d b when a new argument challenges key assumptions underlying an epa rule.this exception is usually stated as follows 
e ven if a party may be deemed not to have raised a particular argument before the agency,epa retains a duty to examine key assumptions as part of its affirmative burden of promulgating and explaining a nonarbitrary,rule and therefore epa must justify that assumption even if no one objects to it during the comment period.
nat.res.def.council epa,cir.citation omitted.the asserted duty to examine key assumptions has no textual origin.it appears to be based on a statement by the circuit in a case that does not mention d b.see lime ass epa,cir.w e think an initial burden of promulgating and explaining a,rule rests with the agency see also small refiner lead task force epa,cir.establishing for what appears to be the first time the exception to d b based on the language in national lime 
we need not decide today whether to adopt the circuit exception to d b exhaustion requirement.for even if the exception were available,we would hold that striking a particular balance between costs and benefits of numerical rpgs can not be a key assumption underlying the final fip.as the circuit has explained,the primary purpose of d b is to ensure that the epa has an opportunity to consider a challenge to its regulations without being sandbag ged by litigants who wait until litigation before a court of appeals to make their arguments.dep t of envtl.quality epa,cir.whether a particular analysis results in an appropriate rpg concerns not a key assumption but a contest to the epa specific application of statutory precepts to a concrete situation.we hold that the issues petitioners have raised for the first time on this appeal are not so key that,assuming the circuit key assumption exception applies,they must have been anticipated by the epa.
petitioners next argue that it would be absurd if their claims,which are partially based on the epa failure to provide notice of the numerical rpgs,were barred under d b.if that were so,petitioners continue,the epa could promulgate a fip without the requisite period and then regulate unsuspecting parties while they scramble to file a request for reconsideration with the epa.see d b r econsideration shall not postpone the effectiveness of the rule.and although the effectiveness of the rule may be stayed for three months during such reconsideration,petitioners claim that it could be years until the epa acts on a reconsideration request.
petitioners pleas have some appeal.however,we can not ignore the unambiguous language of d b simply because it might sometimes lead to what we regard as suboptimal results.indeed,it is far from clear that congress intended to carve out a special exception for claims asserting a deficiency in the process.congress could have just as easily determined that the benefits from the exhaustion requirement,combined with the right to ask a court for a stay during the administrative reconsideration period,would outweigh the harm petitioners identify.such a conclusion would make sense,as the notice process itself can lead to changes from the proposed fip as to which there was no opportunity to comment.the epa is not limited to specific changes suggested by commenters,and one commenter does not necessarily have the opportunity or the resources to comment on every other commenter proposals.were the epa required to put out for every significant change from the proposed fip to the final fip,the process could go on forever.
the words of d b must be therefore read literally,as our sister circuits have concluded.see eme homer city generation,epa,cir.because petitioners argument is an objection to the notice and comment process itself,petitioners obviously did not and could not have raised it during the period for public comment.under subsection d b,however,the only appropriate path for petitioners to raise this issue is through an initial petition for reconsideration to epa.north dakota epa,cir.same oklahoma epa,cir.same.
in sum,we conclude that petitioners are barred from challenging in this appeal the numerical rpgs and the epa decision to jettison the affirmative defense for malfunction.to overcome this procedural bar,petitioners must first request the epa to reconsider its regulations under d b.we are barred from reviewing these issues in this proceeding and dismiss that portion of the petition.
epa regulation of the cement kiln and copper smelters is valid 
petitioners remaining contentions are a series of technical challenges to the emission controls imposed on the cement kiln and copper smelters involved in this action.according due deference to the epa,we see nothing arbitrary or capricious in its final regulations.
calportland cement kiln 
petitioners claim that the epa overstepped its authority in imposing the sncr controls on calportland cement kiln.the epa primary error,petitioners assert,was to deemphasize potential improvement in visibility when considering whether to implement an rp control using the balancing test of section.see g.if the epa had not committed that alleged error,petitioners continue,it would have realized that adopting sncr technology would only marginally advance rpgs.petitioners therefore urge us to deem the epa actions arbitrary or capricious.
we decline to do so.as required under section,the epa considered all four factors before promulgating the fip costs of compliance time necessary for compliance energy and quality environmental impacts of compliance and the remaining useful life of any potentially affected sources.final fip,fed.reg.at see b.although visibility improvement is not among the four factors,the epa took it into account anyway but did not weigh it as heavily as it would have in a bart analysis.final fip,fed.reg.at.although petitioners may not like that the epa accorded some factors greater weight than others,it is simply not our place to substitute our judgment for that of the epa.see cent.water conservation dist.epa,cir.petitioners essential argument does not claim that epa failed to consider the relevant factors,but instead contends that epa erred in its consideration of those factors.this court is not to substitute petitioners judgment,or its own,for that of epa,as long as the agency interpretation is reasonable.that is especially so here,where the caa calls for a functional balancing of technical and difficult considerations.see new york reilly,cir.because congress did not assign the specific weight the epa should accord each of these factors,the epa is free to exercise its discretion in this area.
equally dubious is petitioners contention that sncr technology is not necessary to achieve rpgs because it would purportedly improve visibility by only deciviews.but that is true only if we also take into account improvements from numerous other sources located in the same geographic area.see fed.reg.at.if the impact of the sncr technology at the calportland cement kiln were measured according to the epa model that disregards other polluting sources,the increase in visibility would be far more substantial,measuring at deciviews id.at.we do not view the epa use of its model to calculate the benefits of sncr as arbitrary or capricious but instead regard it as a permissible exercise of agency discretion within the proper bounds of the caa.see north dakota,at reaching the same result and crediting the epa assertion that the use of the petitioners model would rarely if ever demonstrate that emissions reductions at a single source will have an appreciable effect on incremental visibility improvement in a given area.
accordingly,we conclude that the epa acted within its authority in promulgating the sncr requirement and reject all of petitioners contentions to the contrary.
copper smelters 
petitioners final series of challenges concerns the epa regulation of asarco and copper smelters,which,unlike calportland cement kiln,are subject to bart.final fip,fed.reg.at.although the epa declined to impose additional control measures on the smelters after conducting the requisite analysis,see g,it did promulgate emission limits consistent with the facilities existing controls as to nitrogen oxides,particulate matter,and sulfur dioxides.petitioners now claim that those emission limits are arbitrary or capricious.
nitrogen oxides emissions 
the epa imposed a limit of tpy on the nitrogen oxides emissions from each smelter,which it deemed to be well above what the smelters currently emit.final fip,fed.reg.at.petitioners challenge that limitation on two grounds.they first argue that the tpy limit will not eliminat e or reduc e any visibility impairment,b a,because the smelters are already emitting fewer than tpy.and in any event,petitioners continue,the smelters should not even be subject to bart controls and limitations because the smelters current nitrogen oxides emissions are far below the deciview threshold the epa uses to determine whether bart controls are necessary.see proposed fip,fed.reg.at guidelines,fed.reg.at.we reject both of these contentions and regard the tpy limitation as a valid exercise of the epa regulatory authority.
petitioners first challenge is also their weakest.while it is true that the smelters currently emit fewer than tpy of nitrogen oxides,nothing prevents them from exceeding that threshold in the future.given that reality,the epa acted well within its authority to impose a cap of tpy to ensure that the smelters live up to their representations of keeping their nitrogen oxides emissions low.not only are such limitations a prudent way to limit visibility impairments in the long run,see b a,they are also required under the
