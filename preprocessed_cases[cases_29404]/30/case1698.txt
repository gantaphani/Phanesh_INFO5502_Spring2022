affordable housing advocates latinos unidos de napa plaintiff filed a petition for writ of mandate against the city of napa city,its city manager,and its community development director seeking to set aside the city approval of revisions to the housing element of its general plan,and related general plan and zoning amendments the project,on the ground that an environmental impact report eir for the project is required.the city had concluded the project would not result in any new significant environmental effects that were not identified and mitigated in its general plan program eir,and filed a notice of determination to that effect.after the trial court erroneously dismissed plaintiff petition on statute of limitations grounds,we reversed the judgment in latinos unidos de napa city of napa.th.the trial court subsequently denied the petition on its merits,agreeing with the city legal analysis and concluding plaintiff had waived its right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence.we find no error and affirm.
factual background and procedural history 
i.the parties 
plaintiff identifies itself as an unincorporated association which advocates for environmentally sound and legally adequate development policies that address the housing needs of all economic segments of the population in the city of napa and surrounding areas.the city is the lead agency for the subject approvals for the purposes of the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et and is charged with duties to disclose,analyze,and mitigate significant impacts from the project.
under ceqa,an eir must be prepared before a public agency approves any project that may have a significant effect on the environment.san franciscans upholding the downtown plan city and county of san francisco th.ceqa and its related regulations ordinarily referred to as guidelines,tit,et.guidelines define an eir as an informational document whose purpose is to provide public agencies and the public in general with detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment to list ways in which the significant effects of such a project might be minimized and to indicate alternatives to such a project.pub.resources code,guidelines,subds.b e.
public resources code section and guidelines section mandate that once a public agency has prepared an eir for a project,no further eir is required unless either substantial changes are proposed in the project that will require major revisions of the eir,or substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project will be undertaken that will require major revisions in the eir,or new information,which was not known and could not have been known when the eir was certified,becomes available additionally,where an agency prepares a program eir for a broad policy document such as a local general plan,guideline section,subdivision c allows agencies to limit future environmental review for later activities that are found to be within the scope of the program eir.
iii.the city general plan 
the planning and zoning law,et requires each city and county to adopt a comprehensive,general plan for the physical development of the county or city,and of any land outside its boundaries which in the planning agency judgment bears relation to its planning.a city general plan is its constitution for future development located at the top of the hierarchy of local government law regulating land use.devita county of napa cal th.t he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its elements.citations.citizens of goleta valley board of supervisors cal d.the planning and zoning law requires that each general plan include seven mandatory elements,including a land use element,a circulation element,a housing element,a conservation element,an element,a noise element,and a safety element.
state law imposes many requirements for housing elements,including a requirement that they be periodically updated pursuant to a statutory schedule,et the housing element law provides the housing element shall consist of an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals,policies,quantified objectives,financial resources,and scheduled programs for the preservation,improvement,and development of housing.the housing element shall identify adequate sites for housing,including rental housing,housing,and mobilehomes,and emergency shelters,and shall make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of all economic segments of the community.the city was required to have adopted updates to its housing element by december,third revision and by june,fourth revision,subd.e f 
the city adopted a comprehensive update of its general plan entitled envision napa in december general plan.as its name suggests,the general plan sets forth the city future plans for development through the year.the general plan includes updates to all elements of the city general plan except for the housing element,which at the time the city anticipated updating in.
prior to approving the general plan,the city prepared,circulated,and ultimately certified a program eir program eir.the program eir analyzed the environmental impacts of future projected growth within the city through the year,in accordance with the general plan,including analysis of environmental impacts relating to land use,transportation,community services and utilities,cultural resources,visual quality,biological resources,geology,soils,seismicity,hydrology,air quality,noise,and public health and safety.the city updated amended its housing element in and in.
iv.the housing element update project 
in april,the city began the process of again updating its housing element,a course of action that resulted in the project.this process ultimately included public meetings,including community workshops and other opportunities for public input.
on april,city staff prepared an initial study to analyze the project the initial study identified all changes that the project would make to the existing housing and land use elements.the initial study first summarized the overall policy changes to the housing element,including policies to increase housing densities to provide additional housing opportunities,to maintain and improve neighborhood livability,to expand community involvement and outreach,to address housing needs and affordability,and other policy changes to comply with current state requirements.
the initial study then further described the specific new actions contemplated by the project,including changes to the land use element to increase the minimum residential densities in seven areas zoned as mixed use or community commercial from to residential units per acre to to residential units per acre,changes to the land use element to increase the permitted density for eight sites located in three areas of the city by a total of units,various zoning amendments to comply with current state laws regarding emergency shelters and transitional,supportive,and farm worker housing,zoning amendments to require a use permit for conversion of certain types of stores and to provide for,and land use element and zoning amendments to permit single family detached homes at the same densities of single family attached homes.
the initial study then analyzed the extent to which these changes contemplated by the project could result in any new or different environmental impacts not already analyzed with respect to the general plan,specifically and separately analyzing the issues of aesthetics,agricultural resources,air quality,biological resources,cultural resources,geology and soils,greenhouse gas emissions,hazards and hazardous materials,hydrology and water quality,land use and planning,mineral resources,noise,population and housing,public services,recreation,and utilities and service systems.based on its analysis,the initial study concluded that the project was within the scope of the city program eir,such that the project required no further environmental review.
on may,the city received a page comment letter from david graves objecting to the initial study and making various arguments that the city should instead prepare a supplemental eir.the comment letter attached a letter prepared by traffic engineer daniel smith,who asserted that the information in the program eir relating to traffic impacts was outdated.
on june,the city principal planner and public works director prepared a page memorandum response to the two letters,disputing the claims made therein.this memorandum included two and a half pages of analysis from the city public works department explaining why it disagreed with the comments in the two letters and found them to be misleading and inaccurate insofar as they were based on information that was incorrect incomplete.
on june,the city council adopted detailed findings restating the initial study determinations summarized above,including findings that the project was within the scope of the program eir prepared for the general plan,and that it would not result in any new significant environmental effects that were not identified,evaluated and mitigated through the program eir.the council approved the project,adopting the amendments to the land use element,the updated housing element,and,later,approving the various zoning amendments.
v.the petition for writ of mandate 
on october,plaintiff filed a first amended petition for writ of mandate challenging the city compliance with ceqa in adopting the updated housing element and the related conforming changes as noted above,after the trial court dismissed the action on statute of limitations grounds,we reversed the judgment and the case was returned to the trial court.
on february,the trial court issued a tentative ruling denying the petition,finding that the city properly applied section in determining that the project was within the scope of the program eir.the court also found plaintiff had waived its substantial evidence challenges because it failed to set forth in its opening brief all the evidence which might have a bearing on the administrative decision,and that,even if these challenges were not deemed waived,the city findings were,in fact,supported by substantial evidence.
on february,the trial court filed its judgment denying plaintiff petition for the reasons stated in its tentative ruling.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of reviewa.general standard of review 
the standard of review in an action to set aside an agency determination under ceqa is governed by section in administrative mandamus proceedings,and section in traditional mandamus actions.the distinction between these two provisions is rarely significant.in either case,the issue before the trial court is whether the agency abused its discretion.abuse of discretion is shown if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law,or the determination is not supported by substantial evidence.citations.county of amador el dorado county water agency th.
fair argument versus substantial evidence tests 
relying in part on sierra club county of sonoma th sierra club,an opinion authored by this court,plaintiff claims the fair argument test applies to the city decision to refrain from preparing a new eir because the project was not adequately covered or mitigated in the program eir.the fair argument test is derived from section,which requires an eir on any project which may have a significant effect on the environment.that section mandates preparation of an eir in the first instance whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact.citation.if there is substantial evidence of such impact,contrary evidence is not adequate to support a decision to dispense with an eir.id.at.the fair argument standard creates a low threshold for requiring an eir,reflecting a legislative preference for resolving doubts in favor of environmental review.id.at pp.
the city contends,and the trial court agreed,that the substantial evidence standard of review applies here because the project falls under section.w hen a court reviews an agency decision under section not to require a subsequent or supplemental eir on a project,the traditional,deferential substantial evidence test applies.the court decides only whether the administrative record as a whole demonstrates substantial evidence to support the determination that the changes in the project or its circumstances were not so substantial as to require major modifications of the eir.sierra club,supra,th at accord,snarled traffic obstructs progress city and county of san francisco th,thus,the statutory presumption flips in favor of the agency and against further review.moss county of humboldt th,moss.s ection comes into play precisely because review has already occurred,and the time for challenging the sufficiency of the original eir has long since expired id.at.
standard of review applicable to the city environmental review process here 
as the court in division three of our appellate district has observed,a lthough the standards for judicial review of an agency decision under sections and are well settled,the issue is not so clear with respect to the agency decision about which of these statutes governs the environmental review process.courts have reached different conclusions about the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny to be applied to an agency determination about whether a project is new,such that section applies,or whether it is a modification of a previously reviewed project,such that section applies.moss,supra,th at.
in save our neighborhood lishman th,save our neighborhood the third district court of appeal held that this threshold question id.at is a question of law for the court.id.at.subsequently,in mani brothers real estate group city of los angeles th mani brothers,division two of the second district court of appeal strongly disagreed with this aspect of save our neighborhood,particularly in cases in which there is a previously certified eir treating the issue as a question of law,as the court did in save our neighborhood,inappropriately undermines the deference due the agency in administrative matters.that principle of deference is otherwise honored by the substantial evidence test resolution of any reasonable doubts in favor of the administrative finding and decision.citation.mani brothers,supra,at.
in moss,the appellate court noted these two opposing cases and did not take a direct stand on the issue,finding it unnecessary to do so under the circumstances of that case.moss,supra,th at pp.however,the court did state in a footnote that it agreed with mani brothers to the extent its discussion meant to suggest that a court should tread with extraordinary care before reversing a local agency determination about the environmental impact of changes to a project.moss,supra,at,fn.we agree with our colleagues in division three,and elect to evaluate the city decision to proceed under section using the substantial evidence test 
we also observe that the facts of this case are not analogous to the facts at issue in sierra club.in sierra club,the county had certified a program eir for a resource management plan that regulated mining.the plan specified lands available for future mining and provided for preservation of identified agricultural lands.sierra club,supra,th at pp.years later,a mining company proposed to amend the eir to designate for mining a large parcel that had been identified as agricultural in the eir.id.at.we held that the deferential review provided by section did not apply in this context because the proposed project was not either the same as or within the scope of the program described in the eir,which had expressly exempted the agricultural land from future mining.sierra club,supra,at.in the present case,the most recent project is the same as,or within the scope of,that which is described in the program eir.unlike sierra club this case does not involve any plans or any other actual changes to a designated area.
substantial evidence supports the decision to proceed under section 
plaintiff relies on center for sierra nevada conservation county of el dorado th county of el dorado in arguing that the project is not covered by the program eir.in county of el dorado,the county general plan and attendant eir required mitigation of the loss of oak woodland habitat,but anticipated the option of allowing developers to pay a conservation fee under an oak woodland management plan instead.id.at.since neither the general plan nor the eir specified the fee rate or how the collected fees should be used to mitigate the impact on oak woodlands,the appellate court held the county was required to prepare a tiered eir before it adopted the oak woodland management plan and implemented the fee.id.at.plaintiff argues that the project,like the later approved oak woodland management plan in county of el dorado,was anticipated by the program eir,but that the high density residential units approved as part of the project were neither addressed,known,nor adequately covered.we disagree.
here,the entire project consists of limited amendments to the housing element and the land use element of the general plan,and relatively minor amendments to the city zoning ordinances.in contrast to the facts in county of el dorado,no aspect of the project involves any approval site specific or otherwise of any actual development or other activity.to the extent the project amends the city general plan,guidelines section clearly applies and explicitly requires additional environmental review only for amendments that represent s ubstantial changes proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the previous eir guidelines,subd.a,italics added.as to the zoning amendments,those amendments merely incorporate the density revisions already made to the land use element and make other minor changes to comply with current state law.ar,thus,these changes are within the scope of the program eir.see guidelines,subd.c if the agency finds that pursuant to guidelines section,no new effects could occur or no new mitigation measures would be required,the agency can approve a subsequent activity as being within the scope of the project covered by the program eir,and no new environmental document would be required.
plaintiff primarily relies upon the fact that,while the city modified every other element of its general plan when it adopted the general plan in,it did not change the housing element at that time because the city had anticipated updating that element in.thus,plaintiff asserts that the housing element revisions were not a part of the environmental review and planning process.however,while the city did not change the housing element at the time it approved the general plan,the program eir analyzed the effects of the housing element.for example,the project description chapter of the program eir summarized all of the general plan goals from each of the elements,including the housing element.thus,the housing element was not excluded from consideration further,as the city aptly notes,the environmental impacts associated with a community housing element are necessarily addressed in the land use element.under government code section,the housing element consists of policies whose objectives must be accounted for in the land use element 
all of the alleged changes resulting from the project that plaintiff complains will result in significant impacts primarily the changes in density are changes that the project makes to the land use element,not the housing element.there is no dispute that the general plan as adopted in included a fully revised and updated land use element,and there thus can be no dispute that this aspect of the project clearly is a modification to the general plan that was analyzed in the program eir and therefore is properly analyzed under guidelines section.thus,substantial evidence supports the city decision to proceed under public resources code section.
the same standard applies to the amendments to the zoning ordinance once an agency has prepared an eir,its decision not to prepare a supplemental or subsequent eir for a later project is reviewed under the deferential substantial evidence standard.citations.this rule applies to determinations regarding whether a new eir is required following a level of review.citations.citizens for responsible equitable environmental development city of san diego redevelopment agency th,fn.omitted.accordingly,we conclude the city properly determined that sections and,subdivision c of the guidelines applied to its ceqa review of the project.
ii.plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the decision to refrain from preparing an eir is unsupported by substantial evidence 
we review the city conclusion that the project did not require any further environmental review to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support it,citizens for a megaplex free alameda city of alameda th,citizens for a megaplex free alameda stating that an agency determination concerning whether to prepare eir under pub.resources code,is reviewed for substantial evidence.in reviewing an agency decision not to require additional environmental review pursuant to section,courts are not reviewing the record to determine whether it demonstrates a possibility of environmental impact,but are viewing it in a light most favorable to the agency decision in order to determine whether substantial evidence supports the decision not to require additional review.citation.mani brothers,supra,th at.
as noted above,the initial study determined the project would not create any new or more severe environmental impacts over those analyzed in the program eir.while the project incrementally raises maximum densities in limited areas of the city,the initial study indicates that this will not increase total potential development above what was already analyzed in the program eir.this is largely because a many project approvals have permitted less development than would have been allowed under the applicable general plan designations,and b the c ity rate of growth has been less than anticipated by the plan projections.the city resultingly concluded that the project would not require any major revisions to the program eir,was within the scope of the general plan,and required no further environmental review under ceqa.the trial court found this determination to be supported by substantial evidence.
as a threshold matter,the city contends that because plaintiff,in its opening brief on appeal,failed to fairly summarize the evidence in the administrative record supporting the city findings,it has waived its right to challenge those findings.for example,the city states that instead of addressing the city actual analysis of the impacts of the density changes,plaintiff simply asserts that the city did not study it.the city also observes that plaintiff failed to fairly summarize the city public works director detailed response to smith traffic report,instead falsely asserting smith expert evidence is undisputed.as noted above,the trial court found plaintiff had waived its right to bring a substantial evidence challenge,though it nevertheless reached the merits of plaintiff substantial evidence contentions.
plaintiff concedes it was the city that provided detailed evidentiary arguments to the trial court,including citing to specific documents as substantial evidence supporting the city findings.plaintiff essentially admits it made no effort to carry its burden,stating c entral to plaintiff argument,here and in the lower court,is that the city abused its discretion by failing to proceed in the manner required by law.citation.that being a legal issue,judicial review need not reach the issue of whether the city factual findings are supported by substantial evidence.italics added.the obvious flaw with this argument is that we have ruled against plaintiff on the issue of whether the city erred in conducting its environmental review of the project pursuant to section.in effect,plaintiff thus concedes that,having lost its legal argument,there are no further issues for us to address.
as our colleagues in division five have explained,the petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that the record does not contain sufficient evidence justifying
