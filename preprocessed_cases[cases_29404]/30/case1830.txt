factual procedural background 
vincent owns acres of unincorporated land in the county of marin.the property lies to the north of the city of san rafael,abutting the southern boundary of the city of novato,and is set to the east of highway between it and the san pablo bay.the property is separated from the northern boundary of the city of san rafael by the silveira property,another tract of unincorporated lands which also sits between highway and the san pablo bay.
for many years the city and the county of marin county cooperated in planning for the future use and development of the vincent and silveira properties jointly,the properties.although the properties are physically located within the unincorporated area of the county,for planning purposes they were identified by the local agency formation commission lafco as within the city sphere of influence and urban service area.policies in earlier versions of the city general plan and the marin countywide plan anticipated that the properties would be annexed to the city prior to or concurrent with the issuance of development permits.
the city general plan,adopted in,set forth detailed policies for the properties describing environmental concerns and identifying development potential of up to units.in,the city and the county decided to enter a memorandum of understanding to work cooperatively on a process to prepare recommended amendments to the city general plan and the marin countywide plan regarding the properties.the city and county appointed a advisory task force,which included representatives from interest groups throughout the county,in order to prepare recommended general plan amendments for the city and county.over a period of months,the task force held meetings and study sessions with various community groups before presenting recommendations to the city in may.the task force report stated that the appropriate level of development for the properties would be determined through subsequent environmental impact analysis of impacts on environmental characteristics as well as on traffic on highway and local streets.however,the report recommended the range of possible development for the properties at between and units,reduced to units with the purchase of development rights.the city accepted the task force recommendations by resolution dated may,and forwarded them to the general plan steering committee for incorporation into the general plan update.
on march,shapell industries and vincent submitted applications to the city for development of the vincent property alone,including a specific request for annexation of the vincent property.the proposed development included residential units,feet of office space and additional retail space.the city sent a notice of preparation of a draft eir on the proposed project to nearby property owners,as well as other local groups and agencies.in response,the city received about letters from agencies and individuals,including the city of novato and the county of marin,identifying concerns with the proposal,including impacts on traffic and transit and the fact that the proposal did not proceed in conjunction with a plan for the silveira property.
on april,the city council passed resolution,denying the application by shapell.vincent for annexation and prezoning.resolution acknowledged that for many years,the city,county and the marin county lafco have identified the properties as located within the city sphere of influence,and that the city general plan,adopted in,set forth policies for the properties identifying their development potential.the resolution found,however,that circumstances that may have favored prezoning and developing the vincent property had changed since adoption of general plan and acceptance of the task force recommendations.the resolution stated that any such future development had always been contingent upon the completion of infrastructure improvements to address roadway and sewer capacity constraints.these included road improvements such as extension of the mcinnis parkway and completion of the lucas valley ranch road interchange,as well as construction of a parallel arterial to highway to provide additional capacity to novato,as well as for police and fire emergency access such improvements had not been made,the resolution noted,while at the same time traffic problems on highway had worsened,problems which the proposed development would compound.additionally,the resolution noted that in the two years since the task force recommendations were adopted public opposition to developing the area has grown and a majority of the marin county board of supervisors had expressed opposition to the proposed level of development for the vincent property.the resolution also noted that the vincent property is not contiguous to the city,a necessity for any annexation.
resolution also found that disapproving prezoning and annexation for the vincent proposal is consistent with general plan because nothing in the plan affirmatively requires the city to actively pursue or to approve development of the properties.rejection of the proposal maintains the status quo,the resolution found,because the properties are not currently zoned by the city but are currently zoned under the county zoning ordinance.the resolution noted that the county zoning designation will remain in place and the city rejection of the proposal will in no way preclude future development of the property in a manner that is consistent with the county general plan.
the city had earlier signaled a possible change of tack on the annexation of the properties,reflected in resolution,which the city council unanimously passed on january.resolution noted that whereas the city accepted the task force proposals for the properties in may,recent public comments and position statements by county supervisors have advocated more limited development and a greater planning role for the county in any such development.the resolution also noted that the county has substantial involvement in the annexation process and considerable influence in connection with any ultimate decision respecting annexation of the properties to the city as well as being a principal participant in the necessary negotiation of a tax sharing agreement with the city and through its participation on lafco possesses the ability to make annexation infeasible following a lengthy land use entitlement process in the city that may likely require the city defense of lawsuits and public referenda.therefore,under the resolution,the city council directed staff to prepare proposed amendments to the city general plan relating to the properties,indicating the city determination not to annex or to serve these lands and directing that lafco remove them from the city sphere of influence and urban service area as appropriate and to bring such proposed amendments to the planning commission and city council for public hearing and consideration for adoption.in doing so staff is directed to include policies continuing the city long advocacy that any future development of the properties in the county should provide for maximum creation of workforce housing while protecting unique environmental features and habitat values and providing a fair economic use of these lands for their owners.the city council further directs the general plan steering committee also consider such policies in their preparation of a draft general plan consistent with such council direction.
subsequently,general plan was developed and adopted by the city council in a resolution passed on november.general plan did not provide for the future annexation of the properties.accordingly,in the adopting resolution the city council instructed staff to formally request that the marin lafco initiate proceedings to remove the properties from the city sphere of influence.the city council found that the plan is consistent with the intent of the marin countywide plan to concentrate development in three environmental corridors,and which designates san rafael within the corridor.the council also found that plan is consistent with smart growth principles focusing on the development of community centers,including the downtown area and north san rafael town center,appropriate design,mixed uses and balanced transportation planning.
vincent filed its complaint and petition for writ of mandate on december.after demurrers by the city,vincent filed the operative,second amended complaint on may.the complaint alleges the city abandoned the opportunity to have a substantial amount of affordable housing actually built on the vincent property within its expanded borders because it assumed that the political winds had shifted.instead of allowing the development at vincent that the multiple city general plans and the advisory task force anticipated,the city proposed and later adopted amendments to its general plan that reverse land use policies that have been in place for decades.the complaint asserted various causes of action,including violations of ceqa and violations of state planning and zoning law,and sought a writ of mandate declaring the city general plan invalid and void ab initio.
a hearing on the petition for writ of mandate was held on september.on november,the trial court issued an order concluding that the city did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner in deciding to approve its general plan and in its earlier decision not to pursue annexation of the vincent property.in addition,the court found that the city did not violate ceqa or state planning laws in approving plan.consequently,the court denied vincent petition for writ of mandate.judgment in favor of the city,including costs of suit,was entered on november.vincent filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment on january.subsequently,the trial court issued an order awarding the city costs in the amounts of for filing fees and court copy of administrative record and information technology division fees for costs of retrieving emails.
discussion 
general plan amendments 
vincent asserts that the city decided to exclude the properties from its general plan in january,before conducting any ceqa analysis or preparing an eir,and without considering relevant evidence relating to planning and land use criteria or the regional welfare.in a similar vein,vincent contends that the city removal of its lands from general plan was an unlawful reaction to vincent development application on these grounds vincent contends the amendments to the general plan are unlawful.
as vincent points out,agencies are required by law to carry out an environmental assessment of a project before approving it.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d,ceqa requires that an agency determine whether a project may have a significant environmental impact,and thus whether an eir is required,before it approves that project.we also acknowledge that an ordinance is an invalid exercise of a city police power where it constitutes arbitrary and discriminatory rezoning.see,arnel development city of costa mesa d.arnel development rezoning ordinance arbitrary and discriminatory where without any significant change in circumstances and without considering appropriate planning criteria,property is rezoned for the sole purpose of defeating the development.however,these legal precepts and authorities have no applicability here.
first,we reject the claim that the city amended its general plan without appropriate environmental review because there is no factual basis in the record to support it.indeed,vincent contentions are founded on its characterization of resolution passed on january,as a final action requiring ceqa review.it was not.a gencies must not take any action which gives impetus to a planned or foreseeable project in a manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures without first carrying out ceqa review.friends of the sierra railroad tuolumne park recreation dist.th,d.although agency action approving or opening the way for a future development can be part of a project and can trigger ceqa even if the action takes place prior to planning or approval of all the specific features of the planned development,ceqa review is premature if the agency action in question occurs too early in the planning process to allow meaningful analysis of potential impacts.although environmental review must take place as early as is feasible,it also must be late enough to provide meaningful information for environmental assessment,tit,subd.b.id.at,d.resolution was not a final decision on,or approval of,a project,which would have triggered ceqa review.resolution did not by its terms approve changes to the general plan rather,it directed staff to prepare amendments in line with certain guidelines,and bring those back for further consideration.in sum,we conclude the city council passage of resolution did not trigger ceqa review thus,vincent contentions on this point fail,because the record shows that the city did conduct an eir as required under ceqa before adopting general plan in november.
we also reject st vincent related contention that the amendments which removed its property from the city general plan were an arbitrary and discriminatory action that exceeded the city police powers.vincent asserts that o nce an application has been submitted for a development project,applicable land use regulations can not be changed simply to defeat the project.vincent cites arnel development,supra,d.as an archetypical case applying this rule.the facts here,however,do not warrant application of the rule.
in arnel development,the city of costa mesa city approved a final development plan as well as a tentative tract map for acres of land within the city boundaries owned by the arnel development company arnel.arnel development,supra,d at.following approval of the project,the city rezoned the property and medium density consistent with the general and specific plans for the express purpose of permitting the development.id.at.shortly after the city approval of the arnel development,a citizens group mounted an initiative petition to rezone the arnel property residential,which the voters subsequently adopted.thereafter the city refused to approve a final tract map or issue building permits to arnel.id.at.the court of appeal stated that after enacting an ordinance rezoning the arnel property consistent with its general plan,it would be arbitrary and discriminatory to later rezone the property for the sole purpose of defeating the development absent no significant change in circumstances and without considering the appropriate planning criteria.id.at.the city authority under the police power is no greater than otherwise it would be simply because the subsequent rezoning was accomplished by initiative,the court of appeal added.ibid.here,by contrast,the vincent property was never subject to the city police power,was never annexed by the city,and the city never approved any development proposals for the property.rather,the city rejected vincent application for annexation and prezoning,a decision which vincent did not appeal.moreover,the city actions in removing vincent lands from its sphere of influence were to preserve the zoning status quo,not alter it to vincent detriment as in arnel development co,supra 
merritt city of pleasanton th,d merritt,a case decided by division one of this court,is much more instructive.merritt involved an appeal from denial of writ of mandate after property owners sought to compel the city of pleasanton city to set aside measure p,a referendum on the owners development proposal for their property.merritt,supra,th at,d.the property was unincorporated but was adjacent to the city and lay within its sphere of influence.the city had previously annexed land on both sides of the property.owners submitted a proposal for a planned unit development pud to construct single family homes.the city adopted ordinance,approving a prezoning of the site to pud,low density residential.ibid.however,the approved prezoning never occurred.before ordinance took effect,residents raised enough petition signatures to submit the pud to a referendum process known as measure id.at,d.after measure p was defeated at the polls the owners filed a petition for writ of mandate arguing that the defeat of measure p created an inconsistency with the city general plan by promulgating an unincorporated zoning designation for the property inconsistent with general plan objectives,policies,general land uses,and programs.id.at,d.
on appeal from the trial court denial of the writ,the owners contended that measure p was arbitrary and capricious,and unfairly discriminated against the property,citing arnel development co,supra.merritt,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal rejected the owners contention,stating in the present case,unlike the situation in arnel,supra,d,the electorate did not change the property land use designation to preclude a particular type of needed housing.the defeat of measure p simply maintained the status quo.in addition,unlike the situation in arnel,the city general plan was not amended to call for the immediate development of the property,and there is no specific plan that calls for the development proposed by appellants.this is exactly the situation here.general plan maintained the status quo and did not change the vincent property prevailing land use designation to preclude a particular type of development,or indeed,to preclude any type of development.
in sum,we conclude that in adopting general plan,including amendments which removed the vincent property from its sphere of influence for planning purposes,the city did not exceed its police powers by acting in an arbitrary and capricious manner and without conducting an environmental review.vincent may have preferred to remain within the city sphere of influence and ultimately to have been annexed to the city,but such preferences do not translate into a legal right to such annexation.rancho la costa county of san diego d.we know of no authority which gives a property owner a vested right to have his property included within the boundaries of any particular city,district or authority.the prospect one property might become more valuable if it is annexed to the city where certain special services are available at a more reasonable cost is a pleasant contemplation for a landowner,but it is certainly not a vested right.city of santa cruz local agency formation com.d.and no one has any right,constitutional or otherwise,to be included,or excluded,from a proposed annexation.
vincent also challenges the sufficiency of the city ceqa review of general plan on various grounds.
standard of review 
in a case challenging an agency compliance with ceqa,we review the agency action,not the trial court decision.citation.in doing so,our inquiry shall extend only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.citations.substantial evidence in this context means enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion,even though other conclusions might also be reached.citation.save round valley alliance county of inyo th,d.
moreover,w e do not review the correctness of the eir environmental conclusions,but only its sufficiency as an informative document.citation.we may not set aside an agency approval of an eir on the ground that an opposite conclusion would have been equally or more reasonable.our limited function is consistent with the principle that the purpose of ceqa is not to generate paper,but to compel government at all levels to make decisions with environmental consequences in mind.ceqa does not,indeed can not,guarantee that these decisions will always be those which favor environmental considerations.citation.we may not,in sum,substitute our judgment for that of the people and their local representatives.we can and must,however,scrupulously enforce all legislatively mandated ceqa requirements.citation.save round valley alliance county of inyo,supra,th at,d.
vincent asserts that the city violated ceqa by failing to investigate whether its reliance on infill and redevelopment sites for new housing would displace development to more distant areas,resulting in leapfrog development and its attendant environmental ills.according to vincent,the eir did not investigate whether such growth displacement might occur and also did not investigate foreseeable indirect effects of excluding the properties from the general plan.
underlying vincent criticism of the eir is the suggestion that the city should have compared the effect of the amendments in general plan with the alternative of leaving existing general plan policies general plan providing for housing at the properties in place.however,such a comparison is not required under ceqa rather,an eir is required to assess the impact of amendments to the general plan against existing conditions on the ground,not against the impact of the amendments on the previous version of the general plan.as one court put it ceqa nowhere calls for evaluation of the impacts of a proposed project on an existing general plan it concerns itself with the impacts of the project on the environment,defined as the existing physical conditions in the affected area.the legislation evinces no interest in the effects of proposed general plan amendments on an existing general plan,but instead has clearly expressed concern with the effects of projects on the actual environment upon which the proposal will operate.citation.woodward park homeowners,city of fresno th,d woodward park.noting that a number of other cases reach similar conclusions citations,the woodward park court summarized the rule of those cases as follows i n assessing the impacts of a project proposed for an undeveloped piece of property,agencies should compare project impacts against the existing environment,rather than some hypothetical,impacted future environment that might occur without the project under existing general plan zoning designations.citation.woodward park,supra,th at,d.
the eir adequately addressed the impacts of the proposed amendments against existing conditions on the ground.regarding proposed land use changes,the eir clearly describes a loss of acres from the planning area,which represents the removal of the properties includ ing acres of use land vincent silveira designation and acres of parks and open space land.the eir analyzed the environmental impacts and mitigation measures of such land use changes.the eir concluded that such land use changes would not conflict with other adopted plans,such as the marin county zoning ordinance and countywide plan that development consistent with general plan plan would not induce substantial growth and concentration of the city population,especially when placed in a regional context and that such development would result in a ratio of,representing opportunities for more local workers to reside in the community,which has the potential to reduce future traffic generation.the eir analyzed the growth inducing impacts of the general plan amendments.it stated that development in line with general plan would result in up to additional households and more residents within the planning area over existing conditions.while the plan would accommodate this growth,in some instances it would have the effect of restricting development due to changes in land use designations moreover,the proposed changes would be expected to concentrate urban development in areas that already have urban services.
moreover,the city specifically addressed the issue of displacement or leapfrog development in its response to vincent comment on the eir.the response notes plan identified a list of housing sites,some of which will be rezoned to permit housing in districts where it is not currently allowed.with such proposed rezoning,the response notes plan anticipates that all of the housing sites listed for the planning period will be available for housing development with reasonable access to public services and without unusually high development costs.in sum,the eir presents a fair argument that the plan amendments to remove the properties from the city sphere of influence will not result in overspill or leapfrog development into surrounding areas.save round valley alliance county of inyo,supra,th at,d.
vincent also contends that the city violated ceqa by failing to compare project impacts to the impacts of the alternative.vincent asserts that the eir failed to compare the growth inducing implications of the two plans plan and plan and their relative growth displacement effects.however,this claim is belied by the record because the eir included an analysis of three alternatives to plan alternative.no project no conditions,no further development alternative.no project no action general plan development under general plan alternative.reduced lower intensity development alternative.the eir assessed the impacts of these alternatives and compared them to plan across a whole range of factors,including land use,transportation,air quality,noise and public services.moreover,the eir notes that i mpacts of development at the properties are therefore discussed in alternative,the no project no action general plan alternative since general plan included development policies for the properties.in sum,the eir adequately addressed alternatives to the plan.
c.the city housing element 
the statutory framework 
a city broad police power is the constitutional source for its authority to regulate land through planning,zoning,and building ordinances,thereby protecting public health,safety and welfare.citations.fonseca city of gilroy th,d fonseca.t he framework for the exercise of that power is provided by the state land use planning statutes.citations.ibid.state planning statutes require the adoption of a general plan which is the basic land use charter governing the direction of future land use in the locality.citations.fonseca,supra,th at,d declaring affordable housing a priority of the highest order and one not merely a local concern but a matter of vital statewide importance,the legislature in enacted legislation to require each local government to adopt a housing element as a component of its general plan,subd.a,subd.b,subd.d.according to the housing element law,a public locality general plan must include a housing element consisting of several mandatory components.citation.ibid.
government code section specifies these mandatory components generally,it provides that t he housing element shall consist of an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals,policies,quantified objectives,financial resources,and scheduled programs for the preservation,improvement,and development of housing.the housing element shall identify adequate sites for housing,including rental housing,housing,and mobile homes,and shall make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of all economic segments of the community.former 
the housing element must include a n assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to the meeting of these needs,includ ing an analysis of population and employment trends and documentation of projections and a quantification of the locality existing and projected housing needs for all income levels.these existing and projected needs shall include the locality share of the regional housing need in accordance with section an inventory of land suitable for residential development,including vacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment,and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to these sites.former,subd.a.also,the housing element must contain a statement of the community goals,quantified objectives,and policies relative to the maintenance,preservation,improvement,and development of housing.former,subd.b.
additionally,the housing element must include a program which sets forth a schedule of actions the local government is undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the goals and objectives of the housing element through the administration of land use and development controls,provision of regulatory concessions and incentives,and the utilization of appropriate federal and state financing and subsidy programs when available former,subd.c.moreover,i n order to make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community,the program shall identify actions that will be taken to make sites available during the planning period of the general plan with appropriate zoning and development standards and with services and facilities to accommodate that portion of the city or county share of the regional housing need for each income level that could not be accommodated on sites identified in the inventory completed pursuant to paragraph of subdivision a without rezoning.sites shall be identified as needed to facilitate and encourage the development of a variety of types of housing for all income levels,including multifamily rental housing,housing,mobilehomes,housing for agricultural employees,emergency shelters,and transitional housing.where the inventory of sites,pursuant to paragraph of subdivision a,does not identify adequate sites to accommodate the need for groups of all household income levels pursuant to section,the program shall identify sites that can be developed for housing within the planning period pursuant to subdivision h of section.former,subd.c a.
standard of review 
when an interested party challenges a city housing element in a mandamus action,the trial court review shall extend to whether the housing element or portion thereof or revision thereto substantially complies with the requirements of the housing element law.citation.substantial compliance means actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute,as distinguished from mere technical imperfections of form.citation.citations.simply stated,j udicial review of a housing element for substantial compliance with the statutory requirements does not involve an examination of the merits of the element or of the wisdom of the municipality determination of policy.citation.it merely involves a determination whether the housing element includes the statutory requirements.citations.t he court role in determining a mandamus challenge to a locality housing element is simply to determine whether the locality has satisfied statutory requirements.it is not to reach the merits of the element or to interfere with the exercise of the locality discretion in making substantive determinations and conclusions about local housing issues,needs,and concerns.fonseca,supra,th at,d.
on appeal,we independently ascertain as a question of law whether the housing element at issue substantially complies with the requirements of the housing element law,substantial compliance meaning actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute,as distinguished from mere technical imperfections of form.citation.citations.in our independent review of the housing element legal adequacy,we afford no deference to the trial court conclusions.citations.fonseca,supra,th at,d.on the other hand,a city adoption of a housing element is a legislative enactment,something which is generally entitled to some deference.there is a presumption that the adopted element is valid and we do not in the course of our review evaluate the municipality determination of policy.citation.the burden is on the challenger to demonstrate that the housing element,and by extension the general plan,is inadequate.citation.if the municipality has substantially complied with statutory requirements,we will not interfere with its legislative action,unless that action was arbitrary,capricious,or entirely lacking in evidentiary support.citations.accordingly,like the trial court,we do not review the merits of the housing element at issue or assess the wisdom of the municipality determination of policy.citation.nor do we judge whether the programs adopted by the locality are adequate to meet their stated objectives.citation.our review thus comes down to independently determining whether the housing element at issue is in substantial compliance with applicable statutory requirements,does it contain the elements mandated by the statute.id.at,d italics added.
vincent contends that the city housing element fails to comply with the statutory requirements of section.specifically,vincent asserts that the city housing element does not identify adequate sites for residential development,in violation of section,subdivision c.according to vincent,in a poorly conceived effort to make up for the loss of residential land caused by its abandonment of the vincent and silveira sites,the city suddenly discovered new infill and redevelopment sites for housing but failed to show that development of residential uses on these sites during the five year planning cycle is feasible.we are not persuaded.
the city housing element included the inventory of land suitable for residential development required under section,subdivision a.the inventory included an analysis of the residential potential in the various land use districts,identifying a total of acres of land with a potential yield of additional units.the inventory also included analysis of how many of those potential additional units could be developed within the timeframe of the housing element by looking at single family sites and second units,multifamily sites,mixed use sites,and sites currently zoned nonresidential where housing will be allowed pending land use and zoning changes in plan by identifying specific downtown development sites,including potential sites with planning application pending and other potential sites for downtown housing development and by identifying the potential for housing development in other specific areas,such as the loch lomond marina,marin square,the area around davidson middle school and the commercial and office areas around northgate town center.on that basis,it states that units are available to be developed more than the city remaining regional housing need of units,and that the residential potential exceeds the city remaining regional housing need for units for very low,low,and moderate income households.
regarding section,subdivision c requirement for a five year schedule of actions,the housing element includes an analysis of plans and programs to promote and develop identified housing needs over this time frame.these include polices for the funding of affordable housing for the protection of existing housing stock and use for innovative housing initiatives,limited equity cooperatives and sweat equity housing to maintain an adequate supply of land designated for all types of residential development to promote mixed use development allowing residential uses in commercial areas and to allow higher densities on sites adjacent to transit hubs.additionally,the housing element satisfied the requirements of section,subdivision c a by identifying adequate sites and analyzing the required infrastructure needs of the sites.for example,the housing element described specific multifamily sites that are currently available and outlined the factors that would make those sites favorable to housing development,such as the ready availability of public facilities,services and infrastructure,incentives such as density bonuses,and the predominance of similar uses in the vicinity of the site.it also describes five downtown redevelopment sites for which development applications were pending for over units.and it contains an analysis of potential mixed use sites in downtown san rafael,discussing incentives for development,such as lower parking requirements,higher allowable densities and height bonus.
vincent,however,demands more.relying on hoffmaster city of san diego th,d hoffmaster,vincent argues that the city failed in its affirmative duty to demonstrate how its housing strategy could actually produce the units it claimed.hoffmaster imposed no such affirmative duty,nor did the applicable planning statutes in hoffmaster,supra,representatives of homeless persons in the city of san diego city claimed the city housing element failed to comply with section,subdivision c by neither properly designating adequate real property sites which city would make available for homeless emergency shelters and transitional housing,nor providing a action plan to implement the goals and policies of the housing element by various means,including facilitating the development of emergency shelters and transitional housing on designated sites.hoffmaster,supra,th at,d.
the appellate court stated that in order t o substantially comply with the identification of adequate sites requirement of subdivision c here,city must provide an inventory of sites which will be made available through features of its program to meet its quantified housing objectives as to the homeless.hoffmaster,supra,th at,d.however,the court further stated that for identification to be meaningful,it must necessarily be specific.it must set forth sites which will be available to be developed,without restrictive zoning burdens which combined with the nimby not in my back yard factor discussed at length in separate council hearings become insurmountable or produce protracted delays and deterrent cost increases.available sites should be officially designated and publicized,preferably in the housing element,for this use.finally,through its action program,city bears the responsibility to ensure the regulatory process actually encourages the development of emergency shelters and transitional housing.id.at,d.after examining the city action program,the court concluded that through its blanket cup conditional use permit requirement and the geographical restriction,the residential care facility ordinance as presently constituted substantially constrains siting homeless facilities for emergency shelter and meaningful transitional housing in any location within city.hoffmaster,supra,th at,d.moreover,the court further concluded that the remaining features of city program did not sufficiently offset the effect of this restrictive ordinance,resulting in a housing element which failed to meaningfully identify adequate sites available for development of both emergency shelter and transitional housing to meet city quantified objectives as to the homeless.id.at,d.
the thrust of the appellate court analysis in hoffmaster is not that a city housing element must demonstrate how its housing strategy will actually produce a specific number of housing units.rather,it is that a city is not in substantial compliance with section,subdivision c simply because it identifies suitable sites to meet an identified housing need,if it then places planning and zoning restrictions in the way of any actual development of those sites to meet the identified housing need.hoffmaster,supra,th at,d within a zoning and context,a dequate funding and ownership of land does not equate to available usable sites,absent a program of zoning development controls,meaningful regulatory concessions and incentives which will permit and encourage such development.italics added.
there is no such flaw,however,in the city housing element here.as noted above,the city has tailored its regulatory activities and zoning controls to maximize the potential for housing development at identified sites,not to frustrate development as in hoffmaster,supra,th,d.the city has developed policies to change zoning in order to allow housing in sites not currently zoned residential reduce parking standards and increase height bonuses for downtown developments revise its second unit ordinance to reduce the time and cost of adding second units to existing homes establish fee waivers,including traffic impact,planning,and building fees for affordable housing projects to utilize the city priority project selection program psp,which allocates traffic capacity to proposed development projects,to encourage affordable housing projects and to permit density bonuses above and beyond those mandated by state law pursuant to the city inclusionary housing ordinance.in sum,while vincent may disagree with the city policy decision to base its housing element on fostering development within existing city limits instead of annexation,it has failed in its burden to overcome the presumption that the housing element is valid and show it is not in substantial compliance with the statutory requirements.fonseca,supra,th at,d.
the trial court awarded the city costs listed as information technology division fees in the amount of.the trial court stated these costs are described as time spent in the email search and production efforts of city programmers or analysts,calculated at a fully burdened rate.after argument on vincent motion to tax costs,the court again reviewed the record in this case and can recall petitioner insistence that the record be augmented with the parties email exchanges.the court will allow the staff time spent in this cumbersome retrieval process,but will not award the attorneys fees claimed as attributable to these efforts.vincent does not dispute that the city incurred these costs,or that they were reasonable and necessary for the litigation,nor does it challenge the rates at which the costs were assessed.rather,vincent contends that the award of costs is barred as a matter of law both by code of civil procedure and by the public records act.

based on the above provisions of section and the code of civil procedure provision awarding costs to the prevailing party,the court in wagner farms,supra,concluded that the prevailing party in a ceqa proceeding may recover as costs the amount it reasonably and necessarily incurred in preparing the rop record of proceedings.wagner farms,supra,th at,d.vincent,however,asserts that the rule of wagner farms does not apply here because,pursuant to section,subd.b,it elected to prepare the record,and ceqa authorizes recovery of costs for record preparation only by a prevailing party who has actually prepared the record.vincent asserts that i n no reported case has a court awarded costs of record preparation to a party where the other party elected to prepare the record of proceedings.vincent further asserts that the very purpose of the rule allowing a petitioner to prepare the record of proceedings is to allow the petitioner to control the costs of record preparation and this purpose is frustrated by an award of costs to the city for purposes of record preparation.
we are not persuaded.in the first place,the city is not seeking to recover the entire cost for preparation of the rop because it did not prepare the rop,vincent did.rather,the question here is whether the city is precluded by vincent election under section,subd.b from recovering any costs whatsoever in connection with preparation of the record,even when the city is the prevailing party,and even when the city incurred certain extraordinary costs at vincent behest.as explained below,we do not think such a blanket preclusion on costs to the prevailing party sits well with the policy embodied in section.
the policy embodied in section was explained in hayward area planning city of hayward th,d city of hayward,a decision issued by division five of this court.there,plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of mandate against the city,alleging noncompliance with ceqa.city of hayward,supra,th at,d.the developer of the affected project was identified as the real party in interest.ibid.after the city advised plaintiffs regarding the anticipated volume of the record and costs associated with its preparation,the plaintiffs elected to have the city prepare the rop,pursuant to section,subdivision a.id.however,the city,apparently in order to ensure timely completion of the record,asked the developer attorneys to prepare the rop.plaintiffs were never advised of this arrangement,and the final record was much longer than the city original projection.id.subsequently,the trial court denied the writ petition,entered judgment in favor of the city,and awarded both the city and the developer costs.id.at,d.
the developer sought over in costs,mostly associated with preparation of the rop.city of hayward,supra,th at,d.plaintiffs moved to tax costs on various grounds,including that costs of record production were not properly awarded to the developer because preparation of the record was the responsibility of the city under section,subdivision a.id.the trial court agreed,but rather than denying the developer costs entirely,it taxed the costs to reflect what costs would have been incurred had the city prepared the record itself,and awarded costs in the reduced amount of.id.plaintiffs appealed the trial court decision to award the developer costs.id.
on appeal,the issue was one of statutory construction does section authorize the court to award the costs of preparing a ceqa administrative record to a real party in interest absent plaintiffs consent city of hayward,supra,th at,d.the appellate court noted that the statute did not expressly bar a real party in interest from recovering costs of preparing the record.id.at,d.however,language in section,subdivision b that the parties shall pay any reasonable costs or fees imposed for the preparation of the record in conformance with any law or rule of court was ambiguous,the court added.id.on the one hand,b ecause the provision appears in subdivision b,which authorizes the public agency to prepare the record,it could be construed to permit only the public agency to claim those costs.on the other hand,as the developer argues,it can be construed to allow costs to any party because the only express restriction is that costs be awarded in conformance with applicable law.id.
construing the ambiguity in a manner consistent with the statutory scheme and purpose,the court observed that the scheme for preparing the record advances the legislativ
