under of the atomic energy act of as amended,stat,codified at aea,the nuclear regulatory commission nrc is authorized to transfer regulatory authority over various categories of nuclear materials within a state to the state government,provided that the state regulatory program is compatible with the nrc program and is adequate to protect the public health and safety.id.d.shieldalloy metallurgical corporation,which for a decade has been seeking nrc approval for a plan to decommission a new jersey facility,challenges the nrc recent transfer of regulatory authority to that state,arguing that new jersey program is incompatible with the federal scheme and that the transfer of authority was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.we agree.
from to,shieldalloy manufactured metal alloys at its newfield,new jersey facility.shieldalloy manufacturing process generated radioactive byproducts in the form of slag and baghouse dust the firm held these materials on site under a license from the nrc.in the early,shieldalloy took the first steps toward decommissioning the newfield facility.based on discussions with the nrc staff,it developed a conceptual plan for disposal of the materials under conditions restricting the site use.at the same time,the nrc developed,and in published,a final rule on the decommissioning of licensed facilities.although this license termination rule ltr expressed a preference for remediating a site in a way that allowed unrestricted use,it conditionally allowed firms to dispose radioactive materials on site under restrictions designed to guarantee public health and safety.id.over the next decade,the nrc and shieldalloy engaged in repeated discussions regarding the disposal of waste at newfield.between and,shieldalloy submitted four iterations of its decommissioning plan,two of which the nrc rejected outright and one of which the nrc accepted for purposes of starting a technical review.shieldalloy revised each proposed plan based on the nrc staff comments and on an extensive interim guidance document provided by nrc staff on april.the nrc declined to review the fourth plan instead,in light of its roughly simultaneous transfer of regulatory authority,it forwarded the plan to new jersey along with the previously accumulated files.
in october new jersey applied for a transfer of regulatory authority over nuclear materials from the nrc,pursuant to.under that provision,congress has authorized the nrc to enter into agreements with the governor of any state providing for discontinuance of the regulatory authority of the nrc and the assumption of authority by the state.b.before making such an agreement,however,the nrc must find that the state regulatory regime is compatible with the nrc program and that the state regime is adequate to protect the public health and safety.id.d.
to evaluate the compatibility of the state and federal regulatory programs,the nrc considers criteria that it enumerated in a policy statement that we will call the criteria document.it further clarified its evaluation process in a later policy statement,the compatibility guidance document,which interprets the compatibility requirement as mandating that the state program must not create conflicts,duplications,gaps,or other conditions that would jeopardize an orderly pattern in the regulation of agreement material on a nationwide basis.at.pursuant to this policy,each element of the nrc program is assigned to one of five groups,a through e though only the first three concern us here.categories a and b require the state and nrc programs to be essentially identical category c merely requires each element of the state program to embody the essential objective of its federal counterpart.id.outside of areas requiring uniformity,the document provides that a state should have flexibility and can implement regulations that are more stringent than the federal regime.id.at.in a later document,the nrc deemed the license termination rule to be a category c element of its program 
after finding new jersey program adequate and compatible with the federal program,the nrc published notice of the proposed agreement in the federal register and sought comments from the public,pursuant to its statutory obligation under e in a letter to the nrc responding to the call for comments the shieldalloy comment letter,shieldalloy argued that the new jersey and federal programs were incompatible the nrc staff rejected shieldalloy protests,see memorandum from borchardt to nrc commissioners,encl,nrc staff comments,and the agreement transferring authority to new jersey took effect on september,less than two weeks after the transfer of authority,new jersey notified shieldalloy that its revised decommissioning plan,hitherto pending before the nrc,did not meet new jersey remediation requirements.worried that it would now be forced to jettison its plans for remediation and instead transfer the radioactive materials to a facility in clive,utah,shieldalloy sought relief along multiple avenues.it requested an exemption from the relevant new jersey regulatory provisions and was denied.it filed a motion with the nrc to stay the transfer for regulatory authority and was denied.and it filed the instant petition challenging the nrc transfer.

item of the criteria document states in relevant part,
existing nrc licenses and pending applications.in effecting the discontinuance of jurisdiction,appropriate arrangements will be made by nrc and the state to ensure that there will be no interference with or interruption of licensed activities or the processing of license applications,by reason of the transfer.
in its comments to the nrc,shieldalloy argued that new jersey had not attempted to make appropriate arrangements to guarantee a smooth transition for the pending shieldalloy decommissioning plan in fact,new jersey had challenged shieldalloy decommissioning process at every stage.this resistance,shieldalloy contended,was incompatible with criterion commitment to the uninterrupted processing of license applications.shieldalloy comment letter at.in response,the nrc staff aptly noted that new jersey is entitled to take part in hearings on licensing actions and to petition for rulemaking,and that the state exercises of those rights did not in themselves indicate the new jersey plan incompatibility with the federal regime under criterion.nrc staff comments at.
but shieldalloy also invoked criterion in support of its separate contention that,even if the nrc entered a transfer agreement with new jersey,it might exclude the newfield site from the transfer.shieldalloy comment letter at.in that context shieldalloy went well beyond new jersey conduct in the nrc decommissioning proceeding.it pointed to the time and expense that shieldalloy devoted to working with the nrc staff to develop a plan for safely decommissioning the site over million in alone,which it implied would be largely wasted under new jersey different approach.id.
in response,the nrc staff noted that the legislative history for specifically states that congress did not intend to allow concurrent regulatory authority over licensees for public health and safety,and that as a result,all nrc licensees within the categories of materials for which the state requested authority will transfer to the state.nrc staff comments at.the nrc also said that a statutory provision allowing the nrc to retain authority in cases of common defense and
