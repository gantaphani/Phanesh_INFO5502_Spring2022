this case presents a question of venue,specifically,the appropriate district in which to prosecute a charge of willful failure to immediately notify the coast guard of a hazardous condition aboard a vessel.b.the crime is a continuing offense rather than a offense,and therefore the location of the crime continued into the western district of kentucky as the vessel in question proceeded from the mississippi river to the ohio.the district court in this case therefore erred in acquitting defendants on the ground that there was no criminal venue in the western district of kentucky.
on june,a barge carrying gallons of benzene down the mississippi river sprang a leak near louis,missouri.the barge was owned by canal barge and was being operated under a contract with conoco phillips to transport the benzene from wood island,illinois,to catlettsburg,kentucky.when the leak was discovered,jeffery scarborough,a canal barge employee and the pilot of the barge towboat,instructed deckhands to try sealing the leak by rubbing a bar of soap over the crack.scarborough telephoned paul barnes,the port captain in the company belle chase,louisiana,office,who directed scarborough to apply a temporary epoxy patch.with the help of deckhands,scarborough succeeded in temporarily securing the leak.captain randy martin,who had been off duty and asleep when the leak was first discovered,assumed control of the towboat later in the afternoon.
the epoxy patch held for about four days.during that time,the barge was transferred to a towboat owned by a different company on june,near cairo,illinois,at the confluence of the mississippi and ohio rivers,and continued onto the ohio river.on june,while the barge continued up the ohio river,the epoxy patch failed.the captain of the new towboat notified the coast guard office in louisville,kentucky,and the barge was dropped at a fleeting area near mount vernon,indiana,where environmental crews cleaned the benzene from the barge deck and permanently repaired the leak.
a indictment filed two years later in the western district of kentucky charged canal barge,scarborough,barnes,and martin with conspiracy to violate the ports and waterways safety act violation of the pwsa and negligent violation of the clean water act after a trial,the defendants moved for a judgment of acquittal,arguing that the government had failed to prove that venue was proper in the western district of kentucky.the district court reserved ruling on the motion,and the jury returned a guilty verdict on count,but acquitted the defendants of the remaining two counts.
defendants then renewed their motion for a judgment of acquittal on the ground of improper venue.the defendants also argued that the government had failed to introduce sufficient evidence that the proper coast guard office in louis was not notified of the june leak,and sufficient evidence that the defendants violation of the pwsa was knowing and willful.in the alternative,the defendants argued that they were entitled to a new trial because their convictions were against the weight of the evidence.additionally,martin moved separately for a judgment of acquittal,arguing that the government did not show that a hazardous condition existed on the barge while he was in charge of the vessel,and canal barge moved separately for a judgment of acquittal,contending that the government failed to prove that a canal barge employee violated the pwsa with the intent to benefit the company.
on november,the district court granted the defendants motion,concluding that the pwsa violation was a offense that was complete at the time the defendants failed to immediately notify the coast guard of the hazardous condition,which occurred on the mississippi river prior to entry into the western district of kentucky.the district court denied all of the defendants remaining motions.
on appeal,the government argues that the district court erred in granting the defendants motion for judgment of acquittal for lack of proper venue,because the defendants pwsa violation is a continuing offense under a.in the alternative,the government argues that the pwsa violation is an offense involving transportation in interstate commerce under a.
the defendants the district court denial of their motion for judgment of acquittal on the remaining grounds,arguing that the government failed to prove that the defendants did not immediately notify the nearest coast guard office of the june leak,and that the government failed to prove the elements of knowledge and willfulness.the defendants also argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motion for a new trial.finally,both martin and canal barge appeal the denial of their separate motions for judgment of acquittal for the reasons advanced in the district court.
the defendants failure to immediately report a hazardous condition aboard the barge was a continuing offense because the duty to report continued from the time the leak was discovered on june until the coast guard was notified on june.because the barge continued moving until the unreported hazardous condition was in the western district of kentucky,the pwsa violation occurred in part in the western district of kentucky.venue was therefore proper in that district under a.
for venue purposes in federal criminal cases,congress has the power to create a continuing offense by defining the locality of a crime to extend over the whole area through which force propelled by an offender operates.united states johnson.because the pwsa does not specifically define venue for criminal prosecutions,we look to the venue provision,which covers situations where the elements of the offense are committed in more than one district.a.the statute states in part 
a except as otherwise expressly provided by enactment of congress,any offense against the united states begun in one district and completed in another,or committed in more than one district,may be inquired of and prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun,continued,or completed.
a.this provision applies on its face if the offense was continued on the ohio river,which at the relevant point is entirely in the western district of kentucky.
the offense in this case was so continued.the criminal violation is the willful and knowing violation of a coast guard regulation promulgated under the pwsa,b,that in turn requires 
whenever there is a hazardous condition either aboard a vessel or caused by a vessel or its operation,the owner,agent,master,operator,or person in charge shall immediately notify the nearest coast guard sector office or group office.
the time for complying with this obligation clearly starts immediately,which means that any delay is against the regulation.contrary to the interpretation urged by the defendant and accepted by the district court,however,the immediate start of the obligation does not mean that the obligation ceases as soon as there has been some delay in reporting.the natural reading of the regulation,instead,is that the obligation to report starts immediately when the relevant actor has the relevant knowledge,and continues at least until a report is made or the coast guard otherwise becomes aware of the condition.stated differently,the purpose of the word immediately is simply to preclude a defense that the duty was discharged by giving notice several in this case,the hazard was discovered under such a natural interpretation of the regulation,venue lay in the western district of kentucky in this case.
in addition to being the most textually plausible,this reading of the regulation is also the most sensible.it would frustrate the purpose of the pwsa if the duty to report were not ongoing,because the need to notify the coast guard of a hazardous condition does not dissipate over time.the harm from an unreported hazard is more likely to increase rather than to decrease from the continued lack of a report.moreover,an unreported hazard may cause harm in more than one district.and each district through which a hazard passes has an interest in preventing that hazard from causing injury or environmental damage within the district.see united states reed,cir.
while it is certainly true that the crime was complete and chargeable shortly after the leak was discovered on june,that does not mean that the crime did not continue for venue purposes once it was sufficiently complete to ground a conviction.a crime can be both complete and continuing for venue purposes.see united states cores,united states.for example,in cores,the supreme court held that the crime of willfully remaining in the united states after the expiration of a landing permit was a continuing offense.at.the defendant argued that the offense was complete the moment the permit expired,and that even if he remained in the united states thereafter,he was no longer committing the offense.id.the court rejected this argument,explaining that the statutory prohibition against willfully remaining in the united states imposed a continuing duty on the defendant to leave the country,and his failure to leave at the moment his permit expired did not exhaust that duty.see see also,at.similarly,the failure to immediately notify the coast guard of the hazardous condition on june satisfies the definition of the crime,but it does not exhaust it.cores,at.
the defendants rely on toussie united states,in which the supreme court held that a failure to register for the draft could not be deemed a continuing offense for purposes of the statute of limitations.the defendants also cite united states del percio,cir,a decision that relied on toussie in holding that the defendants failure to submit plans and schedules for making plant modifications in violation of the atomic energy act was not a continuing offense for statute of limitations purposes.
these cases are distinguishable because they involve statutes of limitations,not questions of venue.of course,questions of venue,like statutes of limitations,involve a temporal element.however,the distinction is sensible in light of the different consequences that attach to a determination that a crime is a continuing offense for statute of limitations purposes as opposed to venue purposes.if the crime is deemed to be a continuing offense for venue purposes,the defendant is merely exposed to prosecution in a different district.but if the crime is a continuing offense for statute of limitations purposes,the defendant may be prosecuted after a time at which he would otherwise have no exposure whatsoever.thus,interpreting a crime as a continuing offense for statute of limitations purposes has more serious consequences than it does in the context of venue.indeed,the supreme court was sensitive to this concern in toussie,observing that construing failure to register for the draft as a continuing offense could effectively extend the final date for prosecution until as late as years after the crime is first complete.toussie,at.the court specifically distinguished cores and armour packing united states,two cases that dealt with venue and did not involve the statute of limitations.toussie,at.
the defendants also argue that the rule of lenity requires that any ambiguity in the statutory language must be resolved in favor of canal barge and its employees.see united states santos.however,the rule of lenity is typically invoked only when interpreting the substantive scope of a criminal statute or the severity of penalties that attach to a the venue for prosecuting the offense.see,united states,bifulco united states.santos,the case cited by the defendants,involved a question of the substantive scope of the federal statute whether the term proceeds referred to profits or the broader receipts.see at.moreover,the rule of lenity is only a tiebreaker of last resort when,after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction,we are left with an ambiguous statute.united states shabani.but here the terms of the statute,together with the purpose of the pwsa,leave no ambiguity.although the clause might have been more meticulously drafted,the grammatical possibility of a defendant interpretation does not command a resort to the rule of lenity if the interpretation proffered by the defendant reflects an implausible reading of the congressional purpose.abbott united states,quoting caron united states.
finally,the defendants argue that a narrow reading of whether the crime continued is required by johnson,in which the supreme court ruled that 
if an enactment of congress equally permits the underlying spirit of the constitutional concern for trial in the vicinage to be respected rather than to be disrespected,construction should go in the direction of constitutional policy even though not commanded by it.
at.johnson involved the federal denture act,which prohibited use of the mails or any instrumentality of interstate commerce for the purpose of sending or bringing into a district a set of dentures cast by an unlicensed dentist.the court used the constitutional concern for trial in the vicinage as a tiebreaker against the continuing offense doctrine where the statute was susceptible to two different readings.id.distinguishing the crime of sending from that of transportation in another statute,the court held that venue for illegal sending was limited to the district in which the unlawful dentures were sent,and not where the dentures were received.id.at.importantly,the court relied explicitly on the absence of a specifically applicable venue provision.id.
in response to johnson,congress added the second paragraph of a,which removes all doubt as to the venue of continuing offenses and makes unnecessary special venue provisions except in cases where congress desires to restrict the prosecution of offenses to particular districts.revision notes to a.the revision provided that a ny offense involving the use of the mails or transportation in interstate commerce is a continuing offense.although we do not rely directly on that provision in this case,the revision arguably requires a more expansive definition of a continuing offense than that applied in johnson.but see united states brennan,cir reasoning that the rule of construction announced in johnson retains its general validity notwithstanding the enactment of the second paragraph of a.furthermore,cases decided subsequently to both johnson and the enactment of the revised a provision make clear that the supreme court does not hesitate to construe a crime as a continuing offense when that is the superior interpretation of the statute.see cores,u.at,at.like the rule of lenity,the johnson rule is only a tiebreaker,and it does not overcome the more natural reading of the statute here.
for these reasons,the most sensible characterization of the offense is that the pwsa and proscribe an ongoing failure to report a hazardous condition,making venue proper in the district where the hazardous condition continued unreported.
because we conclude that the pwsa violation is a continuing offense under a,we need not address the government alternative the pwsa violation is an offense involving transportation in interstate commerce under the second paragraph of a.we also need not determine whether venue might also lie in the district where the nonreporting officer was,or where the report was supposed to be received,or where the effects of the unreported hazard may have been felt.
defendants also the denial of their motions for judgment of acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence,and their joint motion for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.because the judgment of acquittal for improper venue must be vacated,we address the remaining grounds rejected by the district court.
defendants are not entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the remaining grounds presented to the district court because the evidence was sufficient to establish the elements of the pwsa offense beyond a reasonable doubt.evidence is sufficient to support a criminal conviction if,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states beddow,cir citing jackson virginia.in cases in which we assess the sufficiency of the evidence,we do not weigh the evidence,assess the
