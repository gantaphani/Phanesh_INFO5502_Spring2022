forest guardians appeals the district court determination that the united states forest service did not violate the endangered species act when it failed to consultation on the environmental impact of cattle grazing on a plot of national forest land in arizona.forest guardians urges that the forest service was required to because it failed to comply with the criteria governing the monitoring of the grazing impact on endangered and threatened species living in the water canyon allotment of the national forests.we agree that the forest service failure to consultation on water canyon violated the endangered species act,and reverse the judgment of the district court.
endangered species act 
the endangered species act esa contains substantive and procedural provisions designed to protect species listed as threatened or endangered under the act.the substantive provision relevant to this appeal is,which prohibits federal agencies such as the forest service from taking discretionary actions that would jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species a.
an agency decision whether to take a discretionary action that may jeopardize endangered or threatened species is strictly governed by consultation procedures.id.c thomas peterson,cir t he strict substantive provisions of the esa justify more stringent enforcement of its procedural requirements,because the procedural requirements are designed to ensure compliance with the substantive provisions.first,the agency contemplating the action must request information from the appropriate federal wildlife service regarding whether any species which is listed or proposed to be listed may be present in the area of such proposed action.c.in this case,the appropriate wildlife service is the united states fish and wildlife service fws if the wildlife service determines that listed species may be present in the affected area,the agency preparing to act must produce a biological assessment in accordance with the national environmental policy act for the purpose of identifying any endangered species or threatened species which is likely to be affected by such action.id.if the biological assessment concludes that listed species are in fact likely to be adversely affected,the agency ordinarily must enter formal consultation with the wildlife service.id.a thomas,at.formal consultation requires the wildlife service to produce a biological opinion that evaluates the nature and extent of the proposed action effect on the listed species and that,if necessary,posits reasonable and prudent alternatives to the proposed action.b a pac.rivers council thomas,cir.
following the issuance of a biological assessment which determines that listed species are likely to be adversely affected,the agency may,however,attempt to avoid the lengthy and costly process of formal consultation with the service by voluntarily initiating a less rigorous regulatory procedure called informal consultation.
informal consultation is an optional process that includes all discussions,correspondence,between the fish and wildlife service and the federal agency designed to assist the federal agency in determining whether formal consultation or a conference is required.if during informal consultation it is determined by the federal agency,with the written concurrence of the fish and wildlife service,that the action is not likely to adversely affect listed species or critical habitat,the consultation process is terminated,and no further action is necessary.
id.a.in other words,regardless of whether a biological assessment concludes that a proposed action would likely adversely affect listed species,if informal consultation is initiated and results in a finding that the proposed action would not in fact have such an effect,the agency is not required to engage in formal consultation.id.
there may be an additional step in the process,however,in some cases.informal consultation must be when new information reveals effects of the action that may affect listed species or critical habitat in a manner or to an extent not previously considered,id.b,or the identified action is subsequently modified in a manner that causes an effect to the listed species or critical habitat that was not considered in the biological opinion,id.c.
the issue in this case is whether of informal consultation is required with respect to water canyon as a result of the forest service failure to comply with certain of the guidance criteria established during the initial informal consultation process regarding that allotment.we must also examine whether the case has become moot while on appeal.
factual and procedural background 
the forest service regulates livestock grazing in national forests and on other federal land under its jurisdiction.all livestock use of national forest land must be authorized by forest grazing permits,which are typically granted for terms.permits are issued for designated land allotments and must be accompanied by land management plans.id.each grazing permit and corresponding land management plan is subject to environmental analysis in accordance with federal law.see also idaho conservation league mumma,cir.
in,forest guardians and several filed a lawsuit challenging more than one thousand forest grazing permits for national forest land in arizona and new mexico.the complaint alleged that the forest service violated the esa by failing to consult with fws prior to issuing the permits.in response to the lawsuit,the forest service initiated informal consultation with fws on each challenged allotment.however,because there were so many allotments that required review,the forest service and fws streamlined the informal consultation process by agreeing to create general protocols called guidance criteria.the guidance criteria consisted of certain factual conditions which,if satisfied,would cause fws to agree that a not likely to adversely affect finding would be appropriate.thus,if the forest service would ensure that the guidance criteria conditions were met with respect to a given allotment,the agency was permitted to presume that fws concurred in the not likely to adversely affect finding for that allotment.
forest guardians action targeted,among others,the grazing permit for the water canyon allotment,which covers approximately acres of the national forests in arizona.water canyon is home to numerous species,including the mexican spotted owl and the little colorado spinedace,a type of minnow.the allotment land management plan permitted cow calf pairs to graze for four months annually.the management plan established maximum utilization levels for each grazed pasture in the allotment it assigned to ten pastures a percent level and to the remaining four pastures a percent level.the plan also required that the forest service,at a minimum,monitor the utilization levels of each grazed pasture at the of the scheduled use period.the plan recommended additional monitoring prior to livestock entry and at the end of the use period,but measuring was compulsory because it would allow the forest service to make operational changes if necessary to reflect actual range conditions.
in august,the forest service and fws entered into an agreement establishing guidance criteria that governed livestock grazing pursuant to water canyon land management plan.the agreement adopted the management plan environmental requirements.it explained that the monitoring of the utilization levels was critical to the continued existence of the affected species and emphasized that the mexican spotted owl required forage sufficient to provide habitat for its rodent prey species.it also stated that restricted utilization levels were important because they allowed for controlled fires that reduced the risk of catastrophic wildfire in the region.the agreement provided that,for the life of each grazing permit,yearly confirmation throughout the lifetime of the permit must take place to ensure the criteria for those findings continue to be met.in other words,the forest service was allowed to presume annual concurrence by fws in the not likely to adversely affect finding only if it confirmed each year that the guidance criteria were being satisfied.
in september,as a result of the adoption of the guidance criteria for the water canyon allotment,the forest service issued a not likely to adversely affect biological assessment with respect to several species including the mexican spotted owl and the little colorado spinedace.on june,the forest service issued a notice of decision to permit grazing on water canyon.the grazing permits took effect that year.
in april,forest guardians commenced this lawsuit under the citizen suits provision of the esa,g.its complaint alleged that the forest service violated the esa by not consultation after the agency failed over several years to meet the guidance criteria for approximately thirty national forest allotments,including water canyon.specifically,forest guardians alleged that the forest service had failed to conduct adequate annual monitoring of utilization levels on numerous grazed allotments identified in the complaint and that,as a result,the continuing not likely to adversely affect findings for those allotments were invalid.it contended that of consultation was required to obtain fws annual concurrence in the findings because such concurrence could no longer be presumed.the complaint sought declaratory judgment that the forest service actions violated the esa and an injunction requiring the agency to consultation on the challenged allotments.
the district court addressed,several times,the forest service alleged failure to monitor utilization levels on the challenged allotments.in an order dated october,the court rejected forest guardians argument that each instance in which the forest service failed to monitor in accordance with the management plans and guidance criteria per se triggered of consultation.in doing so,however,the district court noted 
monitoring the effectiveness of the utilization standards is the specified mechanism by which the defendant ensures that grazing on an allotment is not likely to adversely affect endangered and protected species.this explains why the biological assessments tie the not likely to adversely affect determinations to utilization levels and why they require ongoing monitoring of grazing utilization.
the district court nevertheless found that inadequate monitoring by itself could not trigger under without a showing that noncompliance has modified the agency action to an extent that causes an affect sic not previously considered.
on march,following for summary judgment,the district court issued a summary judgment order addressing each allotment challenged by forest guardians.the court found that the forest service was required to consultation on some allotments but that it was not required to do so for several others,including water canyon.with respect to the water canyon allotment,the district court found that monitoring on this large allotment leaves much to be desired.
the undisputed evidence showed that,in,only one pasture on the water canyon allotment was monitored for utilization level compliance notwithstanding the fact that three pastures were grazed.several sites on that one pasture were measured,and each measurement taken at the of the use term for that pasture was less than percent.in,the forest service again monitored only one pasture although several were grazed.that time,one of the four measurements was percent,which exceeded the allowable percent level.no operational changes were made to accommodate the excessive utilization.in,the forest service conducted no monitoring of one grazed pasture,although it did do so for two others.in,two of the three recorded sites on the single monitored pasture exceeded measured percent and the other percent,with both measurements taken at the end of the grazing season.
despite these findings for water canyon,the district court concluded that of consultation on the allotment was not required.it based its conclusion primarily on evidence that,in and,only pairs grazed water canyon instead of the that the biological assessment concluded would support a not likely to adversely affect finding.the district court reasoned as follows because utilization levels correspond to stocking levels,even though monitoring has been inadequate,the court finds that the required utilization levels for the allotment are in place.it found that the inadequate monitoring was sufficient to establish that the guidance criteria supporting the not likely to adversely affect finding were met.the district court entered judgment on april.
forest guardians appealed the district court judgment only with respect to the water canyon allotment.on october,just two days before the forest service filed its responsive brief,it consultation on water canyon as a part of that process,it sent fws notice that the original effects determinations have not changed and therefore the continued grazing would not likely adversely affect any listed species on the allotment,including the mexican spotted owl and the little colorado spinedace.fws subsequently concurred in writing in the forest service not likely to adversely affect finding.
the first issue that we must address is jurisdictional.the forest service contends that this appeal is moot because the agency consultation on water canyon and subsequently received fws concurrence in its renewed not likely to adversely affect finding.the forest service argues that,as a result of this recent,there is no effective relief that the district court can grant.
federal courts lack jurisdiction to consider moot questions or to declare principles or rules of law which can not affect the matter in issue in the case before it.church of scientology of cal.united states,d quoting mills green.an action is moot if it has lost its character as a present,live controversy.am.rivers marine fisheries,cir.the party asserting mootness bears the burden of establishing that there is no effective relief that the court can provide.or.barter fair jackson county,cir.that burden is heavy a case is not moot where any effective relief may be granted.northwest envtl.defense ctr.gordon,cir.
the only court of appeals case cited by the forest service in its effort to meet its burden is southern utah wilderness alliance smith,cir.in suwa,the plaintiff alleged that the bureau of land management blm violated of the esa by failing to consult with fws on a management plan for blm land that was home to a listed species of plant life.at.the management plan required blm to close certain access routes used by vehicles but to leave open several others.id.at.the plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive,it requested a stay of the management plan pending consultation regarding the impact on the listed plant life of vehicle use on the access routes.id.while the matter was pending in the district court,blm initiated and completed consultation with fws on the challenged plan.the district court subsequently ruled against the plaintiff on the merits and also found that the action was moot as a result of the consultation.id.at.the tenth circuit affirmed,ruling that t here is no point in ordering an action that has already taken place.id.at.however,the court expressly narrowed its holding 
this is not to say that a violation of section a could always be cured by subsequent consultation,nor is this general approval for consultation after the fact.instead,this merely recognizes that the changed circumstances of this particular case no longer present an opportunity for meaningful relief a declaratory judgment would serve no purpose in this case.this case does not involve a continuing violation or practice,and suwa has not shown that the defendants are likely to violate section a in the near future.a declaratory judgment would not affect the matter,and would be in the nature of an advisory opinion.
suwa is distinguishable in two critical ways from the case before us.first,our case does involve a continuing practice.the grazing permit for water canyon has a term and requires that the forest service obtain from fws annual concurrence that the guidance criteria governing
