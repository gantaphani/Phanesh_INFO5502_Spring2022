dupont de nemours,dupont instituted this contract disputes act action to recover costs it incurred pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla for an ordnance plant it built and operated for the government during world war ii.on the parties for summary judgment,the united states court of federal claims entered judgment for the government.dupont de nemours united states,fed.cl.the trial court correctly held that the government had agreed to indemnify dupont for the costs at issue.id.at.it erred,however,in concluding that a predecessor to the act,current version at,bars dupont recovery.id.at.accordingly,we reverse the judgment in favor of the government and remand for a determination of damages and entry of judgment in favor of dupont.
background 
in,the government commissioned dupont to construct and operate a plant in morgantown,west virginia,to produce chemicals for the government use in producing munitions for world war ii.the contract at issue,contract no,entered into on november,the mow contract,provided that dupont would acquire the site for the plant and design,construct,and operate it in exchange for reimbursement of its costs plus a fixed fee.the government would own the plant and all of its production.
the cost reimbursement provision of the mow contract reimbursement clause provided as follows 
the contractor shall be reimbursed in the manner hereinafter described for such of its actual expenditures in the performance of the work under this contract,heretofore or hereafter incurred,as may be approved or ratified by the contracting officer and as are included in the following items 
losses,expenses,and damages,not compensated by insurance or otherwise including settlements made with the written consent of the contracting officer,actually sustained by the contractor in connection with the work and found and certified by the contracting officer as not having resulted from personal failure on the part of the corporate officers of the contractor or of other representatives of the contractor having supervision and direction of the operation of the plant as a whole,to exercise good faith or that degree of care which they normally exercise in the conduct of the contractor business.
mow contract,article k.the mow contract also included the following indemnification provision indemnification clause 
it is the understanding of the parties hereto,and the intention of this contract,that all work under this title iii is to be performed at the expense of the government and that the government shall hold dupont harmless against any loss,expense including expense of litigation,or damage including damage to third persons because of death,bodily injury or property injury or destruction or otherwise of any kind whatsoever arising out of or in connection with the performance of the work under this title iii,except to the extent that such loss,expense,damage or liability is due to the personal failure on the part of the corporate officers of dupont,or of other representatives of dupont having supervision or direction of the operation of the plant as a whole,to exercise good faith or that degree of care which they normally exercise in the conduct of dupont business.
mow contract,article.
in,the government terminated the mow contract and entered into a supplemental agreement with dupont the termination supplement.neither dupont nor the government was able to locate a copy of the termination supplement,but the trial court credited dupont evidence that the termination supplement included the following provisions 
c upon payment of said sum of as aforesaid,all rights and liabilities of the parties under the contract and under the act insofar as it pertains to the contract,shall cease and be forever released except 
claims by dupont against the government which are based upon responsibility of dupont to third parties and which involve costs reimbursable under the contract,but which are not now known to dupont.
all rights and liabilities of the parties under the contract articles,if any,applicable to options except options to continue or increase the work under the contract,covenants not to compete,covenants of indemnity,and agreements with respect to the future care and disposition by dupont of facilities remaining in his custody.
termination supplement,articles c the unknown claims clause c the preservation of indemnity clause,respectively.the government does not challenge the trial court finding that the termination supplement included these provisions.
the united states environmental protection agency epa notified dupont in that it was proposing to list the mow site on the national priorities list for pursuant to cercla ultimately,on april,dupont and several other potentially responsible parties agreed,pursuant to a consent order with epa,to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study regarding the site.dupont incurred in attorney and consulting fees as a result.
after dupont received no response to the claim it filed pursuant to the contract disputes act,with the contracting officer for the army corps of engineers to recover its costs in,and after its subsequent negotiations with the government failed,dupont filed the present action.
on for summary judgment on the issue of liability,the trial court found,as noted above,that the termination supplement included the unknown claims and preservation of indemnity clauses.dupont,fed.cl.at.it held,further,that both the indemnification and reimbursement clauses in the mow contract were drafted broadly enough to be properly interpreted to place the risk of unknown liabilities on the government,including liability for costs incurred pursuant to cercla.id.at.the trial court concluded,nonetheless,that recovery was barred by the act,and its predecessors ada,stating 
t he act and its predecessors prohibit the inclusion of indemnification clauses in government contracts without specific appropriation or statutory authority.even though the indemnification clause was included in this contract and it is quite reasonable to assume that both the contracting officer and the contractor believed this clause to place the risk of virtually all liabilities on the government rather than the contractor,the state of the law compels us to hold this clause to be void and unenforceable.
dupont,fed.cl.at.the court rejected dupont argument that the act of july,stat,specifically,its authorization of the government use of contracts exempted the mow contract from the reach of the ada.dupont,fed.cl.at.it did not address,either in granting the government summary judgment motion or in denying dupont motion for reconsideration,dupont argument that it is entitled to recovery because another statute,the contract settlement act of,exempted the termination supplement from the ada.
dupont appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review conclusions of law of the court of federal claims,including as to the interpretation of contracts,without deference,and its findings of fact for clear error.scott timber united states.we review de novo a grant of summary judgment by the court of federal claims,drawing all justifiable inferences of fact in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.id.at citing winstar united states,en banc.
contract interpretation 
as noted above,the trial court read both the reimbursement clause and the indemnification clause as obligating the government to reimburse dupont for the costs it incurred pursuant to cercla.regardless of whether that conclusion was correct as to the reimbursement clause,we agree that the indemnification clause is properly construed to include dupont costs 
the indemnification clause recites the government express agreement to hold dupont harmless against any loss,expense including expense of litigation,or damage including damage to third persons because of death,bodily injury or property injury or destruction or otherwise of any kind whatsoever as long as the loss,expense,or damage aris es out of or in connection with the performance of the work under this title iii namely,the production of anhydrous ammonia at the mow 
such loss,expense,damages or liability is not due to the personal failure on the part of the corporate officers of dupont,or of other representatives of dupont having supervision or direction of the operation of the plant as a whole,to exercise good faith or that degree of care which they normally exercise in the conduct of the contractor business.
mow contract,article emphases added.the indemnity language of this provision any expense.of any kind whatsoever is clearly sufficiently broad on its face to include dupont liability,and the government does not assert that either of the subsequently recited limiting conditions nullifies any government indemnification obligation instead,the government urges that contract terms allegedly promising indemnification for costs of complying with environmental laws be strictly construed.it acknowledges,though,the absence of federal authority for its position in this regard,and further admits that the rule of strict construction in these circumstances is not universally followed.in any event,no rule of construction strict or justify interpreting a provision that on its face promises indemnification for any expense of any kind whatsoever to exclude dupont cercla costs.see elf atochem am.united states,in order for a indemnification clause to cover cercla liability,courts have uniformly held that the clause must be either specific enough to include cercla liability or general enough to include any and all environmental liability which would,naturally,include subsequent cercla claims.quoting beazer,mead,cir.as the court in elf atochem explained,where the clause in question contains no limiting language,and shows an intent to allocate all possible liabilities among the parties,cercla liability must be included among the future unknown liabilities which the parties allocated between themselves.id.at quoting smithkline beecham rohm haas,and citing olin consol.aluminum,aff,cir concluding that a provision stating that conalco releases and settles all claims of any nature which conalco now has or hereafter could have against olin included cercla liability.
thus we reject the government theory that the parties inability,as of the time they entered into the mow contract or the termination supplement,to conceive of cercla justifies reading the indemnification clause to exclude cercla costs.the government identifies no basis in the law for reading a limitation of foreseeability into that provision,the language of which any loss,expense or damage of any kind whatsoever evidences contemplation of just the indemnification was available for all claims,foreseeable or not.besides,while the parties could not have anticipated the precise contours of cercla liability,cercla evolved from the doctrine of common law nuisance.see senate comm.on environment public works,environmental emergency response act,at another source of legal precedent for strict liability for hazardous substance disposal sites or contaminated areas is nuisance theory.suppose operations at the mow facility during the period had resulted in the contamination of the groundwater of nearby parcels,and dupont had been sued under the extant nuisance law in the years following termination of the mow contract by the surrounding landowners for resultant injuries to themselves and their livestock.the government can not in good faith contend that such claims would have been exempt from reimbursement under the terms of the indemnification clause,and it conceded as much at oral argument.further,we agree with the trial court that the language of the mow contract shows an intent to allocate all possible liabilities among the parties.dupont,fed.cl.at quoting elf atochem.at.as between dupont and the government,then,the indemnification clause must be read as allocating the burden of the liability in question to the government.
as noted above,the mow contract is no longer in effect,having been supplanted by the termination supplement the parties executed in.however,the termination supplement,which apparently included no termination or expiration date,specifically exempted a ll rights and liabilities of the parties under the mow contract articles applicable to covenants of indemnity from the release of the rights and obligations it otherwise effected.termination supplement,article c.accordingly,the governments obligation to indemnify dupont for liabilities arising out of or in connection with the performance of the work it undertook pursuant to the mow contract,which we regard as including dupont costs,remains in effect.
ii.the act 
the predecessor to the ada in effect at the time the parties entered into both the mow contract and the termination supplement provided,in relevant part 
no executive department or other government establishment of the united states shall expend,in any one fiscal year,any sum in excess of appropriations made by congress for that fiscal year,or involve the government in any contract or other obligation for the future payment of money in excess of such appropriations unless such contract or obligation is authorized by law.
current version at.as discussed above,the trial court accepted the government argument that the indemnification clause,as construed and,it follows,the preservation of indemnity clause in the termination supplement,is unenforceable because it violates the ada.
the enforceability of what the trial court termed an indemnification clause in the face of the ada had not previously been decided.the trial court found guidance,however,in decisions interpreting the ada as a bar to inferring indemnification clauses in government contracts.dupont,fed.cl.at.for example,in refusing to permit former government contractors to recover the expenses they incurred in defending and settling tort claims arising out of their production of agent orange for the governments use in the vietnam war,the supreme court stated 
there is also reason to think that a contracting officer would not agree to the indemnification alleged here.the act bars a federal employee or agency from entering into a contract for future payment of money in advance of,or in excess of,an existing appropriation.
hercules,united states,d.and in united states,the united states claims court held that the ada defeated claims for implied indemnification brought by asbestos manufacturers who had paid damages to world war workers with diseases.thus,concluded the trial court in the present case,the ada also bars the enforcement of express indemnification clauses.
we do not question the trial court reasoning,but we need not further consider its conclusion in this regard.in its appeal,dupont does not take issue with the trial court interpretation or application of the ada apparent general prohibition of contractual commitments.it relies,instead,on the exception the statute recites unless such contract or obligation is authorized by law.specifically,contends dupont,the contract settlement act of is the authoriz ation by law that exempts the preservation of indemnity clause and,therefore,the indemnification clause from the reach of the ada 
iii.contract settlement act 
the contract settlement act of csa,et,expressly declares its objectives,which include assur ing to prime contractors and subcontractors,small and large,speedy and equitable final settlement of claims under terminated war contracts.id.according to dupont,section of the csa authorized the government contracting agency then,the war department to give the indemnification at issue.in relevant part,that section provides 
each contracting agency shall have authority,notwithstanding any provisions of law other than contained in this chapter,to make any contract necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions of this chapter to amend by agreement any existing contract,either before or after notice of its termination,on such terms and to such extent as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions of this chapter and in settling any termination claim,to agree to assume,or indemnify the war contractor against,any claims by any person in connection with such termination claims or settlement.
id.a emphases added.
the government does not dispute that the csa exempts certain contracts from the operation of the ada,nor could it,given the bestowal of contracting authority notwithstanding any provisions of law other than contained in this chapter emphasis added.as dupont points out,other similarly worded in relevant respect statutes have been construed to confer indemnification authority.see hercules.at citing,pursuant to which t he president may authorize any department or agency to enter into contracts or into amendments or modifications of contracts heretofore or hereafter made and to make advance payments thereon,without regard to other provisions of law relating to the making,performance,amendment,or modification of contracts.at acknowledging that the first war powers act,stat,which granted the president the power to allow departments or agencies involved in world war ii to enter into contracts and into amendments or modifications of contracts without regard to the provisions of law relating to the making,performance,amendment,or modification of contracts,can be construed as granting the president the authority to delegate to departments and agencies contracting power virtually unfettered by contract law,including the ada the parties differ,however,as to whether the csa exempted the indemnification provision at issue from the ada.as noted above,that provision is the preservation of indemnity clause in the termination supplement,the latter having terminated the mow contract.
preliminarily,we note that the termination supplement was signed by the parties in,two years after the csa was enacted.accordingly,the preservation of indemnity clause and the other provisions of the termination supplement enjoys the benefit of whatever ada dispensation the csa conferred.the government did not originate an indemnification commitment in the termination supplement.rather,it agreed to uphold the indemnification commitment it made in the mow the csa was enacted.see preservation of indemnity clause all rights and liabilities of the parties under the mow contract shall cease and be forever released except a ll rights and liabilities of the parties under the contract articles applicable to covenants of indemnity.the government does not challenge the enforceability of the preservation of indemnity clause on the theory that it merely preserved an indemnification promise made without authority in.however,to the extent the enforceability of the preservation of indemnity clause is subject to question on that ground,we agree with dupont that,by expressly exempting covenants of indemnity from the rights and liabilities of the parties released by the termination supplement,the government ratified its earlier promise.to conclude otherwise would render illusory the government agreement to retain those rights and liabilities recited in the preservation of indemnity clause.we further agree that the csa authorized such ratification in stating 
whenever any formal or technical defect or omission in any prime contract,or in any grant of authority to an officer or agent of a contracting agency who ordered any materials,services,and facilities might invalidate the contract or commitment,the contracting agency shall not take advantage of such defect or omission shall amend,confirm,or ratify such contract or commitment without consideration in order to cure such defect or omission 
emphases added.thus,even if the government lacked authority,by virtue of the ada or otherwise to make the indemnification commitment it made in the mow contract,its express agreement in the termination supplement to maintain its indemnification obligation was authorized to the extent the csa precludes application of the ada.
the government notes that the express indemnification authority provided by section a is limited to the resolution of termination claims.relying,then,on the csa definition of termination claim any claim or demand by a war contractor for fair compensation for the termination of any war contract and any other claim under a terminated war contract,which regulations prescribed under this chapter authorize to be asserted and settled in connection with any termination settlement,id.h,the government argues that its indemnification authority is limited to provid ing suitable compensation for work performed under a terminated contract,and cites,as an example,indemnifying the contractor against claims by direct employees or vendors.the government focus on section a and its acknowledgement that it possessed some indemnification authority at the time it signed the termination supplement leads us to conclude that it concedes that the war department was settling a termination claim pursuant to section a when it made the agreement the termination supplement memorializes.the government disputes only the breadth of that authority,contending that the indemnification authority conferred by section a does not extend to an indemnification commitment broad enough to encompass dupont cercla liability.there are several problems with this position.first,the express authorization that section a provides for indemnification agreements authorizes indemnification against any claims by any person in connection with such termination claims or settlement.id.a emphasis added.this indemnification authority thus can not be read as limited to claims by a limited class of third parties,for example,employees or vendors of the contractor.and although the authority conferred by section a is apparently limited to claims that are themselves in connection with termination claims or settlement,we can not ignore the phrase or settlement at the end of the sentence.the csa does not define settlement or termination settlement.however,by distinguishing between termination claims,on the one hand,and a settlement,on the other,the language of the statute makes clear that congress intended to provide contracting agencies the flexibility to negotiate concerning two classes of claims that might concern war contractors being terminated.to the extent a contractor came into termination negotiations having already had one or more claims asserted against it,the contracting agency had the authority to agree to assume those existing termination claims.the language of section a indicates that congress was cognizant,however,that contractors undergoing termination would also be concerned about potential future,unknown,unasserted claims they might face.accordingly,congress gave contracting agencies the power to resolve,as between the government and the contractor,those unknown,unasserted future claims as well,by agreeing to indemnify the war contractor against any claims by any person in connection with such settlement.thus we construe section a as having conferred the authority to deal with both categories of claims and,in particular,to have authorized the war department to confirm,in the settlement represented by the termination supplement,the broad indemnification commitment it first made in the mow contract.
that this interpretation is appropriate is evident when subsection is read in its statutory context.section a begins by dispensing with any limitations on contracting authority found anywhere other than in the csa.id.next,subsections and of section a are grants of contracting authority separate from and in addition to those found in section a,to make any contract necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions of this chapter and to amend by agreement any existing contract,either before or after notice of its termination,on such terms and to such extent as the contracting agency deems necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions of this chapter,respectively.id.a,a by their own terms,these grants are unfettered save for the requirement of fidelity to the purposes of the csa.the expansive language of section,we believe,evinces congress resolve to facilitate the termination of war contracts so as to,inter alia,expedite reconversion from war production to civilian production as war conditions permit and assure to prime contractors speedy and equitable final settlement of claims under terminated war contracts.id.a,b 
although we believe the statut
