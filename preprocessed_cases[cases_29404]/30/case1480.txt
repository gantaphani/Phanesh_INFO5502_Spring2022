the national association of home builders nahb and collectively,the appellants appeal the dismissal of their challenge to the issuance of certain permits by the united states army corps of engineers corps pursuant to section e of the clean water act cwa.the district court granted summary judgment to the corps,concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain any of the appellants claims because the corps issuance of the permits did not constitute final agency action subject to judicial review under the administrative procedure act apa.see ass of home builders united states army corps of eng rs,d,reprinted in joint appendix at.we disagree the appellants claims,with one exception,are cognizable.accordingly,we reverse the district court in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the cwa aims to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters,a,by prohibiting the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters of the united,that is,by permit,see id.a.the cwa divides the authority to issue permits to discharge pollutants between the united states environmental protection agency and the united states secretary of the army,acting through the corps,conferring on the latter the power to issue permits for discharges of dredged or fill material only.id.a.responsibility for the administration of the permitting regime falls to the corps district and division engineers.see a.
the corps issues a permit under section of the cwa either on a general permit or a individual permit basis.a,e.the corps issues a general permit on a state,regional,or nationwide basis for any category of activities involving discharges of dredged or fill material.id.e see also h.before issuing a general permit for a category of activities,the corps must determine that the activities in such category are similar in nature,will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed separately,and will have only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the environment.e see also h.a general permit has a,no longer than five may be revoked or modified if the authorized activities have an adverse impact on the environment or are more appropriately authorized by individual permits.e.
the corps individual permit process is,by contrast,a longer,more comprehensive procedure.new hanover township united states army corps of eng rs,cir.the corps makes a formal decision on an individual application following documentation and analysis,public interest review,public notice and comment and,if necessary,a public hearing.see id,see also home builders ass of greater chicago united states army corps of eng rs,cir.if the corps initially denies an individual application,the applicant may challenge that determination through an administrative appeals process.see.indeed,a disappointed applicant must exhaust his administrative remedies before heading to federal court.see id.
thus a party desiring to discharge fill or dredged material into our nation navigable waters may do so in either of two ways.see new hanover township,at.if the proposed discharge activity is covered by a general permit,the party may proceed without obtaining an individual permit or,in some cases,even without giving the corps notice of the discharge.see e in most cases,permittees may proceed with activities authorized by nationwide general permits without notifying the district engineer.new hanover township,at discharger may simply operate under the general permit without informing the corps in advance unless the general permit in question requires advance approval from the corps.on the other hand,if the proposed discharge is not covered by a general permit,the party must secure an individual permit before undertaking the discharge.see a.a party that discharges without meeting the conditions of a general permit or obtaining an individual permit faces both civil and criminal enforcement actions.see.
this litigation involves several nationwide permits,or nwps,a species of general permit designed to minimize delays and paperwork for projects with minimal environmental impact.see b.the corps has issued this kind of permit for intervals since,see ass of home builders,d at public notice concerning changes to nationwide permit,fed.reg,july,including the once but now defunct nwp,see final notice of issuance,reissuance,and modification of nationwide permits,fed.reg,noting activities were authorized by nwp in alone.there are currently nwps in activities ranging from housing nwp to mining activities nwp to cranberry production activities nwp that are subject to general conditions gcs regarding matters like soil erosion and sediment controls gc and notification gc.see issuance of nationwide permits notice,fed.reg.in their current version,the assorted nwps,applicable conditions and relevant definitions span nearly pages in the federal register.see id.at.
in,the corps proposed to reissue a number of existing nwps,albeit with modifications,that were otherwise set to expire on january.see proposal to issue,reissue,and modify nationwide permits public hearing,fed.reg.june.as to nwp,which,at the time,authorized a party to discharge dredged or fill materials affecting up to ten acres of water into headlands and isolated wetlands without an individual permit and required only notice to a corps district engineer of any discharge causing loss or substantial adverse modification of one to ten acres of wetlands,the corps gave public notice sought comment changes to its notification timeline and acreage threshold limits.see id.at.it also notified the public that it planned to initiate a process to regionalize nwp to further improve its effectiveness.id.
following public comment,the corps decided to replace nwp with general permits.see final notice of issuance,reissuance,and modification of nationwide permits,fed.reg.to allow ample time to develop replacement permits,however,it reissued nwp for a period but with more stringent conditions.see id.at.in july,the corps published a proposed suite of general permits to replace nwp,see proposal to issue and modify nationwide permits,fed reg.july,and extended,once more,the life of nwp until december,or the effective date of the new and modified nwps,whichever comes first,proposal to issue and modify nationwide permits notice,fed.reg,july.that same month the corps also reissued the nwp regarding housing nwp,but reduced the authorized maximum acreage impact from to acre.see final notice of modification of nationwide permit for single family housing,fed.reg.
the corps issued a second proposed set of nwps to replace nwp one year later.see fed.reg.at.in march,following another round of public comment,the corps promulgated permits consisting of five new nwps and six modified nwps,all intended to replace nwp.see final notice of issuance and modification of nationwide permits,fed.reg.with some of the nwps,the corps reduced the authorized maximum acreage impact from ten acres to acre and required preconstruction notification for impacts greater than acre.see fed.reg.at.although december,preceded the effective date of the replacement permits,the corps nevertheless decided to have nwp expire the same day the new permits took.compare fed.reg.at extending nwp expiration date to june,with final notice of issuance and modification of nationwide permits,fed.reg,making june,the correct effective date for the new and modified nwps,as well as the correct expiration date for nwp.
the corps new permits prompted three law suits the district court eventually consolidated into one.the nahb suit was filed on february,followed by the nssga suit on march,and the nfib suit on june.together,the three suits allege four claims against the corps,to wit it exceeded its statutory authority under the cwa by imposing certain permit conditions it acted arbitrarily and capriciously,in violation of the apa,a,by failing to provide a rational basis for its permit acreage thresholds it violated the regulatory flexibility act rfa,et,by failing to evaluate the potential impact of the permits on small businesses and other small entities as well as alternatives to the permits and it violated the national environmental policy act nepa,et,by failing to prepare a programmatic environmental impact statement peis for the permits.the national resources defense council and the sierra club the intervenors intervened in the district court proceedings in support of the corps.
the appellants moved for summary judgment on february.the corps and intervenors responded with motions for summary judgment of their own on june.while the parties for summary judgment lay pending,on january,the corps reissued all nwps,including the eleven march nwps it issued to replace nwp,to make their expiration dates coincide,thereby reduc ing confusion regarding the expiration of the nwps and the administrative burden of reissuing nwps at different times.see fed.reg.at.in november,the district court granted summary judgment to the corps,concluding that the corps issuance of the new nwps and general conditions,while constituting the completion of a decisionmaking process,does not constitute a final agency action because no legally binding action has taken place as to any given project until either an individual permit application is denied or an enforcement action is instituted.ass of home builders,d at.calling the general permit program the first step of a larger permitting process that enables the agency to streamline the overall process by limiting the pool of applicants at the of the process,the district court concluded that a party not eliminated from the applicant pool must simply apply for an individual permit and,consequently,is not legally denied anything until his individual permit is rejected.id.at.
the appellants now appeal the district court judgment,which we review de novo.see,mylan,thompson.
the jurisdictional infirmity the lower court found fatal to this case was the want of a final agency action subject to judicial review that is only one of the issues,however,joined by the parties and requiring our resolution.first,we consider whether the corps took final agency action subject to challenge under the apa and,if so,whether the appellants challenge is otherwise ripe for judicial review.next,we address whether the appellants may challenge the corps compliance with the rfa and,again,whether that challenge is ripe.finally,we review the appellants standing vel non to challenge the corps compliance with nepa.
where,as here,no more specific statute provides for judicial review,the apa empowers a federal court to review a final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.see home builders ass of greater chicago,at.t wo conditions,the united states supreme court tells us,must be satisfied for agency action to be final.bennett spear,d.first,the action must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.and second,the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow.id.at.internal quotation marks citations omitted.in other words,an agency action is final if,as the supreme court has said,it is definitive and has a direct and immediate effect on the business of the party challenging it,ftc standard oil,d quoting citing abbott labs.gardner,d,overruled on other grounds by califano sanders,d see also reliable automatic sprinkler consumer prod.safety comm n,or if,as our court has said,it imposes an obligation,denies a right or fixes some legal relationship.reliable automatic sprinkler,at citing role models,white.there can be little doubt that under these standards the corps issuance of the nwps challenged by the appellants constitutes final agency action subject to judicial review 
we need not tarry long on the finality test first prong plainly,the corps issuance of the revised nwps mark s the consummation of its decisionmaking process.bennett,at.there is nothing tentative or interlocutory about the issuance of permits allowing any party who meets certain conditions to discharge fill and dredged material into navigable waters.the intervenors argue,however,that,by setting terms and conditions for nwps,the corps did not finally decide that a discharger must comply with those terms and conditions,nor did the corps finally deny authorization for discharges that exceed those terms and conditions.intervenors br.at.in their view,a discharger remains free to pursue an individual or general permit that is free of those restrictions.intervenors br.at.the district court similarly opined that a party whose activities do not meet the conditions set by the nwps has not been denied anything until he has exhausted all of his permit options.ass of home builders,d at.this is so,said the district court,because the general permit program,in effect,is the first step of a larger permitting process that enables the agency to streamline the overall process by limiting the pool of applicants at the of the process.id.if the issuance of the nwps had merely altered the procedural framework for obtaining the corps permission to discharge fill or dredged material into navigable waters,the district court advanced by the be sound.a requirement that a party participate in additional administrative proceedings is different in kind and legal effect from the burdens attending what heretofore has been considered to be final agency action.standard oil,at.we have in fact noted that the doctrine of finality would be no more than an empty box if the mere denial of a procedural advantage constituted final agency action subject to judicial review.alcoa united states.
but the nwps do not simply work a change in the corps permitting procedures,thereby disadvantaging some within the class of dischargers.the nwps are not a definitive,but otherwise idle,statement of agency carry legal consequences for the appellants and other dischargers.admittedly,our precedent announces no,rule in this regard the finality inquiry is a pragmatic and flexible one.see,epa,w e are to apply the finality requirement in a flexible and pragmatic way.quoting citing abbott,at.nevertheless,if an epa directive forbidding the use of human test data to evaluate pesticides effects constituted final agency action subject to judicial review before the epa invoked it against any pesticide applicant,see croplife am.epa,and a federal communications commission decision putting the burden on telephone companies to show their entitlement to certain costs was suitable for judicial review before any telephone company was denied costs,see mountain states.fcc,the corps issuance of nwps likewise satisfies the second prong of the finality test.to our mind,all three constitute challenges to agency action with legal consequences that are binding on both petitioners and the agency.croplife,at see also mountain states,at.
the corps nwps create legal rights and impose binding obligations insofar as they authorize certain discharges of dredged and fill material into navigable waters without any detailed,review by the corps engineers.see,fed.reg.at the terms and limits of the new and modified nwps are intended to authorize activities that have minimal adverse effects on the aquatic environment,individually and cumulatively.the direct and immediate consequence of these authorizations for the appellants business is not hard to understand while some builders can discharge immediately,others can not.if the appellants planned activities do not meet the applicable nwp conditions and thresholds,they have two options.they can either put their projects on hold and run the corps gauntlet or modify the projects to meet the conditions.either way,through increased delay or project modification,the nwps directly affect the investment and project development choices of those whose activities are subject to the cwa.indeed,the corps itself appreciated that its permits would influence project design.many project proponents,it noted,will design their projects to comply with the acre limit so that they can qualify for an nwp and receive authorization more quickly than they could through the standard permit process.fed.reg.at.we would be hard pressed,and in fact decline,to conclude that the nwps do not impose an obligation,den y a right or fix some legal relationship.reliable automatic sprinkler,at.
in addition,the intervenors argue that environmental groups,such as themselves,may challenge the corps issuance of nwps as final agency action but the appellants may not.this is so,they say,because an environmental group would challenge the discharges authorized by the is,it would oppose an agency the appellants challenge the corps failure to authorize certain is,they seek to compel agency action.the appellants seek to compel agency action in this instance,the intervenors maintain,because the corps did not finally decide that a discharger must comply with the nwp terms and conditions,nor did the corps finally deny authorization for discharges that exceed those terms and conditions.intervenors br.at.thus dischargers such as the appellants remain free to pursue an individual or general permit.intervenors br.at.it is true that a party seeking to challenge an agency failure to act faces a different burden from that borne by a challenger of agency action.an action to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed,is similar to a petition for mandamus and we apply a standard to determine if the agency has a duty to act and if it has unreasonably delayed in discharging that duty.in re am.rivers,see also telecomms.research action ctr.fcc.a challenge to agency action,by contrast,is simply resolved according to the apa.but the case on which the intervenors principally ground their utah wilderness alliance,d tends only to demonstrate why the oppose action dichotomy does not make the corps action as to the appellants.in utah wilderness alliance,various environmental groups challenged the bureau of land management failure to protect public lands from damage allegedly caused by vehicles.see id.at.at the outset,the supreme court noted that f ailures to act are sometimes remediable under the apa,but not always,and ultimately held that the blm failure was not reviewable because a claim under can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take,id.at emphases in utah wilderness alliance,and the blm did not fail to take required action,id.at.here the appellants challenge not the corps failure to,the omission of an action without formally rejecting a request,id.at unreasonable under apa section instead,they attack the nwps the corps did issue as arbitrary and capricious and beyond its permitting authority under apa section a.because the corps nwps mark the completion of the corps process and affect the appellants operations,they constitute final agency action regardless of the fact that the corps action might carry different or no consequences for a different challenger,such as an environmental group.in any event,the notion that dischargers like the appellants nevertheless remain free to pursue an individual or general permit suggests a a.see office of communication of united church of christ fcc,fcc refusal to adopt policy and presumption that broadcast license transfer in less than three years is contrary to public interest are matters ripe for review.we turn to that issue now.
both the corps and the intervenors,recognizing that we may affirm the district court on an alternative ground,see,tymshare,covell,in this appeal,appellee has sought to justify the judgment below upon a ground argued below but not relied upon by the opinion of the district court.we may of course sustain on such a ground.citing langnes green,maintain that the appellants challenge is not ripe for judicial review.not so.
the doctrine of ripeness shares with its statutory counterpart,finality,the dual concerns of prematurity of judicial intervention in agency processes and the proper and principled exercise of judicial power.usaa fed.sav.bank mclaughlin.that is,its basic rationale,the supreme court tells us,is to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies,and also to protect agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.abbott,at.the ripeness doctrine has two components it requires us to consider the fitness of the issues for judicial review and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.village of bensenville faa,quoting citing abbott,at.neither of these we address in in favor of postponement here.
the appellants challenge easily satisfies the first ripeness.t he fitness of an issue for judicial decision depends on whether it is purely legal,whether consideration of the issue would benefit from a more concrete setting,and whether the agency action is sufficiently final.atl.states legal found.epa,quoting citing clean air implementation project epa.the appellants apa challenge is purely legal,atl.states legal,at they allege that the corps exceeded its statutory authority in drafting the nwps and that the corps failed to offer a reasoned basis for their conditions and restrictions.see,appellants br.at.we have repeatedly held that c laims that an agency action is arbitrary and capricious or contrary to law present purely legal issues.see,atl.states legal,at citing fox television stations,fcc.we have also often observed that a purely legal claim in the context of a facial challenge,such as the appellants claim,is presumptively reviewable.mining ass fowler,see also mountain states,at in light of the wholly legal and facial nature of the present challenge,we can not agree that our ability to review the agency decision would be increased by delay.
while we have cautioned that sometimes even purely legal issues may be unfit for review,atl.states legal,at,we can not accept the corps argument that the appellants purely legal challenge is unfit for review at this time.it initially argues that the nwps are not fit for review because their applicability to a given activity remains within the corps discretion.we have already debunked this theory.in appalachian power epa,we explained that the fact that a law may be altered in the future has nothing to do with whether it is subject to judicial review at the moment.id.in addressing the ripeness of an epa guidance,we recently explained that if the possibility of future revision in fact could make agency action as a matter of law,then it would be hard to imagine when any agency rule would ever be final as a matter of law.epa.that the corps retains some measure of discretion with respect to the nwps does not make the appellants purely legal challenge unripe.
the corps and the intervenors further argue that the appellants apa challenge remains hopelessly abstract until a member submits an actual individual permit application proposing a specific project,has its application denied or unlawfully conditioned,and completes the administrative appeal process provided by corps regulations.appellees br.at see also intervenors br.at.while it is undoubtedly true that a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated,or indeed not occur at all,we see no reason here to wait for a rule to be applied to see what its effect will be.atl.states legal,at internal quotation marks alteration omitted.no further factual development is necessary to evaluate the appellants challenge.all of the facts necessary for judicial review were before the corps when it issued the permits and,on apa review,its action necessarily stands or falls on that administrative record and its statutory permitting authority under the cwa.see fox television stations,at issue fit for judicial review because whether agency action is arbitrary and capricious or contrary to law is purely legal question power supply ass ferc,claim fit for review as it can be wholly resolved by an analysis of the sunshine act,the act legislative history,and its construction by relevant case law.
relying on lujan wildlife fed n,d,the intervenors also argue that the appellants challenge is not ripe because the cwa does not explicitly provide for facial review of a nwp and because the appellants need not adjust their conduct immediately.in lujan,the supreme court rejected the national wildlife federation attempt to challenge the continuing and thus constantly changing operations of the bureau of land management in reviewing withdrawal revocation applications and the classifications of public lands and developing land use plans.id.at.the court explained 
r espondent can not seek wholesale improvement of this program by court decree under the terms of the apa,respondent must direct its attack against some particular agency action that causes it harm.some statutes permit broad regulations to serve as the agency action,and thus to be the object of judicial review directly,even before the concrete effects normally required for apa review are felt.absent such a provision,however,a regulation is not ordinarily considered the type of agency action ripe for judicial review under the apa until the scope of the controversy has been reduced to more manageable proportions,and its factual components fleshed out,by some concrete action applying the regulation to the claimant situation in a fashion that harms or threatens to harm him.the major exception,of course,is a substantive rule which as a practical matter requires the appellant to adjust his conduct immediately.such agency action is ripe for review at once,whether or not explicit statutory review apart from the apa is provided.
id.at.internal citations omitted second emphasis added.but the appellants,unlike the national wildlife federation in lujan,do not seek wholesale revision of the corps permitting framework.rather,they challenge a specific agency,the corps issuance of nwps authorizing certain discharges of dredged and fill requires them to adjust their conduct immediately,as discussed above.and s uch agency action,the court observed in lujan,is ripe for review at once,whether or not explicit statutory review apart from the apa is provided.id.accordingly,i n light of the wholly legal and facial nature of the present challenge,the appellants apa claim is fit for judicial review now.mountain states,at.
turning to the hardship prong of the ripeness test,we conclude that this requirement is also satisfied.any institutional interest in postponing review must be balanced against the resultant hardship to the appellants in order to determine whether immediate review is proper.see consol.rail united states,if we have doubts about the fitness of the issue for judicial resolution,then we balance the institutional interests in postponing review against the hardship to the parties that will result from delay.on the one hand,no institutional interest of the court supports postponement.see mountain states,at.the administrative process has run its course,resulting in general permits and conditions that the appellants have challenged as arbitrary,capricious and contrary to law under the apa.their success depends on the administrative record and the statutory parameters of the corps permitting authority under the cwa.on the other hand,we can not agree with the corps that the appellants face no hardship as a result of postponed judicial review because,as it would have us believe,legal consequences flow only from a collective permitting decision on a specific project and consequently any alleged harm is purely hypothetical at this time.appellees br.at.nor do we agree with the intervenors similar suggestion that any alleged harm is ameliorated by the appellants ability to pursue further agency remedies.intervenors br.at.to the contrary,the fact of the matter is that in the absence of judicial review the appellants are left with the choices we identified earlier they must either modify their projects to conform to the nwp thresholds and conditions as the corps contemplates they will do or refrain from building until they can secure individual permits.the nwps therefore affect the appellants activities in a direct and immediate way.see power supply ass n,at hardship demonstrated where implementation of the market monitor exemption will have a direct and immediate impact on the appellant that rises to the level of hardship.internal quotation marks alteration citations omitted better gov t ass dep t of state,doj guidelines caused hardship where direct and immediate impact on appellants primary conduct would be felt immediately citing quoting abbott,at.toilet goods ass n,gardner,d texas united states,d no hardship where party not required to engage in,or to refrain from,any conduct pfizer shalala.accordingly,we hold that the appellants apa challenge is ripe for judicial review.
for any rule subject to the rfa,a small entity that is adversely affected or aggrieved by final agency action is entitled to judicial review of agency compliance with the requirements of sections,b,b,and.a.the corps and the intervenors have an argument apiece as to why the appellants can not challenge the corps compliance with the rfa under this provision.we reject both and hold instead that the appellants rfa claim,like their apa claim,is justiciable.
the nwps,the corps says,do not constitute a rule subject to review under section of the rfa for two reasons,both of which hinge on the rfa definition of a rule as any rule for which the agency publishes a general notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to section b of the apa,or any other law.the corps initially contends that the nwps fall within the apa definition of adjudication defined as an agency process for the formulation of an order,id.rather than rule,which is defined as the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement,interpret,or prescribe law or policy,id.each nwp constitutes an adjudication,so the corps argument goes,because it fits the apa definition of adjudication as the formulation of an order,id,an order includes a licensing disposition,id,and a license includes a permit,id.we reject this elaborate statutory construction for the more straightforward one.
each nwp easily fits within the apa definition of rule.this is so because each nwp,which authorizes a permittee to discharge dredged and fill material and thereby does not allow others without an individual permit,is a legal prescription of general and prospective applicability which the corps has issued to implement the permitting authority the congress entrusted to it in section of the cwa.see e.as such,each nwp constitutes a rule an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement,interpret,or prescribe law or policy.see generally hercules,epa.it is of course the corps decision whether to proceed by rule or adjudication,see sec chenery,but rules is rules,no matter their gloss.see granholm ex rel.dep t of natural res.ferc,quoting citing bartlett whitting,modern proverbs and proverbial sayingss.
relying again on section of the rfa,the corps asserts that the nwps are not rules because it did not issue any notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to apa rulemaking provision,or publish them in the code of federal regulations.we have explained that an agency must comply with the procedures laid down in the apa only when it promulgates legislative rules.appalachian power,at.legislative rules,we have said,are those that grant rights,impose obligations,or produce other significant effects on private interests.batterton marshall.
despite our declarations that o nly legislative rules have the force and effect of law and a legislative rule is one the agency has duly promulgated in compliance with the procedures laid down in the statute or in the administrative procedure act,appalachian power,at,we have not hesitated to consider an agency pronouncement issued without meeting required apa procedures a rule.see id.at we have also used legislative rule to refer to rules the agency should have,but did not,promulgate through notice and comment rulemaking.citing am.mining cong.dep t of labor.while an agency characterization of an official statement as binding or nonbinding has been given some weight,of far greater importance is the language used in the statement itself.brock cathedr
