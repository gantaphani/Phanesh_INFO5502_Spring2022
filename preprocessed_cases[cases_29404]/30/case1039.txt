the national marine fisheries service nmfs is charged with implementing a licensing program to prevent overfishing of pacific cod in the bering sea and aleutian islands bsai groundfish fishery.the nmfs decided to limit the number of boats fishing in the bsai fishery by granting licenses only to boats that caught a prescribed amount of fish during any two years between.the blue north caught the requisite amount of fish in and,but not in the other qualifying years of or.had the nmfs included as a qualifying year,the blue north would have qualified to secure a license to fish for pacific cod in the bsai fishery.
yakutat,is the owner of the blue north.it brought this action to challenge the nmfs failure to include as a qualifying year.yakutat argues that the nmfs decision is unfair and inequitable under the fishery conservation and management act magnuson act,et,and is arbitrary and capricious,lacking a rational basis under the administrative procedure act apa,et.the district court upheld the decision of the secretary of commerce secretary.upon review of the record,we conclude that the secretary decision to implement the final rule amending the bsai fishery management plan was neither arbitrary and capricious,nor unfair and inequitable,and that the secretary articulated a rational basis for the decision.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
facts and proceedings 
the bsai fishery,located off the coast of alaska,is the largest fishery in the united states.see a i.the bsai fishery is managed by the bering islands groundfish fishery management plan fmp,which is developed by the northern pacific fishery management council council in accordance with the magnuson act and implemented by the nmfs.see c.
a.the regulatory framework 
in the magnuson act,congress found that c ertain stocks of such fish have declined to the point where their survival is threatened,a a,and established a national program for the conservation of fishery resources.congress stated that this program was necessary to prevent overfishing,to rebuild overfished stocks,to insure conservation,to facilitate protection of essential fish habitats and to realize the full potential of the nation resources.a.the purposes of the magnuson act include inter alia,providing fishery management plans which will achieve and maintain,on a continuing basis,the optimum yield from each fishery,and establishing regional fishery management councils that would create,monitor,and review these fishery management plans.b.the magnuson act provides the secretary with fishery management authority within the exclusive economic zone of the united states.see a.
the secretary carries out his management and conservation duties through the nmfs and eight regional fishery management councils established by the magnuson act.a.the northern pacific fishery management council covers the states of alaska,washington,and oregon,and has authority over fisheries in the exclusive economic zone encompassing the arctic ocean,bering sea,and the pacific ocean seaward of alaska.a g.the council includes state and nmfs officials,appointed by the secretary for their expertise regarding the relevant fishery resources.b.
the council is required to prepare fishery management plans and amendments to those plans as necessary for the fisheries in its area.h.the fishery management plans must contain conservation and management measures deemed by the council to be necessary and appropriate for the conservation and management of the fishery,and must be consistent with the national standards described in the magnuson act.a a.the fishery management plan or its amendment must describe the fishery,the vessels involved,the type of gear used,the species of fish involved,and the costs of managing the fishery it must estimate the maximum and optimum yields and the extent to which the yields will be harvested by and foreign vessels it must include measures to minimize bycatch and bycatch mortality and,to the extent the measures reduce the harvest,it must allocate the restrictions equitably among commercial,recreational and charter fishing sectors.a.any plan or amendment prepared by the council may designate zones where,and periods when,fishing shall be limited,or shall not be permitted,or shall be permitted only by specified types of fishing vessels or with specific types of quantities of fishing gear.b.the plan or amendment may also establish a limited access system for the fishery in order to achieve optimum yield of fishery catches.b.if the council develops a limited access system,it must consider,inter alia,present participation,historical fishing practices,and cultural and economic considerations.b a f.
the magnuson act directs the council to establish fishing industry advisory panels which shall provide information and recommendations on,and assist in the development of,fishery management plans and amendments.g a.these panels shall be appointed in a manner that provides fair representation of the fishing community and commercial fishing interests in the area.g b.however,all decisions made by these panels are advisory only,as the secretary holds ultimate authority regarding the preparation and implementation of fishery management plans and amendments.g.
the council prepares a fishery management plan or an amendment with the input of the advisory panel,and then submits it to the secretary for review.h,a.upon receipt of the fishery management plan or amendment,the secretary,through the nmfs,reviews it to determine whether it is consistent with the provisions of the magnuson act.a.the nmfs places a public notice in the federal register and a comment period runs for sixty days after publication.id.within thirty days of the end of the public comment period,the secretary must approve,disapprove,or partially approve the fishery management plan or amendment.a.
although the council may also propose and submit implementing regulations with the fishery management plan or amendment,the secretary must determine whether the proposed regulations are consistent with both the fishery management plan or amendment and the magnuson act prior to the public notice and comment period.b.
the secretary also evaluates the consistency of the fishery management plan with six factors that must be taken into account prior to implementing a fishery management plan 
any fishery management plan which is prepared by any council,or by the secretary,with respect to any fishery,may establish a limited access system for the fishery in order to achieve optimum yield if,in developing such system,the council and the secretary take into account 
a present participation in the fishery,
b historical fishing practices in,and dependence on,the fishery,
c the economics of the fishery,
d the capability of fishing vessels used in the fishery to engage in other fisheries,
e the cultural and social framework relevant to the fishery and any affected fishing communities,and 
f any other relevant considerations.
b.the secretary evaluates proposed regulations immediately upon receipt from the council,and within fifteen days of initiating this evaluation the secretary must either publish the regulations for a fifteen to sixty day public comment period or provide recommendations to the council as to why these regulations are not consistent with the fishery management plan,the amendment,the magnuson act,or applicable law.b a,b.the secretary must then promulgate final regulations within thirty days of the end of the public comment period,and shall consult with the council before making any revisions to the proposed regulations.b.these regulations are to be published in the federal register,along with an explanation of any differences between the proposed and final regulations.id.these regulations are subject to judicial review under the apa.f.
b.the establishment of the bsai license limitation program 
in,the council approved a license limitation program llp for vessels operating in federal waters within the bsai area,slated to begin on january.establishing the permit system in the bsai for groundfish fishing.viewed as the first step in the council commitment to develop a comprehensive and rational management program for alaskan fisheries,this llp limited the number of available licenses to participate in the bsai groundfish fishery.fisheries of the exclusive economic zone off alaska license limitation program,to be codified at pt.alaska llp.the council intended to design a program that would efficiently manage the resources under its authority,reduce bycatch,minimize waste,and improve utilization of the resources in the area,especially given the council concern that the domestic harvesting fleet had expanded beyond the optimum yield oy of the fisheries in alaska.id.the council intended the llp program to protect fishermen with past dependence on and recent participation in the fisheries,but also desired to rationalize the extent of pacific cod fishing for more efficient resource allocation.id.
the llp established eligibility criteria for fishing boats to receive licenses to fish for groundfish or crab.see k groundfish and k crab.the llp provided two area endorsements within the bsai groundfish fishery 
the aleutian islands and the bering sea.see k ii a,b.the council did not view the program as an solution to the problem of rationalizing scarce resources.the nmfs recognized it as an interim step toward a more comprehensive solution to the conservation and management problems of an open access fishery.alaska llp.
the alaskan fishing industry expressed concerns about participants jumping from fisheries into other already fully utilized fisheries,despite the introduction of the llp proposal see fisheries of the exclusive economic zone off alaska fishing participation in,to be codified pt.alaska fishing participation.to alleviate these concerns while it considered amendments to the llp program,the council notified potential license applicants that participation in a fishery in would not necessarily count as a qualifying year under the proposed rules.id.the council expressly warned that by publishing this notice it intended to promote public awareness that potential eligibility criteria for future access to the affected fisheries may be developed and to discourage new entrants into those fisheries based on economic speculation while the council considers further controls on access to those fisheries.id.
c.the original llp and amendment 
the original llp had not classified bsai groundfish licensees by their use of specific gear or their proposed harvest.eventually,however,the council refined its proposed llp to address the issue of gear and species endorsements for pacific cod.see fisheries of the exclusive economic zone off alaska allocations of pacific cod in the bering sea and aleutian islands area,to be codified at pt.implementing amendment allocating specific allowances for total allowable catch tac between fixed,trawl,and jig gear and fisheries of the exclusive economic zone off alaska allocation of pacific cod among vessels using or pot gear in the bering sea and aleutian islands,to be codified at pt.implementing amendment allocating the fixed gear percentage of pacific cod tac among catch processors freezer longline boats,catcher vessels,pot gear vessels,and fixed gear vessels under feet in length.
due to concerns about new participants entering the pacific cod fisheries and movement of pacific cod fisherman among the various sectors that use gear,the council also discussed whether it should add pacific cod endorsements to llp ground fish licenses,to limit the number of new entrants fisheries of the exclusive economic zone off alaska license limitation program for groundfish of the bering sea and aleutian islands area,proposed rule and request for comments proposed rule.the council noted concern that under its preliminary estimates,about fixed gear catcher vessels and fixed gear would be allowed to target pacific cod in the bsai under the llp.the council considered requiring potential licensees to have minimum catches in for freezer longline vessels and catcher longline vessels,and a host of qualifying year alternatives such as any three years between,any two years between,any one year between,with a minimum number of landing requirements for pot gear vessels.the council also worried that a recent dearth of crab resources in the bsai created incentives for fishermen using fixed gear to enter the bsai pacific cod fisheries,thereby increasing the overfishing of fisheries and an increased pacific cod catch proposed rule.at.the council stated that it needed to promote stability in the bsai fixed gear cod fishery until comprehensive rationalization is completed.id.the council urged prompt action and proposed that a person who holds a llp groundfish license,but who has not participated in the pacific cod fisheries in the bsai with gear in the past,or who has not participated at a level that could constitute significant dependence on those fisheries,should be prevented from participating in the fisheries.id.
the desire for prompt action resulted in the council introducing amendment for the llp program to establish a license endorsement for pacific cod.to evaluate proposed amendment,the council analyzed a number of alternatives for licensing vessels in the pacific cod fisheries.in addition,the council also considered whether to issue an environmental assessment,regulatory impact review,and initial regulatory flexibility analysis for the pacific cod license endorsements,and debated over which specific alternatives to include in the report.after deciding to issue the,and deciding to include as one of the alternatives for qualifying years in the report,the council reaffirmed its december statement that landings in and beyond will not count in qualification for pacific cod endorsements under the llp.
council staff furnished the to the council in september.the report included analysis of fixed gear vessels in each of the three categories.the report evaluated the number of qualifying freezer longline and catcher longline vessels resulting from three different minimum catch quantities during the years,and.it also analyzed pot gear vessels under different qualification standards,considering the number of qualifying vessels resulting from requiring either one,two,or three years participation between and.it further evaluated the number of qualifying vessels resulting from minimum landing requirements between and pounds upon receiving this report,the council expanded its prior data set and decided to factor participation into the report it would present at its october meeting.in addition,the council also separated categories for pot gear vessels and pot gear catcher vessels so that council staff could further analyze these categories separately.
the final report to the council contained proposed alternatives up from its original list of alter natives,and less than half of these proposed alternatives included participation.the council adopted the final for proposed amendment in march.in the pot gear vessel category,the report contained qualifying year options and qualifying landing catch options according to analysis provided by council staff,the factor that would most greatly affect the number of qualifying pot vessels would be the participation years requirement.the report noted that the most restrictive alternative for pot would reduce the number of potential pot vessels from to,and the most widely considered combination of alternatives generally resulted in between to qualifying vessels.
in addition,during the public comment period,concerned members of the public submitted numerous public statements to the council urging adoption of stringent catch requirements and standards.several owners leveled accusations that a number of pot vessels made speculative landings in in order to qualify for the pacific cod endorsement.the council noted these concerns and included them in its decision process regarding the adoption of amendment.
in april,the council received recommendations from its advisory panel and also conducted a public hearing to gather testimony on proposed amendment.the council also deliberated privately on the inclusion of as a qualifying year for the pot gear sector,but most of the council members advocated as a cutoff date for a number of reasons.after hearing testimony,looking at the public comments,reviewing the recommendations from the advisory panel,analyzing the from the council staff and discussing the alternatives in detail,the council recommended the adoption of amendment.the amendment recommendation included requiring pot vessels to have landed over pounds of pacific cod in any two years during the period in order to qualify for a license.the advisory panel had also recommended these specific requirements,but it had deliberated between picking option two years between and and option two years between,before finally choosing option 
the council submitted the revised to the secretary of commerce for review on july,and detailed the council preferred alternative for qualifying pot vessels.it also noted the considerable testimony and public concern that any serious participant in the p acific cod fishery could easily land lb in one season,and that allowing a to qualify with any less than that annual harvest level would essentially qualify a number of vessels that participate in the p acific cod fishery to supplement the income they receive from their primary fisheries.the council observed that requiring two out of four years for landing qualification would allow for legitimate,unanticipated absences from the fishery without penalizing serious participants.it noted that fourteen llp qualified pot vessels in the bsai groundfish fisheries resulted if the secretary adopted the qualifying years of,but that nine of those vessels would drop out under the criteria adopted by the council.the council remarked that these nine vessels reported relatively few p acific cod landings by comparison over the qualifying time period,seven of which land ed p acific cod in only one of the qualifying years if at all this indicates that these vessels were not historically dependent on the p acific cod fishery and that the majority of their income likely comes from other fisheries.
d.the final rule 
after submission of the council amendment recommendation to the secretary,the nmfs published the notice of availability of proposed amendment.fisheries of the exclusive economic zone off alaska license limitation program for groundfish of the bering sea and aleutian islands area,notice of availability.it subsequently proposed amendment as a final rule,and requested public comment.proposed rule.following public comment period,the secretary published the final rule in the federal register,and explained the rule while addressing public concerns raised during the comment period.fisheries of the exclusive economic zone off alaska license limitation program for groundfish of the bering sea and aleutian islands area,final rule final rule.
the secretary explicitly addressed the concern in the final rule that t he standards used to determine eligibility for a pacific cod permit were not fair and equitable,in violation of national standard,because different requirements were used for different methods of catching pacific cod.id.at.the secretary explained that the council,through amendment,was trying to achieve a level of participation that reflected historical participation patterns for each of the sectors.id.with respect to the pot sector,the secretary noted that this sector did not have a long and consistent history and that significant variance in the composition of qualifying vessels occurred depending on which years and qualifying catches the council considered.id.t he council chose eligibility criteria that would decrease the number of participants intend ing to ensure that vessels in the sector that had historical and consistent participation based on the council analysis of the available data would be allowed to continue to participate at a level that reflected what the council determined to be economic dependence.id.
yakutat,currently operates the blue north in the bsai groundfish fishery,and has operated in the area since.the blue north originally operated as a freezer longliner,but converted to a combination pot catcher processor and freezer longliner in december of.the blue north fished using its longliner capabilities until reaching its allotted limit in may,and it then utilized pot gear for the rest of the year,landing more than pounds of pacific cod in.in,the blue north did not fish using pot gear,solely utilizing its longliner equipment the entire season in,the blue north landed more than pounds of pacific cod using pot gear after reaching its seasonal apportionment using longliner gear.upon publication of the final rule,the nmfs deemed the blue north ineligible for a pot pacific cod endorsement because its pounds catch landing occurred in only one of the qualifying years between.yakutat currently holds a bsai pot endorsement pending its unavoidable circumstances exception claim under k v b 
proceedings below 
on may,yakutat sought district court review of the secretary final rule.yakutat argued that the final rule violated national standards created by the magnuson act,was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the apa,and denied equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the fifth amendment.the district court granted the secretary summary judgment motion and dismissed yakutat claims.
yakutat appeals the district court judgment,claiming that the district court erred in granting the secretary summary judgment motion,and reiterates its original claims first,yakutat argues that the secretary failure to include as a qualifying year for pot violated the magnuson act and the apa because the secretary and council failed to articulate a justification for the exclusion.second,yakutat claims that the exclusion of as a qualifying year is unfair and inequitable,and lacks a rational basis,thereby violating the magnuson act and the apa.yakutat requests that this court overturn the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the secretary.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo with all facts read in the light most favorable to the party.covington jefferson county,cir.in reviewing regulations promulgated under the magnuson act,we have held that our only function is to determine whether the secretary of commerce has considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.alliance against ifqs brown,cir quoting.crab producers,mosbacher,cir.we determine only if the secretary acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in promulgating such regulations.alliance against ifqs,at.similarly,when reviewing administrative actions taken under the apa,the panel may reverse the agency action only if the action is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise contrary to law.see lands council powell,cir,amended by cir.
iii.discussion 
yakutat makes two claims on appeal first,yakutat argues that the secretary failure to include as a qualifying year for pot is arbitrary and capricious,in violation of both the magnuson act and the apa,because the secretary and council failed to articulate a justification for the exclusion.a b.second,yakutat claims the exclusion of as a qualifying year is unfair and inequitable in violation of the magnuson act,and lacks a rational basis,in violation of the apa.a a.we review each in turn.
a.the final rule was not arbitrary and capricious 
yakutat claims that the council and the secretary through nmfs must articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the final rule.yakutat alleges that this obligation is expressed in national standard of the magnuson act.national standard reads 
conservation and management measures shall not discriminate between residents of different states.if it becomes necessary to allocate or assign fishing privileges among various united states fishermen,such allocation shall be a fair and equitable to all such fishermen b reasonably calculated to promote conservation and c carried out in such manner that no particular individual,corporation,or other entity acquires an excessive share of such privileges.
yakutat argues that failure to comply with national standard or to articulate a motive for a particular allocation violates the magnuson act.yakutat also argues that the secretary actions are arbitrary and capricious because he has not supplied a rational connection between the facts and the final rule.
the record demonstrates the secretary concern to conserve and manage the pacific cod resources and stabilize fully utilized pacific cod resources being harvested in the bsai.final rule.at.the secretary also noted concern to protect fishermen with significant investments and long catch histories in the pot sector.id.at.the secretary and council fully evaluated all of the alternatives available to them,which included numerous alternatives that included as a qualifying year.the council produced the final,which specifically included analysis of out of alternatives with as a qualifying year for pot catcher processors.based on the data before the council,it chose to not include as a qualifying year because those boats that dropped out when was not included were not historically dependent on the pacific cod fishery and the majority of their income likely came from other fisheries.in accordance with public testimony,industry experience,and data analysis,the council decision established a standard for measuring historical dependence,and drew a rational line.the secretary,utilizing the same data and reports provided by the council,adopted the council recommendation.the record clearly provides a rational basis on which the secretary based his decision.
agency actions may also be found to be arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which congress had not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of the agency expertise.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.see also foss marine fisheries,cir rejecting an arbitrary and capricious claim against the nmfs because the nmfs provided rational reasons for the action taken.controlling precedent requires that a plan not be deemed arbitrary and capricious,even though there may be some discriminatory impact,if the regulations are tailored to solve a gear conflict problem and to promote the conservation of the fish in question.alliance against ifqs,at quoting alaska factory trawler ass baldridge,cir.as long as the secretary considered the fishermen interests,and considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,the secretary decision will not lack a rational basis.crab producers,at.see also alliance against ifqs,at.we conclude that the secretary has not run afoul of these considerations.
first,neither the secretary,nor the council,relied on factors that congress did not intend the agency to consider.the secretary must take into account six factors for implementing any fishery management plan or amendments to a fishery management plan see b alliance against ifqs,at.the council explicitly looked at all of these factors,including historical fishing practices and dependence on the fishery,economics of the fishery,capability of fishing vessels to engage in other fisheries,other relevant considerations,and also analyzed present participation in the fishery.the only factor not explicitly examined in the record is the cultural and social framework relevant to the fishery.however,this is not fatal to the secretary and council decision.see alliance against ifqs,at stating that congress left the secretary some room by not defining such terms as present participation and determining that each factor is one of many factors which the council and secretary must take into account.
second,a requires any fishery management plan to comply with ten national standards the secretary comments in the final rule explicitly respond to public comments regarding alleged violations of national standards,twice,and.see final rule.at.the secretary response to these public comments shows that he considered all of these national standards in analyzing and constructing the final rule.id.there is no evidence that the secretary relied on factors congress did not intend,and it is clear that the secretary and council made every effort to comply with all of the options required by congress.
third,the secretary did not fail to consider an important aspect of the agency action because he analyzed the council recommendation and independently considered including as a qualifying year.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.the inclusion of was one of many factors considered by the secretary,as well as by the council,and both considered including as a qualifying year before choosing to emphasize issues implicating other factors more relevant to the problem statement and overall goal of the fmp.
finally,the secretary neither offered an explanation for his decision that runs counter to the evidence,nor acted in a manner that could not be ascribed to agency expertise.the secretary specifically responded to public comments about the decision in the federal register,and explained the rationale behind treating pot vessels differently than other vessels.final rule.at.in addition,the council,with its expertise and industry experience,deliberated over the amendment for over hours,heard public testimony,received public comments,and read staff reports and analysis prior to making its recommendation to the secretary.the secretary analyzed these same reports,received public comments,and responded publically to those comments in making his decision.there is nothing in the evidence that suggests that the secretary,or the council,acted in manner that could not be ascribed to agency expertise.
b.the final rule is neither unfair or inequitable 
yakutat argues that the exclusion of from the pot vessel criteria is unfair and inequitable because it violates the magnuson act by not taking recent participation into account as required by b,and because it violates national standard,a.specifically,yakutat asserts that the final rule does not comply with the requirement that fishing allocations be fair and equitable because the endorsement requirements for pot do not extend to include participation in.see a if it becomes necessary to allocate or assign fishing privileges among various united states fishermen,such allocation shall be a fair and equitable to all such fishermen.
the secretary took present participation into account 
yakutat argues that by not including as one of the qualifying years in the final rule,the nmfs and the secretary violated b because present participation is thereby not included in the final rule.the statute reads any fishery management plan which is prepared by any council,or by the secretary,with respect to any fishery,may establish a limited access system for the fishery in order to achieve optimum yield if,in developing such a system,the council and the secretary take into account a present participation in the fishery,and b historical fishing practices in,and dependence on,the fishery id.aside from these factors,there are four other factors that must be considered,including the economics of the fishery,the cultural and social framework relevant to the fishery,the capability of fishing vessels used in the fishery to engage in other fisheries,and other relevant considerations.id.
we previously dealt with similar claims in alliance against ifqs brown.in alliance against ifqs,the nmfs implemented regulations for a fishery management plan regarding sablefish and pacific halibut,assigning quota shares based on participation in landings in.nmfs implemented the final rule in,and the plaintiffs,a number of concerned fishermen,argued that the final rule violated the present participation requirement of the magnuson act by not taking into account participation in fishing during.id.at.we concluded that the secretary had good reason for not including in the qualifying years for a rule issued in the industry knew that a rule was under consideration and recent fishing history might have skewed the data.id.at.as we explained i f participation in the fishery while the rule was under consideration had been considered,then people would have fished and invested in boats in order to obtain quota shares,even though that would have exacerbated overcapacity and made no economic sense independently of the regulatory benefit.id.at.we held that we could not characterize use of a through period as so far from present participation when the regulation was promulgated in as to and capricious.id.at citing.crab producers,at.
in the instant case,the council noted a similar concern regarding present participation while it debated the specifics of the final rule to present to the secretary.the council gave notice that might not qualify in order to discourage new entrants into those fisheries based on economic speculation while the council considers further controls on access to those fisheries.alaska fishing participation.at.these concerns were not imagined.the data showed a jump in participation by pot vessels during from crabbing to pacific cod fishing.nevertheless,the council did not reject out of hand,but still considered whether should be a qualifying year.alaska fishing participation.at.the council actually considered alternatives,of which included as a qualifying year.even when the council submitted its preferred alternative,which did not include as a qualifying year,the council advised the secretary of other options,which included proposals to make a qualifying year.in the end,the secretary adopted the council recommendations,published the final rule and responded to comments regarding the different requirements used for different methods of catching pacific cod.final rule.at.
present participation is only one of six factors that must be taken into account when promulgating a new rule for fishery management plans.alliance against ifqs,at congress left the secretary some room for the exercise of discretion,by not defining present participation,and by listing it as only one of many factors which the council and the secretary must take into account.emphasis added.the secretary exercised the discretion granted him in the act by concluding that a date was essential for the final rule treatment of pot vessels.the secretary decision to reject the most recent year in favor of a cumulation of the other five factors that also must be considered,is reasonable and consistent with our precedent.alliance against ifqs,at.we conclude that the secretary had a rational basis for not allowing present participation in the form of including to take precedence over other relevant factors under consideration in crafting the fmp amendment.
the final rule does not violate national standard 
yakutat argues that not including in the fmp as a qualifying year is unfair and inequitable in contravention of national standard.national standard provides conservation and management measures shall not discriminate between residents of different states.if it becomes necessary to allocate or assign fishing privileges among various united states fishermen,such allocation shall be a fair and equitable to all such fishermen b reasonably calculated to promote conservation and c carried out in such a manner that no particular individual,corporation,or other entity acquires an excessive share of such privileges.a.see also c i in alliance against ifqs,we noted that there is tension between fairness among all fishermen,preventing overfishing,promoting efficiency,and avoiding unnecessary duplication,which necessarily requires that each goal be sacrificed to some extent to meet the others.alliance against ifqs,at.the secretary is allowed,under this authority,to sacrifice the interests of some groups of fishermen,for the benefit as the secretary sees it of the fishery as a whole.id.at citing alaska factory trawler,at.
yakutat argues that the fmp amendment qualified two boats that have clearly abandoned the fishing industry,while it excludes the blue north,thereby demonstrating the unfairness of the qualifying criteria.yakutat contends that the council should have used base years as qualifying years,which would include the blue north,and preclude the qualification of other boats that have qualified for the pacific cod endorsement under the current regime.
the secretary and the council addressed directly the issues raised by yakutat,and examined the use of as a qualifying year for pot.the council explained that it did not include in its final recommendation to ensure that vessels in the sector that had historical and consistent participation based on the council analysis of available data would be allowed to continue to participate at a level that reflected what the council determined to be economic dependence.final rule.at.
congress requires the secretary to exercise discretion and judgment in weighing the national standards in,and the secretary need only provide a reason for doing that which was consistent with the statutory standards.alliance against ifqs,at.the secretary,through the council,drafted a problem statement in june stating his intent to remedy problems relating to the protection of dependent fishermen and promotion of stability and rationalization of a fully utilized resource.this statement noted 
longline and pot fishermen who have made significant investments,have long catch histories and are significantly dependent on the bsai cod fisheries need protection from others who have little or limited history and wish to increase their participation in the fishery.fisheries of the exclusive economic zone off alaska allocation of pacific cod among vessels using or pot gear in the bering sea and aleutian islands.the council analyzed the individual catch histories and reliance upon the pacific cod fisheries utilizing specific gear assignments and landing quantities,ultimately agreeing on a break even point for economic dependence and sending its recommendation to the secretary with the ea.
the council thoroughly investigated the inclusion of as a qualifying year for pot vessels,but concluded that inclusion would not benefit those with significant historical dependence on the pacific cod industry.the council found that under the council preferred alternative,approximately vessels that landed p acific cod in the bsai in would no longer be allowed in the fishery the vessels that drop out reported relatively few p acific cod landings by comparison over the qualifying time period,seven of which landed p acific cod in only one of the qualifying years if at all this indicates that these vessels were not historically dependent on the p acific cod fishery and that the majority of their income likely comes from other fisheries.
yakutat argues that the council lack of serious deliberation to include as a qualifying year tainted the decision,but yakutat must demonstrate something more than the fact that the secretary allegedly did not give the decision the consideration yakutat would have liked.see alaska factory trawler,at in order for a court to overturn a secretary decision,it must be shown that alleged irregularities affected such decision.emphasis added.therefore,in order to overturn a decision,plaintiffs must demonstrate irregularities in the secretary actions or show that the secretary followed incorrect procedures.id.the record does not support yakutat claims.the council provided the secretary with the and its recommendations from the council,and the secretary viewed all proposed alternatives prior to making his decision.the secretary possessed the entire record while making his decision,and this record demonstrated that the council proposed alternative for amendment would achieve the goal of protecting fishermen with significant investments and long catch histories.
the secretary decision directly correlates with the statement in announcing the development of the fmp amendment since both the council and the secretary considered both historical dependence and consistent participation in the industry while constructing the fmp amendment,we can not find the result unfair and inequitable.the council and secretary analyzed the alternatives for pot,and ultimately decided that including as a qualifying year would not reflect historical and consisten
