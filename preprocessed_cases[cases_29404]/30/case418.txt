plaintiffs are landowners who own property in tennessee downriver from blue ridge paper mill in canton,north carolina.a previous tennessee court class action involving the same class of plaintiffs and covering a time period june,to august,resulted in an aggregate award of million.see freeman blue ridge paper.subsequent to that trial,on october,plaintiffs initiated in tennessee state court the first of the five suits involved in this appeal.plaintiffs sought damages accruing from august,until the date of trial in that case.the parties met the minimal diversity of citizenship requirements as required by the cafa amendments to.see d.in the complaint,the plaintiff disavowed recovery in excess of million 
the amount in controversy as to the plaintiff and each member of the proposed class does not exceed thousand dollars each,exclusive of interest and costs.the plaintiff,therefore,disclaims any compensatory damages,punitive damages,declaratory,injunctive,or equitable relief greater than thousand dollars per individual class member,and plaintiff and the proposed class limit their individual compensatory damage claims to thousand dollars per class member,and limit their total class wide claims to less than four million nine hundred thousand dollars.

the million cafa threshold appears to be met in this case because the million sought in each of the five suits must be aggregated.the complaints are identical in all respects except for the artificially broken up time periods.plaintiffs put forth no colorable reason for breaking up the lawsuits in this fashion,other than to avoid federal jurisdiction.in fact,plaintiffs counsel admitted at oral argument that avoiding cafa was the only reason for this structuring.if such pure structuring permits class plaintiffs to avoid cafa,then congress obvious purpose in passing the allow defendants to defend large interstate class actions in federal be avoided almost at will,as long as state law permits suits to be broken up on some basis.
cafa was clearly designed to prevent plaintiffs from artificially structuring their suits to avoid federal jurisdiction.the statutory language notes that c lass action lawsuits are an important and valuable part of the legal system because they allow aggregation of claims so that a defendant faces only a single action.cafa a,note.furthermore,cafa states that there have been abuses of the class action device,including that s tate and local courts are keeping cases of national importance out of federal court.id.a a.according to the relevant senate report,cafa was necessary because the previous law enable d lawyers to game the procedural rules and keep nationwide or class actions in state courts whose judges have reputations for readily certifying classes and approving settlements without regard to class member interests,at,cong.cafa provides defendants with access to the federal courts,
mak ing it harder for plaintiffs counsel to game the system by trying to defeat diversity jurisdiction,creat ing efficiencies in the judicial system by allowing overlapping and copycat cases to be consolidated in a single federal court,and plac ing the determination of more interstate class action lawsuits in the proper federal courts.
id.at.these purposes support reading cafa not to permit the splintering of lawsuits solely to avoid federal jurisdiction in the fashion done in this case.
our analysis is supported by a recent district court case from the same district.in proffitt abbott labs,wl,dist.lexis,the plaintiffs brought eleven class actions,each for a period,alleging that defendants were involved in an antitrust conspiracy.id.wl,at,dist.lexis at.each complaint pointed to defendant actions taken throughout the whole period as evidence of the conspiracy.id.the court found that o ther than the difficulty of making a damages disclaimer to avoid the cafa,there appears no reason for selecting the divisions and creating eleven lawsuits to litigate one conspiracy that involves one defendant and one drug.id.wl at,dist.lexis at.finding that such an attempt to evade federal jurisdiction was at odds with the congressional intent and purpose of the cafa,the district court treated the cases as one lawsuit and found that the amount in controversy was therefore met.id.wl at,dist lexis at.
while plaintiffs seek to distinguish that case on the ground that a conspiracy claim could not be broken up in the same way that a nuisance claim can be,it is not clear that the cases are very different.conspiracies can be broken up into time periods just like nuisances.damages can be divided up accordingly.we recognize that state law appears to provide that every day starts a new statute of limitations for nuisance,and that a previous suit for nuisance does not preclude a nuisance suit for a period after the time of the previous suit.whiteside estates,highlands cove,for instance held that future damages in nuisance suits must be recovered in successive actions,and stated that t he continued migration of contaminants remains a nuisance and when each contaminant crosses onto an adjoining property,there is a new trespass and injury.id.at,citation omitted but these principles of state law do not mean that periods of time may be artificially divided up for no reason other than to affect jurisdiction.and if indeed north carolina law permits such a retroact
