this action was brought under the california environmental quality act ceqa to challenge a proposed commercial and residential project approved by the city of berkeley.appellants are parker shattuck neighbors and two individuals collectively parker shattuck who contend the city violated ceqa by approving the project without an environmental impact report eir.parker shattuck petitioned for a writ of mandate,maintaining that an eir was required because contamination on the site poses health risks to the project construction workers and future residents.we affirm the trial court denial of the writ because parker shattuck has failed to identify substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that there may be a significant effect on the environment because of these potential health risks.
factual and procedural background 
the parker place project is proposed by citycentric investments,llc and parker place group,llc and was approved by the berkeley city council when finished,it will consist of three buildings on what are currently three different parcels.a building with an underground parking garage will be built at shattuck avenue,another building will be built at shattuck avenue,and a residential building will be built at parker street.all told,the project will include residential units and over square feet of commercial space.
the three parcels are currently occupied by a car dealership,berkeley honda.the showroom,offices,and service garage are located at shattuck avenue,and a sales lot is located at shattuck avenue and parker street.since,shattuck avenue has been the site of a car dealership and service garage,and from at least to,shattuck avenue was the site of a service station.
before buying the properties,the current owner commissioned three environmental reports,which were issued in two phases.the phase i report was issued in december,and it stated that the properties had a history of containing underground storage tanks.underground storage tanks are used to store hazardous substances,such as gasoline.see health,subd.y.in,a gallon underground storage tank was removed from shattuck avenue,and the berkeley health and human services department issued a letter confirming there was no significant soil contamination resulting from a discharge in the area surrounding the underground storage tank.in,a gallon tank was removed from shattuck avenue.fire department records also indicated there were or might once have been several other underground storage tanks.the phase i report recommended using radar to clarify whether there were any other underground storage tanks and conducting an investigation to assess ground contamination.
these recommendations were accepted,and the results were described in the phase ii report issued in march.the study located a suspected underground storage tank under the sidewalk next to shattuck avenue and recommended its removal.it also identified a concrete pad at shattuck avenue that might conceal an underground storage tank.the investigation collected soil samples from twenty borings near areas of potential contamination,and water samples were collected where the borings encountered groundwater.various volatile organic compounds vocs were detected in two soil samples and a water sample,but they did not exceed the san francisco regional water quality control board regional board environmental screening levels,or there are no levels established for the contaminant.the report recommended additional soil and water sampling in other areas of concern,including under the concrete pad to determine if there was petroleum in the soil and thus whether an underground storage tank might be there.
this recommendation was accepted,and the results were announced in a supplemental phase ii report.although petroleum hydrocarbons,arsenic,and cobalt were detected in amounts exceeding regional board levels for land use,the report noted that the hydrocarbon contamination was not likely to require cleanup and that the arsenic and cobalt were probably naturally occurring.no contaminants were detected in amounts exceeding levels for groundwater that was not a potential source of drinking water.the supplemental report also determined that there was no underground storage tank or soil contamination under the concrete pad.
the storage tank under the sidewalk next to shattuck avenue was removed in april.because hydrocarbon contamination was observed in the soil surrounding the tank,tons of soil were also removed from the site.the site was then placed on a list,known as the cortese list,that is comprised of potentially contaminated sites and includes sites with underground storage tanks for which an unauthorized release report is filed,subd.c.
in january,the regional board issued a closure letter finding that no further corrective action related to the petroleum contamination was necessary at the project site.a printout of a state water resources control board website identifying sites on the cortese list showed that the project site remained on the list but was given the status of case closed the day after the regional board closure letter was issued.
almost two years later,in december,citycentric applied to begin constructing the project.a use permit was finally approved in after the city determined that ceqa did not apply because the project fell under a regulatory exemption for urban in fill development projects.
parker shattuck brought a writ of mandate to challenge the city approval of the project in parker shattuck neighbors berkeley city council super.alameda county,no.although the trial court rejected parker shattuck various arguments under ceqa,finding they were not raised at the administrative level,it granted the writ and ordered the city to vacate approval of the project after it found that the city had allowed the project to be modified without first holding a public hearing.the city vacated the project approval in october.
in the second round of administrative proceedings,the city assumed the ceqa exemption for urban projects guidelines,was inapplicable.on november,the city released for public comment a proposed mitigated negative declaration mnd,which incorporated the initial study.
the proposed mnd found that the project would potentially affect several environmental factors,including the category entitled hazards hazardous materials.a checked box indicated that one potential environmental impact was that the project would b e located on a site which is included on the cortese list and,as a result,would create a significant hazard to the public or the environment.in its discussion of this potential effect,the mnd noted that although the project site appeared on the cortese list,both the city toxics management division and the regional board ha d found that the site has undergone adequate discovery and remediation,with the result that the site poses no significant hazard to the public or the environment.the proposed mnd also noted that according to the city toxic management division,t he recognized soil and groundwater impacts did not appear to extend beyond the property boundaries because various characteristics of petroleum oils made it unlikely they would spread in the soil,groundwater,or air.the mnd concluded that mitigation could reduce any potential impact to less than significant by ensur ing that there would be no significant hazard to the public or the environment during any necessary remediation work during or after construction of the project.
parker shattuck submitted comments on the proposed mnd,including comments from matthew hagemann,a hydrogeologist and expert on air quality.relying on hagemann comments,parker shattuck argued that an eir was required because the mnd mitigation measures failed adequately to address the health threat of the toxic soil contamination to construction workers and future residents of the project.a week later,parker shattuck submitted additional comments,which primarily discussed comments on the mnd submitted by the east bay municipal utilities district ebmud.ebmud letter informed the city that the utilities district would not inspect,install or maintain pipeline or services in soil or groundwater that was contaminated above certain levels and until the district was able to review contamination data and remediation plans.parker shattuck argued that these comments further demonstrated that the mnd mitigation measures were insufficient.
the berkeley zoning adjustments board held a public hearing on december and adopted the mnd.parker shattuck appealed the decision to the berkeley city council.in january,the city council approved the project.
parker shattuck filed this lawsuit in february,seeking a writ of mandate to compel the city to set aside approval of the mnd and project and to prepare an eir.the lawsuit also sought injunctive relief,costs,and attorney fees.although during the administrative proceedings parker shattuck had raised other concerns about the project,such as the potential for air pollution and noise,the petition primary contentions were that the site soil contamination is a significant environmental impact requiring an eir and the mnd failed to provide adequate mitigation measures.
the trial court issued a tentative order denying the petition,and a hearing occurred over two days in july.the court then issued an order and proposed statement of decision denying the petition and entered judgment.parker shattuck timely appealed.

parker shattuck has failed to identify substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the project disturbance of contaminated soil may have a significant effect on the environment.
parker shattuck contends that the city is required to prepare an eir because the mnd contains inadequate measures to mitigate environmental effects that will be caused by excavating and disturbing toxic soil.it argues that the project will have a significant effect on the environment by threatening the health of construction workers and future residents.we conclude that parker shattuck has failed to identify substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that potential health risks to workers and future residents might constitute a significant environmental impact.accordingly,we need not consider whether the mnd contained adequate mitigation measures because such measures are not required for effects which are not found to be significant.guidelines,subd.a.
significant effect on the environment means a substantial,or potentially substantial,adverse change in the environment.a change in the environment is a change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the project including land,air,water,minerals,flora,fauna,ambient noise,and objects of historic or aesthetic significance.guidelines.a finding of a significant environmental effect is mandatory if t he environmental effects of a project will cause substantial adverse effects on human beings,either directly or indirectly.guidelines,subd.a.in other words,while e ffects analyzed under ceqa must be related to a physical change guidelines,subd.b,such a change may be deemed significant based solely on its impact on people.
the disturbance of contaminated soil can be a physical change in the environment.
parker shattuck argues that disturbing contaminated soil can be a physical change in the environment.we agree.guidelines,subd.b citizens for responsible equitable environmental development city of chula vista th,creed in a case involving soil contamination beneath a former gas station,the court held that it could be fairly argued that the project at issue may have a significant environmental impact by disturbing contaminated soils see also association for a cleaner environment yosemite community college dist.th,ace project to remove a shooting range that would not increase the lead contamination already present due to bullets might nevertheless spread that contamination,which is a direct physical change in the environment,through increased vehicle and foot traffic and donations of portion of range to another site.
the city argues that this case is not about the project affecting the environment,but is instead about the environment,any contaminated soil or groundwater at the site affecting the project.in support of its position,it relies on several cases holding that the environment impact on a project is not a significant effect on the environment.but these decisions,with one exception,are not directly applicable here because the projects in those cases,unlike the project here,did not involve a physical change in the environment 
in one of the cases,baird county of contra costa th baird,the court considered whether an eir was required for a planned facility to be built on and adjacent to contaminated sites.id.at.the plaintiff contended that the preexisting contamination would have an adverse effect on the proposed facility and its residents.id.at,italics omitted.the court held that a ny such effect was beyond the scope of ceqa and its requirement of an eir because t he purpose of ceqa is to protect the environment from proposed projects,not to protect proposed projects from the existing environment.ibid.the court explained that an eir was not required for a project that might be affected by preexisting environmental conditions but would not change those conditions or otherwise have a significant effect on the environment.id.at.
this holding was premised on the finding that the project would not cause a physical change related to the contamination.the court specifically rejected the plaintiff contention that the construction of the facility may expose or exacerbate the existing ground contamination because all the contamination sources were several hundred feet away from the building site,and there was no evidence that the project would disturb contaminated soil.baird,supra,th at,fn.the observation implies that the court would have considered the disturbance of contaminated soil an effect on the environment,further supporting our conclusion that disturbing contaminated soil is a physical change that,under the right circumstances,may cause an environmental effect that is cognizable under ceqa.
in another case relied upon by the city,socwa,the plaintiff operated a plant next to the site of a proposed development and contended that an eir was necessary to consider the effect of the plant odors on the development.socwa,supra,th at.the court held that ceqa could not be used to defend the proposed project the future residences from a purportedly adverse existing environment smells from the sewage treatment plant.id.at.the court concluded that an eir was unnecessary because the plaintiff had failed to identify any relevant effect on the environment.id.at.and the same result was reached in yet another case relied upon by the city,ballona wetlands land trust city of los angeles th ballona,where the court held that an eir did not need to address impacts relating to sea level rise resulting from global climate change on a proposed development where the project itself would not cause sea levels to rise.id.at.thus,neither baird,socwa,nor ballona involved a project that would itself physically change the environment.by contrast,parker shattuck has identified an aspect of the project the disturbance of contaminated soils that will physically change the environment.
although we conclude that parker shattuck has identified a physical change in the environment that may be cognizable under ceqa,we reject its contention that the existence of toxic soil contamination at a project site,without any accompanying disturbance or other physical change,is,in itself,a significant impact requiring ceqa review and mitigation.in making this part of its argument,parker shattuck relies on creed.but this reliance is misplaced.creed concluded that there was a fair argument the project could have a significant environmental impact by disturbing contaminated soils,not merely by being built on a contaminated site.creed,supra,th at,italics added.
nor do we accept parker shattuck argument that an eir is necessarily required for every project proposed to be built on a site that is mentioned on the cortese list.in arguing that soil contamination at a project site is sufficient to trigger an eir,parker shattuck cites ceqa exception to categorical exemption for projects to be built on sites included on the cortese list,and the legislative history of assembly bill,the bill adding that exception,subd.d stats,ch,see also,subd.a requiring lead agency to determine whether a project is on a site and disclose that information in ceqa documents.we agree that the legislature intended that projects on these sites should not be categorically exempt from ceqa because they may be more likely to involve significant effects on the environment.but whether a project should be categorically exempt from ceqa is different from whether the project involves a significant effect on the environment.the finding that an exception to exemption applies ensures an initial study to investigate whether there is a potential significant effect on the environment but does not establish that such an effect exists.see davidon homes,supra,th at.as the city points out,a site may stay on the cortese list even after a determination is made that no further remediation is required,and this is precisely what occurred in this case.in short,we are not persuaded that projects built on sites identified on the cortese list necessarily involve a significant effect on the environment 
the identified health risks to construction workers and future residents do not establish that the disturbance of contaminated soil may have a significant effect on the environment.
we next turn to whether the project will have a significant effect on the environment as a result of the potential health risks to people.we conclude that the health risks to workers and residents identified by petitioners do not constitute substantial adverse effects on human beings or otherwise create a fair argument that the disturbance of contaminated soil may have a significant effect on the environment.
to begin with,and while we need not and do not decide the issue here,we note that it is far from clear that adverse effects confined only to the people who build or reside in a project can ever suffice to render significant the effects of a physical change.in general,ceqa does not regulate environmental changes that do not affect the public at large the question is whether a project would affect the environment of persons in general,not whether a project would affect particular persons.mira mar mobile community city of oceanside th,accord martin city and county of san francisco th.
