several organizations collectively petitioned for review of a final order of the environmental protection agency epa determining the atlanta motor vehicle emissions budget mveb to be adequate for transportation conformity.in response,epa moved to dismiss the petition as moot.because we conclude the petition for review is now moot,we will grant respondent motion and dismiss the petition.
the clean air act,establishes a comprehensive program for controlling and improving the nation air quality through state and federal regulation.the clean air act caa charges epa with identifying dangerous air pollutants and formulating the national ambient air quality standards naaqs to specify the maximum permissible concentration of those pollutants in the ambient air.for purposes of this petition for review,the only relevant pollutant is ozone resulting from motor vehicle emissions 
the caa requires each state to bring its air quality into attainment with the naaqs.to effectuate this goal,the caa classifies air quality control regions and assigns each nonattaining region an attainment deadline according to its classification.regions determined to be nonattainment regions are classified into the following five groups marginal,moderate,serious,severe,and extreme.id.a.atlanta was classified as a serious ozone nonattainment area,with a statutory attainment deadline of november.
to bring about attainment of the naaqs,the caa creates an extensive planning and review procedure.states must draft state implementation plans sips specifying the emission limitations necessary for attainment,maintenance,and enforcement of the naaqs.id.a sip is submitted to epa for approval,and epa approves sips based in part on whether the specified emissions controls will enable the region to achieve the naaqs by the applicable attainment deadline.id.k.in addition,the caa requires specific emissions controls based upon a region nonattainment classification,and these emissions controls must be included in the sip.id.for example,a severe nonattainment area is required to implement a reformulated gasoline rfg program not required for a serious nonattainment area.see id.k.states must periodically revise their sips and receive epa approval for the revisions.id.a h.
the extensive amendments to the caa bolstered the planning and review requirements in various ways.prior to,states failed to meet their naaqs attainment deadlines in part because federal agencies ignored the deadlines when approving federal transportation programs that affected motor vehicle emissions,which in turn hampered attainment.with the amendments,congress created new conformity requirements with which all transportation plans and projects must comply.generally,the federal government may not approve or fund any transportation program or project unless it has been found to conform to the applicable sip for the region.id.c.the motor vehicle emissions budget mveb,a component part of each sip,is central to transportation conformity decisions.the mveb is a projection of future emissions from motor vehicles for a given region.id.c.the mveb is thus at the intersection of the caa and transportation planning.a sip,along with its component mveb,effectively limits future transportation investments in a region so transportation planning will be consistent with achieving the naaqs by the applicable deadline.
in addition to the conformity requirements,the caa amendments contained a number of other incentives for states to meet their attainment deadlines.the most important of these is the provision,under which a nonattainment area that fails to meet the attainment deadline for its classification is by operation of law to a higher classification.id.b.while the higher classification results in an extension of the attainment deadline,it also mandates whatever specific emissions controls apply to the new classification 
timely review and approval of a region sip is essential to the region transportation planning because all transportation decisions must conform to the sip.in the ordinary course of business,however,epa takes between and months to review and approve a new sip.to allow for effective transportation planning in the interim between submission of a new sip and its approval,epa regulations authorize epa to approve an mveb standing alone via a preliminary finding that the mveb is adequate for transportation conformity purposes.see.the effect of such an mveb adequacy determination is to allow federal agencies to make conformity determinations based on the mveb even before the proposed sip is approved by epa epa may make an adequacy determination for an mveb only when,inter alia,the mveb is part of a sip submitted to epa for review and the mveb is consistent with the sip control measures and the applicable requirements for attainment.epa describes an adequacy determination as the result of a cursory review using minimum criteria.see transportation conformity rule amendments flexibility and streamlining.once epa finally approves a sip,the sip along with its constituent mveb becomes the governing plan for conformity purposes,see a,thereby superseding the interim determination that the mveb is adequate for transportation conformity.
one of the chief difficulties in implementing the caa amendments related to the problem of ozone transport.many states were unable to complete their sips by the statutory deadlines because they lacked necessary information about interstate ozone process by which ozone precursors move from upwind to downwind areas.in response to the scientific difficulties posed by ozone transport,epa formed the ozone transport assessment group otag in.otag completed its review in june of,concluding that nitrogen oxide nox reductions in upstate areas were the key to controlling ozone transport.
in response to otag work,epa issued a final rule known as the nox sip call rule in october.see finding of significant contribution and rulemaking for certain states in the ozone transport assessment group region for purposes of reducing regional transport of ozone,nox sip call rule.the nox sip call rule required upwind jurisdictions to revise their sips to prohibit ozone precursor emissions that contributed to nonattainment of the ozone naaqs in downwind states.the original nox sip call rule required the reductions in upwind states to be effective by.the circuit upheld much of the rule,and it also extended the deadline to.see michigan epa,michigan epa,wl,extending deadline under the nox sip call rule to.
although the nox sip call rule would reduce ozone transport from upwind states by,that would be too late for downwind areas classified as serious nonattainment regions,with attainment deadlines of november.epa therefore issued its extension policy.see extension of attainment dates for downwind transport areas.march,extension policy.the extension policy interpreted the caa to allow epa to grant extensions to moderate and serious areas that suffered from ozone transport,thereby postponing their attainment deadlines without reclassifying those areas to higher levels.epa would grant deadline extensions only after notice and comment rulemaking for each region,usually as part of a sip review.according to epa,the extension policy preserved the responsibilities of downwind areas under the statute without penalizing them for the impossibility of reducing ozone transported from upwind states.
in july,georgia submitted to epa a proposed sip that would meet an attainment deadline of.in so doing,georgia sip requested an extension of its deadline as a serious nonattainment area pursuant to epa extension policy.in december,epa informed georgia that it was finding the proposed mveb in the sip adequate for transportation conformity purposes.see adequacy status of the atlanta,georgia,ozone attainment demonstration for transportation conformity purposes,adequacy determination.
epa based its mveb adequacy determination on the attainment date in georgia proposed sip because that deadline would inevitably apply to the sip,whether or not epa granted georgia request for an extension pursuant to the extension policy.epa reasoned either georgia would receive an extension under the extension policy,which would have delayed its attainment deadline to in keeping with the nox sip call rule as extended by the circuit,or georgia would be to severe status,which would have delayed its attainment deadline to under the caa.in both instances,georgia would not need to demonstrate attainment before,so it was appropriate to find the mveb was adequate based upon the attainment date in the proposed sip.
petitioners then commenced this action on march,challenging epa december adequacy determination for the atlanta mveb.epa subsequently approved georgia sip on april.see approval and promulgation of implementation plans georgia ozone attainment demonstration,motor vehicle emissions budgets,reasonably available control measures,contingency measures and attainment date extension.may,sip approval.in doing so,epa granted georgia an extension until of its attainment deadline,pursuant to the extension policy.see id.
according to epa,its approval of georgia sip on april,supersedes its mveb adequacy determination,thereby rendering this case moot.now that the sip has been approved,epa claims its mveb adequacy determination is of no further legal consequence.according to petitioners,however,nothing about the sip approval supersedes the adequacy determination,since the sip includes the very same mveb that epa found adequate for transportation conformity.furthermore,petitioners argue the mveb adequacy determination may continue to have legal effect for transportation conformity decisions if epa approval of the sip is invalidated by this court 
the rule that federal courts may not decide cases that have become moot derives from article iii case and controversy requirement.see soliman united states,cir the doctrine of mootness derives directly from the case or controversy limitation because an action that is moot can not be characterized as an active case or controversy.internal quotation omitted al najjar ashcroft,cir same.if events that occur subsequent to the filing of a lawsuit or an appeal deprive the court of the ability to give meaningful relief,then the case is moot and must be dismissed.al najjar,at.dismissal of a moot case is required because mootness is jurisdictional.id.any decision on the merits of a moot case or issue would be an impermissible advisory opinion.ass of rehab.facilities.dep t of health rehabilitative,cir.
in what follows,we first conclude the sip approval supersedes the adequacy determination and renders this case moot.next,we reject petitioners suggestion that despite the sip approval,epa might somehow revive its adequacy determination and rely on the mveb for transportation conformity purposes.finally,we determine that petitioners other arguments against finding this case moot are incorrect.
petitioners assert the adequacy determination is not superseded by the sip approval because the mveb that was the subject of the adequacy determination is the same as the mveb in the sip.this position is predicated upon a misunderstanding of the limited scope of our review of epa actions.petitioners seek to avoid the mootness problem by having us assert jurisdiction over the mveb,whether standing alone or as a component of the sip.unfortunately,we can not review the mveb itself our jurisdiction is limited to epa final action that determined the mveb was adequate for transportation conformity purposes.b providing federal court review of final actions by the epa administrator.this limitation on the scope of review is a reflection of the division of labor between individual states and epa inherent in the regime of cooperative federalism created by the caa.see united states morrison,d noting caa as an example of cooperative federalism michigan,describing the caa as an experiment in cooperative federalism envtl.defense fund,discussing caa regime of state and federal cooperation and integrated planning.the caa regulatory regime leaves certain creating an mveb and a the states,while allowing the federal government to review and approve those state acts.the caa gives the federal courts power to review regulatory decisions,but only decisions of the epa,not the states.b.if we were to review the mveb qua than reviewing only epa adequacy would undermine the cooperative federalism congress has seen fit to establish in the caa.
there are two,discrete epa actions relevant to this case epa action finding the mveb to be adequate for transportation conformity purposes,pursuant to e,see adequacy determination.and epa approval of the sip,effected by notice and comment rulemaking.see sip approval.epa has consistently recognized that these separate actions are different from each other.at the time it published notice of its adequacy determination in the federal register,epa noted,an adequacy review is separate from epa completeness review of a sip.adequacy determination.epa later described the final sip approval as a separate action from epa prior adequacy determination that is based upon different analyses and standards.sip approval.at.these are not merely statements bolstering respondent litigation position the difference between an adequacy determination and a sip approval is inherent in the relevant epa regulations.
under the operative regulations,a finding that an mveb in a submitted sip is adequate for transportation conformity purposes is a temporary determination designed to enable transportation planning to proceed while the submitted sip is fully reviewed by epa.generally speaking,the caa requires transportation conformity decisions to be based on the applicable implementation plan,that is,the sip then in effect.see c a.because of the delay associated with review and approval of a sip,epa will make a preliminary adequacy determination about the mveb in the submitted sip.e.under the regulations,the effect of an adequacy determination is to require transportation conformity decisions to be based on the mveb in the submitted sip.e consistency with the motor vehicle emissions budgets in submitted control strategy implementation plans must be demonstrated if epa has declared the motor vehicle emissions budget s adequate for transportation conformity purposes.
the phrase in the submitted sip is crucial to understanding the operation of the regulations.section e authorization to make transportation conformity decisions based upon an adequate mveb is limited to adequate mvebs in submitted sips.until a sip is submitted,no adequacy determination can be made.more importantly,once a sip is approved,it is no longer a submitted sip it becomes the applicable implementation plan upon which transportation conformity decisions must be based.c a.
epa has already approved georgia sip.once it did so,its earlier mveb adequacy subject of petitioners challenge moot the only effect of an adequacy determination is to allow transportation planning to be based upon conformity to the mveb while the submitted sip is reviewed.because the sip has been approved,transportation conformity decisions must be based upon the new sip,not the mveb at this juncture,vacating epa mveb adequacy determination would accomplish nothing because transportation conformity decisions can not now be based upon the mveb the petition for review of the adequacy determination is now moot.
petitioners strongest is their suggestion that there might be circumstances in which epa could revive its adequacy determination and begin using the mveb,rather than the sip,for transportation conformity decisions.petitioners cite,which under certain circumstances permits transportation conformity decisions to be based upon an mveb determined to be adequate,even if the submitted sip containing the mveb is later disapproved by epa 
contrary to petitioners position,the governing statutory and regulatory regime forecloses any future reliance on the mveb as a result of epa adequacy determination.mveb adequacy determinations are interim measures that allow transportation planning to proceed while a sip is under review by epa.once a sip is approved,it becomes the applicable implementation plan governing transportation conformity decisions.c a.if a submitted sip is approved by epa,then a prior a
