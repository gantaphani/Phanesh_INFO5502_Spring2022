discussion 
mejia is entitled to an award of attorney fees 
code of civil procedure section authorizes an award of attorney fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in an action that has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if the action has conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons and the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement make the award appropriate ibid.california home does not challenge the superior court implied findings that mejia is a successful party and that this proceeding has vindicated an important public right and conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons,but contends mejia failed to establish the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement.with respect to necessity and financial burden,a n award on the private attorney general theory is appropriate when the cost of the claimant legal victory transcends his personal interest,that is,when the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit placed a burden on the plaintiff out of proportion to his individual stake in the matter.citation.woodland hills residents,city council cal d.
t he private attorney general doctrine rests upon the recognition that privately initiated lawsuits are often essential to the effectuation of the fundamental public policies embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions,and that,without some mechanism authorizing the award of attorney fees,private actions to enforce such important public policies will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible.thus,the fundamental objective of the doctrine is to encourage suits enforcing important public policies by providing substantial attorney fees to successful litigants in such cases.citation.graham daimlerchrysler cal th,d.i t is established that fees,if recoverable at to either statute or the parties available for services at trial and on appeal.serrano unruh cal d.
whether the moving party has satisfied the statutory requirements so as to justify a fee award is a question committed to the discretion of the trial court we review the ruling for abuse of discretion.baggett gates cal d,families unafraid to uphold rural el dorado county board of supervisors th,d.an abuse of discretion occurs if,in light of the applicable law and considering all of the relevant circumstances,the court decision exceeds the bounds of reason and results in a miscarriage of justice.shamblin brattain cal d,denham superior court cal d,city of sacramento drew d.this standard of review affords considerable deference to the trial court provided that the court acted in accordance with the governing rules of law.we presume that the court properly applied the law and acted within its discretion unless the appellant affirmatively shows otherwise.denham,supra,at,state farm fire casualty pietak th,d.
california home cites several opinions in which the court of appeal affirmed the denial of a fee award under code of civil procedure section based on the superior court finding that the financial burden of private enforcement did not outweigh the petitioner personal interest at stake.williams san francisco bd.of permit appeals th,d city of hawaiian gardens city of long beach th,d christward ministry county of san diego th,d schwartz city of rosemead d.those opinions affirming a discretionary ruling do not compel the conclusion that the ruling here was an abuse of discretion.rather,california home must show that the finding that mejia personal interest does not outweigh the financial burden of private enforcement exceeds the bounds of reason.
mejia personal interest as a homeowner and resident in opposing the proposed development based on an inadequate environmental review was substantial.but her substantial personal interest does not preclude a finding that the financial burden of this litigation was out of proportion to her personal stake in this matter.the financial burden of this litigation on mejia was great she declared that the demands of this litigation caused her to deplete her retirement savings and that she was forced to refinance her home to support this litigation.we can not conclude based on the present record that the court finding that mejia personal interest did not outweigh the financial burden of private enforcement was manifestly unreasonable 
the fee award against california home as the real party in interest was proper 
california home contends the fee award against it was improper because california home was without fault and ceqa compliance was the city sole responsibility.code of civil procedure section authorizes an attorney fee award to a successful party against one or more opposing parties ibid.thus,the question is whether california home was an opposing party within the meaning of the statute.the material facts concer
