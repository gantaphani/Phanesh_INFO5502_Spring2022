opinion of the court 
kristie bell and joan luppe are the named plaintiffs in a class action complaint the complaint filed against cheswick generating station,genon power midwest,genon the putative class the class is made up of at least individuals who own or inhabit residential property within one mile of genon cheswick generating station,a megawatt electrical generation facility in spring dale,pennsylvania the plant.
complaining of ash and contaminants settling on their property,the class brought suit against genon under several state law tort theories.genon argued that because the plant was subject to comprehensive regulation under the clean air act,it owed no extra duty to the members of the class under state tort law.the district court agreed with genon and dismissed the case.on appeal,we are faced with a matter of first impression whether the clean air act preempts state law tort claims brought by private property owners against a source of pollution located within the state.based on the plain language of the clean air act and controlling supreme court precedent,we conclude that such source state common law actions are not preempted.accordingly,we reverse the decision of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings.
regulatory framework 
environmental regulation under the clean air act 
the clean air act,et,enacted in,is a comprehensive federal law that regulates air emissions under the auspices of the united states environmental protection agency epa.congress enacted the law in response to evidence of the increasing amount of air pollution created by the industrialization and urbanization of the united states and its threat to public health and welfare.a.the clean air act states that air pollution prevention and control is the primary responsibility of individual states and local governments but that federal financial assistance and leadership is essential to accomplish these goals.id.a.thus,it employs a cooperative federalism structure under which the federal government develops baseline standards that the states individually implement and enforce.genon rema,llc epa,wl,at cir.july.in so doing,states are expressly allowed to employ standards more stringent than those specified by the federal requirements.
the clean air act makes the epa responsible for developing acceptable national ambient air quality standards naaqs,which are meant to set a uniform level of air quality across the country in order to protect the populace and the environment.id.b.before such levels are adopted or modified by the epa,a reasonable time for interested persons to submit written comments must be provided.id.a b.the epa itself does not typically regulate individual sources of emissions.instead,decisions regarding how to meet naaqs are left to individual states.id.a.pursuant to this goal,each state is required to create and submit to the epa a state implementation plan sip which provides for implementation,maintenance,and enforcement of naaqs within the state.id.all sips must be submitted to the epa for approval before they become final,and once a sip is approved,its requirements become federal law and are fully enforceable in federal court.her majesty the queen in right of the province of ontario detroit,cir citing a.

modes of redress under the caa 
the clean air act contains a citizen suit provision,see,which permits the filing of civil suits in district courts against any person who is alleged to have violated or to be in violation of a an emission standard or limitation under this chapter or b an order issued by the administrator or a state with respect to such a standard or limitation.id.a.the statute further grants a cause of action against the epa if it fails to perform any responsibility,id.a,and also allows suit against any entity that constructs a source of emissions without securing the requisite permits.id.a.furthermore,the epa retains the power to inspect and monitor regulated sources,to impose administrative penalties for noncompliance,and to commence civil actions against polluters in federal court.am.power,connecticut,d.
the citizen suit provision contains a savings clause which provides,in pertinent part 
nothing in this section shall restrict any right which any person or class of persons may have under any statute or common law to seek enforcement of any emission standard or limitation or to seek any other relief including relief against the administrator or a state agency.
e.this is the clean air act citizen suit savings clause.
the clean air act also contains a separate savings clause entitled retention of state authority,codified at.this provision focuses on states rights,and reads as follows 
except as otherwise provided nothing in this chapter shall preclude or deny the right of any state or political subdivision thereof to adopt or enforce any standard or limitation respecting emissions of air pollutants or any requirement respecting control or abatement of air pollution 
id.this is the clean air act states rights savings clause.
regulation at the cheswick plant 
federal,state,and local authorities extensively regulate and comprehensively oversee the operations of the cheswick plant pursuant to their authority under the clean air act.the epa,the pennsylvania department of environmental protection,and the allegheny county health department comprise the administrative bodies that are primarily responsible for defining environmental emission standards and policing compliance with the clean air act at the plant.as discussed above,at the epa direction and with its approval,states issue operating permits for all stationary sources under subchapter v of the clean air act.see subchapter v program authority has in this instance been delegated to allegheny county.genon subchapter v permit for cheswick the permit imposes limits on the emission of various particulate matter,gasses,chemical,and compounds from coal combustion.see app.
the permit collects all the operational requirements that are contained in subchapter v of the clean air act,and approved by the epa.it specifically provides that genon may not operate any source in such manner that emissions of malodorous matter from such source are perceptible beyond the property line,app.iv must take all reasonable actions to prevent fugitive air contaminants from becoming airborne,app.iv may not conduct any materials handling operation in such manner that emissions from such operation are visible at or beyond the property line,app.iv must ensure that a ll air pollution control equipment is properly installed,maintained,and operated,app.iv and may not operate any source in such manner that emissions from such source m ay reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health,safety,or welfare.app.iii.
however,it also provides that nothing in this permit relieves the permittee from the obligation to comply with all applicable federal,state and local laws and regulations,app.declaration of policy,and contains a savings clause which provides that 
nothing in this permit shall be construed as impairing any right or remedy now existing or hereafter created in equity,common law or statutory law with respect to air pollution,nor shall any court be deprived of such jurisdiction for the reason that such air pollution constitutes a violation of this permit.
ii.general factual and procedural overview 
the complaint alleges that genon operation,maintenance,control,and use of the plant releases malodorous substances and into the surrounding neighborhood,causing fly ash and unburned coal combustion byproducts to settle onto the class members property as a black or white powder which requires constant cleaning.app.these odors and particulates are harmful and noxious and have caused substantial damage to class members property and the loss of their ability to use and enjoy their properties,making them prisoners in their own homes.app.the operation of the plant has been the subject of numerous and constant complaints by the residents of the surrounding neighborhood and by organizations and interested persons within the area.however,these complaints have not compelled genon to cease the improper operation of the plant or to discontinue the ongoing invasion and trespass of the class members properties.the complaint alleges that genon knows of the improper construction,and operation of the plant,which allows discharge of these particulates,yet continues to operate the plant without proper or best available technology,or any proper air pollution control equipment.app.
based on these allegations,the class seeks to recover compensatory and punitive damages under three state common law tort theories nuisance negligence and recklessness and trespass although the complaint also seeks injunctive relief on the nuisance and trespass counts,the class admits that such relief would be limited to an order requiring genon to remove the particulate that continuously falls upon the class members properties.oral arg.at bell,d at.
b.the district court decision 
in july,genon removed the case to the western district of pennsylvania invoking the district court diversity jurisdiction,and promptly moved to dismiss the action on the grounds that the state law tort claims were preempted by the clean air act.it argued that allowing such claims to go forward would undermine the clean air act comprehensive scheme,and make it impossible for regulators to strike their desired balance in implementing emissions standards.app.in october the district court granted genon motion,finding that the clean air act preempted all of the class state law claims.
the district court began by summarizing the extensive regulatory framework governing the plant.it then reviewed the complaint and determined that the allegations of plaintiffs,as pleaded,assert various permit violations and seek a judicial examination of matters governed by the regulating administrative bodies.bell,d at.thus,it moved on to examine whether the clean air act preempts the state common law claims or whether the savings clause in the citizen suit provision allow those claims to survive.id.at.after discussing the relevant case law,the district court concluded that,b ased on the extensive and comprehensive regulations promulgated by the administrative bodies which govern air emissions from electrical generation facilities,the court finds and rules that to permit the common law claims would be inconsistent with the dictates of the clean air act.id.at.the court found that the savings clause of the clean air act does not alter this analysis.id.the class now appeals this decision.
preemption analysis 
the supremacy clause of the united states constitution states 
this constitution,and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.
const.art.vi,cl.the supreme court has interpreted the supremacy clause as preempting any state law that interferes with or is contrary to federal law.free bland,d.federal law can preempt state law in three ways express preemption,field preemption,and conflict preemption.farina nokia,cir.conflict preemption nullifies state law inasmuch as it conflicts with federal law,either where compliance with both laws is impossible or where state law erects an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.id.internal quotation marks omitted.genon argues that state tort law conflicts with the objectives of the clean air act,because it would undermine the act comprehensive scheme and rival the work of regulators as they strike their desired balance in implementing emissions standards.appellee br.at.
legal precedent 
while the extent to which the clean air act preempts state law tort claims against an source of pollution is a matter of first impression in this circuit,the supreme court has addressed this issue in the context of a similarly comprehensive environmental statute the clean water act,et.in international paper ouellette,d,the court was asked to determine whether the clean water act preempted a vermont common law nuisance suit filed in vermont state court,where the source of the alleged injury was located in new york.plaintiffs,a group of property owners who resided on the vermont affected state shore of lake champlain,alleged that the defendant paper company,which operated a pulp and paper mill on the new york source state side of the lake,was discharging effluents into the lake,polluting the water and thereby diminishing the value of their property.id.at.defendants argued that the clean water act preempted the court from applying vermont state law against a source of pollution located in new york.in response,plaintiffs argued that the clean water act savings clauses indicated that congress intended to preserve the right to bring suit under the law of any affected state.id.at.
like the clean air act,the clean water act contains two savings clauses,one located in the citizen suit provision,and another which focuses on states rights.section e of the clean water act,which is located in the act citizen suit provision,states 
nothing in this section shall restrict any right which any person or class of persons may have under any statute or common law to seek enforcement of any effluent standard or limitation or to seek any other relief 
e.section of the clean water act focuses on states rights,and provides 
except as expressly provided in this chapter,nothing in this chapter shall preclude or deny the right of any state or political subdivision thereof or interstate agency to adopt or enforce a any standard or limitation respecting discharges of pollutants,or b any requirement respecting control or abatement of pollution or be construed as impairing or in any manner affecting any right or jurisdiction of the states with respect to the waters including boundary waters of such states.
the ouellette court found that the clean water act savings clauses clearly preserved some state law tort actions,but that the text of the clauses did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether suits based on the law of the affected state were preempted.at.however,it found definitively that nothing in the clean water act bars aggrieved individuals from bringing a nuisance claim pursuant to the laws of the source state.id.at emphasis in original.the court reasoned that,b y its terms the clean water act allows states to impose higher standards on their own point sources,and this authority may include the right to impose higher as well as higher statutory restrictions.id.internal citation omitted.the court acknowledged that a source state nuisance law may impose separate standards and thus create some tension with the permit system,but explained that this would not frustrate the goals of the clean water act,because a source only is required to look to a single additional authority,whose rules should be relatively predictable.id.at thus,a suit by vermont citizens would not be preempted if brought under the law of new york,the source state.
genon argues that ouellette is distinguishable from this case because the savings clauses of the clean water act are broader than the corresponding provisions in the clean air act.however,a textual comparison of the two savings clauses at issue demon
