petitioner hydro resources,hri challenges a february,environmental protection agency epa land status determination,in which epa concluded that certain land owned by hri in the checkerboard area of northwestern new section indian country.epa determination subjects hri proposed uranium mine to epa regulation under the safe drinking water act sdwa,rather than regulation by the new mexico environmental department nmed.
epa regulations implementing the sdwa define indian lands by reference to.that section defines indian country as reservations,id.a,dependent indian communities,id.b,and allotments,id.c the pertinent provision here is b.after a notice and comment period and consultations with the department of the interior doi and the navajo nation,epa determined that the section land is located within a dependent indian community.under our precedents,we agree with epa conclusion and,accordingly,we deny hri petition.
background 
a.the section land and the checkerboard 
hri,a mining corporation,intends to operate a uranium mine in mckinley county,new mexico.see hri,epa,cir specifically,hri seeks to mine within the confines of acres of land that it owns in fee in the southeast portion of section,township,range.id.hri acquired the land from united nuclear corporation unc,which had purchased the land from the united states in hri also purchased,at that time,unc patents for claims on the section land.the united states owns in fee simple the remainder of section.id.
no one lives on the section land.gallup,the largest city in mckinley county,lies approximately miles southwest of the section land,while the navajo town of church rock lies approximately miles south of the land.hri pays annual property taxes on the section land to mckinley county.new mexico maintains the only access road to section,state highway,while mckinley county shares responsibility with the federal government for the other roads in the area.mckinley county also provides fire,police,emergency,and school services to those living in the surrounding area.meanwhile,should hri uranium operations ever begin,public service company of new mexico will provide electricity,and the new mexico state water engineer has approved hri request for water rights.
section is located in the checkerboard area of northwestern new mexico,where federal land grants created a pattern of mixed indian and land title.hri,at the section land is located near,but not within,the navajo reservation.instead,it is within the jurisdiction of the eastern navajo agency and the geographic bounds of the church rock chapter the chapter of the navajo nation 
the area surrounding section is often referred to as the eo area because of its establishment as an indian reservation under two executive orders bearing those numbers which were issued in and.id.just a few years later,however,those two executive orders were superseded by two additional executive orders which restored unalloted lands in that particular tract to the public domain.id.the latter executive orders thereby terminated the reservation status of the eo tract.see pittsburg midway coal mining yazzie yazzie,cir.in yazzie,this court concluded that the entire eo area was not a de facto reservation and recognized the complicated jurisdictional status of the checkerboard lands.id.at.thereafter,in pittsburg midway coal mining watchman watchman,cir,abrogated in part on other grounds by alaska native village of venetie tribal government,d,this court entertained the possibility that land in the checkerboard could constitute a dependent indian community under b.
b.the church rock chapter 
as noted above,the section land falls within the bounds of the church rock chapter.the chapter is a local government organization of the navajo nation,authorized by the navajo nation local governance act,see,to provide for the general health,safety and welfare of the chapter membership,id.the navajo nation officially certified the chapter on december.
the bounds of the chapter encircle a land base of over acres,of which is held in trust for the navajo or individual navajos by the bia.the lands which the bia holds in trust were originally purchased by the united states from the santa fe railroad company for the navajo tribe or for individual navajo allottees pursuant to the act of.around of the chapter land is held by the bureau of land management blm and used almost exclusively by navajos,is privately owned,and is owned in fee by the navajo nation.
while the section land has no inhabitants,members of the chapter live in adjacent areas.the chapter social and political nerve center,the chapter house,is located about three miles east of the city limits of gallup doc.at and approximately six miles south of the section land.a head start center,elementary school,several churches,and various other buildings housing chapter,tribal,and bia entities surround the chapter house.these facilities serve the or so according to census data inhabitants of the chapter land.over of those inhabitants are navajos most of the living on the chapter land are married to navajos.a majority of the inhabitants speak navajo.primarily,the chapter residents raise livestock as a livelihood.many supplement their income with earnings from traditional jewelry making,silversmithing,sewing,stone carving,wood carving,and weaving.doc.at.some chapter residents commute to gallup for work.
neither the unincorporated churchrock chapter nor the navajo tribal government provides any infrastructure or basic services to section.doc.at see also doc.at.however,the navajo nation provides a variety of services to the residents of the church rock chapter.for example,the nation polices the chapter,although the chapter makes up its own navajo judicial district.the navajo nation also provides electricity,drinking water,wastewater treatment,and other utilities.the federal government complements these services,providing social services,natural resource management,grazing management and permitting,housing development,health services,economic development grants,law enforcement improvement grants,and education programs.additionally,the chapter itself also offers some services to its residents.the state of new mexico services the main road through the chapter and buses some chapter students to school in gallup.public service company of new mexico provides natural gas to chapter residents.
c.the safe drinking water act 
the sdwa,establishes nationwide minimum drinking water protection standards.see,at,reprinted in,see also hri,at.those standards are implemented by epa,which in many instances delegates certain regulatory prerogatives to states and indian tribes.see hri,at see generally as part of the sdwa,congress instructed epa to prescribe an underground injection control uic program for all lands in the united states,including indian lands,in order to prevent underground injection which endangers drinking water sources.b.
by statutory default,epa typically has primary enforcement responsibilities for lands that fall within definition of indian lands until a tribe has secured treatment as a state tas status and primacy over its lands.that regulation,states that indian lands means indian country as defined in.where a dispute exists as to the indian country status of land,epa administers the uic program until a final determination can be made.see,see also hri,at.accordingly,epa administers the uic program for indian lands in new mexico,with the exception of those lands under the purview of tribes that have secured tas status and primacy.see hri,at the uic program for all classes of wells on indian lands in new mexico is administered by epa.meanwhile,epa has approved new mexico uic program hence,elsewhere in the state of new mexico,nmed regulates the type of uic wells that hri seeks to operate here.see see also.july.
regulation of the section land under the sdwa 
although epa approved the navajo nation for tas and for primacy in,see hri,at,the two uic programs at issue here are the program for indian lands in new mexico,see,and the nmed program,see id.in approving new mexico sdwa application for primacy,epa recognized the geographic reach of the nmed uic program to be statewide,except as to indian lands.see.at.this exception to the geographic reach of the nmed uic program led to the dispute here,which is now in its second stage.
the first stage of the dispute stemmed from epa decision that the jurisdictional status of the section land was in dispute.prior to that decision,the nmed had already approved hri request for a uic permit for the section land in.but the navajo nation submitted a letter in october to epa,asserting that section was located within indian country and thus fell outside the bounds of nmed regulatory jurisdiction.epa,in turn,requested additional information about the jurisdictional issue from both the nmed and the navajo nation.in the meantime,however,epa stated that it had determined that a dispute exists regarding the indian country status of section,and,therefore,hri must obtain its federal sdwa permit for section from epa as well.doc.at.hri and nmed appealed that determination to this court 
on appeal,this court concluded that epa had not erred in finding a legitimate dispute as to the jurisdictional status of the lands in question.hri,at.the court remanded the issue to epa for a final determination as to whether the section land is a dependent indian community under b.id.at.
on remand,epa issued a notice inviting public commentary on the issue.the small pool of comments revealed a variety of interests in both the jurisdictional issue and the broader issue of uranium mining near navajo communities.epa also consulted with the navajo nation.
additionally,epa sought the input of the doi solicitor,summing up the question as follows as framed by the tenth circuit,the precise issue for epa in determining the status of hri land in section,is whether the land is,or is part of,a dependent indian community as defined under b.doc.at.on november,the doi solicitor submitted its statement on the question doi opinion.the opinion concluded that the section land fell within the encincture of b because of the land ties to the church rock chapter community.
after further analysis and investigation,epa issued its land status determination on february.the determination reiterated much of the reasoning of the doi opinion.epa ultimately concluded that the church rock chapter,which necessarily includes section,is a dependent indian community.doc.at.accordingly,the epa is the proper authority under the sdwa to regulate underground injections on hri section land.id.hri petitioned this court to review epa determination.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
this court has jurisdiction to review the epa final decision under a.the epa,however,challenges hri article iii standing to seek review of the determination before this court.epa reasons that because the land status determination merely implicates which regulator epa or nmed will enforce uic regulations rather than what those regulations will be,hri has suffered no harm that is,because one of these two agencies will enforce the uic regulations,it should not matter to hri which of the two agencies it will be.however,we conclude that because hri must now obtain a permit from epa prior to commencing underground injection on section,hri,at,after already obtaining a permit from new mexico,hri will almost certainly incur additional expenses if epa,in fact,has properly asserted jurisdiction over section.therefore,we conclude that hri has standing 
to have article iii standing,a litigant must demonstrate that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is either actual or imminent,that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant,and that it is likely that a favorable decision will redress that injury.massachusetts epa,d.the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.standing must be established even though the sdwa provides an expansive avenue for petitions for review.see valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d neither the administrative procedure act,nor any other congressional enactment,can lower the threshold requirements of standing under art.iii.see also am.forest paper ass epa,cir.
here,only the injury in fact element is in dispute.the issue is whether hri has suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at.quotations,citations omitted.hri argues that the epa determination burdens hri with the cost of compliance with federal regulations and prohibits hri from renewing its uic permit previously obtained from the state.pet r reply at.in other words,to proceed with its mining plans,hri must expend the funds necessary to comply with the federal uic regime.
we determine that the outlay of funds necessary to secure a uic permit under the program constitutes an injury in fact.see collegiate athletic ass califano,cir o cost to a business of obeying a new rule of government,or the unwanted result of the government rule whether or not there was an associated pecuniary loss suffices as an injury in fact.citation omitted.epa has acknowledged that requiring a federal permit for section will be disruptive to some degree,especially since nmed and hri have assumed until recently that the permit would be effective doc.at.in addition to being disruptive,the permitting process could well be very expensive,inflicting an economic injury that surely confers standing on hri.see califano,at t he cost of obeying the regulations constitutes injury.see also sac fox nation of pierce,cir allegations of particularized imminent economic injury suffice for injury in fact element.thus,hri has standing to pursue review in this court and we may exercise jurisdiction under a.
standard of review 
epa determination that the section land is part of a dependent indian community under b constitutes a determination that epa has jurisdiction,under the sdwa,to regulate underground injections on that land therefore,we review the land status determination to ascertain whether the jurisdictional decision has an adequate basis in law.city of fort morgan fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir quoting cascade natural gas fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir further quotation omitted.in our analysis of epa jurisdictional determination,we are under no obligation to defer to the agency legal conclusions.id.quotation omitted.see also tulengkey gonzales,cir explaining that this court reviews an agency legal conclusions de novo.
even if chevron deference does broadly apply to agencies interpretations of their own jurisdiction and authority,such deference would not be appropriate in this case.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.in chevron,the supreme court held that ambiguities in statutes within an agency jurisdiction to administer are delegations of authority to the agency to fill the statutory gap in reasonable fashion.cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d emphasis added.here,congress has delegated to epa the authority to administer the sdwa it has never delegated to epa the authority to administer.kansas united states,cir applying chevron to the national indian gaming commission interpretation of the term indian lands within the indian gaming regulatory act,a statute the agency was charged with administering.
furthermore,while epa determination of section land status involved an interpretation of one of its own regulations rather than of statutory language in the sdwa,courts do not defer to agency interpretations of regulations that merely restate the terms of a statute.gonzales oregon,d.t he existence of such a parroting regulation does not change the fact that the question here is not the meaning of the regulation but the meaning of the statute.id.
thus,in ascertaining here whether the land status determination has an adequate basis in law,city of fort morgan,at,we do not defer to epa legal conclusions as to the indian country status of the section land.see hri,at noting that the agency jurisdiction under federal indian law presents a purely legal issue.we examine an agency factual findings to see if they are supported by reasonable,substantial and probative evidence considering the record as a whole.turgerel mukasey,cir quotation omitted.see also quivira mining epa,cir applying the substantial evidence test to agency determinations of fact that are jurisdictional.
epa regulations promulgated under the sdwa define indian lands as indian country as defined in.the parties agree that only b is pertinent.therefore,the central issue here is whether epa land status agency conclusion that the section land is within a dependent indian community as defined in b has an adequate basis in law,city of fort morgan,at.
section b defines indian country as all dependent indian communities within the borders of the united states whether within the original or subsequently acquired territory thereof,and whether within or without the limits of a state.b emphasis added.in alaska native village of venetie tribal government venetie,d,the supreme court determined that the term dependent indian communities 
refers to a limited category of indian lands that are neither reservations nor allotments,and that satisfy two,they must have been set aside by the federal government for use of the indians as indian land second,they must be under federal superintendence.
at.emphasis added the first requirement guarantees that the land is actually occupied by an indian community,while the second ensures that the community is dependent on the federal government such that the federal government and the indians,rather than the states,exercise primary jurisdiction.united states arrieta,cir.
before reaching the two venetie requirements,however,our precedents compel us to identify the appropriate community of reference.see hri,at n othing in venetie speaks to the propriety of the first element of the watchman of the proper community of reference.
the watchman test adopted in the tenth circuit involved two inquiries.first,the court identified the appropriate community of reference.at.second,the court used four factors to determine whether that community of reference constitutes a dependent indian community under b.id.at.those factors included 
whether the united states has retained title to the lands which it permits the indians to occupy and authority to enact regulations and protective laws respecting this territory,the nature of the area in question,the relationship of the inhabitants in the area to indian tribes and to the federal government,and the established practice of government agencies toward the area,whether there is an element of cohesiveness manifested either by economic pursuits in the area,common interests,or needs of the inhabitants as supplied by that locality,and whether such lands have been set apart for the use,occupancy and protection of dependent indian peoples.
watchman,at quoting united states south dakota,cir.
although venetie abrogated a ninth circuit test that embraced many of the same factors that are part of the watchman test,the hri court subsequently concluded that venetie could not have abrogated watchman threshold community of reference prong because the venetie court was not even presented with the question of defining the proper means of determining a community of reference for analysis under b.hri,at.thus,the hri court noted that it was bound to apply watchman community of reference test absent en banc review.id.
the hri court acknowledged,however,that venetie had altered the second step of the watchman inquiry.at see also arrieta,at.with the exception of the third watchman factor an element of cohesiveness those factors approximate the and superintendence requirements set forth in venetie.thus,we first determine the community of reference,and we then apply to that community of reference the and superintendence requirements established in venetie to determine whether that area is a dependent indian community.see hri,at arrieta,at 
to determine the appropriate community of reference,we follow the same general procedure we developed before venetie.first,we identify the geographical definition of the area proposed as a community.united states adair,cir id.at generally,cases which result in dependent indian community designation are areas exhibiting reasonably distinct boundaries.second,we analyze the status of the area in question as a community.id.at quoting watchman,at.lastly,we consider that locale or community of reference within the context of the surrounding area.id.quoting watchman,at.
hri stridently disputes that watchman community of reference test survived venetie.however,as the first hri panel noted,hri and arrieta,both decided after venetie,determined that our community of reference test survived venetie.therefore,tenth circuit law on this matter is settled.see united states meyers,cir doctrine of stare decisis bars panel from overruling earlier decision of a panel of this court absent en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary decision by the supreme court quotation omitted.
community of reference 
epa recognized that this circuit precedents require that before reaching the two venetie prongs,the reviewing court or agency determine the appropriate community of reference.having considered the three steps of the community of reference analysis,epa concluded that the appropriate community of reference was the church rock chapter.we see no reason to reject this conclusion.
first,we agree with epa finding that the chapter has definite geographic boundaries.epa included in the administrative record a map showing the contours of the chapter.as epa determined,the section land that hri seeks to mine falls within these bounds.
second,we consider whether epa properly determined that the chapter is a community under our caselaw.this factor evaluates the existence of an element of cohesiveness in the community.watchman,at.cohesiveness can be manifested either by economic pursuits in the area,common interests,or needs of the inhabitants as supplied by that locality.id.
the chapter exhibits several of the indicia of a cohesive community that we have looked for in past cases.demographically,the population is fairly homogenous based on the most current census data,of the chapter population are members of the navajo nation and the majority of the residents speak navajo or other native languages.this indicates the presence of common interests.united states,d,i t is clear that a culturally cohesive community exists in the iyanbito chapter of the navajo nation as a whole.
moreover,the community is cohesive in terms of its economic pursuits.in keeping with tradition,many of the chapter residents raise livestock and supplement their income with earnings from the sale of traditional crafts.of course,other chapter residents commute to gallup for work,but the community remains centered on traditional means of earning a living.we note also that the chapter,pursuant to its authority under the navajo local government act,addresses many of the health,welfare,and social needs of its residents.compare blatchford sullivan,cir noting that denizens eligibility for a variety of services flows by virtue of their identification as part of the navajo nation,not by virtue of their settlement in.as epa correctly concluded,the chapter has cohesiveness such that we can consider it a community.
at the third step,we scrutinize epa analysis of the chapter within the context of the surrounding area.adair,at quoting watchman,at.this inquiry ensures that we do not artificially fragment a larger community or fuse a series of smaller communities in identifying the appropriate community of reference.thus,we ask whether the locality is a separate consisting of personal residences and an infrastructure.watchman,at see also adair,at factoring in paucity of institutions and services available in area in question and the area generalized dependency on surrounding areas in rejecting that area status as a community.if an area lacks the quality and quantity of activity and institutions which create infrastructure and,in turn,community,then we will not consider it a distinct community.adair,at.nonetheless,a community can not be expected to originate all or even most of the needs,necessities,and wants of modern life.id.quoting watchman,at.
as to the chapter infrastructure,the doi opinion noted the fact that the chapter has a collection of homes which are either organized into traditional camps of one to six homes or into low cost tribal housing developments.doc.at.there are over homes on the chapter land.additionally,the chapter has a head start center,an elementary school,several churches,and a host of chapter,tribal,and bia services and facilities.id.at.while the chapter infrastructure is not extensive,a community can not be expected to originate all or even most of the needs,necessities,and wants of modern life.adair,at quotation omitted.this is all the more so for rural communities like the chapter.
epa acknowledged that many of the chapter services are provided by the navajo nation,the state,or the federal government.specifically,the navajo nation provides policing although the chapter makes up its own judicial district within the nation,electricity,drinking water,wastewater treatment,and other utilities.among other services,the federal government provides social services,natural resource management,grazing management and permitting,housing development,health services,economic development grants,law enforcement improvement grants,and education programs.and new mexico services the main road through the chapter,buses some chapter students to school in gallup,and also provides natural gas to the chapter residents.
nevertheless,epa determined that the chapter possessed sufficient distinctness under watchman.three critical factors support that conclusion.first,we note as did epa and doi that the chapter is a navajo traditional rural community.doc.at see also id.at.is not necessary for community status under our jurisprudence.that other entities provide the chapter services is to be expected for a rural,economically disadvantaged community.adair,at.
second,the chapter is a distinct political entity under the navajo nation,which performs similar functioning with respect to the health and welfare of its residents as those performed by a county or municipality in the state government system.doc.at quoting thriftway mktg.state.see authorizing chapters to make decisions regarding local matters and provide for the health,safety and general welfare of their memberships.in this regard,the chapter residents turn to the particularly the chapter obtain services and to gather for social and political events.epa found that of the chapter residents visit the chapter community social and political of those residents do so at least monthly.
third,under the local governance act,the chapter has developed a chapter planning initiative and land use plan.the land use plan,issued in november,provides further evidence that the community is distinct.the document captures the specific concerns and goals of the chapter community in the context of a plan to add and update housing on chapter land for chapter residents.these factors are sufficient to distinguish the chapter as a community distinct from both the navajo nation more broadly and the gallup community.in sum,we can not find fault with epa determination that the church rock chapter is the appropriate community of reference.
for its part,hri argues that epa erred in fixing on the chapter as the community of reference.it asserts that under venetie we may look only at the section land however,our precedent bars us from deeming the section land the community of reference see arrieta,at hri,at watchman,at.alternatively,hri argues that venetie abrogated the community of reference test entirely,replacing watchman with a test involving only the and superintendence requirements.hri points to the plain language of venetie and also to the policy ramifications of our community of reference test.
hri notes that the venetie court twice touched on the issue of whether to gauge a community under b by the people on the land or the land itself.first,the court expounded,the federal government must take some action setting apart the land for the use of the indians as such,and it is the land in question,and not merely the indian tribe inhabiting it,that must be under the superintendence of the federal government.venetie,at.emphasis in original.with this clarification,the court rejected the syllogism that because all f ederally recognized tribes are under the superintendence of the government,all lands owned by those tribes meet the second requirement.id.second,and in the same vein,the court noted that its indian country precedents do not suggest that the mere provision of desperately needed social programs can support a finding of indian country.id.at.that is,the federal government role in providing health,education,and welfare benefits was not an indicator of active federal control over the tribe land sufficient to support a finding of federal superintendence.id.emphasis added.
thus,hri reasons that as a legal matter,the venetie analysis focuses on the land in,the section not the indian community encompassing that land.as a policy matter,hri also argues that the community of reference test causes confusion about jurisdictional matters.in hri estimate,the test makes indian country a,pulling in lands that happen to lie near a sufficiently cohesive and distinct indian community.hri and new mexico,in its amicus brief,point out that this is especially problematic in the checkerboard region of northwestern new mexico.finally,hri also suggests that this case implicates the ability of indian tribes to regulate the affairs of on fee land.plains commerce bank long family land cattle,d.
however,hri was handed down after venetie and concluded that venetie had not abrogated the community of reference test.see hri,at.the arrieta court subsequently relied on that holding,at least implicitly.see arrieta,at.regardless of the merits of hri arguments,we lack the authority to overturn watchman,hri,and arrieta.see meyers,at 
as regards hri and the dissent concern that the community of reference test as we apply it here renders indian country a dissent at,we emphasize that our holding is narrow and restricted to the facts of this case.we do not hold that any land within the geographical boundaries of a political subdivision of a tribe necessarily has indian country status rather,we simply hold that on the facts in the record,the church rock chapter constitutes a dependent indian community under b.
furthermore,it is worth remembering that congress exercises plenary power over indian affairs,and thus may restrict the retained sovereign powers of the indian tribes.washington confederated bands tribes of yakima indian nation,d see also macarthur san juan county,cir.thus,should a tribe overreach in an attempt to define the boundaries of indian country outside the reservation dissent at,there would be two critical checks on such an attempt first,review by the federal courts,which would be alert to sham extensions of tribal communities and second,the plenary power of congress,which extends not only to the definition of indian country,but also to the manner in which tribes create or change their political subdivisions.
requirement 
turning now to the venetie requirements,we ask first whether the chapter was set aside by the federal government for the use by the indians as indian land.see arrieta,at we examine the entire indian community to ascertain whether the federal requirement is satisfied.l and is validly set apart for the use of indians as such only if the federal government takes some action indicating that the land is designated for use by indians.buzzard.tax comm n,cir see also venetie,at.
in accord with the doi opinion,epa concluded that the requirement was met in this case.the administrative record supports this conclusion.as explained above,the checkerboard pattern of land ownership in this corner of new mexico is a vestige of land grants to the railroads.in the late,the federal government purchased the parcels in this area from the santa fe pacific railroad company,as well as some of the parcels.see hri,at discussing act of.the government placed the parcels of land into trust for the navajo nation and allocated the remainder as allotments to individual navajos.as a result,of the chapter land was set aside for the navajo nation or individual navajos by the federal government.see hri,at the congressional directive to purchase railroad lands for the benefit of the navajo is sufficiently clear so that,once it is evident that the lands in question were purchased and are held in trust for the navajo,the lands satisfy the element narragansett indian tribe of narragansett,cir applying noting,t he considerations made in the trust process demonstrate that when the federal government agrees to hold land in trust,it is prepared to exert jurisdiction over the land quotation omitted as such,we determine epa did not err in this regard.
superintendence requirement 
lastly,we assess whether the chapter is dependent on the federal government such that the federal government and the indians,rather than the states,exercise primary jurisdiction.arrieta,at.both doi and epa determined that the chapter is superintended by the federal government.again,in light of the administrative record,epa conclusion has an adequate basis in law.see city of fort morgan,at.
superintendency over the land requires the active involvement of the federal government.buzzard,at.for example,the buzzard court explained that in of the three cases codified in federal government involvement was shown by the federal government retention of title to the land and its regulation of activities on the land.see also united states roberts,cir factoring in trust status of indian land in superintendency analysis.
on the other hand,the venetie court noted that its indian country precedents do not suggest that the mere provision of desperately needed social programs can support a finding of indian country.at.providing health,education,and welfare benefits alone does not amount to active federal control over the tribe land sufficient to support a finding of federal superintendence.id.emphasis added blatchford,at the federal government relationship with the community is not with the community qua community but with the approximately indians who happen to live in the area.
here,the government continues to retain title to of the property in the chapter,superintending that land for the benefit of the navajo nation,its members,individual navajo allottees.additionally,as the navajo nation commentary noted,t here is no significant difference in the way the united states interacts with the church rock chapter than the way it interacts with chapters in the navajo reservation proper.docs.at at.hri does not controvert this factual assertion.indeed,in addition to providing various health,education,and welfare benefits,see venetie,at,bia is responsible for protecting navajo nation trust lands,natural resources,and water rights,and administering various trust benefits on behalf of the chapter members doc.at.we would be to argue that the government does not superintend the reservations.it follows,then,that the government superintends the chapter.epa correctly concluded that the chapter community qua community,see blatchford,at,is superintended by the federal government.
iii.conclusion 
under our hybrid test,epa permissibly determined that the section land falls within a dependent indian community.thus,we deny hri petition for review 
in our previous review of this dispute,we stated that b ecause venetie does not speak directly to the issue,barring en banc review by this court,watchman,at,continues to require a community of reference analysis prior to determining whether land qualifies as a dependent indian community under the and supervision requirements of b.hri,at i therefore concur that the doctrine of stare decisis bars this panel from overruling the earlier decision.i further concur that hri has standing to seek review of the epa land status determination.however,i respectfully disagree with the majority conclusion that epa land status determination has an adequate basis in law.because our precedents do not go so far as to hold that uninhabited,land holdings outside a reservation or pueblo can be part of a small indian community surrounding a chapter house located over six miles away,the epa conclusion that the entire church rock chapter is the appropriate community of reference does not have an adequate basis in law.on that issue,i must respectfully dissent.
as noted in the majority opinion,the land in question is uninhabited and lies outside the navajo reservation.it is not owned by the navajo nation.it is not set aside for indian use.it is not federally superintended.petitioner hri,a entity,purchased the land in fee simple from a private company which had purchased the land from the united states.the land falls within the bounds of the church rock chapter,a political subdivision of the navajo nation.see navajo nation code.all acres of land within the church rock chapter lie outside the navajo reservation and within the bounds of mckinley county,new mexico.
the navajo nation council determines the number of certified chapters and the boundaries thereof.the navajo nation code currently provides for a maximum of certified chapters.b.additional chapters may be certified upon presentation of evidence of need to the navajo nation council.c.eleven of the chapters overlap with the hopi reservation because navajos live on hopi lands.a chapter,either alone or in conjunction with one to three other chapters,defines a geographical area from which delegates are elected to the navajo nation council.navajos living within the boundaries of the church rock chapter and the breadsprings chapter jointly elect two delegates to the council.a.the federal government has no input into the boundaries of the chapters or where chapter houses should be located.boundary disputes between chapters appear to be tribal matters resolved by navajo tribal courts with no involvement by the federal government.see sweetwater chapter teec nos pos chapter,nav.navajo.certification of chapters and determination of chapter boundaries is performed solely by the navajo nation council,not the federal government.
we remanded to epa to conduct a community of reference analysis prior to determining whether the section land qualifies as a dependent indian community.see hri,at.on remand,epa concluded that the appropriate community of reference is the entire church rock chapter.hri primary argument is that community of reference analysis does not survive venetie,but we can not deviate from watchman absent en banc review.
hri highlights the fact that the section land is not in close proximity to the indian community located around the chapter house,but lies in closer proximity to the sections of land more than of the church rock chapter consisting of rugged mountain ranges,canyons,and highlands incapable of sustaining a community.as we noted in watchman,a community is a consisting of personal residences and an infrastructure potentially including religious and cultural institutions,schools,emergency services,public utilities,groceries,shops,restaurants,and the other needs,necessities,and wants of modern life.watchman,at.here,as in watchman,the mine site itself does not contain any of this infrastructure.however,our dependent indian community analysis requires that we focus not on the mine site alone,but on the community of reference within the context of the surrounding area.id.in this case,the evidence may support a conclusion that the community surrounding the church rock chapter house is an appropriate community of reference,but not the entire church rock chapter.the record does not support a conclusion that the navajo community extends so far from the chapter house,nor that the political boundaries of the entire chapter should have any meaningful bearing on the community of reference determination.finally,the fact that the chapter has developed a chapter planning initiative and land use plan should not be a factor in determining whether it has the authority and jurisdiction to do so relative to particular parcels of property owned by in fee simple.the record reflects that mckinley county,new mexico also has a comprehensive plan,which may or may not conflict with that established by the chapter.
after concluding that the church rock chapter is the appropriate community of reference to which the venetie test should be applied,the epa concluded that,because the church rock chapter as a whole qualifies as a dependent indian community under the federal and superintendence requirements,the entire church rock the section land lying a dependent indian community.with today application of our community of reference test,we take an unprecedented step.never before has fee land outside the exterior boundaries of a reservation or pueblo been held to be a dependent indian community.on one occasion,this court ruled that land outside the bounds of a reservation or a pueblo in the checkerboard area of western new mexico was a dependent indian community,but that land had been purchased with navajo tribal funds,and hri suggests that the land was titled in the united states united states martine,cir.in united states arrieta,cir,we held that land within the exterior boundaries of a pueblo and to which the pueblo held title is part of a dependent indian community.as in watchman,the arrieta court examined the entire indian community,not merely the stretch of land at issue,to ascertain whether the federal and federal superintendence requirements were satisfied.id.at.the court observed that l and owned by an indian tribe within the exterior boundaries of land granted to the tribe is necessarily part of the indian community,even if the state performs some services and maintenance with respect to the land.because the pueblo possessed title to the land and the land was within the exterior boundaries of the pueblo,the court concluded that the land was part of the pueblo community and therefore subject to federal superintendence.
i must respectfully disagree with the finding that the bia superintends the church rock chapter and with the epa determination that the chapter is superintended by the federal government.instead,the federal government owns or superintends a majority of the lands within the political boundaries of the church rock chapter.the distinction is important,as it more clearly specifies the nature of the federal superintendence.certain properties within the political boundaries of chapter are federally superintended,but the chapter itself is not.the chapter is merely a political subdivision of the navajo government.the federal government has no input into its boundaries.
one might legitimately be concerned that our application of the community of reference test could be interpreted as permitting the boundaries of communities of reference to be drawn by navajo legislation defining tribal political subdivisions.as long as a chapter as a whole satisfies whatever percentage of federal and supervision a federal court deems necessary,tribal law may itself define the boundaries of indian country outside the navajo reservation.in addition to the land within the current boundaries of navajo chapters,land currently outside the boundaries of those chapters may someday be pulled into the black hole complained of by hri and referenced in the majority opinion 
commentators in this area of the law have noted the difficult question presented when land that qualifies as indian country outside of a reservation is part of a community interspersed with land holdings.cohen handbook of federal indian law,edition,c.in criticizing the supreme court of new mexico for declining to incorporate community of reference analysis into new mexico caselaw and limiting dependent indian communities to particular parcels of land that individually meet the and superintendence tests the commentators suggest that a central purpose of the codification of was to avoid checkerboard jurisdiction.see seymour superintendent,d.id.at.a closer look at section and seymour reveals that congressional avoidance of checkerboard jurisdiction is limited to lands within the limits of reservations.in seymour,the supreme court rejected the contention that a parcel of land within the limits of a reservation but held under a patent in fee by a was not indian country.the court stated the issue has been squarely put to rest by congressional enactment of the currently prevailing definition of indian country in to include all land within the limits of any indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the united states government,notwithstanding the issuance of any patent.id.at.checkerboard jurisdiction on indian reservations was avoided by the plain language of id.at.in short,nothing in suggests that congress intended to avoid checkerboard jurisdiction anywhere other than on reservations.our application of the community of reference test outside the bounds of a reservation has the effect of eliminating checkerboard jurisdiction outside the bounds of a reservation.thus,our community of reference test,as applied today,runs counter to congressional intent and may cause great jurisdictional uncertainty and disruption in those states where indian country consists of original allotments trust lands interspersed with land holdings.
although this panel is bound by our precedents to the community of reference analysis undertaken by the epa,i would hold that the epa conclusion that the entire church rock chapter is the appropriate community of reference is not supported by reasonable,substantial and probative evidence considering the record as a whole.
