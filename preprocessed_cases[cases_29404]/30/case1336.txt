moshe leib leib appeals from the district court dismissal of his suit,brought under,against the hillsborough county public transportation commission hcptc,or the commission for denying him permission to operate a toyota prius as one of the limousines offered by his transportation service.leib argues that the hcptc violated his due process and equal protection rights,and that the commission rules are unconstitutionally vague and impermissibly burden interstate commerce.the district court dismissed leib complaint under rule b.after thorough review,we affirm.
leib owns and operates tb,a limousine service in the tampa bay area.seeking to offer customers an alternative to traditional limousines,leib bought a prius.in order to operate the prius as a limousine within hillsborough county,leib had to obtain a permit from the hcptc,the administrative agency charged by the florida state legislature with regulating the operation of public vehicles on hillsborough county public highways.act of may.the commission denied leib request on the ground that the prius did not qualify as a luxury vehicle,and thus did not meet the definition of limousine in hcptc taxi rule,which states 
limousine means any motor vehicle for hire not equipped with a taximeter,with the capacity for passengers or less,including the driver.this definition consists of vehicles which are recognized by the industry as luxury vehicles,that are considered as luxury vehicles by the manufacturer and vehicles that have been uniquely modified so as to provide luxury limousine service.the luxury quality of vehicles will be determined by assessing aesthetics of the interior and exterior of the vehicle,amenities provided to the passenger,spaciousness and comparison to current industry standards for vehicles performing limousine service in hillsborough county.
leib subsequently applied for a waiver of rule luxury requirement.at an august meeting,however,the hcptc considered the request and denied it.the commission based its decision on hcptc taxi rule,which explains the circumstances under which waivers and variances are to be granted 
variances and waivers shall be granted when the person subject to the rule demonstrates that the purpose of the underlying statute will be or has been achieved by other means by the person and when application of a rule would create a substantial hardship or would violate principles of fairness.for purposes of this section,substantial hardship means a demonstrated economic,technological,legal,or other type of hardship to the person requesting the variance or waiver.for purposes of this section,principles of fairness are violated when the literal application of a rule affects a particular person in a manner significantly different from the way i t affects other similarly situated persons who are subject to the rule 
after his waiver request was denied,leib filed the instant suit seeking an injunction allowing him to use his prius as a limousine.the complaint alleges that the commission violated his right to earn a living under the fifth and fourteenth amendments count i,and his right to equal protection under the fourteenth amendment count ii.in addition,the complaint alleges that the commission violated leib right to due process by arbitrarily and capriciously denying his request to use the prius as a limousine count iii,by exercising its police power unlawfully count iv,and by granting unbridled discretion to administrative officials count vi.finally,leib suit alleges that the commission rules are unconstitutionally vague count v,and that they place an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce count vii each count asserts both a facial and an challenge to the commission rules.
we review de novo the district court grant of a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.mills foremost ins,cir.
we first reject leib argument that the district court erred in dismissing his equal protection claim in count ii the equal protection clause requires the government to treat similarly situated persons in a similar manner.gary city of warner robins,cir.when legislation classifies persons in such a way that they receive different treatment under the law,the degree of scrutiny the court applies depends upon the basis for the classification.id.if a law treats individuals differently on the basis of race or another suspect classification,or if the law impinges on a fundamental right,it is subject to strict scrutiny.eide sarasota county,cir.otherwise,the law need only have a rational,it need only be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.id.
because leib makes no allegation that he belongs to a suspect class or that the hcptc rules violate a fundamental right his equal protection claim is subject only to rational basis review.the rational basis test asks whether the government has the power or authority to regulate the particular area in question,and whether there is a rational relationship between the government objective and the means it has chosen to achieve it.cash inn of dade,metro.dade county,cir.this standard is easily met.as the supreme court has held,under rational basis review,a state has no obligation to produce evidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory classification.heller doe by doe,d.rather,a statute is presumed constitutional,and the burden is on the one attacking the law to negate every conceivable basis that might support it,even if that basis has no foundation in the record.id.under rational basis review,a court must accept a legislature generalizations even when there is an imperfect fit between means and ends.id.
rule easily survives rational basis review.because leib does not contest the government power to regulate public transportation,we need consider only whether the rule,and in particular its luxury requirement,has any rational basis.we agree with the district court that a multitude of rational bases might be adduced in support of the requirement.thus,for example,without the requirement,any old jalopy might be passed off as a limousine.the luxury requirement is rationally related to preventing such misrepresentations and confusion.leib contends that the district court erred by failing to accept the allegations in his complaint as true,but this is simply incorrect.quite to the contrary,the court concluded that,even assuming that all of his allegations were true,leib was unable to show that rule and its luxury requirement lacked a rational basis.
we also reject the class of one equal protection argument asserted in count ii alongside leib traditional equal protection claim.a class of one equal protection claim does not allege discrimination against a protected class,but rather asserts that the plaintiff has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.young apartments,town of jupiter,cir quoting griffin indus.irvin,cir.to prove a class of one claim,the plaintiff must show that he was treated differently from other similarly situated individuals,and that the defendant unequally applied a facially neutral ordinance for the purpose of discriminating against him.id.at.leib class of one claim fails to meet either requirement.
with respect to the first prong,we have frequently noted that the similarly situated requirement must be rigorously applied in the context of class of one claims.see,douglas asphalt qore,cir griffin,at.employing t oo broad a definition of similarly situated could subject nearly all state regulatory decisions to constitutional review in federal court and deny state regulators the critical discretion they need to effectively perform their duties.griffin,at.indeed,even in discrimination cases,we have emphasized that plaintiffs are not permitted simply to rely on broad generalities in identifying a comparator.id.at.
furthermore,we have observed that where the challenged governmental decision is simple or example,where the decision involves the application of a single criterion to a single out a class of one claim is generally easier than in cases where governmental action is,involving varied decisionmaking criteria applied in a series of discretionary decisions made over an extended period of time.id.at engquist oregon dep t of,d noting the difficulty of establishing class of one equal protection claims where discretionary authority is exercised based on subjective,individualized determinations.the decisions at issue in this case are of the latter variety because the commission determinations concerning rule luxury requirement involve the discretionary application of a variegated set of factors,aesthetic considerations,comparison with industry standards.in short,establishing a class of one equal protection claim can be an onerous task,and properly setting forth a class of one claim should not be regarded as a perfunctory matter.
leib class of one claim undeniably falls far short of the mark.indeed,his complaint makes only the barest conclusory assertion that the hcptc rules unreasonably required the plaintiff to submit to controls not imposed on other similarly situated businesses or properties.given the complaint complete lack of factual detail regarding the similarly situated requirement,leib class of one claim was properly dismissed.
leib substantive due process claims fare no better than his equal protection claims.indeed,because they are so poorly developed,the substantive due process claims fare worse.in count iii,for example,leib asserts that the commission rules and decisions were arbitrary and capricious.although leib appears to regard this as a straightforward substantive due process claim,the precise basis for the arbitrary and capricious cause of action is uncertain.in advancing the claim,he cites only our decision in eide sarasota county,cir.while eide indeed recognized an arbitrary and capricious due process claim as one of several closely related substantive due process claims,the dispute at issue in that case involved a zoning ordinance.we specifically consider ed only the standards that would be applied to a claim which involves a grievance similar to eide,and we expressly refrained from offering any opinion as to what the standards would be for other types of claims such as physical taking and procedural due process claims.id.at.leib failure to articulate the basis of his arbitrary and capricious due process claim is a sufficient ground for its dismissal.see,tyler runyon,cir i f an appellant fails to make a minimally complete and comprehensible argument for each of his claims,he loses regardless of the merits of those claims as they might have appeared on a fuller presentation.
even putting aside its uncertain doctrinal basis,leib arbitrary and capricious due process claim fails.like equal protection claims,substantive due process claims are subject to rational basis review,so long as they do not infringe fundamental rights and are not discriminatory.in re wood,cir the standard for evaluating substantive due process challenges to social and economic legislation is virtually identical to the rational relationship test for evaluating equal protection claims.since the commission rules survived rational basis review for purposes of leib equal protection claim,it follows a fortiori that the rules survive rational basis review here as well.
against this,leib again contends that the district court dismissed his arbitrary and capricious claim because it failed to accept the allegations in his complaint as true.specifically,he claims that the complaint allegations of his vehicle safety,the fact that the prius can operate on the highways of hillsborough county under the taxicab label,and the emergence of the prius as a limousine in major metropolitan areas,assuming such allegations are accepted as true,show that the challenged regulations are not substantially related to the public health,safety,morals,or general welfare.but the test is not whether the luxury rule is substantially related to health,safety,or the general welfare it is whether the rule is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.id.moreover,as explained above,leib is simply incorrect in asserting that the district court failed to accept his allegations as true.
the foregoing line of analysis also applies to leib police power claim in count iv.leib argues that the commission unlawfully exercised its police power by adding the luxury requirement to the definition of limousine in rule.it is true that the definition of limousine in the hcptc enabling act does not include a luxury requirement.act of may,ch,defining limousine as any motor vehicle for hire not equipped with a taximeter,with a capacity for passengers or less,including the driver.but this hardly suggests that the requirement is contrary to the legislature intent.rather,in creating the commission,the legislature gave it the authority to r egulate and supervise the operation of public vehicles upon the public highways and in all other matters affecting the relationship between such operation and the traveling public.id.a.in adding the luxury requirement to the definition of limousine,the hcptc was doing precisely what it was created to do.
leib further contends that the luxury requirement fails rational basis review,arguing that luxury vehicles are no safer than vehicles,and that,as a result,there is no rational relationship between the luxury requirement and public safety.but the commission need not show that luxury vehicles are always safer than other vehicles it need only show a rational relationship between luxury and safety say,on the theory that luxury vehicles are generally larger and that larger vehicles are generally safer.the rule survives rational basis review even if it seems unwise or if the rationale for it seems tenuous.romer evans,d.more importantly,there is no need to show that the rule specifically promotes safety,so long as it promotes the general welfare or some other legitimate governmental aim.we are therefore unpersuaded by leib police power claim and conclude that the district court was correct to dismiss it as well.
we are also unpersuaded by leib claim in count vi that rule gives the commission unbridled discretion in the enforcement of its rules.as noted above,rule provides that v ariances and waivers shall be granted when the person subject to the rule demonstrates that the purpose of the underlying statute will be or has been achieved by other means,or when application of a rule would create a substantial hardship or would violate principles of fairness.leib argues that the purpose of the underlying statute is too nebulous a standard to provide any guidance in ruling upon waiver requests,and that the rule therefore gives the commission unbridled discretion in making decisions.we disagree.
as an initial matter,we note once again that leib fails to articulate the precise nature of this claim or to indicate the way in which it differs from other claims asserted in the complaint.lindquist city of pasadena,cir although asserted independently,plaintiffs unbridled discretion claim was not distinct from their equal protection and due process claims.in particular,it is difficult to distinguish leib unbridled discretion claim from his claim.leib chief argument in support of the unbridled discretion claim is that the purpose of the underlying statute standard is too nebulous for people of ordinary intelligence to comply,as is discussed more fully in the next section,is the gravamen of a claim.yet leib separately advances a claim in count v the complaint.in short,as with his due process claim,leib has not asserted his unbridled discretion claim clearly enough to permit our review.see,tyler,at.
yet even on the merits,leib unbridled discretion claim is unpersuasive.his argument in support of the claim rests almost entirely on vfw john post santa rosa county,d.there,a zoning ordinance provided that a requirement could be waived upon a proper showing,but gave no further guidance as to what might count as such a showing.the district court held that the proper showing standard was void for vagueness because it was not set out in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordina
