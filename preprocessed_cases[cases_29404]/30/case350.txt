both sides to this appeal concede liability for environmental cleanup at a hazardous waste dump near the houston ship channel but fault the district court equitable allocation of the associated costs.more specifically,this appeal concerns the reliability of expert witness testimony under daubert,the admission of alleged settlement communications into evidence,the district court choice of methodologies in allocating costs,and some of the court factual findings.we find error in the admission of settlement communications only and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
during the late and early,a disposal company named french limited hauled hazardous waste from petrochemical facilities on the houston ship channel.it transported this waste to a dumping site along route highway because that site was occasionally busy or otherwise unavailable,french limited also took some waste to a second location known as turtle bayou.
in the early,the epa and the state of texas began an investigation into contamination at turtle bayou.the investigation centered on waste generated by several french limited customers,including lyondell chemical and the two remaining parties to this appeal,el paso tennessee pipeline and occidental chemical.
the epa eventually issued an administrative order,demanding that one group of french limited el paso and lyondell remediate contamination found at turtle bayou.several of these customers signaled that they would comply with the order and began meeting regularly to fairly divide responsibility for the waste and associated cleanup costs.the group dissolved before finalizing a plan.
the united states responded by suing lyondell in,seeking to compel the company to clean up turtle bayou and to reimburse the government for its investigation and response costs under sections and of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla cercla is congress answer to the serious environmental and health risks posed by industrial pollution and was designed to promote the timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites and to ensure that the costs of such cleanup efforts were borne by those responsible for the contamination.cercla imposes strict liability for environmental contamination upon four broad classes of potentially responsible parties,one of which includes entities that arrange for disposal of hazardous substances.once an entity is identified as a potentially responsible party,it may be compelled to clean up a contaminated area or reimburse the government for its past and future response costs.joint and several liability may be imposed,unless a party can prove that the harm it caused is divisible from the harm others caused 
lyondell entered into a consent decree with the united states in,requiring it to address the contamination and perform all requested response actions at four areas of the site.although the site was originally defined to encompass approximately acres,it was redefined by reference to the scope of contamination.it now includes the areal extent of contamination and all suitable property in very close proximity to the contamination necessary for the implementation of lyondell remediation plan.that property was designated as the four areas to be remediated by lyondell the west road area,the main waste area,the office trailer area,and the power easement,the lyondell remediation areas,and two other plots the bayou disposal area and country road formerly frontier park road.country road is an road running through or next to the five other areas.
in exchange for cleaning up the lyondell remediation areas,lyondell received three guarantees first,the united states agreed to forego claims against lyondell for investigation and remediation costs it had already incurred at the site.second,the united states agreed that subject to certain exceptions it would not pursue future claims against lyondell for matters addressed in the settlement,including the entire site and matters related to the site.and third,because it had settled with the government,lyondell would not have to contribute to any subsequent remediation at the site paid for by private parties.
during the course of its remediation efforts,lyondell discovered additional contamination at turtle bayou feet west of lyondell west road area.this plot of contamination became aptly known as the far west road area.
the united states filed a second cercla action in,this time against el paso.it sought to place the costs of remediation onto el paso for two distinct areas the far west road area and a second area previously known to the bayou disposal which lyondell enjoyed contribution protection.together,we will refer to these two plots as the el paso remediation areas.the government also sought to hold the company accountable for certain costs associated with both the lyondell remediation areas and the el paso remediation areas,specifically investigation and remediation costs already incurred by the united states,and any such costs incurred in the future,plus interest.
the district court consolidated the lyondell and el paso cercla actions.following lyondell lead,el paso eventually settled with the united states,agreeing to remediate the el paso remediation areas and to reimburse the united states for much of its past costs to avoid paying for all remediation costs,however,both lyondell and el paso sued other parties they believed shared responsibility for cleanup of their respective remediation areas,including occidental they brought apportionment actions under cercla section and contribution actions under cercla section in an apportionment action,liability is still contested and parties may avoid joint and several liability by establishing a fixed amount of damage for which they are liable.on the other hand,once liability is established in a contribution action,jointly and severally liable parties may recover from each other on the basis of equitable considerations.contribution actions are thus intended to provide a liable party under cercla with a cause of action to mitigate the harsh effects of joint and several liability.
lyondell brought apportionment and contribution actions against el paso,too.in response,el paso counterclaimed pursuant to cercla section,seeking to offset any of its responsibility for the lyondell remediation areas with lyondell share of responsibility for the el paso remediation areas.because of lyondell settlement with the united states,however,el paso could not seek contribution for any costs associated with matters addressed in that settlement.el paso and lyondell settled these claims in and turned their attention to occidental and other potentially responsible parties.
the district court dismissed the section apportionment claims and conducted a bench trial of the remaining contribution claims under section in the first phase,the district court found lyondell and el paso had established the liability of several other parties,including occidental.it then went about allocating response costs among those liable parties.because the evidence did not allow the damages to be divided along geographic boundaries,the court considered all lyondell and el paso remediation areas as an indivisible whole.under section,the court allocated a percentage of investigation and remediation costs of that whole to each liable party based on equitable culpability.
to assist in allocating cleanup costs among the liable parties,the district court appointed an expert in environmental engineering,charles newell.among other things,the district court tasked newell with running a statistical analysis to determine disposal volumes for each liable company.the disposal volumes,together with chemical analyses of those volumes,would then enable to the court to allocate remediation costs.although newell ran the actual calculations,the court determined the inputs he would use.to calculate the amount of occidental waste dumped at turtle bayou,for example,the court instructed newell to use three input values a minimum,an intermediate estimate,and a maximum.these inputs are at the center of the parties dispute on appeal.
pegging occidental minimum responsibility was straightforward.the court heard from ken kimmons,a french limited truck driver,who testified that he transported two truck loads of occidental waste to turtle bayou.with one truck load equaling gallons of waste,the court set its minimum estimate at.
in contrast,crafting the intermediate and maximum inputs required more effort because much of the available documentary evidence concerned waste disposal intended for french limited primary disposal site along highway its auxiliary disposal site at turtle bayou.nonetheless,the court found the documentary evidence useful after listening to the testimony of kimmons and another french limited truck driver,charles thomas.from their testimony,the court found that approximately of waste intended for highway actually ended up at turtle bayou,and adopted this finding for purposes of allocating costs.the litigants began referring to the estimate as the rule.the other drivers who testified did not particular percentage,but agreed that turtle bayou was used for overflow when highway could not receive waste.
able to roughly quantify a link between the waste intended for highway and the waste actually disposed of at turtle bayou,the court set about calculating the two remaining occidental waste volume values based on documentary evidence of disposal at highway.to calculate the intermediate value,the district court looked to the smythe reports,which occidental had created in and which detail the amounts of waste occidental shipped offsite for disposal at highway.for the relevant time period,they indicate french limited hauled gallons of occidental waste bound for highway.following the rule,the district court divided this figure by four to arrive at an intermediate estimate of gallons.
in calculating occidental maximum possible responsibility,the court looked to a ledger that french limited had used to track hauls for each of its customers.the french ledger provides details such as customer name,disposal fee,and intended disposal destination.after some extrapolation,the court found the french ledger reflected gallons of occidental waste meant for disposal at highway.again,based on the rule,the court determined that of that actually disposed of at turtle bayou.
as discussed below,newell used the court three input values to calculate the volume of occidental waste disposed of at turtle bayou.looking to that calculation,the district court assigned of el paso response costs to occidental.although both occidental and el paso contest this allocation,neither denies liability altogether.all other litigants,including lyondell,are no longer parties to this appeal.
we begin with occidental challenge to newell expert testimony,specifically his use of the monte carlo statistical methodology to calculate the volume of occidental waste dumped at turtle bayou occidental tepidly contends the methodology fails daubert we review a district court admission of an expert testimony for abuse of discretion 
monte carlo measures the probability of various outcomes,within the bounds of input variables to calculate occidental waste volume,for example,newell used the district court three volume estimates as inputs.instead of simply averaging the input values,monte carlo analysis uses data points to increase accuracy,and then looks to the results that those data points generate.the methodology is particularly useful when reaching an exact numerical result is impossible or infeasible and the data provide a known minimum and a maximum,for leave the exact answer uncertain.seventy years after its discovery by physicists involved with nuclear weapons research,monte carlo analysis is now at home not only in the physical sciences but in a wide variety of fields including,for instance,the world of high finance.
occidental daubert challenge relies on five arguments that the monte carlo method used by newell has not been as applied to cercla allocations is not generally accepted for use in cercla allocations was developed specifically for use in this litigation has not been tested as applied to cercla allocations and has a rate of error that can not be evaluated and is not relevant because it is equivocal.
in arguments one and two,occidental concedes monte carlo analysis is reliable in general,but challenges its application to cercla cost allocation.this incorrectly assumes that the use of monte carlo analysis in this case differs meaningfully from any other monte carlo application once we remove the irrelevant label of waste volume,the court chosen inputs serve as any other three numbers would.at any rate,the epa itself has endorsed the use of monte carlo analysis in very similar risk in a guidance document that probabilistic analysis techniques such as monte carlo analysis,given adequate supporting data and credible assumptions,can be viable statistical tools for analyzing variability and uncertainty in risk assessments.
occidental third criticism is similarly meritless.it is true that newell tailored monte carlo algorithms to meet the specific needs of this case,but the same effort is required of virtually all experts in environmental litigation.and,while expert testimony is indeed cause for concern in some situations,occidental gives us no reason to believe newell testimony was biased,particularly since a not a him as an expert.
as for the testability and potential rate of error prongs of basis for occidental fourth cited cases at most stand for the proposition that monte carlo analysis is unreliable when injected with faulty inputs,but nothing more monte carlo simulation is not inherently untestable courts routinely admit statistical evidence and we can gauge reliability by examining input values and requiring transparency from testifying experts.similarly,just because a monte carlo simulation produces a range of outcomes,rather than one single numerical value,does not mean it is speculative.if anything,monte carlo analysis provides greater certainty than the basic alternatives using one of the three data points or using the arithmetic average of all three.
nor is newell monte carlo analysis irrelevant because,as occidental argues,it is equivocal or statistical,or because it does not make any fact regarding allocation more likely than not the monte carlo it produced a statistical range of likely outcomes and not one determinative choosing one result over another,and certainly assisted the district court in its decisionmaking.
occidental next objects to the district court admission of the smythe reports,which the district court used to develop the intermediate estimate of occidental turtle bayou waste.occidental asserts that the reports are settlement communications inadmissible under federal rule of evidence.that rule excludes from admission certain evidence offered to prove liability for,invalidity of,or amount of a claim that was disputed as to validity or amount,including conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations regarding the claim.these exclusionary powers are grounded in two rationales.first,the relevancy of settlement communications is thought to be suspect because they may have been an attempt to purchase peace rather than an admission of liability second,and perhaps most importantly,the rule exclusion of settlement evidence furthers public policy by promoting the voluntary settlement of disputes,which would be discouraged if evidence of compromise were later used in court the need for voluntary settlement is especially critical in cercla litigation,with the statute the willingness of potentially liable parties to negotiate with the government and with each other 
we review evidentiary challenges for abuse of discretion as the party objecting to the admission of such a communication,occidental has the burden of proving the preliminary facts required to show the inadmissibility of the compromise.an error in the admission of evidence is reversible when it affects a party substantial is,when it constitutes harmful error 
by its terms,rule protects only conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations regarding a claim that was disputed as to validity or amount.this protection extends to legal conclusions,factual statements,internal memoranda,and the work of and lawyers alike so long as the communications were intended to be part of negotiations toward compromise.litigation need not have commenced for rule to apply 
occidental concedes the smythe reports were not part of negotiations directly arising out of the contamination at turtle bayou.they are instead the product of an earlier dispute over contamination at french limited primary disposal location,highway.before discovering contamination at turtle bayou,the epa had threatened to pursue cercla litigation related to highway in the,targeting several french limited customers.many of these el paso and the french limited task group in an attempt to avoid litigation,and to allocate and settle their potential liability.occidental assigned an employee,gary smythe,as its representative to the group,but by the time smythe joined the discussions,the task group had already decided on a higher allocation for occidental than the company thought fair.in an effort to convince the other companies that occidental should carry a lesser burden,smythe,along with other occidental employees and an outside consulting firm,created two reports purporting to account for all of occidental waste dumped at highway.these smythe reports attempted to narrow th e gap between what the task group had proposed and what occidental believed to be a fairer assessment of its waste disposal at highway.
the district court was right,then,in concluding that the reports were made during settlement negotiations as an effort to resolve issues of relative responsibility for highway.although el paso characterizes the reports as part of a congenial effort by group members to fairly and cooperatively assess the contamination unentitled to rule protection,we can not agree.it is undisputed that the epa threatened litigation against occidental and other members of the task group.this threat raised not only the prospect of liability to the government but liability to other members of the task group because cercla imposes joint and several liability on each responsible party,and grants the right to sue confederates for contribution.the task force members made conflicting demands as a result for its part,occidental plainly offered the smythe reports in hopes of paying less than what the task force had already allocated to the company.the work of the task force was anything but business as usual and its the smythe well beyond mere business communications.
despite having concluded that the smythe reports were made during settlement negotiations,the district court admitted the reports into evidence.el paso asserts this ruling was correct because occidental created the smythe reports to settle legal issues unrelated to the subject of the present litigation.quoting wright and graham treatise,el paso contends rule only bars the use of compromise evidence to prove the validity or invalidity of the claim that was the subject of the compromise,not some other claim.because occidental created the smythe reports in response to legal issues surrounding highway,el paso argues they are admissible in this action,which concerns contamination at turtle bayou.
el paso argument hinges in part on the scope of the word claim.courts vary widely in their understanding of the term,and thus in their understanding of when evidence is introduced to prove liability for,invalidity of,or the amount of the claim subject to compromise most do agree that claim does not mean legal claim and that,as a result,t he dispute being settled need not be the one being tried in the case where the settlement is being offered in order for rule to bar its admission.
weinstein evidence would nonetheless require that these different disputes arise out of the same transaction in order to trigger rule caselaw,too,can be organized around a loose transactional test.four this applied rule to distinct legal claims arising out of a common event other circuits have gone further,applying the rule to distinct legal claims arising,for example,out of the same failed business relationship to legal claims brought by seven different plaintiffs that arose during the same uranium exploration project and to legal claims brought by the government against two different taxpayers,even though the claims did not stem from the same factual nexus on the other hand,settlement evidence is not inadmissible merely because it relates to circumstances that are similar to those being litigated 
the seventh circuit eschews any strict transaction test,but looks to the spirit and purpose of the rule and decide s whether the need for the settlement evidence outweighs the potentially chilling effect on future settlement negotiations.that balance is said to more likely tip in favor of admitting evidence when the settlement communications at issue arise out of a dispute distinct from the one for which the evidence is being offered.wright and graham would take a similar approach 
i t seems preferable to make the meaning of claim turn on whether the result of the interpretation is likely to discourage parties from entering into compromise negotiations and whether the exclusion of the evidence of compromise would be fair in the case before the court 
we too decline to adopt any rigid definition of claim.our application of rule has been and remains,and tethered to the rationales underlying the rule.and here,we have no trouble concluding the smythe reports were created for use in negotiations regarding the claim now being litigated.though separated by time and location,the disputes associated with the highway and turtle bay sites arise out of the same events the repeated dumping of hazardous waste intended for highway.the disputes involve the same relevant parties,the same facilities,the same basic time frame,the same waste hauler,and the same intended disposal site.more to the point,it involves the same primary liability question what chemicals did each facility ship offsite and in what quantity and because waste disposal at both sites is inextricably linked,the scope of a party liability for the highway site bears directly on the extent of its liability for turtle bayou.the highway negotiations did not involve circumstances that were merely similar to the current dispute over turtle bayou even el paso counsel prudently conceded at oral argument that liability for one site is germane to liability for the other.
even assuming the disputes over highway and turtle bayou represent two distinct claims for purposes of rule,the smythe reports are only relevant insofar as they enable el paso to prove liability for and the amount of contamination at highway only after resolving the question of liability for this antecedent first claim could el paso make its case for costs arising out of contamination at turtle,through the court estimate that of waste intended for highway was disposed of at turtle bayou.
viewed through either lense,the offering of settlement evidence arising out of a shared factual nexus and bearing directly on present issues of liability between many of the same parties falls within rule prohibition.effective dispute resolution requires frank and full discussion of relevant evidence.making the content of such a discussion available for use in related litigation would invite the very situation that rule is designed to avoid,and worse,in cercla litigation,reduce the likelihood that responsible parties would volunteer to right their environmental wrongs.cercla only works when that likelihood is all,the entire statutory regime is predicated on the fact that the government has limited resources to find potential polluters,to dictate remedial measures to those polluters it does find,and to pay for those it does not.cercla itself protects parties who enter into consent decrees with the government,stating that participation in that process shall not be considered an admission of liability for any purpose,and the fact of such participation shall not be admissible in any judicial or administrative proceeding.
determining when one cercla claim ends and another begins is particularly difficult,too,because environmental damage does not always respect lines drawn on a settlement map.efforts to detect hazardous substances can prove inconclusive and the substances,once found,often remain a moving target.the signing of a settlement will not,as a result,always end the chapter for potentially responsible parties,as this case amply demonstrates.
we are mindful that rule should not exclude more than required to effectuate its goals,which,after all,run counter to the overarching policy favoring the admission of all relevant evidence but we have no difficulty concluding that exclusion of the smythe reports fits comfortably within the rule limitations.the tension between rule and the policy favoring the admission of relevant evidence is mitigated in the present case from the general public standpoint,the need for evidence in a cercla contribution case is simply less critical than in a situation in which liability is contested.here,we know that el paso and occidental are responsible for remediating turtle bayou what remains to be determined is how much each private entity will pay.
the district court admission of the smythe reports,then,was an abuse of discretion.and this error was harmful.the smythe reports support at least a few of the district court conclusions,most notably its intermediate calculation of occidental waste volume.el paso urges that newell was entitled to rely on the report as an expert but fails to explain how an expert use of settlement evidence would not effectively vitiate rule protections altogether.even if an expert could use evidence otherwise inadmissible under the rule,it was the district court that calculated the intermediate volume input,not newell.rather,newell relied on all three volume inputs at the court direction.given that the district court intermediate waste estimate for occidental is now without key evidentiary support,we decline to simply average the remaining minimum and maximum values and leave,on remand,the reallocation of costs to the district court in the first instance 
occidental also faults the district court choice of equitable factors used in allocating response costs for turtle bayou among the liable parties.in making such a tally,a court may use such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.here,the district court chose to base its allocation on the total volume of waste produced at each facility,weighting those volumes according to chemical composition.occidental essentially argues that instead of calculating waste by facility,the court should have aggregated total waste by company.occidental would have fared better had the court done so,particularly when compared to lyondell.
occidental fails to demonstrate that the district court result is unfair.on the contrary,the district court considered the total volumes of waste streams for each lyondell facility,just as it considered the total volumes for the occidental facility.by uniformly applying the same approach,the court employed the most specific evidence available for all parties in an equitable calculus that can not be error 
occidental also sees error in a handful of the district court factual findings,which we review for clear error a finding of fact is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in the light of the record read as a whole.cercla contemplates flexibility so that t he parties actually performing the cleanup can look for reimbursement from other potentially responsible parties without fear that their contribution actions will be bogged down by the impossibility of making meticulous factual determinations as to the causal contribution of each party.
occidental quarrels with the maximum waste volume value used in newell monte carlo value the district court derived from the french ledger.although the ledger did not list any offsite disposal charges for occidental in,the court concluded that occidental had trucked away hazardous waste during that year,citing other evidence including the smythe reports.with that conclusion in hand,the court determined occidental average monthly disposal charges for using the french ledger.it then assumed this monthly average held true for july through december,an assumption that increased occidental maximum estimated responsibility by about.
having determined that the smythe reports were admitted in error,we leave it to the district court on remand to decide whether the record without the reports remains sufficient to uphold this extrapolation.
occidental also contests the district court finding that of the waste intended for the highway site actually ended up at turtle bayou.occidental says this rule is speculative as to occidental because it is supported by only two of french limited forty who recalled no loads from occidental and one who remembered only two.
we disagree.the district court found the drivers testimony credible and no credible witness claimed otherwise.the district court did not treat the rule as a definitive measure of the proportion of french limited hauls that were dumped at the turtle bayou site,but considered it an appropriate fallback option where better evidence of disposal rates is not available.left with significant evidence of disposal at highway and credible evidence of a link between that disposal and the waste at turtle bayou,the district court did not clearly err in applying the rule absent countervailing evidence.
even if the court factual finding was not in error,occidental contends the court applied the rule unfairly.it notes that the french ledger listed several companies who are not parties to this lawsuit and argues the district court should have used the rule to assign responsibility to these as the relative responsibility of occidental.we again disagree.the district court concluded it could not impose liability on a french limited therefore could not assign a waste volume to that an independent link between that customer and turtle bayou occidental liability,not contested here,was established by evidence apart from blind application of the rule for one,kimmons testimony specifically links occidental waste to disposal at turtle bayou.the court applied the rule to all french limited customers found liable during the first phase of trial,treating each liable party fairly.no such evidence connected the.
although occidental concedes that it is,along with el paso and others,liable for past costs incurred by the united states at turtle bayou,it disclaims responsibility for el paso cleanup of the el paso remediation areas.occidental argues that there is insufficient evidence that french limited dumped occidental waste in those particular locations.occidental points to the testimony of kimmons,the lone truck driver who attested to delivering occidental waste to turtle bayou.kimmons testified that he dumped occidental waste at the main waste pit,which falls within the lyondell remediation areas,but made no mention of dumping waste specifically at the el paso remediation areas.the district court,however,found that kimmons was not the only french driver to handle occidental wastes and that french limited plainly had trucked significant amounts of occidental waste bound for highway.given the scope of hauling,the court concluded it is probable that at least one load of occidental waste was disposed of in an area remediated by el paso.
these findings are consistent with the district court treatment of the other parties.the court held that the evidence is not sufficiently conclusive for the court to isolate a particular company waste to a specific portion of turtle bayou.no expert could tie the waste of any company to distinct geographic areas within turtle bayou,either.it was enough that the district court could determine that some of occidental waste intended for highway was dumped somewhere at turtle bayou.occidental does not dispute this core liability finding.our review of the record as a whole indicates that the district court findings are plausible and evince no clear error.
the district court assigned more than half of el paso response costs to lyondell,but that share was uncollectible meaning el paso could not collect any further sums from the company.from the district court point of view,the share was only uncollectible because el paso had chosen to settle with lyondell.on that basis,the court meted out responsibility for lyondell share to el paso instead of distributing lyondell share proportionally among all liable parties 
if el paso believes that the settlement agreement does not adequately reflect its proportionate share of liability lyondell,then el paso should have refrained from entering into the agreement and taken its chances at trial 
in its,el paso contends the court erred in its assessment because,at the time of settlement,lyondell had already resolved all of its liability regarding turtle bayou.so,as far as lyondell was concerned,its consent decree with the government granted protection from el paso contribution claim.according to el paso,then,its settlement with lyondell could only resolve el paso liability to liability the other way the earlier consent decree barred el paso from recovering against lyondell altogether.el paso urges this created an uncollectible orphan share that should have been distributed proportionally among all liable parties.
as defined by some courts,an orphan share is the liability attributable to a party who is insolvent,can not be located,or can not be identified under this doctrine,a court may choose to allocate a proportional fraction of an orphan share to all available,solvent,and responsible parties.the doctrine is an equitable one,vesting courts with the discretion both to determine whether a share is an orphan,and whether to allocate that orphan share to all available responsible parties lyondell share is not a traditional orphan,but we assume without deciding that a solvent and identified party share of cercla costs can qualify as an orphan share and thus that lyondell percentage of responsibility was theoretically distributable among other liable parties 
as a person who has resolved its liability to the united states,lyondell was not liable for any claims for contribution brought by el paso for matters addressed in its consent decree by the decree terms,those matters addressed in lyondell settlement included the site and matters related to the site.the site encompassed only that property which includes the areal extent of contamination and all suitable property in very close proximity to the contamination necessary for the implementation of the lyondell remediation plan.the decree specifically designated this property as the west road area,the main waste area,the office trailer area,the easement area,the bayou disposal area,and country road formerly frontier park road.
the decree text plainly does not incorporate all of turtle lists discrete areas.of those six areas,road,main waste,office trailer,and within the lyondell remediation areas.the fifth,the bayou disposal area,is an el paso remediation area.that potentially leaves one remediation far west road lyondell contribution protection and subject to legal action by el paso.el paso claims the decree inclusion of country road was a reference to the far west road area,or,at the very least,that its cleanup work in the far west road area is related to country road because that work centered directly under the road itself.
at most,these arguments demonstrate that the scope of lyondell contribution protection was a matter subject to adversarial dispute and judicial determination.for one,the far west road area was not known to be contaminated at all when lyondell settled its liability for the lyondell remediation areas.nor is the area in very close proximity to known contamination in is more than a away from the closest remediation area at the time,the west road area.and while it is true that the tract of land known as far west road area was also referred to as the country road west area,the consent decree plainly refers to the road that traverses turtle bayou from east to west,going well beyond any one tract.
rather than litigate these questions,el paso dropped its contribution action against lyondell under cercla section by entering into a settlement.among other terms,the settlement provided that el paso would receive all of occidental eventual contribution,that the first million received from other settlements would go to lyondell,and that most other proceeds would be shared so that lyondell received and el paso received.nothing precluded el paso from negotiating a higher percentage if it believed lyondell share of costs to be greater.el paso also agreed that it would not oppose an interpretation of lyondell consent decree that would absolve it of any future liability at turtle bayou that both parties considered lyondell contribution protection a matter amenable to genuine dispute.this conclusion is confirmed by el paso earlier suggestion to the district court that it define orphan share as those shares of the waste responsibility which are attributable to potentially responsible parties who either are insolvent or can not be located or identified a definition that does not,on its face,include lyondell uncollectible responsibility 
in sum,because admission of the smythe reports was harmful error,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
