arizona cattle growers association arizona cattle appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment rejecting its challenge to the united states fish and wildlife service fws designation of critical habitat for the mexican spotted owl.arizona cattle argues that the fws unlawfully designated areas containing no owls as occupied habitat and that the fws calculated the economic impacts of the designation by applying an impermissible baseline approach.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
background 
litigation history 
in the mexican spotted owl was listed as a threatened species under the endangered species act esa.the listing decision prompted a series of lawsuits alternately seeking to compel the fws to designate critical habitat for the owl and,following the fws designation of habitat,attacking that designation.
the first such lawsuit was in to compel the fws to designate critical habitat and resulted in the fws issuing a final rule designating million acres of critical owl habitat,a designation that was quickly challenged in court and then revoked in.after another lawsuit was filed to compel the fws to designate habitat,the fws proposed a rule in to designate million acres of critical habitat and in the agency promulgated a final rule that again designated million acres.that rule was later struck down and,rather than propose a new rule,the fws reopened the comment period on the rule it proposed in.in the fws designated approximately million acres of critical habitat.it is this designation,the final rule,that arizona cattle challenges in the current action.
arizona cattle moved for summary judgment to set aside the final rule as invalid on several grounds,only two of which are appealed.first,arizona cattle argues that the fws impermissibly treated areas in which no owls are found as occupied under the esa and,in doing so,bypassed the statutory requirements for designating unoccupied areas.second,arizona cattle challenges the fws determination of the economic impacts of the designation,arguing primarily that the fws applied an impermissible baseline approach that did not account for economic impacts of the critical habitat designation that are also attributable to the listing decision.the district court rejected arizona cattle arguments and granted the appellees for summary judgment.
b.the final rule 
the fws relied on three types of habitat management areas,first outlined in a recovery plan created in,as a starting point for the final rule protected areas,restricted areas,and other forest and woodland types.protected areas are those areas containing known owl sites,termed protected activity centers pacs steep slope areas meeting certain forest conditions and legally and administratively reserved lands.pacs include a minimum of acres that includes the best nesting and roosting,resting habitat in the area and the most proximal and highly used foraging areas.however,pacs contain only of necessary foraging areas for the owl.restricted areas include slope areas with appropriate forest conditions that are adjacent to or outside of protected areas.areas outside of pacs,including restricted areas,provide additional habitat appropriate for foraging.according to the final rule,restricted areas also provide habitat for nonterritorial birds,support dispersing juveniles,and provide replacement habitat on the landscape through time.
the fws used these categories to develop alternatives for critical habitat designation,selecting protected and restricted areas as a starting point for potential owl critical habitat in the final rule the fws adopted an alternative that excluded all tribal lands from designation,refined critical habitat unit boundaries,and excluded certain areas that did not contain pacs.the fws also excluded interface areas identified as being at high risk of catastrophic wildfire.the final rule concluded that all of the designated habitat was occupied by the owl.
ii.standard of review 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,reviewing directly the agency action under the administrative procedure act arbitrary and capricious standard.gifford pinchot task force fish wildlife,cir.
a n agency rule would be arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.

iii.the fws properly designated only occupied areas as critical habitat 
we first consider whether the owl occupied the designated areas,as defined by the esa.we conclude that the fws permissibly interpreted the word occupied in the esa to include areas where the owl was likely to be present and that,applying this definition,the fws designated only occupied areas.
a.the esa and the definition of occupied 
the esa defines a species critical habitat as 
i the specific areas within the geographical area occupied by the species,at the time it is listed,on which are found those physical or biological features i essential to the conservation of the species and ii which may require special management considerations or protection and 
ii specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed,upon a determination by the secretary that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.
a.the statute thus differentiates between occupied and unoccupied areas,imposing a more onerous procedure on the designation of unoccupied areas by requiring the secretary to make a showing that unoccupied areas are essential for the conservation of the species.although this appeal turns primarily on the factual question of whether the fws treated unoccupied areas as occupied to avoid this more onerous process,we face the preliminary issue of what it means for an area to be occupied under the esa.
it is useful to unpack this inquiry into two components uncertainty and frequency.uncertainty is a factor when the fws has reason to believe that owls are present in a given area,but lacks conclusive proof of their presence.frequency is a factor when owls are shown to have only an intermittent presence in a given area.occasionally,both factors will play a part in determining whether an area is occupied.because the esa permits only one of two possible outcomes for this or the result is best characterized by a spectrum,we must determine the scope of the fws authority to categorize as occupied those areas that may not fit neatly into either pigeonhole.
we have ample guidance on the uncertainty issue.the esa provides that the agency must determine critical habitat using the best scientific data available.b see also id.b c ii.this standard does not require that the fws act only when it can justify its decision with absolute confidence.see,pub.citizen health research group dol,cir greenpeace action franklin,cir.although the fws can not act on pure speculation or contrary to the evidence,the esa accepts agency decisions in the face of uncertainty.compare.cattle growers ass fish wildlife,cir,with sw.ctr.for biological diversity babbitt.
turning to the frequency component,arizona cattle asserts that the word occupied is unambiguous and must be interpreted narrowly to mean areas that the species resides in.in the context of the owl,they argue that such areas consist only of the pacs.the fws argues for a broader interpretation.it suggests that where a geographic area is used with such frequency that the owl is likely to be present,the agency may permissibly designate it as occupied.fws contends that,at a minimum,this includes the owl home range and may include other areas used for intermittent activities.
we can not agree that occupied has an unambiguous,plain meaning as arizona cattle suggests.the word occupied,standing alone,does not provide a clear standard for how frequently a species must use an area before the agency can designate it as critical habitat.amoco prod.vill.of gambell,explaining that there is clearly no plain meaning to the phrase public lands which are actually occupied.merely replacing the word occupied with the word resides does not resolve this ambiguity.rather,arizona cattle argument that occupied is limited to areas where the species resides only underscores the flexibility of determining whether an area is occupied.viewed narrowly,an owl resides only in its nest viewed more broadly,an owl resides in a pac and viewed more broadly still,an owl resides in its territory or home range.determining whether a species uses an area with sufficient regularity that it is occupied is a highly contextual and inquiry.cape hatteras access alliance united states doi,d.relevant factors may include how often the area is used,how the species uses the area,the necessity of the area for the species conservation,species characteristics such as degree of mobility or migration,and any other factors that may bear on the inquiry.such factual questions are within the purview of the agency unique expertise and are entitled to the standard deference afforded such agency determinations.see earth island,at.
having found the term occupied dependent on a number of factors,we must look to whether the agency proposed interpretation is permissible as applied to the owl habits and habitat.arizona cattle argues that the fws has never previously defined occupied critical habitat.thus,it contends,the agency interpretation urged on appeal is merely a construction found only in the fws legal briefs and is entitled to no deference.but the agency has defined occupied critical habitat in a manner very similar to the proposed interpretation.in its endangered species consultation handbook,the agency defines occupied critical habitat as 
critical habitat that contains individuals of the species at the time of the section project analysis.a species does not have to occupy critical habitat throughout the year for the habitat to be considered occupied migratory birds.subsequent events affecting the species may result in this habitat becoming unoccupied.
fish wildlife serv.marine fisheries,endangered species consultation handbook,available at http.this definition recognizes that a species need not be present continuously for habitat to be considered occupied.it also demonstrates that occupied habitat is not limited to areas in which the species resides,as it includes habitat that merely contains individuals of the species.at the very least,this definition is entitled to deference proportional to its power to persuade pursuant to the supreme court holding in skidmore swift,and subsequent cases.see united states mead,giving skidmore deference to interpretations contained in agency manuals or enforcement guidelines bamonte city of mesa,cir explaining that,under skidmore,agency positions not afforded the force of law are entitled to deference proportional to their power to persuade internal quotation marks omitted.the definition in the handbook appears to be the result of the agency considered judgment and,for the reasons we express below,we are persuaded by the agency position that occupied should not be interpreted in a restrictive fashion.
the fws permissibly rejected arizona cattle resides in interpretation as too narrow.looking to the context of the present appeal provides a solid justification for this rejection.the record demonstrates,for example,that pacs include only of the owl foraging habitat.even if we assume that each owl resides in a pac,we are not persuaded that congress intended a definition of occupied that would exclude areas likely to be regularly used by the species.this is particularly true where those areas contain resources necessary for species conservation.arizona cattle proposed interpretation would also exclude habitat for nonterritorial owls that may not be under constant or uniform use despite frequent owl presence.cape hatteras access alliance,d at noting the agency examination of areas for consistent use.
the fws has authority to designate as occupied areas that the owl uses with sufficient regularity that it is likely to be present during any reasonable span of time.this interpretation is sensible when considered in light of the many factors that may be relevant to the factual determination of occupancy.for example,arizona cattle reside in interpretation would make little sense as applied to nonterritorial,mobile,or migratory the which it may be impossible to fix a determinate area in which the animal resides.such a narrow interpretation also would mesh poorly with the fws authority to act in the face of uncertainty 
we are further persuaded by our decision in gifford pinchot.in that case we invalidated an agency interpretation of the esa that effectively eliminated the independent significance of critical habitat as a measure to protect endangered species.see gifford pinchot,at see also sierra club fish wildlife,cir.the same logic leads us here to reject arizona cattle attempt to shackle the fws with an overly narrow definition of occupied.critical occupied critical habitat is defined in relation to areas necessary for the conservation of the species,not merely to ensure its survival.see a gifford pinchot,at sierra club,at.limiting the agency to designating habitat only where the owl resides focuses too narrowly on owl survival and ignores the broader purpose of the critical habitat designation.
our decision is also informed by supreme court precedent that has treated the word occupied with considerable breadth.in amoco production,the court distinguished a statute referring to land in alaska from a statute referring to public lands which are actually occupied.at.the court explained that while in alaska had a precise meaning,the phrase public lands which are actually occupied did not and was properly construed to include substantial areas of adjacent waters.id.citing hynes grimes packing.the court interpretation of actually occupied as including adjacent waters suggests that it is permissible for the fws to interpret occupied more broadly than merely the area where an individual or species resides.
finally,this interpretation is supported by the purpose of the esa to prevent animal and plant species endangerment and extinction caused by man influence on ecosystems,and to return the species to the point where they are viable components of their ecosystems.trout unlimited lohn,cir quoting,at,reprinted in,where data are inconclusive or where habitat is used on a sporadic basis,allowing the fws to designate as occupied habitat where the species is likely to be found promotes the esa conservation goals and comports with the esa policy of institutionalized caution.see,defenders of wildlife flowers,cir sierra club marsh,cir congress clearly intended that agencies give the highest of priorities and the benefit of the doubt to preserving endangered species.internal quotation marks omitted.
it is possible for the fws to go too far.most obvious is that the agency may not determine that areas unused by owls are occupied merely because those areas are suitable for future occupancy.such a position would ignore the esa distinction between occupied and unoccupied areas.see.cattle growers ass n,at.we note as a caveat,however,that determining whether an area is occupied or merely will be occupied in the future may be complicated in the context of migratory or mobile species.the fact that a member of the species is not present in an area at a given instant does not mean the area is suitable only for future occupancy if the species regularly uses the area 
having thus framed the inquiry,we turn to the primary issue before the court whether the fws included unoccupied areas in its critical habitat designation.
b.the fws did not designate unoccupied areas as critical habitat 
after a thorough review of the record we find that the fws did not arbitrarily and capriciously treat unoccupied areas as occupied.we reiterate that when an agency is acting within its expertise to make a scientific determination a reviewing court must generally be at its most deferential.balt.gas nrdc,lands council mcnair,cir en banc,abrogated in part on other grounds by winter nrdc.
the fws took,as a starting point for its designation,the three types of habitat management areas that it developed in the recovery plan.simply by virtue of the definitions of these habitat management types,there is a direct link between the designated territory and owl occupancy.pacs are explicitly defined with reference to frequent owl presence,and protected areas and restricted areas are devised around and adjacent to pacs.more to the point,we note significant record support for owl occupancy of these areas in the form of studies correlating the habitat characteristics of protected and restricted areas with owl presence.gifford pinchot,at cf also envtl.prot.info.ctr.forest,cir rather than counting individual animals,an agency may in appropriate cases use habitat as a proxy.
the agency did not stop there.it further refined its designation by adding and removing areas on the basis of evidence of owl occupancy or lack thereof.a striking example of this is the fws analysis of owl occupancy in the proposed critical habitat in arizona this analysis proceeds,unit by unit,through the addition of areas to the critical habitat proposal on the basis of information about known owl locations.it also demonstrates that the fws,even where it could not identify known owl sites pacs with certainty,was considering other evidence of current owl use in designating habitat,such as owl calling routes.
a point of recurring significance to our analysis is that pacs reflect only known owl sites.although the final rule identified pacs,owl populations have been estimated to be significantly greater than the maximum owls reflected by this number of pacs.for example,the environmental analysis notes that more owls than this may exist in a single recovery unit a pilot study ganey et,conducted in estimated the number of mexican spotted owls for the upper gila mountains recovery unit,exclusive of tribal lands,as.since the listing of the species,the fws has repeatedly revised upward its estimates of owl populations and identified new pacs.likewise,the final rule recognizes that a dditional surveys are likely to document more owls.efforts by the fws to identify other evidence of owl presence when it is unable to fix the location of a pac with certainty are,therefore,highly significant.
even more significant is the fact that the fws excluded areas with evidence of few or no owls.the final rule explains that the fws did not designate some areas that are known to have widely scattered owl sites,low owl population densities,marginal habitat quality.we find this statement supported by record evidence explaining the fws decision to exclude several areas due to an absence of owls.we likewise find that the record demonstrates that where the fws did include areas in which owl presence was as the north kaibab ranger district nkrd,the peloncillo mountains,the prescott national forest,and certain sky islands it did so after thoughtful consideration of owl occupancy.finally,we note that a comparison of the areas designated in the final rule to pac locations confirms that the fws excluded the vast majority of critical habitat units that contained no pacs and refined the boundaries of the critical habitat units to exclude large areas that are distant from pacs.
the fws process for designating critical habitat gives us a strong foundation for our conclusion that the agency did not arbitrarily and capriciously treat areas in which owls are not found as occupied.with this context in mind,we turn to arizona cattle specific arguments that the agency improperly designated unoccupied areas as critical habitat and our reasons for disagreement.
the fws did not impermissibly change course in the final rule from its approach to prior designations 
arizona cattle argues that the recovery plan and the agency prior proposed habitat designations demonstrate that the fws considered only pacs to be occupied and intended restricted provide future owl habitat.this,it contends,is proof that the final rule must have falsely labeled restricted areas as occupied.arizona cattle singles out an that it contends is a smoking gun demonstrating that the fws made an abrupt shift in its description of protected and restricted areas,deciding to refer to these areas as suitable habitat outside of pacs rather than unoccupied habitat.
we have already suggested some of the reasons why it would be inappropriate to read the final rule as treating pacs as the only areas occupied by the owl.we pause here to explain this conclusion further.first,the final rule is explicit that pacs represent only the best habitat used by the owl.the record also demonstrates that the fws believed that owls may use habitat within a buffer around pacs and that pacs were intended to minimize activities occurring in close proximity to owl nests and preserve the best habitat close to known nesting and roosting sites.as already discussed,the record reflects that known,territorial owls regularly use substantial areas outside of their pacs for foraging.for these owls,we find that the agency suggestion that the owl home range is an appropriate measure of the territory occupied by the owl is by the record.
even that measure would not present a complete picture of the territory occupied by the owl because pacs reflect only known owl sites.it is implausible to believe the fws was statutorily limit occupied habitat to pacs,or to the home range of only known owls,when such a decision would be significantly underinclusive.similarly,it is clear that pacs and the owl home range do not reflect areas used by nonterritorial owls or areas used for certain other intermittent owl activities,such as dispersal or migration.the agency points out in the final rule,for example,evidence that some owls migrate considerable distances miles during the winter.it does not appear that the fws intended to limit occupied habitat to pacs,nor was this decision arbitrary and capricious.
as to the fws purported shift in approach between the final rule and earlier agency actions,we find that it reflects merely a change in the agency perspective,a movement away from an unnecessarily restrictive view of the areas the owl occupies.in other words,the apparent difference between the final rule and the agency prior approach did not arise because the agency suddenly decided to treat substantial areas where owls were not present as occupied.the agency simply reassessed its previous approach,which focused narrowly on known nesting sites as the areas occupied by the owl,adopting the broader approach that we have held reflects the proper definition of occupied.see ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,explaining that agencies may change their minds if proper procedures are followed and federal courts ordinarily review only an agency final action motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at plmrs narrowband fcc.because we conclude that the final rule remained within permissible bounds,we find no fault in the rule on this front.
the that arizona cattle contends demonstrates the fws shift in approach is explicit that this change was one of agency perspective and was entirely consistent with the evidence of the areas used by the owl.the states that,in its previous discussion of occupied habitat,the agency was really referring to known nesting sites and that protected areas,restricted areas,and other forest and woodland types within one mile of a pac may be used by owls at any given time.it explains that,although a narrow definition of occupied habitat that focused exclusively on nesting might not include these areas,protected areas and restricted areas may potentially harbor an owl at any given time.the same states that the fws believed these areas were,in fact,presently used by if they had been previously labeled unoccupied under an unnecessarily restrictive approach to that term.thus,statements in prior agency actions as to the suitability of certain areas for future owl occupancy or characterizing restricted areas as unoccupied lose their force because they reflect this change in approach rather than a contradiction as to owl presence or use of these areas.we will uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency path may be reasonably discerned.ass of home builders,at internal quotation marks omitted see also wetlands action network army corps of eng rs,n cir.
we find the explanation for the agency change in perspective supported by the record.for example,the record contains notes taken at a meeting that demonstrate the fws focus on assuring that the agency could identify a reasonable expectation of occupancy in the areas it planned to designate.the record likewise demonstrates the agency view that restricted areas are temporally occupied even if not used for nesting purposes.as we have already explained,there is sufficient record support for the agency decision in the final rule not to treat pacs as the only areas occupied by the owl.another example is an in which the agency explains that,although the exclusion of certain land resulted in the fws proposing to designate an area that contained no pacs,the agency considered the restricted area occupied.
the fws was not attempting to designate areas devoid of owls as occupied in the final rule.although seeming inconsistencies between the fws decisions may shed light on the agency process,and changes from past positions that are unsupported by evidence are unlawful,ultimately it is the final rule that is before the court and our inquiry is whether the fws exceeded its authority or deviated from the evidence see ass of home builders,at wetlands action,at.the fws analysis solidly demonstrates the connection between the designated areas and owl occupancy,notwithstanding that the agency previously adopted an unnecessarily restrictive view of the areas the owl occupied as limited to known nesting sites.the agency approach in the final rule was supported by the evidence and within permissible bounds.
the amount of land designated is not disproportionate to the number of owls 
arizona cattle also argues that even using the owl substantially larger home range as the appropriate measure for the territory occupied by the owl,the fws has designated a grossly disproportionate amount of land compared to the amount the owl occupies.it ties this argument to a seemingly simple calculation multiplying the pacs by the maximum estimated home range size of the owl of acres,the resultant area is only approximately million acres,in contrast to the million acres designated.this calculation,however,rests on a faulty assumption that the pacs represent all extant owls.we have already explained that pacs reflect only known owl sites and that there is record support for the existence of substantially greater numbers of owls and undiscovered sites.nor does this calculation,tied as it is to the number of pacs,reflect areas used by nonterritorial owls,areas used for juvenile dispersal,or areas used for owl migration arizona cattle argument does not overcome the strong evidence that the fws was focused on designating areas occupied by owls.
the fws decision to include the north kaibab ranger district in the designation was not arbitrary and capricious 
finally,we turn to the single specific where arizona cattle contends that the fws has failed to demonstrate owl occupancy the nkrd.citing a letter to the fws detailing certain studies conducted in the area without owl sightings,arizona cattle maintains that the agency treated the nkrd as occupied despite evidence that owls were in fact absent from the district.arizona cattle,however,overlooks a responsive memorandum by the agency in which the fws explains that it declined to rely on those studies because it concluded that the studies were not reliable evidence that owls were not present.this memorandum also explains the reasons for the agency conclusion that owls are present,including a history of owl sightings in the nkrd.this is precisely the sort of decision within the agency technical expertise that we are not free to.this memorandum,along with the fws diligent review of the proposed designation for owl occupancy,detailed above,persuades us that the fws decision had a sound basis in fact.
we conclude that the agency designated only occupied areas as critical habitat,even though it may not have identified with certainty in all cases a known owl constantly inhabiting that territory.the process that the fws used to select habitat for designation,the measures it took to exclude areas where owls were absent or use by owls was infrequent,and its careful work to confirm the presence of owls in the designated areas demonstrate that the fws designated areas that correspond to habitat where the owl is likely to be found.the agency action was neither based on speculation nor counter to the evidence.
iv.the fws economic analysis was not arbitrary and capricious 
arizona cattle challenges the fws analysis of the economic impacts of the critical habitat designation.for the reasons expressed below,we find no fault with the agency economic analysis.
a.the fws permissibly used the baseline approach in conducting the economic analysis 
the decision to list a species as endangered or threatened is made without reference to the economic effects of that decision.see cattle growers ass fish wildlife,cir.listing alone results in certain protections for the species,including a requirement that federal agencies insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species.a see also,id.these protections may impose economic burdens.
in contrast to the listing decision,under the esa the agency may designate critical habitat only after considering the economic impact of the designation on any particular area.id.b.the agency has discretion to exclude any area from the designation if the agency determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat,unless exclusion would result in extinction of the species.id.this can be a delicate balancing act.after critical habitat is designated,the esa requires that federal agencies insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency is not likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.id.a see also gifford pinchot,at.
the crux of the parties dispute over the fws economic analysis is whether the fws was required to attribute to the critical habitat designation economic burdens that would exist even in the absence of that designation.the parties agree that the fws applied the baseline approach to the economic analysis.under this approach,any economic impacts of protecting the owl that will occur regardless of the critical habitat particular,the burdens imposed by listing the treated as part of the regulatory baseline and are not factored into the economic analysis of the effects of the critical habitat designation arizona cattle,relying on the tenth circuit decision in new mexico cattle growers association,argues that this was error and that the fws was required to apply a approach to the economic analysis.under the approach,the agency must ignore the protection of a species that results from the listing decision in considering whether to designate an area as critical habitat.any economic burden that designating an area would cause must be counted in the economic analysis,even if the same burden is already imposed by listing the species and,therefore,would exist even if the area were not designated.
in new mexico cattle growers association the tenth circuit held that the baseline approach was impermissible under the esa.see at.it did so,however,relying on an fws regulation that defined destruction or adverse modification as effectively identical to the standard for determining whether an agency action p
