forest guardians and the white mountain conservation league collectively,forest guardians appeal from a summary judgment in favor of the united states forest service service regarding the service adoption of certain measures relating to cattle grazing on land in the national forest.the district court had jurisdiction over the claims pursuant to and g.we have jurisdiction over forest guardians timely appeal pursuant to.after the briefs were filed,but before argument was heard,the service filed a motion notifying the court that intervening events rendered moot some of forest guardians claims.after oral argument,forest guardians filed its response to the mootness motion.we dismiss in part and affirm in part.
the service is currently responsible for managing the million acres of land in the national forest system.the national forest is managed by the southwest region of the service and is located in the central eastern portion of arizona that is bordered by new mexico.
the service administers the national forest system,including the national forest,under the forest and rangeland renewable resources planning act of,as amended by the national forest management act of,et.nfma,and the act of,musya.the service also promulgates its own regulations regarding forest management in the code of federal regulations.
the service makes forest management decisions by developing a land and resource management plan forest plan for each unit of the national forest system.the service then implements the forest plan by approving or disapproving actions.the nfma and service regulations require that proposed actions be consistent with the forest plan.i.
in developing a forest plan,the service is required to provide for multiple use and sustained yield of the products and services obtained therefrom in accordance with the musya and,in particular,include coordination of outdoor recreation,range,timber,watershed,wildlife and fish,and wilderness e.the nfma also requires the service to consider the economic and environmental aspects of various systems of renewable resource management.g a.in addition,a forest plan must comply with the national environmental policy act of nepa,which requires the service to prepare an environmental impact statement for every major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.service actions must also comply with the endangered species act esa,which requires consultation with the fish and wildlife service to ensure that any action by the service is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of a designated critical habitat.a.
the service issued a forest plan for the national forest in,and amended the plan in,and.the forest plan,in accordance with musya,provided for grazing of livestock on certain portions allotments of forest land.in,the service began to develop allotment management plans amps for six grazing allotments in the forest.the red hill and grandfather allotments hereinafter,red hill were evaluated together in one administrative process,while the cow flat,foote creek,ps and stone creek allotments hereinafter,cow flat were evaluated together in another.the purpose of the two amps was to determine whether livestock grazing should be authorized,and if so,what the appropriate management strategy would be.as grazing capacity estimates indicated overstocking and overutilization of vegetation on the rangelands by both the livestock and wild ungulates,hoofed animals such as deer,big horn sheep and elk,the service concluded that the grazing permits had to be revised to comply with the forest plan and the applicable environmental laws.
after considering its options,the service canceled existing permits on the red hill and cow flat allotments and issued new permits.in these new permits,the service provided for a gradual reduction of the number of cattle allowed to graze,allocated of the available forage,forage that can be consumed or trampled by any ungulate,wild or domesticated,without damage to the environment to the,therefore,not to the wild ungulates known to inhabit the reserved the power to issue temporary permits to increase the number of grazing cattle to experiment with management strategy for the allotments.
forest guardians sued,alleging that the reduction,the allocation of all available forage to cattle,and the reserved power to experiment with range management through temporary permits all violate the consistency provision of the nfma,because the forest plan requires balancing grazing capacity with use and environmental concerns.the service,forest guardians alleges,failed to consider,as it must,the needs of the wild ungulates known to subsist on the allotments.it further alleges that the service actions violated a biological opinion bo in which the fish and wildlife service determined that unless cattle grazing was significantly reduced and harmonized with use by wild ungulates,the resulting overuse would result in a take of the loach minnow and the mexican spotted owl in violation of sections and of the esa.a take occurs when a species listed by the fish and wildlife service as endangered is killed,or its habitat is so threatened that members of the species will die,in violation of the terms of the fish and wildlife service consultation with the offending agency.
on appeal,forest guardians challenges the district court summary judgment in favor of the service on these claims.it also challenges the district court refusal to admit monitoring evidence gathered in that demonstrates overgrazing on the red hill and cow flat allotments,arguing that its claims under the esa are not limited to administrative record review.
before addressing the merits of forest guardians claims,we must consider whether some of those claims are now moot.the service argues a that the validity of the reduction scheme is moot because the period for both allotment groups red hill and cow flat ended on or before march,b that the validity of the temporary permit power was mooted by the service issuance of a decision notice indicating its intent to use its temporary permit power only in accordance with the service manual mirroring the regulation at c i and c that all of forest guardians esa sections and claims with respect to the loach minnow and the mexican spotted owl are moot because they are based on a bo that has been superseded,or in the alternative,that the section claim is moot because the service has already reconsulted with the fish and wildlife service,or that forest guardians failed to give adequate notice of the sections and claims to the agency in its intent to sue letter.we consider each argument in turn.
the service first asserts that the reduction scheme is moot because the period has ended.our cases,however,make clear that completion of activity is not the hallmark of mootness.rather,a case is moot only where no effective relief for the alleged violation can be given.neighbors of cuddy mountain alexander,cir.a controversy remains live so long as effective relief is still available.id.at cantrell city of long beach,cir challenge to plan to develop naval station was not mooted by destruction of buildings on the site because the defendants could consider alternatives to the current reuse plan,and develop ways to mitigate the damage to the birds habitat northwest envtl.def.ctr.gordon,cir challenge to regulations governing salmon fishing season was not mooted by the close of the season because the damage could be mitigated by allowing more fish to spawn in.if we conclude that the service reduction scheme violates the nfma,the district court could order the service to develop tactics to mitigate the damage caused by the violation,such as moving or removing livestock from the allotments so the land can repair itself.thus,forest guardians claim with respect to the reduction scheme remains live.
we now discuss the temporary permit power issue.forest guardians complained in its opening brief that the service decision notice indicated that the service might issue temporary permits increasing livestock numbers to determine if more intensive management could expand the lands existing grazing capacity,even though experimenting with management is not one of the five regulatory circumstances in which the service is authorized to issue temporary permits under c i.however,on january,after this case was filed but before argument was heard,the service issued a clarification to decision notice for the red hill and cow flat amps.this document expressly states that no temporary permits will issue unless consistent with the policy and purpose of temporary grazing permits set forth in the service manual,which mirrors the regulation at c i.no temporary permits were ever issued to experiment with management options.we agree with the service that the issue was no longer live once the defect was cured by the clarified decision notice.
forest guardians argues,however,that the issue falls within the voluntary cessation exception to the mootness doctrine.voluntary cessation saves an issue from becoming moot if the defendant voluntarily stops the allegedly illegal conduct to avoid a judgment against him,unless it is absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d,quoting united states concentrated phosphate export ass,d internal quotation marks omitted.forest guardians argues that it is far from absolutely clear that the agency will never pursue such improper temporary permits in the future because the original decision notice was not deleted rather,it was clarified,the service defended its original provision in the district court,and the district court agreed with the service that it fit within one of the five proper bases for issuing a temporary permit.forest guardians asserts that there is no assurance in the clarification that the service will not issue a temporary permit to experiment with management and then successfully argue to a district court that the permit is valid under one of the five proper bases.
while t he burden of demonstrating mootness is a heavy one in the face of a claim of voluntary cessation,los angeles county davis,d internal quotation marks omitted,the service has met its burden in this case.it is unreasonable to think that the service would return to conduct it has admitted to this court is constitutionally deficient.carlson united,cir.while the service may not have deleted the offending decision notice as forest guardians would have liked,the clarification overrides it,and it is clear that the service does not intend to nor even think it could return to the original policy.furthermore,the service has never attempted to exercise its apparent authority under the original provision.in light of the clarification and the service admission,it is fair to conclude that it is absolutely certain the service will not in the future issue temporary permits to experiment with forest management options.
next,we come to the service argument that the esa sections and claims for the loach minnow and the mexican spotted owl are moot because the underlying bo was superseded and therefore does not affect the new permits at issue in this case.forest guardians bases its section claim on the principle that if an agency fails to implement key assumptions on which a bo was based,the agency is required to reinitiate consultation with the fish and wildlife service under the esa.sierra club marsh,cir.it argues that the service permits do not meet the bo assumptions.forest guardians bases its section claims on the bo explicit statement that the service failure to adhere to the forage utilization standards contained therein would cause an unlawful take of the loach minnow and the mexican spotted owl.
in response,the service argues that the alleged sections and violations are moot because the biological assessment and evaluations baes superseded the bo.while this sounds implausible,the agency explains that although the baes predate the bo,they nonetheless supersede the bo because the former covers the permits for the period of,whereas the bo covered a period beginning in.the bo addressed livestock use on grazing allotments although the bo was begun before the esa consultation for the new amps and permits,it took longer to complete than the baes which addressed proposed livestock use under the new permits and amps on only allotments.the bae concluded that the allowed grazing would have either no effect or was not likely to adversely affect the species listed under the esa.the fish and wildlife service concurred in a letter dated september,satisfying the consultation requirement.a.
in its defense of jurisdiction,forest guardians argues that its section claim alleges that the agency must reconsult because the permits are inconsistent with the relevant esa consultation documents.the challenge,then is to the permits and not to any particular consultation document or process.while it is true that forest guardians challenges the permits and not the bo,their challenge is unquestionably based on the bo.forest guardians alleges the service violated the esa because it violated assumptions made in the bo.we have recognized that when one bo supersedes another,a challenge to the superseded bo is moot.am.rivers marine fisheries,cir.this is true even if the superseded bo originally covered a time period that included the date of the litigation.see id.at.although the challenge is not to the bo itself,the validity of the challenge necessarily rises or falls with the validity of the bo.because the bae,which controls,does not contain the assumptions as to forage utilization on which forest guardians bases its claim,the section claim based on the bo is moot.
the section claim is also moot because it is based on incidental take statements that accompanied the bo.since the bae supersedes the bo,and is not accompanied by incidental take statements,forest guardians claim under section of the esa that the service has violated the terms of the incidental take statements is moot.
because we hold that forest guardians sections and esa claims are moot,we do not address the service alternative argument that we are jurisdictionally barred from hearing those claims because forest guardians notice of intent to sue letter mentioned the bo and not the bae.see southwest ctr.for biological diversity bureau of reclamation,cir notice of intent to sue letters are jurisdictional.nor do we address the service argument that the section claim is moot because it has already reconsulted with the fish and wildlife service.
because the sections and claims were moot when they were brought,its additional claim that,monitoring data should have been admitted is also moot.
we review de novo forest guardians remaining challenges to the district court summary judgment upholding the agency decision.neighbors of cuddy mountain forest,cir.agency actions challenged under the nfma and the esa may be set aside only if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.id.nfma sierra club babbitt,cir esa a.in determining whether an agency action is arbitrary or capricious,we must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.morongo band of mission indians fed.aviation,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.id.
moreover,the service is entitled to substantial deference to its interpretation of its own regulations.thomas jefferson shalala,d.indeed,judicial review of an agency interpretation of its own regulations is limited to ensuring that the agency interpretation is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.vincent apfel,cir.
forest guardians contends that the reduction scheme included in the grazing permits violates the nfma because it is not consistent with the forest plan.the district court held that the scheme was permitted by a,which requires one year notice to permittees regarding changes in permitted livestock numbers.we conclude that this was not a proper basis upon which to uphold this aspect of the grazing permits.section a expressly aut
