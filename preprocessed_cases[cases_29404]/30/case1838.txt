introduction 
a worker in a public sewer system was seriously injured when a furniture stripping business released methylene chloride into the sewer system where he was working.the trial court granted summary judgment to the insurer of the furniture stripping business on the basis of a pollution exclusion clause contained in a comprehensive general liability policy the cgl policy.we affirm.the injured worker injuries arose from an event commonly thought of as environmental pollution.an ordinary insured would reasonably expect that the release of methylene chloride into a public sewer is environmental pollution.mackinnon truck ins.exchange cal th,d,mackinnon.
factual and procedural background 
the furniture stripping business 
defendant and appellant michael miller miller owned a furniture stripping business called stripper herk located in santa monica,california.as part of the business,stripper herk generated wastewaters containing solvents,including methylene chloride,and generated hazardous wastes that accumulated in drums on the premises.
the city of santa monica issued stripper herk an industrial wastewater facility.the permit allowed stripper herk to discharge wastewater from its premises into the city sewer.the permit,however,prohibited the discharge of any solvents,including methylene chloride,into the sewer.
the cgl policy 
plaintiff and respondent american casualty company of redding,american casualty,provided miller,doing business as stripper herk,with a cgl policy,which was effective from april,to april.
coverage a of the policy provided coverage for bodily injury and property damage with a limit of million per occurrence.under coverage a,the policy provided coverage for those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence during the policy period.the policy also obligated american casualty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages.
the pollution exclusion 
the cgl policy contained a pollution exclusion clause which provided in pertinent part that coverage a did not apply to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the actual,alleged,or threatened discharge,dispersal,seepage,migration,release or escape of pollutants a at or from any premises,site,or location which is or was at any time owned or occupied by,or rented or loaned to,any insured.
the cgl policy defined pollutants as follows a ny solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant,including smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acids,alkalis,chemicals,and waste.waste includes materials to be recycled,reconditioned or reclaimed.
the accident 
on the morning of march,a private contractor hired by the city of santa monica was working in the city sewer lines which were downstream of the premises of stripper herk.valenzuela,an employee of the private contractor,was repairing a sewer line in front of and approximately feet below stripper herk.valenzuela noticed wastewaters discharging from a drain outlet into the sewer.the wastewaters soaked valenzuela clothing and caused him to lose consciousness.monitors that measure the presence of dangerous chemicals sounded.valenzuela sustained serious bodily injuries.
the city investigation 
later that day,inspectors from the city of santa monica environmental and public works management,industrial waste section,inspected stripper herk.the investigators discovered organic solvents,including methylene chloride,discharging into stripper herk floor sump and into the city sewer system.the investigators conducted a dye test,which confirmed that stripper herk industrial waste sump was tied into the sewer leading into the section of sewer line where valenzuela was working at the time of the incident.
the criminal proceedings against miller 
the investigation resulted in federal criminal proceedings against miller.the federal proceedings concluded with miller entering a plea agreement with the united states attorney office for the central district of california.
there,miller pled guilty to negligent discharge of pollutants into a treatment works in violation of a permit and storage of hazardous wastes without a permit.
in the plea agreement,miller and the united state attorney stipulated to the following miller and his employees allowed such wastewaters to flow into a sump located on the floor of stripper herk premises.located in the sump was a pipe connected to the sewer.the pipe was not properly sealed,which negligently allowed some of the wastewaters that accumulated in the sump to flow into the pipe and thereafter discharge into the sewer.neither party presented any evidence as to how long methylene chloride wastewaters had escaped into the sewer.
the zurich action 
on june,zurich american insurance company zurich sued stripper herk for reimbursement of workers compensation benefits paid to valenzuela following the incident the zurich action.there,zurich alleged that stripper herk caused or permitted toxic compounds to enter the sewer and injure valenzuela.zurich also alleged that stripper herk retained sufficient control over its premises to owe valenzuela a duty of care to avoid exposing him to an unreasonable risk of harm.zurich alleged that the release of wastewaters breached the duty of care.
miller notified american casualty of the zurich action,and that zurich was seeking reimbursement of workers compensation benefits it had paid and would pay to valenzuela.american casualty denied the claim on the basis of the pollution exclusion clause,and refused to defend or indemnify miller with respect to the claim.
valenzuela sues miller and stripper herk 
in february,valenzuela filed suit against miller and stripper herk.valenzuela alleged eight causes of action,including negligence,negligence per se,premises liability,strict liability,battery,assault and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress the valenzuela action.valenzuela alleged,inter alia,that miller and stripper herk breached a duty of care by discharging wastewaters containing methylene chloride.
in may,miller tendered the valenzuela action and the zurich action to american casualty.on may,american casualty refused to defend or indemnify miller with respect to the lawsuits.
in january and february,miller again requested that american casualty defend and indemnify him for damages resulting from valenzuela injuries.american casualty again refused.
the valenzuela action settles 
in june,the parties settled the valenzuela action against miller and stripper herk.as part of the settlement agreement,miller assigned his rights under the cgl insurance policy to valenzuela.valenzuela made a policy limit demand on american casualty of million.american casualty declined the demand.
american casualty files for declaratory relief 
on june,american casualty filed a complaint for declaratory relief against miller,doing business as stripper herk,and valenzuela defendants.american casualty alleged that pursuant to the cgl insurance policy,it had no duty to defend or indemnify miller in either the valenzuela or zurich action.defendants answered and filed a.
the trial court grants summary judgment in favor of american casualty 
on april,the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of american casualty.the trial court found that under the pollution exclusion clause,quoted above,american casualty was not required to defend or indemnify miller,doing business as stripper herk,and thus had no liability to valenzuela for his injuries from the methylene chloride.defendants timely filed a notice of appeal.
contentions 
defendants contend the trial court erred as a matter of law by finding that american casualty had no duty to defend or indemnify miller,doing business as stripper herk,based on the pollution exclusion clause.
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo a trial court grant of summary judgment.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.in addition,interpretation of insurance policy language is a question of law.ibid.therefore,we review de novo whether the pollution exclusion bars coverage for the injuries at issue in this case.ibid.
in legarra federated mutual ins.th,d,the court explained an insurer may move for summary adjudication that no potential for liability exists and thus no duty to defend where the evidence establishes as a matter of law there is no coverage.citation.in an action seeking declaratory relief on the issue of a duty to defend,different showings are required of the insured and the insurer.to prevail,the insured must prove the existence of a potential for coverage,while the insurer must establish the absence of any such potential.in other words,the insured need only show that the underlying claim may fall within policy coverage the insurer must prove it can not.citation.id.at,d.
discussion 
the pollution exclusion clause is not ambiguous in the context of this case and excludes coverage for valenzuela personal injuries 
in mackinnon,the california supreme court addressed the meaning and scope of a pollution exclusion clause in a cgl policy.the supreme court found the pollution exclusion clause was intended to exclude coverage for injuries resulting from events commonly thought as environmental pollution,not all injuries arising from toxic substances.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.the pollution exclusion clause in mackinnon is substantially similar to the pollution exclusion at issue in this case.id.at,d.
in mackinnon,a landlord hired a third party pest control company to exterminate yellow jackets in an apartment building.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.after the company treated the apartment building on a number of occasions,a tenant died in the building.ibid.the tenant parents filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the landlord.the landlord tendered the defense to his insurer,which denied a duty to defend or indemnify based upon the pollution exclusion clause in the cgl policy.the landlord filed suit against his insurer.ibid.
the trial court granted the landlord motion for summary judgment,concluding that the pollution exclusion clause precluded coverage for the injuries.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.the court of appeal affirmed the trial court.the supreme court reversed.id.at,d.
the mackinnon court traced the historical evolution of pollution exclusion clauses.with respect to the particular pollution exclusion clause at issue,the court explained that courts in other jurisdictions were split as to the scope of such clauses.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.the court summarized one camp maintains that the exclusion applies only to traditional environmental pollution into the air,water,and soil,but generally not to all injuries involving the negligent use or handling of toxic substances that occur in the normal course of business.these courts generally find ambiguity in the wording of the pollution exclusion when it is applied to such negligence and interpret such ambiguity against the insurance company in favor of coverage.the other camp maintains that the clause applies equally to negligence involving toxic substances and traditional environmental pollution,and that the clause is as unambiguous in excluding the former as the latter.fn.omitted.id.at,d.
the mackinnon court then examined the language of the policy at issue in the case before it.the court noted that the cgl policy,like the insurance policy in this case,obligated the insurer to pay all sums for which the insured become s legally obligated to pay as damages caused by bodily injury,property damage or personal injury.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.the court explained that this language establishe d a reasonable expectation that the insured will have coverage for ordinary acts of negligence resulting in bodily injury.ibid.the court stated that c overage will therefore be found unless the pollution exclusion conspicuously,plainly and clearly appraises the insured that certain acts of ordinary negligence,such as the spraying of pesticides in this case,will not be covered.ibid.
the mackinnon court found that the policy language was ambiguous.the court rejected the insurer argument that the pollution exclusion,read literally and broadly,would extend to all acts of negligence involving substances that could be characterized as irritants or contaminants.specifically,the insurer argued that pesticides are capable of causing irritation and can thus be defined as irritants or pollutants.the insurer also argued that the spraying of pesticides could be described as discharge or dispersal.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.
the mackinnon court explained that the insurer interpretation of the pollution exclusion clause would lead to absurd results because v irtually any substance can act under the proper circumstances as an irritant or contaminant.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.the court noted that chlorine contains irritating properties that could cause injury and i ts dissemination throughout a pool may be literally described as a dispersal or discharge.ibid.the court explained,however,that its research had not revealed any court or commentator that concluded that such an incident would be excluded under the pollution exclusion.ibid.
the mackinnon court concluded in short,because the insurer broad interpretation of the pollution exclusion leads to absurd results and ignores the familiar connotations of the words used in the exclusion,we do not believe it is the interpretation that the ordinary layperson would adopt.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.
instead,the mackinnon court held that application of the pollution exclusion clause should be limited to injuries arising from events commonly thought of as pollution,environmental pollution mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.in reaching this conclusion,the court focused upon the commonly understood meanings of the terms used in the pollution exclusion clause.
first,the court explained that it would be unusual to consider the normal,intentional application of pesticides as a release or escape of a pollutant under the pollution exclusion clause.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.the court explained that the terms release and escape connoted some sort of freedom from containment and that it would be unusual to characterize the normal application of pesticides as a release or escape of pesticides.ibid.
the court also explained the terms discharge and dispersal as used in the pollution exclusion clause did not generally connote the normal intentional spraying of pesticides.the court explained that t he notion of dispersal as a substantial dissemination is reinforced by its use with the term pollutant.indeed,the word dispersal,when in conjunction with pollutant,is commonly used to describe the spreading of pollution widely enough to cause its dissipation and dilution in the present case,the application of pesticides in and around an apartment building does not plainly signify to the common understanding the dispersal of a pollutant.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.
likewise,with respect to the term discharge,the court explained that a lthough the application of pesticides could literally be described as a discharge of pesticides,that term is rarely used in this manner.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.the court explained that,instead,the term discharge is commonly used with pesticides to describe pesticide runoff behaving as a traditional environmental pollutant rather than pesticides being normally applied.id.at,d.
second,the supreme court focused on the word pollution.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.the court explained that the definition of pollutant,as including any irritant or contaminant,was too broad and that the court must turn to the common connotative meaning of that term as understood by a reasonable policy holder.ibid.quoting regional bank of colorado paul fire and marine ins.cir,the mackinnon court explained while a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence might well understand carbon monoxide is a pollutant when it is emitted in an industrial or environmental setting,an ordinary policyholder would not reasonably characterize carbon monoxide emitted from a residential heater which malfunctioned as pollution.it seems far more reasonable that a policyholder would understand it as being limited to irritants and contaminants commonly thought of as pollution and not as applying to every possible irritant or contaminant imaginable.mackinnon,at,d.the
