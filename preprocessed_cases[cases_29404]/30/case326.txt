this is the second appeal by james and rebecca deaton,who were sued by the government under the clean water act sometimes,the cwa or the act,et,for failing to obtain a permit from the army corps of engineers the corps before digging a ditch and depositing excavated dirt in wetlands on their property.the corps asserts jurisdiction because the deatons wetlands are adjacent to,and drain into,a roadside ditch whose waters eventually flow into the navigable wicomico river and chesapeake bay.the deatons main argument is that the corps has no authority over the roadside ditch,and thus the agency can not regulate their wetlands.first,we hold that congress power under the commerce clause to protect navigable waters allows it to regulate the discharge of pollutants that flow into the ditch.congress delegated part of this authority to the corps in the clean water act.the corps,in turn,has promulgated a regulation,a,that extends cwa jurisdiction to tributaries of navigable waters.this regulation represents a reasonable interpretation of the cwa that is entitled to deference.the corps interprets its regulation to cover the roadside ditch,and we also defer to that interpretation.second,we hold that the district court did not err when it decided that the corps used an appropriate indicator for wetland hydrology prescribed by its wetlands delineation manual in designating parts of the deatons property as wetlands.finally,we affirm the district court remediation order,which requires the deatons to fill in the ditch and restore their wetlands to their condition.
the delmarva peninsula separates the chesapeake bay from the atlantic ocean.since the deatons have owned an undeveloped,parcel of land located roughly in the center of the peninsula,near parsonsburg in wicomico county,maryland.the parcel slopes gently downhill toward a county road,morris leonard road.a drainage ditch runs alongside the road between the pavement and the deatons property.the deatons call the ditch the morris leonard road ditch,while the corps calls it the john adkins prong of perdue creek.we will call it the roadside ditch.the parties agree that surface water from the deatons property drains into the roadside ditch.they disagree about how much water flows through the ditch,and how consistent the flow is,but they agree on the ditch course.water from the roadside ditch takes a winding,path to the chesapeake bay.at the northwest edge of the deatons property,the roadside ditch drains into a culvert under morris leonard road.on the other side of the road,the culvert drains into another ditch,known as the john adkins prong of perdue creek.perdue creek flows into beaverdam creek,a natural watercourse with several dams and ponds.beaverdam creek is a direct tributary of the wicomico river,which is navigable.beaverdam creek empties into the wicomico river about eight miles from the deatons property.about river miles further downstream,the wicomico river flows into the chesapeake bay,a vast body of navigable water.
the deatons bought the parcel for the purpose of developing a small residential subdivision.there was a problem,however,because much of the property was poorly drained.in particular,there was a large,low,wet area in the middle where water stood in the winter months and after heavy rainfall.because of the drainage problem,the wicomico county health department denied the deatons application for a sewage disposal permit.the deatons then decided to dig a drainage ditch across the property.a technician from the soil conservation service scs advised deaton,however,that a large portion of the property contained nontidal wetlands and that he would need a permit from the corps before undertaking any ditching work.in early the deatons,without seeking a corps permit,hired a contractor who dug a ditch that crossed the areas of the property identified as wetlands by the scs technician.the contractor piled the excavated dirt on either side of the ditch,a practice known as sidecasting.
the corps learned about the deatons ditching project in july and promptly initiated regulatory action.the details are discussed in our prior opinion,united states deaton,cir.in short,the corps issued a order to the deatons,warning them that their placement of fill material in a wetland violated a of the clean water act,a,and that no further work should be done without a permit.after a period of lengthy,but unsuccessful,negotiations with the deatons,the government in filed a civil complaint alleging that the deatons had violated the clean water act by discharging fill material into regulated wetlands without a permit.the district court ultimately concluded in the first round that sidecasting did not constitute the discharge of a pollutant under the act and granted summary judgment to the deatons.we reversed,holding that the clean water act definition of discharge as any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters encompasses sidecasting in a wetland.deaton,at referring to.we remanded the case for further proceedings.
not long after our remand order,the supreme court decided solid waste agency of northern cook county united states army corps of engineers,d swancc.swancc held that the corps exceeded its statutory authority under a of the clean water act when it interpreted the act through a and the migratory bird rule.to cover an isolated,intrastate gravel pit that was filled with water and used by migratory birds.id.at.because swancc provides new guidance for analyzing the corps jurisdiction under the clean water act,the deatons filed a motion on september,asking the district court to reconsider the issue of cwa jurisdiction in this case.the deatons argued that under swancc the clean water act can not be read to extend corps jurisdiction to their wetlands or the roadside ditch and that if the act does extend that far,congress exceeded its authority under the commerce clause,const.art.i,cl.on january,the district court entered an order denying the motion to reconsider,holding that the deatons wetlands are adjacent to the roadside ditch,which is a tributary of navigable waters,that b ecause there is a hydrologic connection between the deaton wetlands and navigable waters,swancc does not bar cwa jurisdiction,and that protecting the deatons wetlands is reasonably related to congress authority under the commerce clause to protect navigable waters as channels of commerce.five days later,on february,the district court entered a remediation order directing the deatons to restore their property to its condition and elevation.the deatons appeal these orders.
the deatons appeal of the district court order denying their motion to reconsider clean water act or corps jurisdiction presents a question of law that we review de novo.see meekins united transp.union,cir.we begin with the statutory and regulatory framework for corps jurisdiction in this case.section a of the clean water act requires a permit issued by the secretary of the army,through the corps of engineers,for the discharge of fill material into navigable waters.a,d.the act defines navigable waters as waters of the united states,including the territorial seas.the corps jurisdictional regulations define waters of the united states to include,among others,i traditional navigable waters,that is,waters which are currently used,or were used in the past,or may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce,a,ii tributaries of covered waters,including traditional navigable waters,id.a,and iii wetlands adjacent to covered waters,including tributaries,id.a.the corps asserts jurisdiction over the deatons wetlands because they are adjacent to the roadside ditch,which is a tributary of the wicomico river,a traditional navigable water.
in united states riverside bayview homes,d,the supreme court upheld corps regulations requir ing permits for the discharge of fill material into wetlands adjacent to the waters of the united states.id.at.several courts have held that swancc limited this holding to wetlands adjacent to traditional navigable waters,rice harken exploration,cir united states rgm,d,united states newdunn,d,appeal pending sub nom.treacy newdunn,l cir.united states rapanos,d.the deatons do not press for that limitation here.they argue instead that the roadside ditch is not covered by the clean water act,which means that their wetlands are not adjacent to any covered water.as a result,the deatons say,they did not need a permit to discharge fill material into their wetlands.it is undisputed that the deatons wetlands are adjacent to the roadside ditch.thus,if the ditch is covered,so are the wetlands.our analysis,then,will focus on whether the corps has jurisdiction over the roadside ditch.
the deatons first argue that the corps tributaries regulation,which interprets the clean water act to reach the roadside ditch,pushes the limits of congressional authority under the commerce clause and thereby raises a serious constitutional question.according to the deatons,congress did not give a clear indication that it intended the act to reach tributaries so far from navigable waters,and therefore we should avoid the question of whether regulation of the ditch is constitutional by holding that congress did not authorize it under the act.the deatons argue in the alternative that even if congress authorized the corps regulation of the roadside ditch under the cwa,that authorization is invalid because it exceeds congress power under the commerce clause.the corps,of course,contends that its assertion of cwa jurisdiction over the roadside ditch through its tributaries regulation,a,represents a proper exercise of power granted to congress by the constitution and delegated to the corps.for the reasons that follow,we hold that the cwa,as implemented by the corps regulation,fits comfortably within congress authority to regulate navigable waters.
the regulation reflects the corps interpretation of the cwa,and the deatons arguments require us to undertake a somewhat complicated analysis.the deatons begin their first argument by saying that the corps regulation can not survive the threshold analysis required by swancc when an administrative interpretation of a statute invokes the outer limits of congress power,the interpretation is not entitled to deference under chevron natural resources defense council,d,unless congress gave a clear indication that it intended that result.swancc,at.citing edward debartolo.gulf coast and constr.trades council,d.this requirement,the court said,stems from a prudential desire not to needlessly reach constitutional issues and an assumption that congress does not casually authorize administrative agencies to interpret a statute to push the limit of congressional authority.id.at.moreover,t his concern is heightened where the administrative interpretation alters the framework by permitting federal encroachment upon a traditional state power.id.at.thus,where an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems,courts will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of congress.id.at.quoting debartolo,at.
swancc and debartolo must be read in light of rust sullivan,d.see williams babbitt,cir comparing debartolo and rust.in rust the supreme court proceeded to decide the constitutionality of an agency regulations because,while the constitutional arguments against the regulations had some force,the arguments did not raise the sort of grave and doubtful constitutional questions that would require a clear indication from congress that it intended to authorize the agency interpretation.rust,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,the court said,it did not have to invalidate the regulations in order to save the statute from unconstitutionality.id.in sum,when we do not face the sort of serious constitutional questions that would lead us to assume congress did not intend to authorize the regulation issuance,we may decide the constitutional question and proceed to the chevron analysis.republican comm.fed.election comm n,quoting rust,at.
our initial task is to determine whether the constitutional the commerce clause give congress authority over the roadside serious enough to warrant rejection of the corps regulation.the commerce clause of our constitution grants congress authority over three distinct spheres the use of the channels of interstate commerce the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,or persons or things in interstate commerce and those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce.united states lopez,d.the activities regulated under the third category must be economic in nature.united states morrison,d.see also gdf realty,norton,cir.congress enacted the clean water act under its traditional jurisdiction over waters that were or had been navigable in fact or which could reasonably be so made.swancc,at.see also id.at.the power over navigable waters is an aspect of the authority to regulate the channels of interstate commerce.gibbs babbitt,cir including navigable rivers,lakes,and canals among the channels of commerce citation omitted united states ballinger,cir.
congress power over the channels of interstate commerce,unlike its power to regulate activities with a substantial relation to interstate commerce,reaches beyond the regulation of activities that are purely economic in nature.the power to regulate channels of interstate commerce allows congress to make laws that protect the flow of commerce.see heart of atlanta motel,united states,d upholding congressional power to bar racial discrimination in hotels because this discrimination had a disruptive effect on commercial intercourse united states darby.upholding congressional power to forbid interstate commerce in goods made by child labor because traffic in such goods encourages competition injurious to the commerce.some of the power exercised by congress in enacting the clean water act is grounded in the authority to protect the flow of commerce in navigable waters as channels or instrumentalities of interstate commerce.united states wilson,cir.see also united states ashland oil transp,cir noting hazards to navigation posed by pollution.
the deatons argue that the power over navigable waters is limited to legislation aimed at protecting or encouraging navigation and the flow of commerce.however,the supreme court cases discussing congressional power over channels of interstate commerce make clear that this view is too narrow.congressional power to regulate the use of commercial channels goes further the authority of congress to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from immoral and injurious uses has been frequently sustained caminetti united states.quoted in lopez,at.in caminetti the supreme court held that the mann act,which barred the transport of any woman or girl in interstate channels for an immoral purpose was within congressional authority,even though the defendant a woman across state lines to be and become his mistress and concubine was entirely noncommercial.id.at.see also perez united states,d acknowledging congressional power to regulate the use of channels of interstate commerce which congress deems are being misused heart of atlanta motel,at.citing caminetti ballinger,at congress may regulate any instrumentality or channel of interstate commerce united states horton,cir reading federal kidnapping statute as exercise of congressional power to prevent misuse of channels of commerce by a kidnapper trying to cover up his trail by moving evidence of his crime into a different state jurisdiction.but united states abdullah,cir suggesting that a statute enacted under this authority must have as its purpose to keep open the very avenues by which interstate commerce is transacted.the deatons are correct that many cases concerning the power over navigable waters focus on congressional authority to regulate in aid of navigation,gilman philadelphia,wall.united states appalachian power.but there is no reason to believe congress has less power over navigable waters than over other interstate channels such as highways,which may be regulated to prevent their immoral and injurious use.caminetti,at.
congress authority over the channels of commerce is thus broad enough to allow it to legislate,as it did in the clean water act,to prevent the use of navigable waters for injurious purposes.see caminetti,at.lopez,at.for example,congress may outlaw the use of navigable waters as dumping grounds for fill material.the power over navigable waters also carries with it the authority to regulate nonnavigable waters when that regulation is necessary to achieve congressional goals in protecting navigable waters.see oklahoma ex rel.phillips guy atkinson.united states rio grande dam irrigation.see also united states grand river dam,d.any pollutant or fill material that degrades water quality in a tributary of navigable waters has the potential to move downstream and degrade the quality of the navigable waters themselves.indeed,the principle that congress has the authority to regulate discharges into nonnavigable tributaries in order to protect navigable waters has long been applied to the clean water act.see,ashland oil,at united states hartsell,cir.the deatons argue that their discharge or sidecasting of dirt into wetlands adjacent to the roadside ditch is too trivial to affect water quality in navigable waters.congress,however,may decide that the aggregate effect of all of the individual instances of discharge,like the discharge by the deatons,justifies regulating each of them.see wickard filburn.and if congress itself has the authority to make that decision,it may delegate it to the corps,as long as it provides an intelligible principle to guide the agency decisionmaking.see,hampton,united states.skinner.pipeline,d see also darby,at.congress passed the clean water act to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters,a,and gave the corps,along with the environmental protection agency,the job of getting this done.the corps has pursued this goal by regulating nonnavigable tributaries and their adjacent wetlands.this use of delegated authority is well within congress traditional power over navigable waters.
it follows that under the corps interpretation,the clean water act does not invade an area of authority reserved to the states.the power to protect navigable waters is part of the commerce power given to congress by the constitution,and this power exists alongside the states traditional police powers.although states have important interests in regulating natural resources within their borders,this authority is shared with the federal government when the federal government exercises one of its enumerated powers minnesota mille lacs band of chippewa indians,d.gibbs,at concluding that the application of the endangered species act to private land does not unconstitutionally interfere with local power over land use or wildlife gdf realty,at same.the federal decision to regulate the discharge of pollutants into tributaries of navigable waters does not significantly change the balance.see united states bass,d.
in sum,the corps regulatory interpretation of the term waters of the united states as encompassing nonnavigable tributaries of navigable waters does not invoke the outer limits of congress power or alter the framework.the agency interpretation of the statute therefore does not present a serious constitutional question that would cause us to assume that congress did not intend to authorize the regulation.indeed,as our discussion of congress commerce clause authority makes clear,the federal assertion of jurisdiction over nonnavigable tributaries of navigable waters is constitutional.
the thrust of the deatons final argument about the corps jurisdiction is this even if the corps could regulate the roadside ditch without causing a constitutional problem,neither the clean water act nor the corps regulation extends coverage to the ditch.here,the deatons make a argument.first,they argue that even if the act authorizes the corps to regulate the nonnavigable tributaries of navigable waters,the roadside ditch is not such a tributary.they say that the ditch does not meet the definition of tributary at all or,alternatively,it is not a tributary of a navigable water because water flowing from the ditch must pass through several other nonnavigable watercourses before reaching the navigable wicomico river.in short,the deatons are arguing here that the corps is misinterpreting its own regulation by using the tributaries provision,a,to assert jurisdiction over the roadside ditch.second,they argue that if the tributary regulation does cover the ditch,the regulation is an unreasonable interpretation of the cwa.we hold that we should defer to the corps interpretation of its regulation to include the ditch and that the regulation,read this way,is a reasonable interpretation of the clean water act.
this finally brings us to chevron,and we analyze the deatons statutory and regulatory coverage arguments as follows.we begin with the first step of the chevron analysis,see at,and determine whether the clean water act delegates authority to the corps to decide whether to regulate nonnavigable tributaries.specifically,we ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.when congress has not spoken directly,but instead has been silent or ambiguous on the issue,it has by implication delegated authority to the agency charged with administering the statute,allowing the agency to clarify the ambiguity or fill the gap.id.at.see also smiley citibank south dakota,d.if we conclude that the statute is silent or ambiguous,we normally move directly to the second step in the chevron analysis,see at,and determine whether the agency regulation reflects a reasonable construction of the statute,id.
in this case,however,we are sidetracked by another issue the meaning of the regulation itself.the corps interprets its regulation to cover the roadside ditch,but the deatons contend that the corps interpretation can not be squared with the words of the regulation.as a result of this dispute,we must,before proceeding to chevron step two,determine what the regulation actually means.kentuckians for the commonwealth rivenburgh,cir.we give controlling weight to an agency interpretation of its own regulation,unless the interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.bowles seminole rock sand.see also auer robbins,d kentuckians,at united states hoechst celanese,cir.if the regulation is unambiguous,then what is known as seminole rock deference does not apply,and the regulation plain language,not the agency interpretation,controls.christensen harris county,d.once we have determined what the regulation means,we can move on to the second step of chevron,at,and decide whether the regulation is based on a reasonable construction of the statute.see kentuckians,at combining use of seminole rock and chevron tests.
we turn to the initial question of whether the statute is ambiguous.if congress has spoken to the precise question at issue,there is no ambiguity and thus no room for the agency interpretation.chevron,at.the precise question here is whether the clean water act extends to distant,nonnavigable tributaries of navigable waters.section a of the cwa regulates discharges into navigable waters,a,and the act defines navigable waters as waters of the united states,id.the corps regulations interpret the term waters of the united states.if congress had stopped with the basic term navigable waters,the term used in a,a,many years of judicial precedent would give us the following clear meaning waters are navigable in fact when they are used,or are susceptible of being used,in their ordinary condition,as highways for commerce,over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water.the daniel ball,wall.see also appalachian power,at.in the clean water act congress elected to redefine navigable waters,moving away from the traditional definition.its choice of the expansive phrase waters of the united states indicates an intent to regulate at least some waters that would not be deemed navigable under the classical understanding of that term.riverside bayview,at.
