environmental law 
the panel denied petitions for review brought by tribal conservation organizations and environmental organizations challenging the united states environmental protection agency federal implementation plan fip under the clean air act for the navajo generating station,a power plant on the navajo nation reservation in arizona.
the panel held that the federal government partial ownership of the station did not eliminate any deference to the epa interpretation of the clean air act and its implementing regulations.
the clean air act invites states to submit to the epa a state implementation plan setting forth emission limits and other measures to improve air visibility.if a state elects not to submit a state implementation plan,or the epa rejects the state plan,the epa must generate a fip to fill any resulting gaps.regional haze state implementation plans must identify the best available retrofit technology bart to reduce emissions from major emission sources,like the station.a state can bypass bart with a better than bart alternative.
in,the epa issued its tribal authority rule,which created a mechanism for tribes to develop a tribal implementation plan,similar to a state implementation plan,to carry out the clean air act requirements on tribal land.because tribes are not required to adopt tribal implementation plans,the tribal authority rule authorizes the epa to promulgate a fip to fill in any gaps.
the panel held that the instant fip was not subject to the clean air act deadline to implement bart because the fip promulgated a better than bart alternative not bart.
under the regional haze regulations for a bart alternative,a state implementation plan must require that all necessary emission reductions take place during the period of the first strategy for regional haze.e iii.the panel held that the epa reasonably concluded that the tribal authority rule applied because the navajo nation had not submitted a tribal implementation plan,which gave the epa authority to promulgate a fip for nitrogen oxides emissions at the station.the panel further held that the epa reasonably interpreted the tribal authority rule,e,a,and the regional haze regulations to conclude that the emission reductions in e iii did not apply to fips for regional haze that are promulgated in place of tribal implementation plans.
the panel held that it was reasonable for the epa to give the station an emission credit when evaluating if the bart alternative results in greater emission reductions,e,than bart.the panel deferred to the epa reasonable determination that the fip alternative was better than bart for nitrous oxide emissions.
the panel held that it was a reasonable exercise of the epa discretion not to determine bart for particulate matter for the station.
owens,circuit judge 
petitioners vincent yazzie,several tribal conservation organizations,and certain environmental organizations collectively petitioners seek final review of the united states environmental protection agency epa federal implementation plan fip under the clean air act caa for the navajo generating station,a power plant on the navajo nation reservation in arizona we have jurisdiction over these petitions,b,and we deny them.
facts and procedural history 
a.the navajo generating station 
the navajo generating station station is the largest plant in the western united states,and emits nitrogen oxides nox that affect visibility at class i national parks and wilderness areas,including the grand canyon.the station powers a water distribution system that meets over of arizona water demands.fed.reg.coal from the kayenta mine,located on both navajo and hopi tribe lands,powers the station and employs many tribal members,and taxes and royalties from the coal are significant parts of the tribes revenues.id.at.under the proposed amended lease of the land from the navajo nation to the of the station,the station would operate until,when it would cease conventional generation of electricity.fed.reg,fed.reg.after,the navajo nation has the option to continue the station as a new source that generates electricity without coal.fed.reg.at.several entities,including four utilities the salt river project,arizona public service,nv energy,and tucson electric power,and the department of interior through the bureau of reclamation,the station.id.at.the utilities operate the station terms of the lease bar the navajo nation from controlling or regulating the operation of the station.see salt river project agric.improvement power dist.lee,cir.
b.the clean air act visibility protections 
the amendments to the caa expanded the caa focus to include regional haze,which is visibility impairment that is caused by the emission of air pollutants from numerous sources located over a wide geographic area.see also.emissions of fine particles such as sulfates,nitrates,and other particulate matter and their precursors,nox produce regional haze.fed.reg,july.in and again in,the epa issued regional haze regulations,and guidelines.fed.reg,july.the regulations set a goal of achieving natural visibility by.d.
the caa invites each state to submit to epa a state implementation plan sip setting forth emission limits and other measures necessary to make reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal.parks conservation ass epa,cir.citing a,b.if a state elects not to submit a sip,or if the epa rejects a sip in part or in whole,the epa must generate a federal implementation plan fip to fill any resulting gaps.id.at citing c a.
regional haze sips must identify the best available retrofit technology bart to reduce emissions from certain major emission sources,like the station.b.bart is an emission limitation based on the degree of reduction achievable through the application of the best system of continuous emission reduction for each pollutant which is emitted by an existing stationary facility.five factors dictate bart for a particular source of regional haze any source subject to bart must install and operate the appropriate technology as expeditiously as practicable but in no event later than five years after approval of a sip or issuance of a fip.g.
a state can bypass bart with a better than bart alternative.see arizona,at see also e.for a state to adopt a bart alternative,its sip must require that all necessary emission reductions take place during the period of the first strategy for regional haze.e iii.in one of three ways,a state can demonstrate through greater reasonable progress i f the distribution of emissions is not substantially different than under bart,and the alternative measure results in greater emission reductions i f the distribution of emissions is significantly different,then a state must conduct dispersion modeling,which focuses on visibility rather than emissions or the otherwise based on the clear weight of the evidence.e i e,e.
tribal authority rule 
the caa amendments authorized the epa to treat indian tribes as states if certain conditions were met,and to issue regulations outlining when that treatment should occur.d a.the amendments also permitted the epa to directly administer haze reduction efforts on tribal lands if it determine d that the treatment of indian tribes as identical to states is inappropriate or administratively infeasible.id.d.
in,the epa issued its tribal authority rule tar,which created a mechanism for tribes to develop a tribal implementation plan tip,similar to a sip,to carry out the caa requirements on tribal land.fed.reg.the tar treats eligible tribes in the same manner as states with respect to all provisions of the clean air act and implementing regulations,except for mandatory plan submittal deadlines.see also id.tribes may choose,but are not required,to adopt tips for their reservations.because tribes are not required to adopt tips,the tar authorizes epa to promulgate fips to fill in any gaps.pub.serv.epa,cir.aps.when a tribe chooses not to issue a tip,the epa must promulgate without unreasonable delay such federal implementation plan provisions as are necessary or appropriate to protect air quality.a.
the tar also exempted tribes from certain caa requirements because states were farther along in developing air planning and implementation expertise.fed.reg.at.for example,the tar permits the epa more time to promulgate a fip for a tribe than for a state,and exempts tribes from specific visibility implementation plan submittal deadlines established under section of the act.e.
d.the station and its fip 
the epa initial proposal 
the navajo nation did not issue a tip for the station,so in february the epa issued a proposed fip under the tar.relevant here,the fip proposed both a bart determination and a bart alternative.under the bart determination,the station would reduce its nox emissions by nearly within five years after the effective date of a final fip,largely through the installation of both catalytic reduction and low nox air technologies.fed.reg.at.under its bart alternative determination,the fip extended the deadlines for achieving nox emission reductions to.id.at.it also gave an emission credit for the station early and voluntary installation of the low nox air technology.id.
the epa proposed these alternatives so that the station had options for flexibility in achieving emissions reductions required under the proposed bart determination.id.at.flexibility was necessary,the epa concluded,because of the important economic and water issues tied to the future of the station.id.at.
the epa supplemental proposal 
after receiving feedback from the technical work group twg during the comment period,the epa issued its supplemental proposal in october.fed.reg.at.under this revised plan,the station would cease conventional power generation by the end of.id.at.the plan would impose a lifetime cap on total nox emissions from to,reduce power generation at the station,and would incorporate an emission credit for the station early installation of the low nox air technology.id.at.the epa concluded that this revised plan qualified as a better than bart alternative.id.at.
the epa final rule and challenges 
in august,the epa issued its final rule,which tracked its october supplemental proposal.fed.reg.at.it finalized the longer deadline for emission reductions,as well as the emission credit.id.at.the epa reiterated that a more flexible,extended compliance schedule was warranted due to the station unusual and significant challenges and the epa discretion under the tar id.at.petitions challenging this final rule were filed timely,and consolidated.
ii.standard of review 
under the administrative procedures act apa,we uphold a final agency action unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.the standard is highly deferential,presuming the agency action to be valid and affirming the agency action if a reasonable basis exists for its decision.bahr epa,cir.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
further,agency interpretations of statutes and regulations may be entitled to deference.an agency interpretation of a statute it administers is governed under the framework established in chevron,natural resources defense council.the first step investigates whether congress has addressed the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at citation omitted.under the second step,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
in addition,an agency interpretation of its own regulation is controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer robbins.when faced with ambiguous regulatory language,we defer to the epa interpretation if it is reasonable,if it sensibly conforms to the purpose and wording of the regulations.el comite para el bienestar de earlimart epa,cir.citation omitted.
petitioners argue that the epa interpretation of the caa and its implementing regulations should not be afforded deference here because the government has a financial interest in the station via the department of the interior nearly ownership stake in the station and the epa along with the department of interior and the department of energy issued a joint statement in january in which petitioners contend the epa essentially agreed to minimize negative impacts on government ownership interests.we disagree.
the federal government partial ownership of the station does not weigh against affording deference to the epa interpretation of the caa and its implementing regulations.importantly,here the epa does not have any or financial interest in the station continued operation.amalgamated sugar.llc vilsack,cir.holding that chevron deference was inappropriate where the agency itself,rather than the government in general,had a financial interest in a particular statutory interpretation.
further,the joint statement does not demonstrate that the epa interpretation was intended to protect the government ownership interest in the station.rather,petitioners take phrases from the joint statement out of context,and overlook that the statement also provided that it does not alter the authorities and responsibilities of the various federal agencies overseeing the station,including the epa clean air act regulatory role relating to air quality and visibility in the region,which includes promulgating best available retrofit technology bart requirements for the station.
accordingly,the federal government partial ownership of the station does not eliminate any deference to the epa interpretation of the caa and its implementing regulations.
applicability of emission reduction deadlines to instant.statutory deadline to implement bart 
under the caa,bart must be implemented as expeditiously as practicable but in no event later than five years after a sip approval or the promulgation of a fip.b a,g.petitioners contend that the epa failed to comply with this statutory deadline.
however,the caa deadline does not apply here.by its terms,this statutory deadline only applies to bart,and here,the fip promulgated a better than bart alternative not bart.therefore,the instant fip is not subject to the caa deadline to implement bart.
regulatory deadline to implement bart alternative 
under the regional haze regulations,for a bart alternative,a sip must require that all necessary emission reductions take place during the period of the first strategy for regional haze.e iii.the parties dispute whether this regulatory deadline applies to the instant fip promulgated in place of a tribal implementation plan under the tar,rather than under a state implementation plan.
applicability of tar to the station 
as a preliminary matter,petitioners contend that the epa could not issue the fip under the tar because the navajo nation contracted away its right to regulate the station and,therefore,it was not a tribe eligible for treatment as a state and could not issue a tip 
the caa authorizes the epa to treat indian tribes as states.d a.but the epa may treat indian tribes as states only if the tribe meets certain requirements,including if the indian tribe is reasonably expected to be capable,in the judgment of the epa,of carrying out the functions to be exercised in a manner consistent with the terms and purposes of this chapter and all applicable regulations.id.d c see also d.further,i n any case in which the epa determines that the treatment of indian tribes as identical to states is inappropriate or administratively infeasible,the epa may provide,by regulation,other means by which the epa will directly administer such provisions so as to achieve the appropriate purpose.d.
pursuant to this statutory authority,the epa issued the tar,a.this section provides that the epa shall promulgate such federal implementation plan provisions as are necessary or appropriate to protect air quality if a tribe does not submit a tribal implementation plan meeting the completeness criteria or does not receive epa approval of a submitted tribal implementation plan.a.
petitioners argue that a only applies when a tribe eligible for treatment as a state fails to submit an approved tip,and here the navajo nation was not eligible for treatment as a state because it had contracted away its power to regulate the station.
however,a by its plain terms is not limited to eligible tribes who can be treated as a state.rather,it applies so long as a tribe does not submit an approved tip it mentions nothing about a tribe eligibility.a.moreover,the caa,d,authorizes the epa to adopt a fip when a tribe is not treated as a state,i n any case in which the epa determines that the treatment of indian tribes as identical to states is inappropriate or administratively infeasible.thus,the epa authority to promulgate a fip for tribal areas under the tar is not dependent on a tribe eligibility for treatment as a state.
in sum,the epa reasonably concluded that the tar applied because the navajo nation had not submitted a tip,which under a,gave the epa authority to promulgate a fip for nox emissions at the station.see auer,at an agency interpretation of its own regulation is controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation see also chevron,at setting forth standard for deferring to agency statutory interpretation.
applicability of section e iii to the fip 
under e iii,if a state implements a bart alternative,its sip must require that all necessary emission reductions take place during the period of the first strategy for regional haze.e iii.the parties dispute whether the fip for the station is subject to this deadline we conclude that the epa reasonably determined that it is not.
the epa contends that e iii deadline only applies when a state adopts a bart alternative.it reasons that the deadline is explicitly tied to the period of the first strategy for regional haze,for which states were required to submit a plan by december,but which tribes were not subject to under the tar.see e exempting tribes from s pecific visibility implementation plan submittal deadlines established under section of the act.we can not say that the epa interpretation of its own regulation that e iii does not apply to tribes because tribes are not subject to the underlying deadline for strategies is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer,at.
the epa contends that the tar entitled it to establish different necessary or appropriate deadlines for the fip.a providing that the epa shall promulgate such federal implementation plan provisions as are necessary or appropriate to protect air quality where a tribe fails to submit an approved tip see also fed.reg.at fed.reg.at.
petitioners argue that the epa interpretation is contrary to the plain language and purpose of the caa and its implementing regulations.they assert that any flexibility under the tar applies only to procedural,not substantive,requirements of the caa,or that it only applies to submission deadlines,not compliance deadlines.see e exempting tribes from s pecific visibility implementation plan submittal deadlines established under section of the act emphasis added fed.reg.at tribes are not subject to the deadlines for submitting visibility implementation plans and may use a modular approach to caa implementation.emphasis added.accordingly,petitioners contend that the tar does not exempt tribal sources from meeting the substantive pollution reduction requirements for a bart alternative under the caa,which purportedly includes e iii compliance deadline.
the tenth circuit decision in aps is instructive.in aps,the court rejected the environmentalists argument that a fip promulgated in place of a tip for the four corners power plant on the navajo nation reservation in new mexico was arbitrary and capricious because the fip did not satisfy the sip completeness criteria.at.the court reasoned that the tar provides the epa discretion to determine what rulemaking is necessary or appropriate to protect air quality and requires the epa to promulgate such rulemaking.nothing in a requires the epa as opposed to a tribe to submit a plan meeting the completeness criteria.id.at.the court thus deferred to the epa interpretation of the tar because it was not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,and denied the environmentalists petition.id.citation omitted.
importantly,aps did not hold that the tar only excused tribes from meeting procedural requirements.rather,the court also rejected the environmentalists more substantive argument that the tar requires the epa to implement a more stringent federal plan.id.at emphasis in original.
as recognized by aps,the tar grants the epa wide discretion to determine what rulemaking is required to protect air quality on tribal lands.nothing in the tar requires the fip to comply with the regional haze deadline applicable to a sip under e iii.
petitioners also argue that the instant fip is inconsistent with a four corners fip that,like here,concerned regional haze and nox emissions the four corners fip bart alternative complied with e iii requirement that all necessary emission reductions take place during the period of the first strategy for regional haze.fed.reg,august.however,the fact that the four corners fip complied with the regulatory deadline does not establish that the tar as a rule requires a fip to comply with this deadline.given that the four corners fip had a longer timeframe to comply with the regulatory deadline it was promulgated in rather than in like the instant fip the epa could have simply exercised its discretion to determine that it was not necessary or appropriate to consider whether the four corners bart alternative required an extended deadline under a.
in sum,the epa reasonably interpreted the tar e,a and the regional haze regulations e iii to conclude that the emission reductions deadline in e iii does not apply to fips for regional haze that are promulgated in place of tips.we must defer to this interpretation because it is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer,at.
epa determination that the fip alternative is better than bart for nox emissions 
petitioners next challenge the epa determination that the fip alternative is better than bart,that it will achieve greater reasonable progress than would have resulted from the installation and operation of bart.e i.under the regional haze regulations,there are three different methods to show that an alternative will result in greater reasonable progress i f the distribution of emissions is not substantially different than under bart,and the alternative measure results in greater emission reductions,id.e if the distribution of emissions is significantly different,dispersion modeling must be conducted,which focuses on visibility rather than emissions,or otherwise based on the clear weight of the evidence,id.e i e.
here,epa relied on the first method that the distribution of emissions is not substantially different under bart and the alternative and the alternative results in greater emission reductions.id.e see also fed.reg.at.
clear weight of the evidence standard inapplicable here 
as a preliminary matter,petitioners argue that the epa failed to show by the clear weight of the evidence that its alternative achieves greater reasonable progress than bart.petitioners also fault the epa for not conducting visibility modeling for its bart alternative.
as described above,there are three separate methods to establish that an alternative is better than bart.see fed.reg,revision to bart guidelines stating that the weight of evidence approach is an alternative to the methodology set forth in section e emphasis added wildearth guardians epa,cir.concluding that a state can use the two quantitative methods stated in e or apply a qualitative standard the clear weight of evidence emphasis added.the clear weight of the evidence standard only applies to the third method.e i.here,the epa chose the first method,which does not incorporate the clear weight of the evidence standard.id.e.similarly,the epa was not required to conduct visibility modeling,as that is only required under the second method.id.
therefore,under its chosen method,the epa was only required to show that the distribution of emissions is not substantially different under bart
