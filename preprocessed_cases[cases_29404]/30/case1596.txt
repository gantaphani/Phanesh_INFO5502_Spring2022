the department of the air force air force terminated a contract between empire energy management systems,empire and the air force for default.the armed services board of contract appeals board sustained the air force default termination.empire energy mgmt,asbca,bca p,wl.we affirm.
background 
on june,empire and the air force entered into a contract under which empire was to provide cogen of electricity,chilled water,hot water,and steam to macdill air force base macdill for a lengthy period of time concluding on october.the air force did not agree to pay for the construction of the plant empire was required to furnish all plant,labor,equipment,and engineering and perform all operations necessary to furnish,install,own,operate and maintain a cogeneration plant at its own expense.id.at.instead,the air force contracted only to pay for the utility services provided by the cogen plant,at a discount from the market price.the contract specified a commercial operation date cod by which empire was required to have completed commercial operations acceptance tests successfully and to have substantially completed construction of the cogen plant.the contract also required empire to comply with all federal,state and local environmental and archeological laws and regulations.id.the contract contained several standard contract clauses from the federal acquisition regulations far,including the standard far default clause,far 
on june,the air force and empire entered into modification of the contract,which obligated empire to construct two cogen plants at macdill,rather than the original single plant.in modification,the air force agreed to lease the site to be used for the purpose of constructing and operating the second cogen plant the cogen site to empire for only nominal consideration.the air force and empire subsequently agreed to build only the second cogen plant and to postpone the construction of the first cogen plant.the dispute in this case relates only to the construction of the second cogen plant 
the air force had previously used land adjacent to the cogen site for washing fuel bladders.to prevent the release of fuel to the surrounding land and storm drains,it had installed an separator,a device that uses gravity to separate oil and other petroleum products from water,based on their respective densities.nonetheless,because some petroleum products are,the separator could not completely eliminate potential pollutants from the water,which was discharged to a storm sewer.the separator and its discharge were subject to regulation by the united states environmental protection agency epa.after the cogen site was selected,empire requested information from the air force about the environmental conditions at both the cogen site and the site of the separator,which the air force provided.
shortly after groundbreaking at the cogen site on february,empire stopped work on the project because of a dispute with the company through which empire had arranged financing for the project.this work stoppage continued until may,when the parties executed modification mod and a novation agreement.among other provisions,mod contained a release of all claims that arose from facts and circumstances that existed prior to mod,with an exception not pertinent here.mod also provided a new completion schedule for the cogen site and a facility charge to be paid monthly by the air force after cod.may,the date mod was executed,was the starting date for performance of the completion schedule,and the cod was set at days from that start date.empire energy,cch at.although the cod was set at days from the starting date,or february,the air force agreed not to terminate the contract for default within days of the starting date,or days after the cod thus,mod set august,as the first date on which the air force could terminate the contract for default the termination date.mod further provided that the air force was required to provide a cure notice allowing empire at least ten days to cure any default other than the failure to achieve the cod.
pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra,pub,stat.codified as amended at,the epa regulates owners and operators of facilities that generate,transport,treat,store,or dispose of hazardous materials.the epa primary regulation of treatment,storage,and disposal facilities is through the rcra permitting system.owners and operators of such facilities must have a rcra permit for the facility treatment,storage,or disposal of hazardous waste is prohibited without a permit.b c see also a.a rcra permit allows the operation of a facility for treatment,storage,or disposal and outlines the precautions and corrective actions that the operator must take to protect the environment.
during the work stoppage,the epa notified the air force on august,that it had issued the corrective action portion of a permit for macdill pursuant to rcra the permit required the air force to conduct a rcra facility investigation rfi with respect to several solid waste management units swmu located throughout macdill,including the separator near the cogen site.although the boundaries of the separator swmu are disputed,the board found that for purposes of the rfi the separator and an area three to five feet around it was the swmu.empire energy,cch at.thus,the swmu encompassed only a small portion of the cogen site the permit also provided that the air force shall give notice to the regional administrator as soon as possible of any planned physical alterations or additions to the permitted facility.united states environmental protection agency,permit no.fld,portion of the rcra permit epa permit,at.
on may,shortly after it had started working again in response to mod,empire investigated the storm sewer near the separator,where it allegedly discovered contaminants.empire stopped working and requested a stop work order from the air force on may,stating that empire has just become aware that it is being prevented from proceeding with performance by the presence of an unknown quantity of an environmentally hazardous substance on the project site,allegedly left by the separator.app.at.the contracting officer,judith hall,denied empire request for a stop work order on may.empire did not learn of the rfi until june.
the air force subsequently hired dames moore,an environmental contractor,to investigate the soil conditions at the site.between july and july,dames moore took samples throughout the cogen site and tested for organic vapors.dames moore reported 
the results of the investigation in this report indicate that further site assessment is not required by state or federal rules or regulations.
the site investigation confirmed compliance with all applicable federal,state and local environmental laws and regulations and that the site is suitable to complete construction of the cogen facility.
app.at.on august,the dames moore report was provided to empire.
on september,air force officials met with an epa representative and provided the dames moore report to the epa.the board found that this meeting also constituted notice to the epa,in accordance with the permit,that the air force intended to change the rcra site.on december,elizabeth wilde,the epa representative at macdill,stated in a letter that,b ased on the dames and moore report,it appears that the cogen site does not warrant further investigation.therefore this area does not need to be addressed under the rcra facility investigation.empire energy,cch at quoting letter of december,by wilde.the air force provided this letter to empire on january,and directed empire to return to work.however,in a letter dated march,the epa appeared to contradict the december,letter,by suggesting that the cogen site still required investigation under the rfi.in light of empire refusal to work on portions of the cogen site,the air force apparently requested an even more definite statement from the epa.the epa responded in a letter on june,stating that it did not object to the construction activities planned near the separator swmu and that it did not believe that any such activities would interfere with the rfi the letter was also provided to empire on that date.
during the work stoppage from may,to may,empire repeatedly refused the air force demands that it return to work on the cogen site.the air force issued a cure notice on april.the cure notice stated 
i have repeatedly directed you to resume construction of the macdill avenue cogeneration facility.therefore,since no reasonable impediments exist to prohibit your construction efforts,your continued refusal at this point must be viewed as a condition which endangers the successful completion of the macdill avenue cogeneration facility in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.i request you advise this office in writing no later than may,of your intentions with regard to the resumption of construction of the macdill avenue cogeneration facility otherwise,the government may terminate subject contract for default under the terms and conditions of the default clause far and part i,section h,paragraph,additional default provisions,of the contract.
app.at emphases added.empire responded to the cure notice on may,asserting that it had continued performance of the contract by continuing its investigation into the cogen site environmental status and that a fast track construction schedule would enable empire to achieve the macdill avenue commercial operation date on or before august.app.at.
empire resumed work at the cogen site on may,but it remained substantially behind schedule.empire requested a schedule extension,which the air force refused.on august,the termination date set by mod,empire sent a letter to the air force stating that it ha d been led to believe that the government intends to terminate the contract for default and presenting reasons why such an action by the contracting officer would be unmerited.app.at.the letter stated that empire is presently performing on schedule and should reach the commercial operation date by of this year.id.at.the contracting officer terminated the contract for default on september,stating that empire had failed to meet the termination date of august,which has never been altered.id.at.
empire appealed the contracting officer decision to the board,seeking to recover its costs of more than.after a lengthy factual hearing,the board found that empire was entitled to days of excusable delay,postponing the termination date until october.empire energy,cch at.therefore,it held that the contracting officer had been incorrect in terminating the contract on the ground that the termination date had passed on august.id.at.nevertheless,the board held that the contracting officer had properly terminated empire for default based on empire failure to make progress.the board found that,based on empire progress to only completion as of the government termination,empire would have required days to complete the project.id.at.the board further found that there was no reasonable likelihood empire could have met cod with a day extension and that the contracting officer had a reasonable basis for default termination of the contract on september.id.
the board also rejected empire claims that it had been justified in refusing to work on the site because of environmental concerns.first,the board found that construction work could have been done on site without interfering with the rfi work and that construction could have proceeded without violating the permit.id.at.the board also noted we have found that empire could have proceeded safely,and that it never reached the point where the rcra investigation prevented it from proceeding.id.at see also id.at empire had sufficient knowledge that it could have proceeded safely and empire never reached a point where it could not proceed because of the rcra investigation.citation omitted.
second,the board found that the site was not in fact environmentally contaminated and that empire alleged concerns were unsubstantiated w e find there was no proof of actionable contamination matter that violated the environmental laws and regulations of the united states or florida or separator malfunction.id.similarly,the board found 
there is no evidence of any remediation at or near the cogen site,no proof of actionable contamination and macdill was never cited by epa for violations of any kind at the cogen site thus,we can not find that the effluent from the separator contained actionable contamination,matter that violated the environmental laws and regulations of the united states or florida.
third,and finally,the board found that empire did not in fact have genuine environmental concerns.the board noted that the air force concerns that empire was trying to create a paper trail to support a claim were credible,id.at,and that empire welcomed the prospect of a delay and the attendant claim,id.at.in addition,the board stated we simply do not believe empire on the contamination issue,id.at,and w e conclude it was posturing when it stopped work,id.at.the board concluded that it was not persuaded that empire ran the risk of criminal liability by continuing work at the site,id.at,and that empire professed concern about civil liability or being held accountable for a regulatory violation that is,a violation where there is no actual contamination without epa approval does not ring true,id.at.
the board also addressed and rejected additional arguments by empire,holding that the air force had provided the required cure notice,both because mod did not require a notice for failure to achieve cod and because the april,cure notice was sufficient in any event.id.at.the board also held that the air force did not waive the right to terminate the contract for default by encouraging empire to complete the project before the termination date.
the board entered final judgment against empire on november.empire timely appealed on march.see g a.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review the board decisions on questions of law without deference,but the board decision on any question of fact shall be final and conclusive and shall not be set aside unless the decision is fraudulent,or arbitrary,or capricious,or so grossly erroneous as to necessarily imply bad faith,or if such decision is not supported by substantial evidence.b.
empire challenges the default termination on a number of grounds.the first,and most strenuously asserted,is that it would have been flatly unlawful for empire to have commenced work before the air force notified epa of the construction activity and the epa approved the work.br.for appellant at.we can not agree.
an understanding of empire arguments requires an initial description of the terms of the applicable epa requirements.under rcra,the epa is authorized and directed to denominate the criteria for identifying hazardous waste and to list particular hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of rcra.a b.these criteria and lists are codified in part of title of the code of federal regulations.those who treat,store,or dispose of hazardous waste must comply with and the regulations the epa has promulgated pursuant to that statute,which are codified in parts of title of the code of federal regulations.
in this case,the epa designated macdill as a hazardous waste facility.owners and operators of such facilities may not treat,store,or dispose of hazardous waste until they have applied for or received from the epa a rcra permit,which governs further activity on the site.see pt.here,the epa issued a permit for macdill on august,which required the air force to conduct an rfi of four separator units,including one near the site of empire cogen facility.epa permit appendix,at.as noted above,the parties and the board agree that the cogen site encompassed at least a portion of the swmu.
empire notes correctly that the permit also required notification to the epa before any work on the site was undertaken.the permit provided that t he permittee shall give notice to the regional administrator as soon as possible of any planned physical alterations or additions to the permitted facility.epa permit at see also k.it is also undisputed that the air force did not give such notice until at least september,when the air force met with the epa and notified it of the report by dames moore,which the air force had hired to investigate soil conditions at the site.the board found that this meeting constituted notice to the epa that the air force intended to alter the site.empire energy,cch at.
empire argues that it was barred from working on the site between june,the date it learned of the rfi,and at least september.to justify its refusal to continue work on the site,empire relies upon a threat of an epa enforcement action against it pursuant to,the rcra provision authorizing federal enforcement of rcra violations.that statute provides for criminal penalties for a ny person who knowingly treats,stores,or disposes of any hazardous waste identified or listed under this subchapter in knowing violation of any material condition or requirement of a rcra permit.d b.it also provides for a civil penalty of up to per day.id.g.the government argues that the notification obligation was upon the air force,not empire,and that empire has failed to establish that it would have incurred liability if work began before the notification was given.the government argues that only the permittee has a duty to comply with the permit 
the permittee shall comply with all conditions of this permit,except to the extent and for the duration such noncompliance is authorized by an emergency permit.any permit noncompliance,other than noncompliance authorized by an emergency permit,constitutes a violation of rcra and is grounds for enforcement action,permit termination,revocation and reissuance,modification,or denial of a permit renewal application.
epa permit at emphasis added see also a.indeed,the epa permitting authority extends only to each person owning or operating an existing facility or planning to construct a new facility for the treatment,storage,or disposal of hazardous waste.a emphasis added the government may be correct that empire was not bound to comply with the requirements of the permit.however,we need not decide whether empire could reasonably have been concerned that any of its actions would violate the permit notification provision.
even if empire were entitled to excusable delay for the period before epa notification,empire still would not have been able to complete the project in a timely fashion.the day excusable delay found by the board ran from july,the date that dames moore began testing,to september,fifteen days after the dames moore report was provided to empire on august.empire energy,cch at.the additional fifteen days allowed empire time to remobilize after the work stoppage.id.on the assumption that empire was excused from performing during the entire period from june,when it learned of the rfi,to september,because it was barred from work until the epa had been notified,empire would only be entitled to excusable delay for the days between june,and september,fifteen days after epa notification,extending the termination date until december.the board found that,when work on the project was stopped,empire was days from achieving cod that is,it would not have reached cod until february,id.therefore,empire still would have had nearly fifty days of unexcusable delay,justifying the air force termination.
empire seeks to overcome this problem by arguing that it was not required to resume work until june,the date of epa approval of construction activity on the cogen site near the separator swmu,giving it a total of days of excusable delay.in the alternative,empire contends that it is entitled to days of excusable delay,or until january,the date when empire was notified of the epa initial statement that the cogen site does not need to be addressed under the rcra facility investigation.id.at quoting letter of december,by wilde.such excusable delay would extend the termination date until august,or april,respectively.
while empire contention with respect to notification is at least arguably supported by some of the language of the permit,its argument concerning its asserted requirement of epa approval has no support whatsoever in the permit.the permit imposes sixteen duties and requirements,epa permit at,which are directed to guaranteeing that the epa remains informed about conditions at the site and planned changes to the site so it can ensure that it will remain able to conduct its investigation.the permit does not require epa approval for any particular action by the permitee,though.by its terms,the permit only requires that the permittee notify the epa of planned physical alterations,not that the epa specifically approve such alterations.empire cites no legal authority for the proposition that epa approval was required under the permit indeed,empire returned to work on may,before the approval was given.we reject empire claim that it was required to delay work until epa approval was granted.
at oral argument,empire presented yet another alternative theory.it argued that,even if epa approval was not required under the permit,empire could reasonably have insisted on it before beginning work.the contract required empire to comply with all federal,state and local environmental and archeological laws and regulations.empire energy,cch at.empire says that possible environmental problems had been identified at the site,including potential contamination of the soil,and that it was precluded from engaging in unlawful conduct in connection with the rfi.br.for appellant at.the environmental laws bar arrang ing for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances.a.pursuant to this statute,a disposal may occur when a party disperses contaminated soil during the course of grading and filling a construction site.redwing carriers,saraland apartments,cir see also kaiser aluminum chem.catellus dev,cir tanglewood homeowners,cir.under these circumstances,says empire,it could reasonably insist on epa approval before resuming work to avoid the risk of environmental liability.
empire is correct that a contractor may violate the environmental laws if it causes dispersal of contaminated soil,such as through grading and filling of a construction site.and a contractor might argue that it could reasonably insist on not working while awaiting epa approval if there were reasonable doubt as to whether work on the site would result in a significant violation of the environmental laws however,the environmental laws are complex the mere assertion of a colorable claim by the contractor later found to be meritless that its actions would violate some regulatory requirement does not excuse performance.nor would performance be excused by the mere existence of a regulatory investigation,particularly one inspired by the contractor itself.
here,the board found that empire could not have had,and did not in fact have,any reasonable environmental concerns that its action would create a material violation of environmental regulatory requirements,and that empire claimed environmental concerns were pretextual.first,the board found that construction work could have been done on site without interfering with the rfi work and that construction could have proceeded without violating the permit.empire energy,cch at.second,the board found that empire alleged concerns about environmental contamination of the site were unsubstantiated.id.at.finally,the board concluded that empire was posturing when it stopped work.id.at.these findings are supported by substantial evidence.a contractor has no basis to decline to proceed with work because the epa or other agencies have not yet approved the work if,in fact,the contractor has no reasonable basis for believing that the work would cause a material violation of law.that is the situation here.empire claimed environmental concerns and the lack of epa approval thus provided no basis for empire failure to perform 
empire next argues that time was not of the essence in this contract and that the air force could not have terminated the contract because of empire delays.however,the existence of a contract deadline itself establishes that time is of the essence.devito united states,time is of the essence in any contract containing fixed dates for performance.empire argues that,in this particular contract,time was not of the essence because of the unique nature of the contract,which placed the risk of failure entirely upon the contractor and its lender and shielded the government from any consequences resulting from the contractor failure to perform.br.for appellant at.thus,empire argues,any delay caused no harm to the air force.however,there is nothing in the contract itself to support this proposition.rather,the contract specified that failure to meet the cod was a condition of default.app.at.
nor does our case law offer support for empire argument that the liquidated damages provision in the contract militates against a finding that time is of the essence in this case.instead,our precedent is contrary to empire argument.in florida,department of insurance united states,we expressly permitted the government termination for default,even though the contract contained a liquidated damages provision and even though the government reminded the contractor that liquidated damages continued to accrue.id.at.similarly,our predecessor court upheld a termination for default where a liquidated damages clause existed and liquidated damages had been imposed.olson plumbing heating united states.indeed,olson held that the imposition of liquidated damages is evidence of the intent to hold the defaulting party liable for its delayed performance.id.
we conclude that time was of the essence in the contract.the air force could therefore terminate the contract for default as a result of empire failure to achieve cod by the termination date.
empire further argues that the air force waived its right to terminate for default for failure to meet cod because the contracting officer encouraged empire to complete the project,even after she knew that cod could not be achieved by the termination date because empire had fallen so far behind schedule.br.for appellant at.in devito,we held that 
where the government elects to permit a delinquent contractor to continue performance past a due date,it surrenders its alternative and inconsistent right under the default clause to terminate,assuming the contractor has not abandoned performance and a reasonable time has expired for a termination notice to be given.this is popularly if inaccurately referred to as a waiver of the right to terminate the necessary elements of an election by the party to waive default in delivery under a contract are failure to terminate within a reasonable time after the default under circumstances indicating forbearance,and reliance by the contractor on the failure to terminate and continued performance by him under the contract,with the government knowledge and implied or express consent.
at quoting williston,a treatise on the law of contracts ed.
empire relies on several cases from the board that followed devito,including research,asbca,cch,wl,and composites horizons,asbca,cch,wl.in each of the cases empire relies upon,the government actions occurred after the date of default.here,the air force did not waive its right to terminate for default because the contracting officer never elected to allow empire to continue working past a date on which she believed the air force could have terminated the contract for default.any encouragement given by the contracting officer in this case occurred before august,the first date on which the contracting officer believed she could terminate the contract for default for failure to achieve the cod,and a date well before the october,termination date found by the board.such actions by the contracting officer to encourage completion of the work can not result in a waiver and are entirely permissible.nor did the contracting officer statement that,if the cogen plant was substantially complete by the termination date,she was willing to discuss an extension,empire energy,cch at,waive the government right to insist on continued performance.
empire also urges that termination for default was inappropriate because it never received a valid cure notice.the contract includes the standard far default clause,far,which permits the government to terminate for default only if the contractor does not cure its failure within days or more if authorized in writing by the contracting officer after receipt of the notice from the contracting officer specifying the failure.a.part i,section h,paragraph of mod provides additional default provisions,including the following 
with respect to any condition of default other than the failure to achieve the macdill avenue commercial operation date within the time specified,the contracting officer shall provide the contractor a cure notice providing a period of days for any longer time reasonably necessary to cure the condition of default,whichever is greater.
here,the air force issued a cure notice on april,but empire points out that the only condition of default specified in the cure notice was empire failure to begin work.the notice states 
i have repeatedly directed you to resume construction of the macdill avenue cogeneration facility.therefore,since no reasonable impediments exist to prohibit your construction efforts,your continued refusal at this point must be viewed as a condition which endangers the successful completion of the macdill avenue cogeneration facility in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.i request you advise this office in writing no later than may,of your intentions with regard to the resumption of construction of the macdill avenue cogeneration facility otherwise,the government may terminate subject contract for default under the terms and conditions of the default clause far and part i,section h,paragraph,additional default provisions,of the contract.
app.at.empire urges that,once it began work on may,the notice was no longer effective since the only default it identified was the failure to resume construction,and a new notice was required.that is not correct 
in halifax engineering,united states,we addressed and rejected a similar argument.in halifax,the contractor received a cure notice providing that failure to start performance on the specified date will be grounds for immediate termination for default.id.at.the contractor argued that the letter was legally inadequate because it fail ed to specify the defects that formed the basis for the default.id.at.however,we held that the notice was sufficient because it was apparent from the circumstances that the contractor had sufficient notice of the asserted defects.id.thus,under halifax,if the contractor has actual notice of the nature of the government concerns and its intention to terminate for default if those concerns are not rectified,default termination is permissible without a formal cure notice,at least so long as the contractor has previously received a formal,written cure notice directed to a related concern.see also am.marine upholstery united states,holding that a cure notice failure to specify the particular failure for which the government might terminate the contract did not render the notice defective because the contractor had sufficient notice of the government intent to terminate the contract for default.
in this case,empire received a formal,written cure notice showing that the air force primary concern was the successful completion of the macdill avenue cogeneration facility in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract,including the termination date.app.at.in addition,the contracting officer repeatedly stated that an extension of the termination date was unacceptable and that,at a minimum,empire had to substantially perform the contract by the termination date specified in the contract.empire energy,cch at.as late as august,the contracting officer reminded empire that it still ha d not cured the situation and still ha d not addressed our concerns.app.at.therefore,as in halifax,empire had sufficient notice of the asserted defects in its performance.at.the fact that the cure notice was directed more specifically at the resumption of construction does not require the air force to provide another formal cure notice simply because empire returned to work,but failed to achieve cod before the termination date.app.at.
finally,relying primarily on language in
