opinion of the court 
this case arises from a contribution action initiated by appellee,gould,under s of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act,s.appellants,alexandria scrap corporation,r r salvage company,lake erie recycling,and american scrap company,appeal from several district court orders in favor of gould.although appellants denied liability on several bases below,the sole issue they raise on appeal is whether the enactment of the superfund recycling equity act,stat.november,requires reversal of the judgments entered against them.we conclude that it does,and will,therefore,vacate the judgment of the district court,and remand the cause for further proceedings.
background facts 
from to,the marjol battery and equipment company operated a battery breaking,recycling facility in the borough of throop,lackawana county,pennsylvania.appellants,all scrap metal dealers,each sold spent batteries to marjol during the and for recycling.one appellant,alexandria scrap corporation,also sold,or soft lead to marjol.
the battery recycling process is referred to as breaking because it literally requires the recycler to break open the battery outer casing and remove its lead and other recyclable components.until the,the battery casings themselves,which were then made of hard rubber,were not recyclable.as a consequence,the casings were simply discarded,often contaminated with various amounts of residual lead and other toxic substances.each of the appellants,like all of marjol suppliers at the time,sold spent batteries to marjol manufactured with hard rubber casings.the vast majority,if not all,of such casings were eventually dumped into old mine shafts located on marjol property,or otherwise buried on site.
beginning in the late,battery manufacturers began producing batteries with casings made of polypropylene plastic rather than rubber.eventually,battery recyclers such as marjol found ways to recycle the plastic casings as well as other components from spent batteries.while trying to develop processes for recycling the plastic casings,however,marjol simply stockpiled innumerable,broken,plastic casings on its property.like their hard rubber predecessors,these plastic casings were contaminated with lead and other toxic substances,and marjol made virtually no effort to keep those substances from migrating through the environment.
as early as the,the pennsylvania department of environmental resources der began receiving complaints about emissions from the marjol site.there is no question that marjol operations contaminated both its own property and its neighbors.at the time,however,environmental law was largely undeveloped,and enforcement was generally lax.
on march,the der bureau of air pollution control entered an order requiring marjol to reduce emissions from its site to the point that no emissions would be detectable beyond its property line.marjol repeatedly violated that order,first by failing to install the necessary equipment,and then by rendering it ineffective because it had slowed the speed of battery processing.between and,the der issued a cease operations request that marjol refused,and several remedial orders that it generally ignored.
in early,gould,of ohio,agreed to acquire marjol.when the der learned of the planned acquisition,it conducted further investigations at the marjol site and ultimately issued an end of the line order.that order essentially required marjol to comply with the der remedial demands or cease operations.gould,which was generally aware of marjol history with the der,went ahead with the acquisition,and initiated measures to comply with the der remedial demands.ultimately,however,gould agreed to shut down the marjol site.
thereafter,the der advised gould that no further remediation of the marjol site would be required,and no further enforcement actions taken,unless operations resumed.gould performed various forms of maintenance and housekeeping at the marjol site,but otherwise generally conducted no activities there.later,the federal environmental protection agency epa initiated investigations of the marjol site,ultimately deter mining that hazardous substances had been released,and that there was an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health,welfare,or the environment.appellee br.at.
ii.procedural history 
in april,gould entered into a consent agreement and order with the epa under s a of cercla.that agreement required gould to conduct site stabilization activities relating to lead and other hazardous substances at and around the marjol site.in may,gould entered into a second consent order,this time with both the epa and the pennsylvania der.this second order under the resource conservation and recovery act,h,required gould to perform a facility investigation and corrective measure study at the marjol site.
in december,gould initiated a civil action seeking cost recovery from approximately potentially responsible parties prp pursuant to s a b of cercla,or,alternatively,contribution pursuant to s.the defendants moved for partial summary judgment,arguing that because gould was a responsible party who had entered into a consent agreement resolving its liability to the government,it was limited to asserting a contribution claim only.the district court agreed,and granted partial summary judgment in favor of the defendants.see gould,v.a m battery tire service.
the district court held a bench trial on the issue of allocating response costs among those defendants held liable to gould for contribution and held that gould should bear of the costs and that the defendants should bear the remaining gould,v.a m battery tire.the court then apportioned the defendants share according to the amount of waste each contributed to the marjol site.see id.
with the exception of the four appellants,gould eventually settled with all defendants.after appellants filed their notice of appeal,congress passed,and the president signed,the superfund recycling equity act.appellants are pursuing only their claim that this act shields them from contribution liability to gould.gould counters that the act does not apply to materials that contain components,that it does not apply retroactively to this case,and that if it does apply retroactively,it violates the fifth amendment due process guarantee.
iii.background law 
under cercla 
notwithstanding any other provision or rule of law,and subject only to the defenses set forth in subsection b of 
any person who by contract,agreement,or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person,shall be liable for 
a all costs of removal or remedial act ion incurred by the united states government or a state or an indian tribe not inconsistent with the national contingency plan 
b any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan 
c damages for injury to,destruction of,or loss of natural resources,including the reasonable costs of assessing such injury,destruction,or loss resulting from such a release and 
d the costs of any health assessment or health effects study carried out under i.
after failing to pass several earlier versions,congress passed,and on november,the president signed into law,the superfund recycling equity act,div.b,a,title vii,b,stat.november.the act,intended to clarify liability under cercla,provides that a person who meets certain specified criteria,and who arranged for recycling of a recyclable material shall not be liable under sections a and a of with respect to such material.a.the act defines a recyclable material to include,inter alia,spent,spent,and other spent batteries id.b.
in transactions involving spent batteries,the transaction 
shall be deemed to be arranging for recycling if the person who arranged for the transaction by selling recyclable material or otherwise arranging for the recycling of recyclable material can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that at the time of the transaction 
the person met the criteria set forth in c with respect to the spent batteries and 
a t he person was in compliance with applic
