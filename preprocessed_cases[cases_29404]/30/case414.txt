technologies,llc ep tech,an electronics manufacturer,filed for chapter bankruptcy in.the united states,on behalf of the environmental protection agency and the department of interior,filed a claim in the bankruptcy proceeding against ep tech under cercla the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act of.under cercla,the federal government may recover the cost of cleaning up hazardous waste from the parties responsible for its release.
over the objections of bank,the bankruptcy trustee,the bankruptcy court found ep tech liable for of costs and in estimated future costs for the of groundwater and soil contamination near a manufacturing plant in socorro,new mexico.bank appealed to the district court,which affirmed.
bank appeals to this court,arguing i ep tech is not liable under cercla for hazardous waste releases that occurred before ep tech acquired an interest in the socorro plant in ii even if ep tech is liable for the costs at the plant,genuine issues of material fact precluded the bankruptcy court from concluding that ep tech was responsible for contamination detected at a well located a mile and a half south of the plant and iii the bankruptcy court improperly excluded evidence at the hearing on estimating the future cost of cleaning up the hazardous substances.the bankruptcy court decision was legally correct,and it did not abuse its discretion by excluding evidence of future costs.we affirm.
ep tech and the socorro manufacturing plant 
ep tech was incorporated in.that year it acquired one of ep industries,ep internal divisions the technologies an assignment and assumption agreement.per this agreement,ep tech acquired a ll real property and all leasehold interests in real property used in connection with the business along with a ll written or oral contracts,agreements or other arrangements relating to the business.among these real property interests was a leasehold interest in highway,exit socorro,nm vacant plant.
as it turned out,the socorro manufacturing plant had a checkered past when it came to waste disposal.in,ep began manufacturing batteries,printed circuit boards,and cable connectors at the plant,located on about acres due north of socorro.the manufacturing process involved trichlorethylene or tce a cleaner that was discharged into floor drains connected to an onsite sewage lagoon.tce,according to the world health organization,is probably carcinogenic to humans,and has been designated a hazardous substance for purposes of cercla liability.
in the company stopped its manufacturing operation and deeded the property surrounding the plant back to the city which,from to,used a portion of the property as a municipal landfill.but in,the company leased part of the property back from the city and started to manufacture batteries at the socorro plant,a process that generated liquid and solid waste but,according to ep tech,not tce waste.the lease ended in,by which time the plant was no longer in use.
hazardous substances in the area 
in a well at the manufacturing plant,the eagle picher municipal well,tested positive for tce,and the nearby soil tested positive for lead.by tce was detected in the olson well a municipal well located of the socorro plant.in response,the epa and the new mexico environment department began investigating the contamination source.a investigation of the landfill concluded that it was not the contamination source.
despite the tce detected in both the olson well and at the plant,investigations in the and early did not find a link between the tce contamination at the olson well and the plant waste disposal practices.notably,in,the new mexico environment department conducted an expanded site inspection that involved sampling.wells at the plant and the olson well tested positive for tce,but the residential wells in between the two did not.the investigators reasoned 
whether the release to the olsen well can be attributed to the eagle picher facility is questionable because the olsen well is located miles from the eagle picher facility and because tce was not detected in the residential wells gonzalez and cotton located between the eagle picher facility and the olsen well.therefore,the release of tce and dce in the olsen well is not attributed to the sources at this time.if more information regarding the sources associated with the release in the olsen well is available in the future,attribution of the release shall be reevaluated.
but by the time the united states moved for partial summary judgment in late,a third party,under contract with the army corps,had completed two years of investigating contaminants around socorro.the study included drilling new monitoring wells and taking surface water and sediment samples from through.unlike the earlier investigations,this more recent round of tests detected tce in several private residential wells between the eagle picher municipal well and the olson well.it led to an april expanded site inspection and remedial investigation report concluding that tce in the socorro area can be attributable to the former eaglepicher facility this report stated that e xisting monitoring wells in the project area indicate that the groundwater gradient is to the south and that a groundwater plume containing chlorinated organic contaminants extends from the former eagle pitcher sic property to the olsen well,and t he tce and other chlorinated organic compound contamination of groundwater in the socorro area can be attributable to the former eagle picher facility based on the historic use and disposal of tce at the former eagle picher facility,the absence of tce up gradient of the facility,the hydrogeology of the socorro area,the lack of evidence for other tce sources,and the characteristics of chlorinated solvents.
in september,the epa issued a final rule placing the socorro site on its superfund national priorities list of hazardous waste sites designated for priority cleanup.the report describes a large plume of groundwater approximately two miles long and a wide that extends from the manufacturing plant to an area including the olson well.
ep bankruptcy and settlement agreement 
the bankruptcy at issue here is not the first for the ep businesses.and the socorro plant is not the only location where an ep entity released hazardous waste.thus,when ep filed for chapter bankruptcy in,the united states filed a claim for the epa costs incurred and to be incurred in the course of responding to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment from certain sites the united states and ep executed a settlement agreement in bankruptcy settlement agreement,which obligated ep and any successor or assign to be accountable for environmental liabilities at sites not including socorro and at a dditional s ites.the socorro site qualifies as an additional site because it was not listed as a liquidated site or a site under the bankruptcy settlement agreement.the agreement also specified that payment for environmental response costs at additional sites would be subject to the distribution terms of the bankruptcy reorganization amounted to a distribution rate of,or per for general unsecured creditors.
ep tech bankruptcy 
this appeal arises out of ep tech chapter bankruptcy,filed concurrently with that of its parent corporation,ep holdings.under the reorganization plan,the debtors assets were transferred to the ep custodial trust with bank as trustee.the united states filed a claim on behalf of the epa and the department of the interior against ep tech seeking to recover the costs for responding to the contamination in the area around the socorro manufacturing facility,including the olson well.bank objected on the ground that ep tech did not assume liability for hazardous waste releases that occurred before it was incorporated in.in,the bankruptcy court granted the epa motion for partial summary judgment as to ep tech liability for response costs,finding that ep tech assumed,under the agreement with ep,all of ep environmental liabilities relating to the socorro facility.the bankruptcy court further rejected ep tech argument that it was not liable for the contamination at the olson well under cercla.the epa established past costs of,which,at a rate of per the bankruptcy settlement agreement,amounts to.
the bankruptcy court held an estimation hearing on epa future response costs,which it found amounted to million,reduced to,or.ep tech appealed this finding to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court orders.ep tech now appeals.
when reviewing a bankruptcy court order on appeal from a decision of a district court,this court review s the bankruptcy court order directly and give s no deference to the district court decision.in re lee,cir.the bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error,and its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.id.
a.the bankruptcy court did not err in concluding that ep tech assumed its predecessor environmental liabilities 
the parties threshold disagreement is whether the agreement between ep and ep tech assigned to ep tech the liability for all hazardous substance disposal at the socorro manufacturing facility or only liability arising after the agreement execution.the bankruptcy court decided that ep tech expressly assumed all of ep environmental liabilities,including liability for additional sites like socorro under the bankruptcy settlement agreement with the epa.successor liability under cercla is determined by common law contract principles.mickowski worldwide,cir.under ohio law which the parties agree governs the agreement a buyer of corporate assets is not liable for the debts and obligations of the seller,flaugher cone auto.mach,ohio,unless it assumes such liability expressly or impliedly.id.at.
here,the language of the agreement and assignment undermines bank contention that ep tech assumed liabilities arising only after the date of execution.the second paragraph of the agreement states 
the assignor has agreed,among other things,to assign to the assignee all of the assignor right,title and interest in the properties,assets tangible or intangible and rights the contributed property of the assignor technologies division the business which are more particularly set forth on annex a hereto,and the assignee has agreed that it will accept such assignment and will assume all of the liabilities and obligations of the assignor with respect to the business collectively,the obligations 
emphasis added.the agreement further describes ep tech assumptions in the second numbered paragraph 
the assignee accepts such assignment,and assumes and agrees to perform,pay,discharge and comply with all of the covenants,conditions,agreements,terms,obligations and restrictions to be performed or complied with on the part of the assignor under or in connection with the business or the obligations arising from and after the date hereof,subject to the covenants,conditions,agreements,terms,obligations,restrictions and other provisions set forth in the contributed property and the obligations.
emphasis added.
bank focuses on the phrase,obligations arising from and after the date hereof to argue that ep tech assumed only liabilities.but this reading ignores ep tech express assumption of all of the liabilities and obligations of the assignor defined collectively as obligations.in the same sentence that ep tech agreed to assume obligations arising from and after the date hereof,obligations being a defined term it also agreed to perform,pay,discharge and comply with all the covenants,conditions,agreements,terms,obligations and restrictions to be performed or complied with on the part of the assignor under or in connection with the business emphasis added.the two clauses are separated by the disjunctive,or,meaning that the after the date hereof language is a separate source of liability from liability for ep obligations and agreements.indeed,liability under the settlement agreement is an obligation in connection with the business.
although the agreement is not a model of good draftsmanship,ep tech expressly and separately assumed all obligations and agreements in connection with the business which includes the bankruptcy settlement agreement.thus,the plain and unambiguous language of the agreement supports the bankruptcy court determination that the agreement transferred liabilities in connection with the business,including those that existed when the agreement was executed and those arising from and after the execution.we conclude therefore that ep tech assumed cercla liability that ep incurred as an owner or operator of a site at the time of the disposal of hazardous substances.see a.
size of facility and divisibility of harm 
cercla establishes strict liability for any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of.a.ep tech argues that even if it assumed ep liability for hazardous substances disposal at the manufacturing plant,it is not liable for response costs related to hazardous substances at the olson well.the company maintains that the olson well is a discrete site from the manufacturing plant and that a data gap in samples between the plant and the olson well leaves open the question of whether there is a single continuous subterranean plume extending from the plant to the olson well.this argument requires us to consider whether the contamination at the olson well is distinct from the contamination at the manufacturing plant,or whether the contamination can be reasonably apportioned between ep tech and another party.
although cercla imposes joint and several liability on owners and operators of facilities that release hazardous waste,united states twp.of brighton brighton,cir,a party may attempt to limit its cercla liability by raising a argument that the cleanup costs at a single cercla facility should be divided between it and another responsible party.id.at the phrase divisible environmental harm describes circumstances where cercla liability may be apportioned among responsible parties if a potentially responsible party proves that a there are distinct harms,or b there is a reasonable basis for determining the contribution of each cause to a single harm.id.at.the ultimate burden of proving divisibility is on the party invoking the doctrine.united states meyer,cir.
although other courts have described the divisibility determination as a question of law subject to de novo review,in re bell petroleum services,cir,this court has curiously described the inquiry as a question of causation,brighton.at,subject to reversal only if the determination is clearly erroneous,even when reached at the summary judgment stage.meyer,at.notwithstanding brighton and meyer,we are mindful that here,in reviewing a decision reached at the summary judgment stage,our task is to determine whether genuine issues of material fact preclude a ruling on the merits.see.scrap recyclers ass bredesen,cir.
rees report was not properly before the bankruptcy court when it ruled on the partial summary judgment motion.
bank argues that the bankruptcy court prematurely decided that the environmental harm near socorro was not divisible.as a threshold matter,we must determine the scope of the record before the bankruptcy court when it ruled on the united states motion for partial summary judgment on liability.we do so because our role is to review the case presented rather than a better case fashioned after an unfavorable order.see barner pilkington,cir.
bank argues that a report prepared by todd six days after the parties fully briefed the partial summary judgment motion,but six days before the bankruptcy court ruled on the part of the record when the bankruptcy court ruled and should have been considered in connection with the liability determination.as the bankruptcy court explained,however,it did not consider the rees report because it believed the motion to be fully briefed as of january,per the agreed scheduling order.consistent with this schedule,bank made no reference to the rees report in its brief responding to summary judgment,nor did it otherwise notify the bankruptcy court that the report was relevant to its opposition to summary judgment.the bankruptcy court therefore properly limited
