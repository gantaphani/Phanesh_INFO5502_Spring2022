in this case portland and new york city challenge an environmental protection agency rule regulating microbial contaminants in drinking water.the rule requires the two cities to take several steps to eliminate the parasite cryptosporidium from their drinking water.the cities challenge the rule on many grounds,arguing that epa improperly conducted a required analysis,provided inadequate notice and opportunity for public comment,ignored significant comments on the draft rule,failed to use the best available science,and issued a final rule unsupported by the record.because we find the cities arguments either meritless,irrelevant,or both,we deny the petition for review.
cryptosporidium is a parasite found in human and animal feces.when ingested,it can cause cryptosporidiosis,which generally leads to mild symptoms,but can be deadly in children,the elderly,and those with weak immune systems,aids patients.from to,the united states experienced ten reported cryptosporidiosis outbreaks linked to drinking water.by far the most serious outbreak occurred in milwaukee,wisconsin,in,killing more than fifty people and sickening hundreds of thousands of others.see national primary drinking water regulations long term enhanced surface water treatment rule final rule,to be codified at pts.
most cities try to protect against cryptosporidium by running their source water the river or lake from which they draw filters.new york and portland,however,are two of the rare large cities that do not filter their water before it reaches consumers.instead,the two cities seek to protect public health by carefully controlling the sources from which their water originates.in particular,they have taken steps to ensure that their watersheds are entirely to human activity and domestic animals.thus,wild animals represent the only likely cause of cryptosporidium in their source waters.
portland and new york are also unusual in that they use uncovered reservoirs,rather than covered reservoirs,to store their finished water water that goes directly to consumers without further treatment.the cities say they have gone to great lengths to protect their reservoirs from sources of cryptosporidium.though located in urban areas,the reservoirs were carefully constructed to prevent runoff from draining into them,fences and security exclude people and animals from them,and overhead wires in new york but not portland discourage flocks of birds from landing on them.according to epa,however,cryptosporidium can still enter these reservoirs via bird droppings,small animals able to penetrate the fences,and intentional human contamination.
the safe drinking water act sdwa,to,requires epa to protect the public from cryptosporidium and other drinking water contaminants.because the sdwa was the basis for the rule challenged in this case,we describe the act basic provisions before turning to the details of the rule at issue here.
the sdwa regulates public water systems by limiting the allowable level of contaminants in such systems.it requires epa to set a maximum contaminant level goal mclg for each identified contaminant at a level at which no known adverse health consequences will occur.id.b a.it then requires epa to set a maximum contaminant level mcl for each contaminant as close to the mclg as is feasible.id.b b.under the statute,feasible means feasible with the use of the best technology,treatment techniques and other means which the administrator finds are available taking cost into consideration.id.b d.if epa determines that ascertaining the level of a contaminant will be either economically or technologically example,because no adequate testing procedure agency can require a certain treatment technique instead of an mcl.id.b a.treatment techniques must prevent known or anticipated adverse effects on the health of persons to the extent feasible.id.
based on these requirements,epa convened a large group of stakeholders in to develop rules to combat microbial contamination in drinking water,including cryptosporidium.the group issued its recommendations in two stages.acting on the first set of recommendations,epa issued a rule that did four things relevant to the issue we face here it established an mclg of zero for cryptosporidium,meaning there is no safe level of cryptosporidium in drinking water it imposed treatment techniques,rather than an mcl,to control cryptosporidium,because epa had earlier concluded that it would be infeasible to measure cryptosporidium at the low levels at which the parasite can threaten human health it required that all finished water reservoirs built after the rule issuance have covers and it required systems that filter their water to treat it for cryptosporidium.see national primary drinking water regulations interim enhanced surface water treatment,codified at pts.the rule also warned that epa was considering requiring that all existing finished water reservoirs be covered,but explained that the agency needed more time to analyze the issue.id.at.
acting on the basis of the stakeholders second set of recommendations,epa issued a proposed rule that did three things it required all water systems to monitor their source water for cryptosporidium it required systems that do not filter their water,such as new york and portland,to treat their source water for cryptosporidium and it imposed new requirements on existing uncovered reservoirs,giving cities with such reservoirs three options covering their reservoirs,treating the water in them for viruses but not cryptosporidium,or implementing a risk mitigation plan.see national primary drinking water regulations long term enhanced surface water treatment rule proposed rule,proposed,to be codified at pts.unlike most cities,portland and new york were affected by all three aspects of this rule because they had uncovered reservoirs and provided unfiltered water.
the final rule,which epa issued in,was identical to the proposed rule except for two key differences.first,the final rule eliminated the risk mitigation option,forcing cities with uncovered reservoirs to cover them or treat the water in them.second,rather than requiring treatment of finished water only for viruses,the final rule required treatment for cryptosporidium as well.at.thus,under the final rule,new york and portland have two choices they may either treat their source water for cryptosporidium and cover their reservoirs,or they may leave the reservoirs uncovered and treat the water for cryptosporidium as it leaves the reservoirs.the basic idea is that at some point the two cities must treat their water for cryptosporidium and,following treatment,protect it from potential sources of cryptosporidium.
after epa issued its final rule,portland filed a petition for review pursuant to a,which gives this court jurisdiction over challenges to final epa rules promulgated under the sdwa.we granted new york motion to intervene.the cities challenge two of the final rule requirements that they either cover their reservoirs or treat the water leaving them for cryptosporidium the cover or treat requirement,and that they treat their source water for cryptosporidium the source water treatment requirement.the cities allege that epa improperly conducted a analysis required by the sdwa,provided insufficient opportunity for notice and comment,and failed to use the best available science.they also argue that the rule is arbitrary and capricious because epa failed to respond adequately to significant public comments and because the rule lacks support in the record and relies on a mistaken estimate of cryptosporidium infectivity the amount of cryptosporidium necessary to infect a person.
before considering these arguments,we observe that amicus walla walla raises an entirely different issue,arguing that epa improperly chose to use treatment techniques,rather than an mcl,to regulate cryptosporidium.because neither walla walla nor any other party raised this argument before the agency during the rulemaking process,however,it is waived,and we will not consider it.see,military toxics project epa.
portland and new york first attack the rule by claiming epa bungled the analysis required by the sdwa.section b c requires epa to conduct a analysis when proposing a treatment technique or mcl.with respect to treatment techniques,the statute says 
when proposing a national primary drinking water regulation that includes a treatment technique,the administrator shall publish and seek public comment on an analysis of the health risk reduction benefits and costs likely to be experienced as the result of compliance with the treatment technique and alternative treatment techniques that are being considered 
id.b c ii.if,based on this analysis,epa concludes that the costs of an mcl outweigh its benefits,the agency may set a less stringent mcl.id.b a.
central to the issue before us,however,is whether the sdwa bars epa from using analysis to establish a treatment technique for cryptosporidium less stringent than the most stringent feasible.section b c,enacted in the wake of the milwaukee outbreak,provides the administrator may not use the authority of this paragraph to establish a maximum contaminant level or treatment technique requirement for the control of cryptosporidium.t he authority of this paragraph refers to section b a,which says if epa determines that the benefits of an mcl would not justify the costs of complying with the mcl,epa may promulgate an mcl for the contaminant that maximizes health risk reduction benefits at a cost that is justified by the benefits.put another way,paragraphs a and c together provide that if epa determines that an mcl is not cost effective,the agency may select a the mcl relates to cryptosporidium.paragraph contains an undeniable oddity c says clearly that the power of a can not be used to establish a treatment technique for cryptosporidium,but a addresses only the establishment of mcls,not treatment techniques.we conclude that the power granted by a must be understood to apply to establishing treatment techniques,lest the phrase or treatment technique requirement in c be surplusage.see trw andrews,d it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.quoting duncan walker,d.in summary,then,the statute prohibits epa from using analysis to choose a cryptosporidium treatment technique less stringent than the most stringent feasible.
in their opening briefs,the cities dispute none of this.in fact,they never even mention section b c ban on using analysis to choose a cryptosporidium treatment technique.instead,they argue that section b c ii when proposing a treatment technique,the administrator shall publish an analysis of the benefits and costs likely to be experienced as the result of compliance with the treatment technique means epa has to analyze separately the costs and benefits of each treatment technique it imposes.they then argue that epa violated this requirement by performing only one aggregated analysis for the rule two treatment cover or treat and source water treatment requirements.
as epa points out in its brief,however,the cities argument ignores key sections of the statute.in particular,section b a requires epa to choose treatment techniques that prevent known or anticipated adverse effects on the health of persons to the extent feasible,and section b c prohibits it from choosing less stringent treatment techniques for cryptosporidium based on analysis.thus,even if,as the cities insist,the statute requires epa to perform separate analyses for each treatment technique and epa failed to do so,the agency error was harmless.see d ue account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error.pdk labs.dea,if the agency mistake did not affect the outcome,if it did not prejudice the petitioner,it would be senseless to vacate and remand for reconsideration.analysis could have affected this rulemaking only if it showed that the treatment techniques epa proposed were neither city claims.indeed,epa analysis shows that the rule will cost the vast majority of households less than per year.at.
in their reply briefs,the cities finally acknowledge section b c ban on using analysis to choose a less stringent cryptosporidium treatment technique,but insist that epa must still conduct the analysis properly for three reasons,none of which has merit.first,the cities argue that epa can use the analysis for purposes of section b,which requires the agency to determine whether an mcl benefits justify its costs,or section b,which allows epa to set a less stringent mcl if the most stringent feasible mcl would interfere with other treatment techniques.nothing in section b,however,allows epa to choose a treatment technique other than the most stringent feasible,and although section b allows the agency to set a less stringent mcl in the rare instance when a strict mcl would actually interfere with other treatment techniques,the cities never said this was the case here.second,the cities claim that the analysis must be done properly in order to inform the public and allow epa to make a reasoned decision.this argument fails because the statute requires epa to choose the most stringent feasible treatment technique for cryptosporidium regardless of its own or the public views about whether the benefits justify the costs congress already made this determination in section b c.third,the cities insist that the analysis must be done properly because a treatment technique is only feasible if its benefits outweigh its costs.but if feasible meant that the technique benefits justified its costs,section b a which allows epa to use analysis to set less stringent standards than the most stringent be surplusage.see trw,at.moreover,when congress wanted epa to undertake analysis,it said so expressly.see,b c directing epa to publish a determination as to whether the benefits of the mcl justify the costs.thus,feasible must mean what epa says it does technically possible and affordable.am.textile mfrs,donovan,d c analysis is not required by the occupational safety and health act because feasibility analysis is when congress has intended that an agency engage in analysis,it has clearly indicated such intent on the face of the statute certainly in light of its ordinary meaning,the word feasible can not be construed to articulate such congressional intent.footnotes and citations omitted.
next,the cities argue that epa interpretation of the statute leads to an absurd result,namely that the agency is required to conduct analysis when issuing cryptosporidium regulations but prohibited from using that analysis to choose a less stringent treatment technique.we see nothing absurd about this result.although congress forbade epa from using analysis to choose a less stringent technique,the analysis could still serve some purpose.for example,if the analysis showed that a proposed treatment technique was infeasible or would have no effect on cryptosporidium levels,it would influence what technique epa imposed.moreover,congress unwillingness to allow a broader role for analysis in setting cryptosporidium standards is hardly surprising given that it added section b c prohibition on using analysis to the sdwa largely in response to the deadly milwaukee outbreak.
in rejecting the cities challenge to epa analysis,we emphasize that nothing we say in this opinion implies either that agencies may ignore statutorily required procedures or that we will tolerate rules based on arbitrary and capricious analyses.in the narrow context of this case,however,where the sdwa largely prohibits epa from using the very analysis the same statute requires it to prepare,remanding this rule to the agency based on flaws in its analysis would be pointless.even were epa to redress its alleged errors,the final rule would remain unchanged,making this the epitome of harmless error.
the cities next argue that the rule is arbitrary and capricious because it lacks support in the record,because it rests on a mistaken estimate of cryptosporidium infectivity,and because epa failed to respond adequately to significant public comments.highly deferential,t he arbitrary and capricious standard presumes the validity of agency action.ass of clean air
