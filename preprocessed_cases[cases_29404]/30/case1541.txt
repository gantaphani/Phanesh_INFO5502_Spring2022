background 
relevant facts 
in october,the epa issued the nox sip call a final rule under caa section k,k,requiring states and the district of columbia upwind states to revise their state implementation plans sips to impose additional controls on nox emissions.see finding of significant contribution and rulemaking for certain states in the ozone transport assessment group region for purposes of reducing regional transport of ozone,nox sip call.the epa concluded that emissions from the upwind states contribute significantly to ozone nonattainment in downwind states,in violation of caa section a d i.a d i.under the sip call,upwind states are required to reduce nox emissions by the amount accomplishable by highly controls,defined as those controls capable of removing nox at a cost of or less per ton.
under the nox sip call,each upwind state must limit its summertime nox emissions to a statewide emission budget for the year.the budgets represent the amount of allowable nox emissions remaining after a covered state prohibits the nox amount contributing significantly to downwind nonattainment.michigan,at.specifically,the nox state budgets represent the epa projection for what nox emissions in would be for each state were highly controls implemented.under the nox sip call,states have substantial flexibility in selecting combinations of emission control measures to meet their respective budgets,so long as they do so by the regulatory deadline.
in setting the nox budgets,the epa relied upon emission inventory data collected by the ozone transport assessment group,a working group comprised of federal,state,industry,and environmental group representatives.see findings of significant contribution and rulemaking on section petitions for purposes of reducing interstate ozone transport,may,michigan,at.the epa divided each state nox emissions according to five source types or sectors electric generating units egus,stationary sources such as industrial boilers,area sources smaller stationary sources,highway mobile sources,and nonroad mobile sources.the epa calculated budget allocations for each sector.under the nox sip call,the epa assumed that emission reductions would occur primarily in the egu and sectors,representatives of which are petitioners here.in developing their sips,however,states are free to achieve emission reductions from other sources,so long as the sip provides for attainment of the requisite emission reduction level.
to calculate the egu emission budgets,the epa obtained utilization data for either or.to this baseline,the epa applied growth factors derived from growth projections for the years through generated by the integrated planning model ipm,a widely used utility planning model.even though the epa had utilization projections from the ipm,the epa instead opted to apply the growth factors to project growth over the period in each state.the resulting emission projections were then reduced based on the epa estimate of the amount of emission reductions that could be achieved through highly means.the resulting budgets are at issue in this case.
on march,this court upheld the bulk of the epa nox sip call.see michigan.relevant to this case,we specifically upheld the epa ability to set nox budgets.at the same time,this court remanded the regulatory definition of egu because the epa failed to provide an adequate explanation.this court also partially vacated and remanded the sip call as it applied to missouri because the epa included portions of missouri in the sip call with no evidence that these areas contributed to downwind nonattainment.
at the same time that it promulgated the nox sip call,the epa also proposed a federal implementation plan fip that would impose direct emission controls on egus and in any state that failed to implement an adequate sip by the regulatory.in january,the epa also mandated specific nox emission controls on egus and in upwind states in response to petitions filed by eight northeastern states under section of the caa.both the fip and the section rule seek nox reductions in accordance with the nox budgets established for the nox sip call,as amended by the rules challenged in this case.earlier this year,this court upheld the epa section rule in most respects,though some portions of that rule relevant to this case were remanded to the epa for additional consideration.see appalachian power epa.
b.the technical amendments 
in the final sip call rule promulgated on october,the epa reopened public comment on the accuracy of data upon which the emission inventories and budgets were based.see nox sip call.at.on december,the epa extended the comment period for emission inventory revisions to baseline information used to establish each state budget in the nox sip call,and further explained that it was seeking comment on the relevant data and assumptions so the agency could correct errors and update information used to compute the budgets.see correction and clarification to the finding of significant contribution and rulemaking for purposes of reducing regional transport of ozone,sip call correction.the epa also announced that it would reopen the comment period on equivalent inventory data for the fip and section rulemakings as well because all three rules relied upon the same inventories.id.
following this rulemaking,the epa published two technical amendments tas revising the sip call nox emission budgets.in the first ta published may,may ta,the epa made some modifications to emissions data,as well as to the baseline inventories.technical amendment to the finding of significant contribution and rulemaking for certain states for purposes of reducing regional transport of ozone.may.in the second technical amendment published march,march ta,the epa made additional corrections based upon additional public comments it received and the epa own internal review of the accuracy of its data and calculations.technical amendment to the finding of significant contribution and rulemaking for certain states for purposes of reducing regional transport of ozone.the epa also explained that the march ta was necessary to make the nox sip call inventory consistent with the inventory adopted by the epa in the final section rule,as the two rules were to be based upon the same inventory.id.the epa also made corrections to the growth rates of many sources because it had misapplied these growth rates in the may ta version of the budget.id.at.these changes altered the baselines for some source categories and some states.
ii.industry generating issues 
egu growth factors 
industry petitioners challenge the lawfulness of the nox emission budgets as set forth in the tas,specifically,the particular growth factors the epa used to project future utilization rates for egus in.petitioners allege that the epa reliance upon these growth factors was arbitrary and capricious because the growth factors were unsupported and in conflict with growth estimates.petitioners further contend that the epa arbitrarily failed to determine whether the resulting emission budgets could be achieved in a manner.other petitioners raise similar challenges to the tas.before turning to the merits of these arguments,we must first address several jurisdictional issues raised by the epa.specifically,the epa claims that petitioners claims are time barred and precluded by our michigan decision under principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel 
statute of limitations 
the epa contends that petitioners objections to the egu growth factor determinations are not properly before this court because they were resolved in the underlying nox sip call rulemaking,not in the ta proceeding.therefore,the growth factors were subject to challenge in michigan,and not here.the epa outlined and finalized its method for determining state emission budgets,including the use of growth factors,in the nox sip call rulemaking.see nox sip call.at.the epa argues that under caa section b,b,petitioners had sixty days from the publication of the sip call in the federal register to challenge the epa final growth factor determinations.by these lights,petitioners may not challenge the growth factors because they did not raise their challenges within sixty days of publication of the sip call.
in october,the epa reopened comment on the data used to establish each state budget.nox sip call.at.however,the epa maintains petitioners claims are precluded because it did not explicitly invite comments on growth rate methodology.in other words,the epa argues that it undertook the ta rulemakings for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy of the epa data inputs,and not to reconsider prior methodological determinations,such as how to construct growth factors and how to use those growth factors in determining emission budgets.according to the epa,c omments related to the use of growth factors in determination of state budgets were addressed in the context of the final nox sip call.may response to comments at.therefore,the agency pleads,petitioners growth factor arguments are under national ass of reversionary property owners surface transportation board,narpo if narpo reopening theory does not apply,we are without jurisdiction to consider narpo due process claim.
the ta proceedings are not as clear cut as the epa maintains,nor are our precedents so restrictive.the initial ta rulemaking invited comment on both the emission data used to calculate state budgets and the baseline information.nox sip call.at.as the epa recognizes,the baseline information is nothing more than the product of growth factors and the emission data used to calculate state budgets.see sip call correction.at noting that baseline inventory is based on the universe of sources in the inventory and a growth factor emphasis added.therefore,insofar as the epa reopened comment on the baselines,it would seem that the epa reopened comment on the growth factors in addition to the emission data used to calculate state budgets.while the epa did not reopen comment on the broader issues of its authority to impose nox emission budgets on states,it did open comment on the budgets themselves.insofar as the agency was ambiguous on this point,that only further supports petitioners argument that the growth factor issue was reopened.see narpo,at ambiguity in an nprm may also tilt toward a finding that the issue has been reopened.
even accepting that the epa did not explicitly reopen growth factors for public comment,this does not preclude petitioners claim.under public citizen nrc,whether an agency has in fact reopened an issue is dependent upon the entire context of the rulemaking including all relevant proposals and reactions of the agency,and not just on the agency stated intent.thus,if an agency response to comments explicitly or implicitly shows that the agency actually reconsidered the rule,the matter has been reopened.panamsat fcc,citation omitted.
the epa claims that the growth factors were completely settled for the purposes of the nox sip call by the time the ta rulemaking began in october.yet this claim is difficult to square with the epa purported justification for the ta to conform the emission inventories of the nox sip call and section rules.the ta rulemaking began in october,but the first section rule was not final until may.thus,if the epa was sincere in seeking to use the ta rulemaking to conform the emission inventories of the two rules,then the epa various growth factor methodologies must have been open for comment for the purposes of the nox sip call as they were subject to revision in the section rulemaking at least up until the close of that proceeding.
where a rulemaking notice is ambiguous and could fairly be read to suggest that the search for harmony might lead to the rethinking of old positions this court has found that the earlier decision was reopened.narpo,at citation omitted.this is an apt description of what happened here.therefore,insofar as there are problems with section inventories and budgets,the epa implicitly gave petitioners an opportunity to identify the equivalent problems with the nox sip call inventories and budgets when the epa opened the ta rulemaking for the purpose of conforming the inventories for the two rules.
res judicata and collateral estoppel 
res judicata bars relitigation not only of matters determined in a previous litigation but also ones that a party could have raised.nrdc thomas,emphasis in epa brief.collateral estoppel further bars parties from relitigating issues of law or fact resolved in prior cases between those parties.securities indus.ass bd.of governors,when a court determines an issue of fact or law that is actually litigated and necessary to its judgment,that conclusion binds the same parties in a subsequent action.as the growth factor determinations were made as part of the nox sip call,the epa maintains that petitioners should have presented any challenge to the growth factors in michigan,where there were actual legal and factual challenges on budget and topics and where nearly all of the petitioners here were represented.brief for respondent epa at.
petitioners challenges are based upon the emission inventories and budgets laid out in the tas.as such,they present issues not litigated in michigan.though it is true that petitioners could have challenged the epa growth factor methodologies in that litigation,we hold here that the epa reopened comment on that issue.just as it would be absurd for the epa to argue that res judicata and collateral estoppel would preclude review had the epa decided to change its growth factor methodologies in response to invited comments,so too is it absurd for the epa to argue here that res judicata and collateral estoppel preclude review of its decision not to change in response to those same invited comments.
on the merits,industry petitioners allege that the epa emission budget determinations for egus are arbitrary and unsupported on several grounds.first,they maintain that the emission baselines reflect the unrealistic assumptions that utilization growth will be linear.second,they question the epa use of growth rates to estimate growth over the period.third,they claim the epa reliance upon the growth factors resulted in unrealistic utilization estimates.for example,utilization rates in some states,such as michigan and west virginia,are greater than the baselines estimated by the epa.
petitioners contend that the arbitrariness of the growth factors is compounded by the fact that more representative growth estimates were available.in conducting its analysis,the epa used the ipm to generate growth assumptions for,as well as to generate egu utilization estimates for.yet the epa did not use this data for the purpose of developing its growth factors for the baseline,and it offered no reasonable explanation for its choice.even if the epa finds on remand that its choice was the better one,failure to examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action either is arbitrary decisionmaking or at least prevents a court from finding it.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.
we confronted nearly identical challenges to the epa use of growth factors to estimate baseline nox emissions for in the section litigation.see appalachian power epa.although the nox sip call covers more states than the section rule,the epa methodological choices and explanations or lack thereof were the same.therefore,we see no reason to depart from our conclusions in that litigation.
there is no question that a gency determinations based upon highly complex and technical matters are entitled to great deference,at quoting public citizen health research group brock.the epa has undoubted power to use predictive models,such as the ipm,but it must explain the assumptions and methodology used in preparing the model and provide a complete analytic defense should the model be challenged.small refiner lead task force epa,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.given the highly deferential standard of review applied to such questions,and the epa clear authority to rely upon computer models in place of inconsistent,incomplete,or unreliable empirical data,the agency decision to rely upon the ipm,rather than the projections offered by individual states,was not arbitrary and capricious.appalachian power,at.however,this court can not excuse the epa reliance upon a methodology that generates apparently arbitrary results particularly where,as here,the agency has failed to justify its choice.
in the case at hand,the epa adopted a particular methodology to estimate egu utilization rates in that generated seemingly implausible results,such as a negative growth forecast for some states in the coming decade.the epa adopted this methodology without offering any reasoned explanation for its choice.the epa decision not to use the ipm projections for that were used to estimate the of emissions controls may well have been reasonable.so too may have been the epa choice to rely upon ipm projections for the period in order to generate a growth factor for the period.however,there is no way for us to tell because the epa never offered an explanation.merely asserting that the choice was reasonable is not enough.
as we held in the section litigation,so too here 
the epa has not fully explained the bases upon which it chose to use one set of projections for costs and another for budgets,nor has it addressed what appear to be stark disparities between its projections and real world observations.with its delicate balance of thorough record scrutiny and deference to agency expertise,judicial review can occur only when agencies explain their decisions with precision,for it will not do for a court to be compelled to guess at the theory underlying the agency action.american lung ass epa,quoting sec chenery.as a result,we have no choice but to remand the epa egu growth factor determinations so that the agency may fulfill its obligation to engage in reasoned decisionmaking on how to set egu growth factors and explain why results that appear arbitrary on their face are,in fact,reasonable determinations.
industry petitioners make the additional argument that the epa failed to find the budgets achievable at the ton established in the nox sip call rule.essentially,petitioners contend that the budgets the epa analyzed for purposes were different from the emission budgets imposed on the states.this argument is without merit.the emission budget levels themselves are based upon reductions deemed by the epa to be.in the case of egus,the epa concluded that an average emissions rate of could be achieved at a cost of less than.nox sip call.at.thus,insofar as the epa properly generates,and adequately explains,estimated utilization rates,it need not repeat its analysis.
significant contribution 
industry petitioners also allege that the tas are arbitrary because they rely upon emission inventories that are substantially different from those that were used to make the initial contribution findings for the nox sip call.essentially,petitioners argue that because the tas changed the underlying state emission inventories and budgets,thereby alteringthe relative contributions of upwind states to downwind nonattainment,the epa was obligated to reevaluate its significant contribution findings for each of the affected states.for example,the tas decreased the baseline emissions for west virginia,an upwind state,and increased baseline emissions for new york,a downwind state.due to this change,petitioners contend,the epa could not continue to assume that west virginia contributes to new york nonattainment without additional analysis.
it is administrative law that a bsent special circumstances,a party must initially present its comments to the agency during the rulemaking in order for the court to consider the issue.tex tin epa,citing indus.epa.generalized objections to agency action or objections raised at the wrong time or in the wrong docket will not do.an objection must be made with sufficient specificity reasonably to alert the agency.id.an agency can not be faulted for failing to address such issues that were not raised by petitioners.petitioners waived their argument,and can cite no special circumstances to justify their waiver.
petitioners are able to cite no comments that were in the relevant docket that raise the significant contribution issue.for example,petitioners note that the west virginia manufacturers association argued that i f epa has in fact made adjustments to the inventories,we believe that this would dramatically affect the modeled impact of the contribution of upwind states and sources to downwind ozone nonattainment.the problem is that this document was submitted to the dockets for the section and fip rulemakings,and was not part of the ta rulemaking.petitioners do cite other documents which were part of the relevant rulemaking,but these documents do not address the significant contribution argument.this is insufficient notice does not operate by osmosis.having failed to raise their concern in the relevant agency docket,petitioners could perhaps have cured their waiver by seeking reconsideration before the epa,but they did not.thus,petitioners waived their argument that the epa was required to revisit its significant contribution findings.
iii.state petitioners 
state petitioners echo many of the arguments addressed above.their claims are unique insofar as they object to the epa imposition of erroneous projections of their economic growth on states through the nox sip call.joint brief of petitioning states at.the state petitioners primary complaint is with the epa reliance upon the ipm to generate growth rates without promulgating a mechanism to review these projections based upon actual growth rates.petitioning states contend that the epa projections underestimate actual growth in some affected states,but the epa refused to address this concern in the ta rulemaking.while the epa acknowledged some inconsistency between ipm growth projections and those provided by individual states,the epa rejected the claim that the states projections are inherently more reliable.state petitioners claim that it was unreasonable for the epa to reach this conclusion without conducting any analysis of the state projections.
state petitioners aver that deference to the epa findings in this area is unwarranted because deference is only due within an agency area of expertise.see nrdc epa.were the epa making environmental projections,they concede,deference would be warranted.since,however,the growth projections are essentially economic projections,this court should give the epa no more deference than it would to the agency predictions of interest rates or the level of the dow jones index.joint brief of petitioning states at citing montana epa,cir.while the epa has authority to impose emission limits on states,they argue,it does not have the authority to regulate a state economic growth.insofar as the epa has done this through its growth projections,it has adopted an overly broad reading of the caa that usurps states sovereign power to manage their own economic growth.id.at.
the epa raises the same untimeliness arguments discussed above.see supra part.we reject them for the same reasons.however,insofar as the state petitioners seek relief beyond that which is provided above,their complaints are not
