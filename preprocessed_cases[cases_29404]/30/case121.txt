this case arises from the efforts of the environmental protection agency epa pursuant to section a of the clean water act the cwa,a,to regulate the discharge of ballast water from ships a ship takes on and discharges ballast water to compensate for changes in its weight caused by activities such as loading and unloading cargo or consuming fuel or supplies.the amount of water can range from hundreds of gallons to as much as million gallons enough to fill swimming pools.more than billion gallons of ballast water are released in the united states annually.see nw.envtl.advocates epa,cir.
when a ship takes on ballast water,it can inadvertently pick up organisms and their eggs and larvae,as well as sediment and pollutants.when the ship discharges ballast water,often in a new place,these organisms and pollutants are ejected into the surrounding waterbody,enabling these organisms to establish new,populations.as a result,ships have become one of the primary ways that invasive species are spread from one waterbody to another.id.at all told,more than marine species each day hitch rides around the globe in the ballast water of cargo ships.quoting nw.envtl.advocates epa,no.c si,wl,at.
invasive species cause severe economic and ecological harm,including by destroying native fish species and shellfish industries,creating algae blooms,and devastating tourism.zebra mussels are a particularly destructive example.they were first introduced to lake erie in the by a freighter from europe that discharged ballast water containing mussels these mussels have wreaked havoc in the midwest and northeast by blocking water intake and outtake at power plants and other industrial facilities,causing nearly million in damage between and.nw.envtl.advocates,at.one study estimates the damage caused by invasive species collectively at about billion a year more than double the annual economic damage caused by all natural disasters in the united states.id.quoting nw.envtl.advocates,wl,at 
ballast water discharge is particularly problematic in the great lakes.vessels that sail exclusively in the great lakes,known as lakers,account for over percent of ballast water volumes transferred in the great lakes.unfortunately,lakers are more likely than oceangoing vessels to spread invasive species because the short duration of their voyages allows organisms to survive in their ballast.
in april,epa issued a vessel general permit the vgp,pursuant to section of the cwa,to regulate the discharge of ballast water from ships.in response,four environmental groups filed three petitions for review pfrs alleging that epa acted arbitrarily and capriciously in issuing the vgp petitioner natural resources defense council nrdc filed a pfr on may,in this court petitioners northwest environmental advocates nwea and the center for biological diversity jointly filed a pfr on may,in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit and petitioner national wildlife federation nwf filed a pfr on july,in the united states court of appeals for the circuit in an order dated may,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation issued a consolidation order and assigned final venue for the first two petitions,and any subsequently filed petition,to this court.
on may,the lake carriers association and the canadian shipowners association the csa filed a motion to intervene,which was granted on october.on january,the csa filed a pfr in this case.epa and the csa jointly moved to sever the csa pfr from this case and hold it in abeyance the motion was granted on may.
we find that epa acted arbitrarily and capriciously in issuing parts of the vgp,and therefore remand this matter to the epa for further proceedings.
background 
congress created the cwa to limit pollution in the waters of the united states.see a objective of cwa is to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.water mgmt.dist.miccosukee tribe of indians,d same waterkeeper,epa,cir same.the cwa thus prohibits the discharge of any pollutant from a point source to the navigable waters of the united states,except as permitted by the cwa.a,emphasis added.the discharge of a pollutant includes any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.id.a.a pollutant includes solid,industrial,agricultural,and biological waste.id.a point source is any discernible,confined and discrete conveyance,including but not limited to any vessel or other floating craft,from which pollutants are or may be discharged.id.navigable waters is defined as the waters of the united states,including the territorial seas.id.the discharge of polluted water from a vessel ballast tank is a point source discharge covered by the cwa.see nw.envtl.advocates,at.
a key component of the statute is the establishment of water quality standards.water quality standards are set by states for waters within their boundaries and are then reviewed for approval by epa.see,see also nrdc epa,cir under the cwa,each state sets its own water quality standards,subject to review and approval by the epa.epa must ensure that the standard proposed by the state will comply with the requirements of the cwa before approving it.see b c,a a d.
national pollutant discharge elimination system permits 
an entity seeking to discharge a pollutant is required to obtain and comply with a permit that limits the amounts and kinds of pollutants being discharged.see nrdc epa,see also waterkeeper,at discharge allowed where permits ensure that every discharge of pollutants will comply with all applicable effluent limitations and standards.this permit,known as a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit,establishes enforceable effluent limitations,as well as monitoring and reporting requirements.
npdes permits,which are issued either by epa or a state in a federally approved permitting system,see,may be individual issued to a specific entity to discharge pollutants at a specific place or general issued to an entire class of dischargers in a geographic location,see,a.the permit here is a general permit.
permits can impose two different types of standards on discharges standards and water standards.see b c and b a,a.the vgp imposes both.
technology based effluent limits 
effluent limits tbels set effluent limitations on a point source based on how effectively technology can reduce the pollutant being discharged.see b,e,b see also pud of jefferson cty.dep t of ecology,d holding that,to achieve goals of cwa,epa is required to establish and enforce limitations on individual discharges into the country navigable waters from point sources.congress designed this standard to be,meaning it should force agencies and permit applicants to adopt technologies that achieve the greatest reductions in pollution.see nrdc,at holding that cwa seeks not only to stimulate but to press development of new,more efficient and effective technologies,which is essential purpose of this series of progressively more demanding standards 
in determining the standard for tbels,epa considers the source of the pollution existing or new and the type of pollutant.for nonconventional pollutants from existing sources,epa is required to set effluent limits based on the best available technology economically achievable or bat.b a bat requires the application of the best available technology economically achievable for such category or class,which will result in reasonable further progress toward the national goal of eliminating the discharge of all pollutants.id.see nrdc,at cwa designed to progress toward implementation of pollution controls to the full extent of the best technology which would become available.because invasive species are a nonconventional pollutant from an existing source,ballast water discharges are subject to bat.
epa considers a number of factors in assessing whether a technology is bat,including 
the cost of achieving the effluent reductions,
the age of equipment and facilities involved,
the process employed,
the engineering aspects of various control techniques,
potential process changes,
environmental impacts including energy requirements,and 
other factors as epa deems appropriate.
epa can mandate that bat requires the use of a technology that is not currently available within a particular industry when the technology is available in another industry,epa finds that the technology is transferrable from that other industry,and epa can reasonably predict that such technology will adequately treat the effluent.see kennecott epa,cir citing tanners council of,train,cir.
water quality based effluent limits 
if the tbels are insufficient to attain or maintain water quality standards,the cwa requires npdes permits to include additional water effluent limits wqbels.see b c,a nrdc,at whenever a effluent limitation is insufficient to make a particular body of water fit for the uses for which it is needed,the epa is to devise a based limitation that will be sufficient to the task.wqbels are designed to ensure that the discharges authorized by the permit do not violate water quality standards.see,a.
the wqbels,which supplement the tbels,are based on the amount and kind of pollutants in the water.see id.a.wqbels are set without regard to cost or technology availability.see nrdc epa,a standard discards its fundamental premise when it ignores the limits inherent in the technology.by contrast,a water permit limit begins with the premise that a certain level of water quality will be maintained,come what may,and places upon the permittee the responsibility for realizing that goal.footnote omitted.wqbels may be narrative where the calculation of numeric limits is infeasible.see k.
no permit may be issued when the imposition of conditions can not ensure compliance with the applicable water quality requirements of all affected states.id.d.thus,permits must establish limits on discharges that will lead to compliance with water quality standards.see trs.for alaska epa,cir holding that permit must translate state water quality standards into effluent limitations necessary to achieve those standards.
because no states have established numeric water quality criteria for invasive species,epa is required to establish wqbels that ensure compliance with narrative criteria,designated uses,and antidegradation policies that comprise state water quality standards.the permit may then mandate best management practices bmps to control pollution.see k.
monitoring and reporting requirements 
npdes permits also require both monitoring and reporting of monitoring results of tbels and wqbels to assure compliance with permit limitations and facilitate enforcement.see,a i.
regulatory history 
when the cwa was first being implemented in the,epa regulations exempted discharges that were incidental to the normal operation of vessels from npdes permitting requirements.see national pollutant discharge elimination system,may,codified at see also national pollutant discharge elimination system revision of regulations,june,codified at a.this exemption included ballast water discharges.
in,the nwea and other environmental organizations submitted a rulemaking petition to epa seeking to repeal this exemption,then codified at a.see final national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes general permit for discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel.epa denied the petition.see nw.envtl.advocates,at.the environmental groups challenged the denial in the united states district court for the northern district of california,while simultaneously filing a pfr in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit,in case the district court lacked jurisdiction.the district court issued an order vacating the exemption,see nw.envtl.advocates,wl,at,and the ninth circuit upheld the decision.see nw.envtl.advocates,at.epa finally repealed the exemption and issued a vessel general permit in the vgp.draft national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes general permits for discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel.june.
environmental groups,industry groups,and the state of michigan challenged the vgp in a pfr filed in the united states court of appeals for the circuit,arguing primarily that the vgp was inadequate because it contained only narrative provisions,not specific numeric limitations on discharges.in march,epa settled this matter,agreeing to set numeric effluent limits for discharges of ballast water expressed as organisms per unit of ballast water volume set numeric effluent limits that represent the applicable levels of control and include more stringent water effluent limitations if needed to satisfy applicable water quality standards.settlement agreement,nrdc epa,ecf.
the creation of new standards 
to create these new,more specific standards,epa enlisted the help of its own science advisory board the sab and the national research academy of sciences committee on assessing numeric limits for living organisms in ballast water the nas committee.epa posed a different question to each scientific body.
in,epa asked the sab to provide advice on technologies and systems to minimize the impacts of invasive species in vessel ballast water discharge.app.at.specifically,the sab looked at four issues the performance of shipboard systems with available effluent testing data the potential performance of shipboard systems without reliable testing data system development for the shipboard systems identified in issues and and the development of reliable information about the status of ballast water treatment technologies and system performance.in considering these questions,the sab was to take into account the international convention for the control and management of ships ballast water and sediments the imo standard,adopted by the international maritime organization in,which set certain ballast water effluent limits.id.at 
in july,the sab issued its report efficacy of ballast water treatment systems a report by the epa science advisory board the sab report.the sab identified treatment systems,with five categories of shipboard systems that could reliably achieve the imo standard.id.at the sab found that none of the systems could meet standards or times greater than the imo standard.id.at.the sab also found that none of the shipboard treatments identified could reliably achieve a no living organism standard.id.
b.the nas committee 
epa created the nas committee to examine the relationship between the concentration of living organisms in ballast water discharges and the probability of nonindigenous organisms successfully establishing populations in waters.id.at.
in its june report,assessing the relationship between propagule pressure and invasion risk in ballast water the nas report,the nas committee concluded there was no significant relationship between ballast volume and invasions,and t he current state of science does not allow a quantitative evaluation of the relative merits of various discharge standards in terms of invasion probability.id.at.essentially,the committee said that it was unable to establish a reliable numeric limit on discharges that would guarantee protection against invasive species,other than zero.
on march,epa issued the vgp,the permit now before us,allowing vessels to discharge ballast water subject to certain limitations on the living organisms in the discharge.final national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes general permit for discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel,this constituted final action on the permit pursuant to section a of the cwa,a.the vgp included tbels,wqbels,and monitoring and reporting requirements.
as discussed above,tbels impose effluent limitations on a point source based on how much technology is able to reduce the amount of a pollutant at issue.see b,e,b.in this instance,epa chose to set the tbels at the imo standard,which requires 
limiting discharges of organisms micrometers or larger to a concentration of fewer than living organisms per cubic meter of ballast water 
limiting discharges of organisms less than micrometers and greater than or equal to micrometers to concentrations of fewer than living organisms per milliliter ml of ballast water and 
limiting discharges of three types of pathogen and pathogen indicators vibrio cholerae fewer than colony forming unit cfu per ml escherichia coli fewer than cfu per ml and intestinal enterococci fewer than cfu per ml.
vessel general permit for discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels vgp authorization to discharge under the national pollutant discharge elimination system,at,available at.the vgp did not set standards for other small organisms,such as bacteria or viruses.
the wqbels in the vgp require oceangoing vessels entering the great lakes to continue to perform ballast water exchanges,and all vessels to control discharges as necessary to meet applicable water quality standards in the receiving water body or another water body impacted by the discharges.vgp,at,at.
monitoring and reporting requirements for tbels and wqbels 
as noted above,npdes permits must contain conditions that require both monitoring and reporting of monitoring results of tbels and wqbels to ensure compliance with water quality standards.see a i.
i monitoring and reporting requirements for tbels 
in the vgp,epa established the following monitoring requirements for tbels 
that vessels monitor the functionality of their ballast water treatment systems,if installed and 
that vessels monitor the concentrations of the two indicator bacteria,coli and enterococci 
the first requirement is known as functionality monitoring.under this requirement,a ballast water treatment program is considered to be in compliance if it is operating according to the manufacturers requirements.app.at.
the second requirement is known as effluent biological organism monitoring.under this requirement,vessels must collect samples and analyze them for concentrations of two indicator pathogens.this is required between one and four times a year depending on the treatment system.
ii monitoring and reporting requirements for wqbels 
the only monitoring required for wqbels is that ships report the expected date,location,volume,and salinity of any ballast water to be discharged.vgp,at emphasis added.permittees are not required to report actual locations,volumes,or composition of ballast water to be discharged.
the vgp requires all lakers to comply with control measures,like ballast water exchange and other bmps found in vgp.app.at see vgp,at.lakers are also subject to three ballast water management measures found in vgp conducting an annual assessment of sediment accumulations minimizing the amount of water taken in nearshore environments and adequately maintaining sea chest screens,which keep larger organisms like fish out of ballast tanks.vgp,at.in addition,all lakers built on or after january,must comply with vgp,which sets numeric ballast water discharge limits.vgp,at.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a npdes permit under the administrative procedure act to determine whether epa actions were arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.to determine whether the agency actions were arbitrary and capricious,we consider whether the agency 
relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.

petitioners challenge 
here,petitioners challenge epa issuance of the vgp as arbitrary and capricious,and not in accordance with law,on a number of grounds.
first,petitioners argue that the tbels are arbitrary and capricious.specifically,petitioners assert that epa acted arbitrarily and capriciously and not in accordance with the law when it selected the imo standard as the standard for the tbels failed to consider onshore treatment,limiting consideration to shipboard treatment failed to include numeric tbels for viruses and protists and exempted lakers built before pre lakers from the numeric tbels of the vgp.
second,petitioners argue that epa acted arbitrarily and capriciously and not in accordance with the law in choosing narrative wqbels,rather than numeric wqbels,because,among other things,the narrative standard is too imprecise to guarantee compliance with water quality standards.
finally,petitioners argue that epa monitoring and reporting requirements for tbels and wqbels are not in accordance with the law because they were inadequate to guarantee compliance.
under the cwa,epa must apply bat in establishing pollution controls for ballast water discharge.bat requires the application of the best available technology economically achievable for such category or class,which will result in reasonable further progress toward the national goal of eliminating the discharge of all pollutants.b a emphasis added.bat also requires a commitment of the maximum resources economically possible to the ultimate goal of eliminating all polluting discharges.epa crushed stone ass n,d.
we hold that in failing to set tbels that reflected bat in the vgp,epa acted arbitrarily and capriciously in a number of respects.
a.the imo standard 
petitioners argue that epa failed to apply bat when it chose the imo standard for tbels in the vgp.they allege that epa chose the imo standard first,and then worked backwards to determine which systems could achieve that standard.nwea br.at.in doing so,they contend,epa improperly restricted the sab inquiry to whether certain technologies would meet what petitioners describe as existing international consensus standards.id.according to petitioners,epa should have first considered what available technology was capable of achieving,and then created standards based on that capability.as a result,petitioners contend,epa standard did not achieve greater reductions in pollution discharges that were achievable with current technology.
we agree.epa acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it chose the imo standard without adequately explaining why standards higher than the imo standard should not be used given available technology.
in choosing the imo standard,epa overlooked crucial portions of the sab report.the sab identified a number of technologies that can achieve standards higher than imo for one or more organism sizes,including all five of the technologies identified as also meeting the imo standard the sab acknowledged that these same five systems have the potential to meet a imo d phase standard,the imo standard in the near future.app.at.in describing the performance of those systems,the sab concluded that each would require only modifications.id.at.indeed,according to the sab report,the ecochlor,balpure,and peraclean systems can meet times imo for medium organisms,and ecochlor can meet times imo for large organisms.
epa should not have adhered to the imo standard without explanation when technologies could have exceeded imo.indeed,seeking to find systems that are capable of doing better than the current standard is in keeping with the aspect of the cwa.see nrdc,at.epa should have first looked at the available ballast water technologies as identified by the sab report.then,finding that those technologies could exceed the imo standard,epa should have adjusted its standard accordingly,or explained why it would not.see islander pipeline,at holding that agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action quoting state farm,at alterations omitted.
epa counterargument that no more was necessary because it did not limit the sab to considering the imo standard is unavailing.epa insists that it gave the sab a list of potential regulatory limits,and then asked the sab to identify the systems that could reliably meet those limits.in support,epa points to its charge question to the sab,which asked the sab to identify discharge standards that the available data about existing systems credibly demonstrate can be reliably achieved.app.at.epa argues that in response to this charge,the sab report supports the conclusion that,b ased upon the data available,no current ballast water treatment technologies were considered likely to meet standards more stringent than the imo d i standards.id.at.
while it is true that epa did not strictly limit the sab consideration to the imo standard,epa is incorrect in suggesting that the sab report supports the conclusion that no system could meet standards stricter than the imo standard.id to the contrary,the record contradicts epa assertion that treatment systems that exceed the imo standard are not available.in fact,as noted above,systems that exceed the imo standard are available 
accordingly,by failing to consider adequately a standard more stringent than imo,epa failed to set permit limits that reflect bat.see b crushed stone,at bat requires a commitment of the maximum resources economically possible to the ultimate goal of eliminating all pollution discharges fmc train,cir upholding epa decision to set bat based on data from a single pilot plant.in doing so,epa acted arbitrarily and capriciously and not in accordance with law in choosing the imo standard for the tbels in the vgp.
onshore ballast water treatment 
petitioners also argue that epa arbitrarily and capriciously limited its consideration to shipboard treatments,failing to consider onshore treatment.petitioners argue that onshore facilities used in other industries,such as sewage treatment plants and drinking water treatment plants,were reasonable alternatives to shipboard treatment that should have been considered.epa concedes it directed the board to focus its limited time and resources on the status of shipboard treatment systems because such systems were either in existence or in the development process.epa br.at quoting sab report.it argues that onshore treatment was not available,primarily because no onshore system was yet in existence.
while it is true that no onshore systems existed then unsurprising considering ballast water treatment was not required at all until the effective date of the vgp the record suggests that such onshore systems were technologically possible at that time.yet,epa chose to curtail discussion about onshore systems and failed to develop information necessary to evaluate their availability.we conclude that by failing to consider onshore ballast water systems,epa acted arbitrarily and capriciously.
what does available mean as courts have interpreted the term in the cwa context,technologies that could be used for a particular discharge,even if they are not currently being used by that industry,are available.as the fourth circuit noted,
the model technology under consideration may exist at a plant not within the industry at issue.congress contemplated that epa might use technology from other industries to establish the best available technology.progress would be slowed if epa were invariably limited to treatment schemes already in force at the plants which are the subject of the rulemaking.congress envisioned the scanning of broader horizons and asked epa to survey related industries and current research to find technologies which might be used to decrease the discharge of pollutants.
kennecott,at emphasis added citation omitted.this court held similarly in hooker chemicals plastics train,
that no plant in a given industry has adopted a pollution control device which could be installed does not mean that that device is not available.congress did not intend to permit continuance of pollution by industries which have failed to cope with and attempt to solve the problem of polluted water.
cir see also cal.hawaiian sugar epa,cir technology used in other industries with similar raw waste characteristics was available quoting liquid and crystalline cane sugar refining subcategory,am.petrol.inst.epa,cir holding that a process can be deemed available even if it is not in use at all because s uch an outcome is consistent with congress intent to push pollution control technology quoting ass of pac.fisheries epa,cir weyerhaeuser costle.
for a technology in one industry to be available in a second industry the transfer technology must be available within the first industry the transfer technology must be transferable to the second industry and it must be reasonably predictable that the technology,if used in the second industry,will be capable of removing the increment required by the effluent standards.see kennecott,at citing tanners council,at cpc int l train,cir hooker,at but even if technology which is not presently in use can be treated as available and achievable,there must be some indication in the administrative record of the reasons for concluding that such technology is feasible and may reasonably be expected to yield the effluent reduction mandated when applied to the particular industry.for example,in kennecott,the fourth circuit upheld epa use of manufacturing technology from one industry as part of a bat determination for treating wastewater in a different industry.at.
here,we can not evaluate whether onshore technology should be considered available because the record does not contain a full discussion of onshore treatment.this lack of information about onshore facilities,however,is a problem of epa own making because epa went to great lengths to foreclose discussion of onshore treatment both by expressly limiting the sab mandate to studying shipboard treatment technology and consistently opposing any attempt by the sab to consider onshore treatment.
epa effort to curtail discussion of onshore treatment is well documented in the record.in a letter dated february,thirteen scientists,eight of whom were members of the sab and six of whom were members of the nas committee including the chair of the nas committee,stated that the sab never actually addressed the question of what is the best treatment that available technology can achieve because epa limited them to the narrower question of whether shipboard treatment systems could meet certain specific sets of standards.app.at.furthermore,the scientists assert that their attempts to consider onshore treatments were actively thwarted by epa 
during the sab panel meetings and discussions,some members of the panel attempted to develop and include in the panel report a more detailed assessment of onshore treatment,including its cost impacts,and an assessment of the full capability of shipboard treatment t hese assessments would have further demonstrated that available technology can achieve levels of treatment beyond what the epa has proposed as controls.the epa office of water,however,consistently opposed including such information in the report.as a result,some relevant information and analysis that could have been developed by the panel was not,and some of what was developed by panel members was excluded or deleted from the final report.if there was less information developed on these issues and less provided in the report than the epa considers sufficient,it is in large part because the epa office of water opposed the development and inclusion of such information.
id.at emphases added.
in light of these facts,we can not well credit epa assertion that it lacked information to support a finding that onshore facilities were available.while epa states that it was unaware of any onshore treatment facility currently available in the that is capable of meeting the vgp ballast water discharge standards,and that it did not receive information indicating they are or would become available over the term of the vgp,id.at,in fact epa turned a blind eye to significant information about onshore treatment.
indeed,the lack of information about the availability of onshore treatment is due in large part to epa arbitrary and capricious decision to oppose developing such information.as a result,the tbels were based on an incomplete record one lacking meaningful discussion of an available treatment,namely onshore treatment.see humana of aurora,heckler,cir agency action is arbitrary and capricious when based on a flawed study.oil gas ass epa,cir a regulation can not stand if it is based on a flawed,inaccurate,or misapplied study.almay,califano,rejecting regulation produced on the basis of the flawed survey.put another way,epa refusal to consider onshore treatment entirely fail s to consider an important aspect of the problem and offer s an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency.islander pipeline,at see tanners council,at t he agency must fully explicate its course of inquiry,its analysis,and its reasoning.see also state farm,at hooker,at.hence,it is arbitrary and capricious.
in fact,the sab report points out a number of reasonably predictable advantages to onshore treatment.the sab report states 
use of reception facilities for the treatment of ballast water appears to be technically feasible given generations of successful water treatment and sewage treatment technologies,and is likely to be more reliable and more readily adaptable than shipboard treatment.
app.at see also id.at.the sab report also notes that onshore treatment has a number of advantages over shipboard treatment because onshore facilities are not subject to problems such as limited space,small and overburdened crews,vibrations,weight allowances,limited power,ship instability,and greater corrosion rates.id.at.regarding ship crews in particular,studies have shown that many of these crews are already overburdened,o peration by trained,dedicated personnel in reception facilities would likely result in more reliable performance,and m aintenance and repair work are more likely to be done reliably as well.id.at.onshore treatment can also be more effective by using superior technologies that are not available for shipboard treatment,such as settling tanks,granular filtration,and membrane filtration.id.at.indeed,epa cites a number of studies that conclude that onshore treatment facilities are a technically feasible option.id.at.these studies date back to,and proceed with some regularity thereafter.
moreover,onshore treatment would not necessarily be slower than shipboard treatment to implement.the sab estimated that onshore implementation would take up to thirty months,while epa allowed eight years to shipboard implementation.see id.at.nor would onshore treatment necessarily be more expensive than shipboard treatment.regional economic studies suggest that treating ballast water in reception facilities would be at least as economically feasible as shipboard treatment.id.at.in addition,the cost of monitoring and enforcement is likely to be lower with a smaller number of reception facilities compared with a larger number of shipboard systems.id.at.the coast guard also found that onshore treatment was generally less expensive per metric ton of ballast water than shipboard treatment.id.at.
of course,onshore treatment has many costs,including the cost of retrofitting vessels for onshore facilities,particularly ships from outside the united states,and the cost of shipping delays created by the time it takes to discharge ballast onshore though presumably shipboard treatment is not instantaneous.costs alone,however,can not determine bat.see b b.furthermore,epa failed to perform the economic analysis required to determine relative costs of the differing technologies in reaching its conclusion that onshore treatment was not economically achievable.see waterkeeper,at t he administrator is obligated to inquire into the initial and annual costs of applying the technology and make an affirmative determination that those costs can be reasonably borne by the industry.quoting riverkeeper,epa,cir wildlife fed epa,although its analysis may be general,epa has the heaviest of obligations to explain and expose every step of its reasoning.this duty to explain arises out of the need for reviewing courts to be able to discern the basis for epa decision.internal citations omitted quoting am.lung ass epa.
in light of these observations,the sab and nas committee scientists concluded that epa should conduct a comprehensive analysis comparing biological effectiveness,cost,logistics,operations,and safety associated with both shipboard treatment and reception facilities.app.at.if that analysis indicate d that treatment at reception facilities is both economically and logistically feasible and is more effective than shipboard treatment systems,it should be used as the basis for assessing the ability of available technologies to meet a given discharge standard.id.epa chose not to do so because the sab did not specify a timetable for that complex endeavor or suggest that is was possible to complete such an analysis in time to inform the impending vgp.epa br.at.we do not find that answer compelling.there is no impediment to engaging in further study,and further study may advance the goals of the cwa.
thus,epa could have well found that onshore treatment was available.indeed,epa failure to consider onshore treatment is inconsistent with the cwa mandate that tbels be.congress designed the cwa to force agencies and permittees to adopt technologies that achieve the greatest reductions in pollutants.see nrdc,at holding that cwa seeks not only to stimulate but to press development of new,more efficient and effective technologies,which is the essential purpose of this series of progressively more demanding standards.as judge starr noted in nrdc,the most salient characteristic of this statutory scheme,articulated time and again by its architects and embedded in the statutory language,is that it is.id.at.
epa decision on this issue matters.as the sab scientists pointed out,epa choice of system in this permit will have a impact 
s hipboard treatment and onshore treatment represent distinct approaches to ballast water management that would each require different large investments in infrastructure thus we are almost certain to be stuck for a very long time with whichever approach is used as the bat in setting discharge standards in.it is thus of the utmost urgency that a fair and thorough comparison of the two approaches be made at this time.
app.at emphasis added.we conclude that epa failed to give fair and thorough consideration to both onshore and shipboard treatment systems in setting the standard in the vgp,and we remand to epa to give full consideration to the issue now.
viruses and protists 
petitioners also complain about the lack of numeric tbels for viruses and protists primarily organisms.epa argues,however,that it could not set tbels for viruses and protists in the vgp because epa could not yet identify suitable standardized test organisms surrogate parameters to determine treatment system performance at removing or eliminating viruses and protists and which also can be used in establishing discharge limitations.app.at see also app.at epa does not believe that there are sufficient data available to establish numeric limits for protists or other bacteria.
we agree that it was not arbitrary and capricious for epa to decline to set tbels for organisms for which it is unable to test and for which it has insufficient data to set numeric limits.see balt.gas nrdc,d a reviewing court must remember that where the agency is making predictions,within its area of special expertise,at the frontiers of science as opposed to simple findings of fact,a reviewing court must generally be at its most deferential.petitioners have not demonstrated that sufficient data are available.epa has represented that it will consider including numeric tbels for viruses and protists in the next version of the.at.this is sufficient.

petitioners allege that epa decision to exempt lakers built before january,from numeric effluent limits of vgp was arbitrary and capricious.epa based this decision on its finding that there was no treatment technology available for these vessels either onboard or onshore.app.at.epa expressed concern about the difficulty of finding effective onboard systems for pre lakers due to their unique operational and design constraints,such as the large volumes of fresh cold water they require,the short duration of their trips,their high pumping rates,and their uncoated ballast tanks.id.at in reaching that conclusion,epa relied on the sab report,which advised that specific constraints can greatly limit treatment options for lakers.id.at.epa also cited the costs of implementing these systems.id.at.
we agree with petitioners that exempting the pre lakers was arbitrary and capricious.first,the lack of supply of updated shipboard systems is not a legitimate reason to exempt pre lakers from the vgp,as,again,the purpose of bat is to force technology to keep pace with need.see nrdc,at.
second,epa decision was based on a flawed record that failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,namely the possibility of onshore treatment.see islander pipeline,at.epa should have engaged in a analysis comparing onshore treatment with shipboard treatment,rather than dismissing onshore treatment.epa disregarded the sab recommendation that onshore treatment would benefit pre lakers that are engaged solely in regional trade.id.at.the sab points out that the space and power constraints posed by pre lakers are largely absent in reception facilities.id.at.epa foreclosure of considering onshore treatments for pre lakers and indeed,all lakers seems shortsighted.see supra at.
third,epa imposed the vgp on lakers built after,even though post lakers face many of the same challenges and constraints as pre lakers,such as their short voyages,high pumping rates,and freshwater environment while it is true that shipbuilders were on notice that post lakers would be subject to the vgp,in reality post boats appear to be similarly situated to pre lakers.see islander pipeline,at agency decision is arbitrary and capricious when agency offers explanation for decision that runs counter to evidence before agency.thus,distinguishing pre and post lakers was arbitrary and capricious.
the sab report supports our conclusion.although the sab report acknowledged the limitations in treating ballast water from lakers,it did not declare such treatment impossible.instead,the sab concluded that in light of these limitations,a variety of environmental,temperature and salinity,operational,ballasting flow rates and holding times,and vessel design,ballast volume and unmanned barges parameters should be considered in determining the treatment standards.app.at.
epa exemption of the pre lakers from the vgp was also arbitrary and capricious due to epa failure to conduct an appropriate and analysis.such an analysis might have shown that the cost of subjecting pre lakers to the vgp was not unreasonably high,or,alternatively,that onshore treatment was economically feasible.for all these reasons,epa decision to exempt pre lakers from the vgp was arbitrary and capricious.
under the cwa,npdes permits must include wqbels where the tbels are insufficient to maintain water quality standards.b c d vii a.here,epa concluded that even at the imo level of discharge,reasonable potential exists for such discharges to cause or contribute to violations of applicable water quality standards pursuant to d ii.app.at.to address this concern,epa established wqbels to ensure compliance with water quality standards.epa,however,chose to create narrative wqbels because it believed numeric wqbels were infeasible to calculate 
the wqbel in the vgp states 
your discharge must be controlled as necessary to meet applicable water quality standards in the receiving water body or another water body impacted by your discharges.
vgp,at.in defending this standard,epa relied in part on the nas report,which stated that t he current state of science does not allow a quantitative evaluation of the relative merits of various discharge standards in terms of invasion probability.app.at.
petitioners argue that this narrative wqbel does not ensure compliance with water quality standards.we agree.this narrative standard is insufficient to give a shipowner guidance as to what is expected or to allow any permitting authority to determine whether a shipowner is violating water quality standards.by requiring shipowners to control discharges as necessary to meet applicable water quality standards without giving specific guidance on the discharge limits,epa fails to fulfill its duty to regulat e in fact,not only in principle.waterkeeper,at.as this circuit held in waterkeeper alliance,npdes permits may issue only where such permits ensure that every discharge of pollutants will comply with all applicable effluent limitations and standards.id.that is hardly the case here.epa itself notes that it only generally expects that compliance with the tbels will control discharges as necessary to meet applicable water quality standards.vgp,at.the wqbels,although found by epa to be required to supplement the tbels,in fact add nothing.the wqbels do not state how they will ensure compliance.
even if determining the proper standard is difficult,epa can not simply give up and refuse to issue more specific guidelines.see am.paper,epa,articulating that,even if creating permit limits is difficult,permit writers can not just thr o w up their hands and,contrary to the act,simply ignore water quality standards including narrative criteria altogether when deciding upon permit limitations.scientific uncertainty does not allow epa to avoid responsibility for regulating discharges.see massachusetts epa,d epa can not avoid its statutory obligation by noting the uncertainty surrounding various features of climate change and concluding that it would therefore be better not to regulate at this time.
moreover,epa reliance on the nas report is misplaced.epa concedes that the nas committee did not conclude that it is infeasible to calculate water effluent limits for ballast water discharges.app.at.rather,the nas committee found that it could not formulate a precise standard.in light of this uncertainty,it recommended further study of the issue.but epa declined to engage in further study.see app.at.for all these reasons,epa wqbels were arbitrary and capricious.
epa remaining counterarguments are unavailing.first,epa asserts that petitioners fail to offer examples of meaningful permit limits for wqbels.epa br.at.epa,however,could articulate specific actions that vessels would be required to take to protect against threats.for example,if epa or the shipowner became aware of an unusual risk posed by a specific port,epa could require vessels to take action to avoid such risk at that port,including not uptaking ballast water or not discharging into other ports the contaminated ballast water that was taken up.toward that end,epa has included a set of specific best management practices in the vgp,further demonstrating the viability of this approach.
second,epa argues that under k it may employ bmps instead of n umeric effluent limitations for wqbels when deriving numeric limitations is infeasible.k.bmps include schedules of activities,prohibitions of practices,maintenance procedures,and other management practices to prevent or reduce pollution.id.epa argues that the narrative wqbel is a bmp,and therefore it has discharged its duty under 
but epa narrative wqbel does not qualify as a bmp,as it is neither a practice nor a procedure.bmps typically involve requirements like operating procedures,treatment requirements,practices to control runoff,spillage or leaks,sludge or waste disposal,or drainage from raw material storage they can also be structural requirements including tarpaulins,retention ponds,or devices such as berms to channel water away from pollutant sources,and treatment facilities.see nrdc sw.marine,cir.examples of bmps that have been accepted as substitutes for effluent limits include nutrient management plans for concentrated animal feeding operations,see waterkeeper,at,filtration of stormwater runoff from ditches before it enters rivers and streams by timber companies,and constructing roads with surfacing that minimizes sediment in runoff by timber companies,see decker nw.envtl.def,d.the narrative standard here is nowhere as specific as any of these examples.indeed,it requires nothing more of a shipowner than to meet the tbels.this interpretation is hardly consistent with the regulations that require wqbels to ensure compliance.see auer,at holding that courts should defer to agency interpretation of its own regulations if not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.
third,epa claims that wqbel standards will be sufficiently maintained because epa can take corrective actions after the permittee becomes aware of a violation.app.at.this is not reassuring.the point of a permit is to prevent discharges that violate water quality standards before they happen.see u.b c,a d,d.corrective action is not an effective remedy in an invasive species context it is difficult to eradicate a colony of zebra mussels after they are established.see,great lakes sci,geological survey,zebra mussels cause economic and ecological problems in the great lakes once zebra mussels become established in a water body,they are impossible to eradicate with the technology available today.many chemicals kill zebra mussels,but these exotics are so tolerant and tough that everything in the water would have to be poisoned to destroy the mussel.robbins,a western showdown,at noting that officials in western states have instituted elaborate and expensive inspection systems for boats because they want desperately to keep the mussels out of trout streams and pristine mountain lakes as once established the mussels are impossible to permanently eradicate.this is all the more problematic because a vessel operator is not likely to know it has a discharge violation if,as discussed below,there are no monitoring requirements 
accordingly,epa acted arbitrarily and capriciously in issuing the wqbels because they violate section requirement that npdes permits ensure compliance with the cwa.waterkeeper,at.
intervenors raise one additional argument.under section of the cwa,before epa issues a permit,the state in which the discharge is to occur must either certify,or waive its right to certify,that the discharge will comply with the state water quality standards commonly known as a certification.nrdc,at see also a.b.the intervenors argue that because the certifications have been upheld,the matter is settled the vgp will ensure compliance with the state water quality standards.intervenors br.at.we disagree.epa has an independent duty under the cwa to ensure compliance with state and federal water quality standards and may impose additional permit conditions necessary to meet that end.nrdc,at.such additional permit conditions may be necessary if state water quality standards are potentially less stringent than the cwa,because the cwa provides a federal floor,not a ceiling,on environmental protection.dubois dep t of agriculture,cir citations omitted.
monitoring and reporting requirements for tbels and wqbels 
under the cwa,npdes permits must contain conditions that require both monitoring and reporting of monitoring results of tbels and wqbels to ensure compliance.see a i.the regulations provide,in pertinent part 
in addition to the conditions established under a,each npdes permit shall include conditions meeting the following requirements when applicable.
i monitoring requirements.in addition to,the following monitoring requirements 
to assure compliance with permit limitations,requirements to monitor 
i the mass or other measurement specified in the permit for each pollutant limited in the permit 
ii the volume of effluent discharged from each outfall 
iii other measurements as appropriate including pollutants in internal waste streams under i pollutants in intake water for net limitations under f frequency,rate of discharge,for noncontinuous discharges under e pollutants subject to notification requirements under a and pollutants in sewage sludge or other monitoring as specified in cfr part or as determined to be necessary on a basis pursuant to section d of the cwa.
iv according to sufficiently sensitive test procedures,methods approved under cfr part for the analysis of pollutants or pollutant parameters or required under cfr chapter,subchapter n or 
except as provided in paragraphs i and i of this section,requirements to report monitoring results shall be established on a basis with a frequency dependent on the nature and effect of the discharge,but in no case less than once a year 
enforcing compliance with a permit is the key to an effective npdes program.see nrdc cty.of,cir t he npdes program fundamentally relies on,and congress purpose in adopting this mechanism was to promote straightforward enforcement of the act.internal quotations omitted.we now turn to the monitoring and reporting requirements in the vgp.
monitoring requirements for tbels 
as previously discussed,the vgp requires vessels to monitor the functionality of their ballast water treatment systems,if installed,and the concentrations of the two indicator bacteria coli and enterococci.vgp,at,at.
the first requirement,known as functionality monitoring,determines whether a ballast water treatment program is operating according to the manufacturers requirements.app.at.a shipowner is required to check a measurement that would verify system functionality,such as how much chlorine the system is using each month.id.at.if the measurement is correct,it is assumed that the program is in compliance.if the equipment is not operating properly,the ship is not permitted to discharge ballast.the vessel owner is not required to take any measurement of pollutants or significant categories of living organisms in ballast water being discharged.instead,the shipowner relies solely on the functioning of the treatment system to determine if the ship is complying with the permit.treatment systems are inspected monthly.see vgp,at to assess the system functionality,monitoring indicators of the system functionality is required at least once per month for specific parameters that are applicable to your system.
the second provision,effluent biological organism monitoring,requires vessels to collect samples from ballast discharge and analyze them for concentrations of two indicator pathogens,coli and enterococci.vgp,at.the idea is that if there are significant levels of these two pathogens in the sample,then treatment has not been effective.vessels are not required to monitor vibrio cholera or medium or large organisms regulated in the vgp.sampling is required between one and four times a year,depending on the type of system.
petitioners present two arguments about why these requirements do not accord with the law.first,petitioners argue that the vgp violates cwa regulations by not requiring vessels to monitor the concentration of living organisms.the regulations require monitoring of mass,volume,or other measurement specified in the permit.i i ii.petitioners contend the unit of measurement for living organisms in the vgp should be concentration.neither functionality monitoring nor testing for two indicator microorganisms measures concentration.thus,according to petitioners,the monitoring and reporting requirements for tbels violate i.
second,petitioners argue that these monitoring requirements violate the requirement in i that monitoring assure s compliance with permit limitations.relying on functionality monitoring instead of requiring an actual measurement of concentrations of organisms m
