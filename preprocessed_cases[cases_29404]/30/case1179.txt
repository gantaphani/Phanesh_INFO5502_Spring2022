this appeal stems from the environmental cleanup of a contaminated wetlands site used originally for petroleum production and later as a mobile home park.the current property owner,carson harbor village,carson harbor,brought suit principally under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,et,for reimbursement of costs associated with the cleanup.we are called upon to determine whether,as a matter of law,those cleanup costs were necessary and whether certain of the defendants are potentially responsible parties prps under cercla a,a.
the touchstone for determining the necessity of response costs is whether there is an actual threat to human health or the environment that necessity is not obviated when a party also has a business reason for the cleanup.because the district court erred in focusing on the ulterior business motive for remediation and because there are genuine issues of material fact regarding whether carson harbor response costs were,in fact,necessary,we can not uphold summary judgment on this ground.
even if we assume that those costs were necessary,we still must decide whether defendants carson harbor village mobile home park,richard braley,and walker smith,the partnership defendants are prps if not,summary judgment was nonetheless appropriate.parsing the meaning of the term disposal in a lies at the heart of this question.we conclude that the migration of contaminants on the property does not fall within the statutory definition of disposal.thus,on the cercla claim,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for the partnership defendants.
we must also address the remaining issues.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants city of carson,county of los angeles,and city of compton on carson harbor state claims.finally,with respect to carson harbor claim for indemnity against the partnership defendants,in view of our holding that there are genuine issues of material fact regarding the necessity of carson harbor response costs,we reverse the grant of summary judgment.
background 
carson harbor owns and operates a mobile home park on seventy acres in the city of carson,california.from until,prior to carson harbor ownership,defendant carson harbor village mobile home park,a general partnership controlled by defendants braley and smith the partnership defendants,owned the property.they,like carson harbor,operated a mobile home park on the property.beginning over thirty years earlier,however,from until,unocal corporation held a leasehold interest in the property and used it for petroleum production,operating a number of oil wells,pipelines,storage tanks,and production facilities.
an undeveloped wetlands area covers approximately seventeen acres of the site.properties located upstream from the property are in the cities of carson and compton and unincorporated areas within the county of los angeles,the government defendants.storm water feeds into the wetlands from those properties through storm drains.california highway the artesia freeway,which is operated by the california department of transportation caltrans,is also located immediately upstream from the property.runoff from approximately three miles of the highway drains into the wetlands.
while attempting to refinance the property in,carson harbor discovered hazardous substances on the site.the prospective lender commissioned an environmental assessment,which revealed and slag materials in the wetlands area of the property.subsequent investigation revealed that the materials were a waste or of petroleum production and that they had been on the property for several decades prior to its development as a mobile home park.
much of the and slag materials was covered with soil and vegetation.a portion of the material,however,was visible on the surface in an area measuring approximately twenty feet wide by thirty feet long.the slag material appeared to have been deposited on top of the material and was visible in an area approximately thirty feet by feet.subsequently,it was determined that the contaminated area covered an area approximately feet wide by feet long and extended from one to five feet below the surface.the material and surrounding soils contained elevated levels of petroleum hydrocarbons measured in total petroleum hydrocarbons or tph and lead and soil samples upgradient of the materials also contained elevated levels of lead.these levels exceeded state reporting limits.
as required by law,carson harbor environmental consultants reported their findings to the appropriate agencies.the regional water quality control board the water quality board and its site cleanup unit chief,james ross,assumed the lead in the cleanup effort.carson harbor requested a letter from the water quality board before proposing cleanup,and submitted a remedial action plan rap,proposing to remove the and slag materials and impacted soils.because the highest concentrations of tph and lead contamination were associated with the and slag materials,the rap did not address other areas of elevated tph and lead contamination.ross approved the rap but required carson harbor to bring the contamination down to a lower level than that proposed in the rap.
the and slag materials were removed from the property in.over the course of five days,tons of material were removed.in all but four of the soil samples taken after the cleanup,tph and lead levels were within the limits.the water quality board staff conducted a site visit and independent soil testing.ross then sent a closure letter to carson harbor,stating that 
the removal is complete to the extent required by this board w e have concluded that all the requirements established by this board in our rap approval letter have been complied with.in addition,the contamination has been successfully removed and the remaining soil in the bottom of the watercourse poses no further threat to surface waters of the state.we,therefore,conclude that no further action is required at this site.
in,carson harbor brought suit against the partnership defendants,the government defendants,and unocal seeking relief under federal environmental statutes,cercla,the resource conservation and recovery act rcra,et,and the clean water act cwa,et,and for state common law claims of nuisance,trespass,injury to easement,indemnity,and negligent nondisclosure.carson harbor sought to recover the costs of its cleanup which totaled approximately as well as damages arising from its inability to refinance the property.according to carson harbor,unocal is responsible for dumping the and slag materials on the property the partnership defendants are liable as past owners of the property and the government defendants and caltrans are liable for lead on the property that resulted from storm water runoff,which may have contributed either to the lead found in the and slag materials or the elevated lead levels outside those materials.
the parties stipulated to the dismissal of the negligent nondisclosure claim and for summary judgment on the remaining claims.the district court granted the defendants motions on all claims except the nuisance and trespass claims asserted against unocal.see carson harbor,unocal.the court first held that carson harbor cercla claim fails because it did not show that its remedial action was necessary under a b because there was no evidence of an actual and real threat to human health or the environment.id.at.in so holding,the district court disregarded certain evidence to the contrary as inadmissible hearsay.see id.at.in the alternative,with respect to the partnership defendants,the district court held that they were not prps within the meaning of a because disposal warranting cercla liability requires a showing that hazardous substances were affirmatively introduced into the environment.id.at.and,with respect to the storm water runoff,there was no direct evidence that any storm water entered the property at any time prior to,when carson harbor purchased the property.id.
the district court granted summary judgment on the rcra claim because the evidence shows that there was no imminent danger to human health or the required element for a rcra claim.id.at emphasis added.on the cwa claim,the court concluded that there was no evidence that the defendants violated a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit,as required for a cwa violation.id.at.with respect to the common law claims for nuisance,trespass,and injury to easement against the government defendants,the district court held that cal.civ.code,which provides that nothing done pursuant to express statutory authorization can be deemed a nuisance,provides a complete defense.because carson harbor failed to show that the government defendants violated the npdes permits,the court concluded,any pollutants discharged into the storm water were permissible.id.finally,the district court rejected carson harbor claim for express indemnity against the partnership defendants,because the water quality board did not require the cleanup.see id.at.
carson harbor appealed the district court rulings on the cercla claim,the claims against the government defendants,and the indemnity claim against the partnership defendants following the issuance of a panel opinion,we agreed to hear this case en banc

cercla overview 
cercla generally imposes strict liability on owners and operators of facilities at which hazardous substances were disposed.stevens creek assocs.barclays bank,cir.to achieve that end,cercla authorizes private parties to institute civil actions to recover the costs involved in the cleanup of hazardous wastes from those responsible for their creation.accord pinal creek group,at section a authorizes suits against certain statutorily defined responsible parties to recover costs incurred in cleaning up hazardous waste disposal sites.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
to prevail in a private cost recovery action,a plaintiff must establish that the site on which the hazardous substances are contained is a facility under cercla definition of that term,section,a release or threatened release of any hazardous substance from the facility has occurred,a such release or threatened release has caused the plaintiff to incur response costs that were necessary and consistent with the national contingency plan,a and a b and the defendant is within one of four classes of persons subject to the liability provisions of section a.
stevens creek,at footnote omitted.the third and fourth of these elements are at issue here.
with respect to the fourth element,a sets out the four classes of persons subject to the liability provisions.id.those persons are potentially responsible parties or prps.see pritikin dep t of energy,cir.we must decide in this case whether the partnership defendants fit within the second prp category namely,whether they owned the contaminated property at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance.a.
also relevant to our analysis,although not the basis of the judgment here,is the fact that even if the plaintiff establishes the requisite four elements for recovery,a defendant may assert a variety of defenses to liability.most relevant here are the third party and innocent landowner defenses,by which a prp may show that the release of hazardous substances was caused solely by an act or omission of a third party,b,or that the disposal or placement of the hazardous substance occurred before the prp acquired the property.a.in this way,the interpretation of disposal affects the application of these defenses.see infra section.
once liability is established,the defendant may avoid joint and several liability by establishing that it caused only a divisible portion of the example,it contributed only a specific part of the hazardous substances that spilled.even if a defendant can not do so,it may seek contribution from other prps under f.see pinal creek group,at noting that congress amendment of cercla to include f clarif ies and confirm s that contribution is available to prps.a prp contribution liability will correspond to that party equitable share of the total liability and will not be joint and several.id.at.the contribution provision aims to avoid a variety of scenarios by which a comparatively innocent prp might be on the hook for the entirety of a large cleanup bill.
ii.genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on whether the sresponse costs were necessary 
remediation costs are recoverable under cercla only if necessary.it is generally agreed that this standard requires that an actual and real threat to human health or the environment exist before initiating a response action.see,epa sequa in re bell petroleum,cir southfund partners iii sears,roebuck,d,foster united states,yellow freight,acf,leasing union,aff,cir.
although the district court correctly referenced this standard,it went on to follow the ulterior motive analysis established by the district court in leasing.at.there,the court held that,to the extent cleanup activities are taken for reasons other than because of an actual and real public health threat,cleanup costs are not necessary.id.because there was evidence in leasing that the cleanup of asbestos contamination was motivated by business reasons specifically,the desire to convert the property to new uses,the court held that the cleanup costs were not necessary.accord foster.at yellow freight.at.
in concluding that carson harbor response costs were not necessary,the district court relied on leasing ulterior motive analysis.specifically,it relied on the testimony of james ross,the water quality board site cleanup unit chief.ross testified that he would n ot likely have required carson harbor to cleanup the site if carson harbor had not come to him with a remediation plan 
q i f the owners had not come to you with a remediation plan,if they had simply reported to you that this is what we see here,would you have required them to develop some remediation plan 
a not likely.
q as far as you were concerned,this stuff,even the slag and material,could have just stayed there 
a very likely.
q so,then,basically,this remediation was done at their initiative for their own reasons and not because of any environmental or health problem that was perceived by the regional board 
carson harbor.at.
the district court reliance on this testimony highlights its adoption of the leasing analysis and its decision to disregard evidence that created a genuine issue of material fact on the linchpin issue of necessity.in determining whether response costs are necessary,we focus not on whether a party has a business or other motive in cleaning up the property,but on whether there is a threat to human health or the environment and whether the response action is addressed to that threat.it is unrealistic to believe that clean up is necessarily motivated by eleemosynary factors.although a private plaintiff will almost always have a business or financial motive for cleaning up a site,such subjective intent is simply not part of the calculus.rather,we focus on the objective circumstances of each case.the issue is not why the landowner decided to undertake the cleanup,but whether it was necessary.see cadillac,dow chem,cir necessity is a factual question.to hold otherwise would result in a disincentive for cleanup.indeed,the cleanup may be motivated by many factors,such as fear of a government enforcement action,landowner liability,and even economic reasons.
nor must a plaintiff show agency action as a prerequisite to cost recovery.agency inaction is not dispositive of the question whether contamination presents an environmental risk worthy of response.see id.t he district court erred in ruling that some governmental entity must authorize and initiate a response action for that action to be necessary and consistent with the national contingency plan.nl,kaplan,cir holding that response costs can be necessary even though the agency that required cleanup never approved the response actions taken.whether the water quality board would have ordered remediation is not a definitive determination of whether there is a health or environmental risk.
although agency inaction is not dispositive,an actual agency cleanup order is highly relevant and,in some cases,compelling on the necessity question.here,there was conflicting evidence on this point.some evidence in the record also suggests that the water quality board required the remediation and that it perceived a threat to public health or the environment.in his deposition,ross conceded that lead contamination from the tar and slag material presented a threat to surface and groundwater 
q do you agree that this project was a surface water quality protection issue 
a in part,yes.
q what do you mean in part 
a well,it also has the potential to be groundwater.
q okay.so do you think that there might be a threat to groundwater as a result of the contamination on the property 
a certainly occurred to me.
q what hazardous substances on the property did you think were a threat to groundwater 
a lead primarily.
q did the levels of lead that were found on this property have the potential to get into the groundwater 
a yes,the soluble lead.
ross also testified that the level of lead contamination on the property would require something to be done.
a review of the water quality board conduct also supports the conclusion that it perceived a threat to public health or the environment the board withheld the letter carson harbor consultant requested shortly after he sent the initial notice of contamination on the property.instead of adopting the consultant recommended cleanup levels,the board required lower lead levels.and,after the cleanup,a board representative inspected the site to verify that the contamination had been adequately remedied before it issued the letter.finally,the letter predicates closure on a finding that the remaining soil in the bottom of the watercourse poses no further threat to surface waters of the state.
the district court also excluded certain evidence as hearsay,namely,the testimony of carson harbor expert,environmental consultant hassan amini,and a memorandum written by a unocal employee.in marked contrast to ross testimony that in the first instance a remediation would likely not have been required,amini testified that the water quality board ordered the cleanup,and the memorandum corroborates that testimony,as does correspondence between amini and ross.
when properly considered,this evidence of ross prior inconsistent statements creates a genuine issue of material fact about whether carson harbor response costs were necessary.this evidence falls within the basic rule of evidence that prior inconsistent statements may be used to impeach the credibility of a witness.united states hale,d accord united states bao,cir b ecause a declarant prior inconsistent statement is not offered for its truth,it is not hearsay.in addition,experts are entitled to rely on hearsay in forming their opinions.see.if the underlying facts or data are of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject,the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence in order for the opinion or inference to be admitted.united states mccollum,cir applying rule to affirm the admission of expert testimony based on hearsay.thus,the evidence was admissible because it was part of the basis for amini expert opinion about whether the contamination posed a threat to public health or the environment such that the water quality board would require cleanup.the district court therefore erred by disregarding this evidence.
in light of this conflicting evidence,genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on the issue of whether carson harbor response costs were necessary.therefore,with respect to unocal and the government defendants the district court erred by granting summary judgment in their favor on the cercla claim.we discuss the cercla claim against the partnership defendants,below.
we decline to address in the first instance the government defendants remaining cercla arguments,including their arguments that they are,nevertheless,entitled to summary judgment because carson harbor response costs were not consistent with the national contingency plan,see a b because federally permitted releases are exempt from cercla coverage under j and because the third party defense applies.we leave these issues for the district court consideration on remand.
iii.the contaminant migration at issue here is not a disposal under cercla 
the fourth element of carson harbor cost recovery action requires a showing that the defendant falls within one of four classes of persons subject to liability under a.kaiser aluminum chem.catellus dev,cir accord f any person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section a.those four categories of persons are potentially responsible parties or prps.
to determine whether the partnership defendants are prps,we must decide whether there was a disposal during their ownership of the property.this inquiry rests on our interpretation of the statutory definition of disposal.based upon the plain meaning of the statute,we conclude that there was no disposal during the partnership defendants ownership.therefore,they are not prps,and they are not subject to liability.accordingly,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in their favor on the cercla issue.
prps,the meaning of disposal,and circuit court interpretations 
section a,which sets out the four prp categories,provides 
the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility,
any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of,
any person who by contract,agreement,or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment,or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment,of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person,by any other party or entity,at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances,and 
any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities,incineration vessels or sites selected by such person,from which there is a release,or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs,of a hazardous substance,shall be liable 
a emphasis added.carson harbor argues that the partnership defendants fit within the second prp category as owners of the property at the time of disposal under a.
cercla defines disposal for purposes of a with reference to the definition of disposal in rcra,see,which in turn defines disposal as follows 
the term disposal means the discharge,deposit,injection,dumping,spilling,leaking,or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water so that such solid waste or hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters,including ground waters.
emphasis added.under this definition,for the partnership defendants to be prps,there must have been a discharge,deposit,injection,dumping,spilling,leaking,or placing of contaminants on the property during their ownership.id.
although we have previously concluded that rcra definition of disposal is clear,stevens creek,at,whether the definition includes passive soil migration is an issue of first impression in this circuit.other circuit courts have taken a variety of approaches.those opinions can not be shoehorned into the dichotomy of a classic circuit split.rather,a careful reading of their holdings suggests a more nuanced range of views,depending in large part on the factual circumstances of the case.compare united states acres of land,cir concluding that absent any evidence that there was human activity involved in whatever movement of hazardous substances occurred on the property,there is no disposal,abb indus,prime,cir holding that prior owners are not liable for the gradual spread of contamination underground,and united states cdmg realty,cir t he passive spreading of contamination in a landfill does not constitute disposal under cercla,with nurad,william hooper sons,cir holding past owners liable for the disposal of hazardous wastes that leaked from an underground storage tank.
the first circuit court to face the question was the fourth circuit in nurad.there,the court addressed whether leaking from underground storage tanks is a disposal.at.the current owner brought suit against two prior owners for reimbursement costs under cercla,claiming that the past owners were prps under a.id.at.the court rejected the approach,stating 
t his circuit has already rejected the strained reading of disposal which would limit its meaning to active human conduct.united states waste,cir.in waste industries,the court held that congress intended the definition of disposal to have a range of meanings,including not only active conduct,but also the reposing of hazardous waste and its subsequent movement through the environment.id.at.
id.at.the fourth circuit concluded that a imposes liability not only for active involvement in the dumping or placing of hazardous waste at the facility,but for ownership of the facility at a time that hazardous waste was spilling or leaking.
id.at accord crofton ventures.g h,cir holding that,g iven the breadth of the statutory definition of disposal,the district court must be able to conclude that the buried drums did not leak when the defendants owned or operated the facility to make a finding that they were not liable under a.
four years later,in cdmg realty,the third circuit addressed whether the spread of contamination within a landfill is a disposal.at.there,as in nurad,the current owner of contaminated property sought contribution from the prior owner,asserting that the prior owner was a prp under a.id.the third circuit held,based on the plain meaning of the words used to define disposal and the structure and purposes of cercla,see id.at,that the passive migration of contamination dumped in the land prior to the past owner ownership does not constitute disposal,id.at.the court specifically declined,however,to reach the question whether the movement of contaminants unaided by human conduct can ever constitute disposal,concluding that w hile leaking and spilling may not require affirmative human conduct,neither word denotes the gradual spreading of contamination alleged here.id.at.
the next year,the second circuit,in abb industrial systems,similarly addressed whether a current owner could recover cleanup costs under a from several companies that had previously controlled the property.at.as in cdmg realty,the second circuit addressed whether there was a disposal where hazardous chemicals continued to gradually spread underground while the defendants controlled the property.id.at.the second circuit,relying on the third circuit analysis of cercla language,structure,and purposes in cdmg realty,affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants,holding that prior owners and operators of a site are not liable under cercla for mere passive migration.id.at.the court stated 
t here is no genuine issue of triable fact as to whether the dismissed defendants spilled chemicals or otherwise contaminated the property moreover,although hazardous chemicals may have gradually spread underground while the dismissed defendants controlled the property passive migration,we conclude that prior owners are not liable under cercla for passive migration 
id.at.the second circuit,however,express ed no opinion on whether prior owners are liable if they acquired a site with leaking barrels and the prior owner actions are purely passive.id.at.
in acres of land,the sixth circuit interpreted disposal for purposes of the innocent landowner defense.at.in that context,the sixth circuit explicitly required active conduct for a disposal.see id.at.the court concluded that the current owners,whose status as prps arises under a,acquired the property after the disposal under,because there is no disposal i n the absence of any evidence that there was human activity involved in whatever movement of hazardous substances occurred on the property since the current owners have owned it.see also bob beverage,acme,cir.
in sum,although all of the cases reference the distinction in some manner,there is no clear dichotomy among the cases that have interpreted disposal.rather,the cases fall in a continuum,with the sixth circuit taking an approach in acres of land the third circuit,in cdmg realty,and the second circuit,in abb industrial systems,addressing only the spread of contamination and leaving open whether migration must always be active to be a disposal and,finally,the fourth circuit in nurad,concluding that disposal includes passive migration,at least in the context of leaking underground storage tanks.
we have not addressed whether disposal in a includes the passive movement of contamination.we have held,however,that the movement of contamination that does result from human conduct is a disposal.see kaiser aluminum chem,at holding that disposal under a includes a party movement and spreading of contaminated soil to uncontaminated portions of property and that congress did not limit disposal to the initial introduction of hazardous material onto property in another context,we have held that disposal refers only to an affirmative act of discarding a substance as waste,and not to the productive use of the substance.stevens creek,at concluding that there was no disposal of asbestos in a building when it was installed for use as insulation and fire retardant.we have also held that the definition of disposal is the same under a and a.see id.because the disposal definition applicable to actions under a and a is the same,and there is no meaningful difference for purposes of cercla between a party who sells or transports a product containing or composed of hazardous substances for a productive use,and a party who actually puts that product to its constructive use,we see no reason to adopt a different definition in this case.
statutory construction 
when interpreting a statute,o ur task is to construe what congress has enacted.duncan walker,d.w e look first to the plain language of the statute,construing the provisions of the entire law,including its object and policy,to ascertain the intent of congress.northwest forest res.council glickman,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we will resort to legislative history,even where the plain language is unambiguous,where the legislative history clearly indicates that congress meant something other than what it said.perlman catapult entm t,in re catapult entm t,cir.the plain meaning of the terms used to define disposal compels the conclusion that there was no disposal during the partnership defendants ownership,because the movement of the contamination,even if it occurred during their ownership,can not be characterized as a discharge,deposit,injection,dumping,spilling,leaking,or placing.this approach is consistent with cercla purposes,minimizes internal inconsistency in the statute,and presents no conflict with cercla legislative history.
plain meaning 
we begin,as always,with the language of the statute.duncan.at accord perlman,at.in examining the statutory language,we follow the supreme court instruction and adhere to the plain meaning rule 
it is elementary that the meaning of a statute must,in the first instance,be sought in the language in which the act is framed,and if that is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.
where the language is plain and admits of no more than one meaning the duty of interpretation does not arise,and the rules which are to aid doubtful meanings need no discussion.
caminetti united states.citations omitted accord negonsott samuels,d.
when a statute includes an explicit definition,however,we must follow that definition,even if it varies from that term ordinary meaning.stenberg carhart,d.therefore,we return to the definition of disposal.under,there is a disposal when there has been a 
leaking,or 
of solid or hazardous wastes on the property.cercla does not define these terms,but we gain some insight into their statutory meaning by examining cercla definition of release,which includes some of the words used to define disposal,as well as the word disposing 
the term release means any spilling,leaking,pumping,pouring,emitting,emptying,discharging,injecting,escaping,leaching,dumping,or disposing into the environment including the abandonment or discarding of barrels,containers,and other closed receptacles containing any hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant 
emphasis added.
we must presume that words used more than once in the same statute have the same meaning.boise cascade united states envtl.prot.agency,cir.therefore,from these definitions,we can conclude that release is broader than disposal,because the definition of release includes disposing also,it includes passive terms such as leaching and escaping,which are not included in the definition of disposal.but,at the same time,the definitions of disposal and release have several words in common discharge discharging injection injecting dumping spilling and leaking.
we thus focus on the plain meanings of the terms used to define disposal.we first note that one can find both active and passive definitions for nearly all of these terms in any standard dictionary we therefore reject the absolute binary distinction used by some courts.indeed,the substantial overlap in terms used to define disposal and release and the presence of both active and passive terms in both definitions suggests that something other than an distinction governs the terms.
instead of focusing solely on whether the terms are active or passive,we must examine each of the terms in relation to the facts of the case and determine whether the movement of contaminants is,under the plain meaning of the terms,a disposal.put otherwise,do any of the terms fit the hazardous substance contamination at issue 
examining the facts of this case,we hold that the gradual passive migration of contamination through the soil that allegedly took place during the partnership defendants ownership was not a discharge,deposit,injection,dumping,spilling,leaking,or placing and,therefore,was not a disposal within the meaning of a.the contamination on the property included and slag materials.the material was highly viscous and uniform,without any breaks or stratification.the slag material had a vesicular structure and was more porous and rigid than the material.there was some evidence that the material moved through the soil and that lead tph may have moved from that material into the soil.if we try to characterize this passive soil migration in plain english,a number of words come to mind,including gradual spreading,migration,seeping,oozing,and possibly leaching.but certainly none of those words fits within the plain and common meaning of discharge,injection,dumping,or placing.although these words generally connote active conduct,even if we were to infuse passive meanings,these words simply do not describe the passive migration that occurred here.nor can the gradual spread here be characterized as a deposit,because there was neither a deposit by someone,nor does the term deposit encompass the gradual spread of contaminants the term spilling is likewise inapposite.nothing spilled out of or over anything.unlike the spilling of a barrel or the spilling over of a holding pond,movement of the and slag materials was not a spill.
of the terms defining disposal,the only one that might remotely describe the passive soil migration here is leaking.but under the plain and common meaning of the word,we conclude that there was no leaking.the circumstances here are not like that of the leaking barrel or underground storage tank envisioned by congress,as discussed infra,or a vessel or some other container that would connote leaking.therefore,there was no disposal,and the partnership defendants are not prps.on this basis,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the partnership defendants on the cercla claim.
in adopting this plain meaning construction,we are mindful that the statute will be applied in a myriad of circumstances,many of which we can not predict today.and although most of the terms generally connote active conduct,we agree with the third circuit that,for example,leaking and spilling may not require affirmative human conduct,although neither word denotes the gradual spreading of contamination alleged here.cdmg realty,at.this approach does not rule out the scenario in which spilling,leaking,or perhaps other terms in some circumstances,encompasses passive migration.as discussed below,this approach is consistent with the purpose of cercla.
reading the statute as a whole 
no statutory provision is written in a vacuum.complex regulatory statutes,in particular,often create a,in the case of cercla,perhaps a sections,subsections,definitions,exceptions,defenses,and administrative provisions.thus,we examine the statute as a whole,including its purpose and various provisions.see mccarthy bronson,d in ascertaining the plain meaning of a statute,the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.quoting k mart cartier,d.
as outlined in section i,cercla is structured in such a way as to,first,implicate a range of operators,owners,and transporters as prps second,offer certain of these prps affirmative defenses that allow them to avoid liability entirely and third,provide judicial or administrative mechanisms limiting liability or encouraging early settlement.the interpretation of disposal controls the scope of parties designated as prps thus,it has ripple effects on the applicability and effectiveness of the available defenses and administrative tools that complete the statutory structure.in examining this statute as a whole,then,we assess whether our interpretation of disposal is in accord with the statute purpose,and creates or minimizes any internal inconsistency in cercla.
statutory purpose 
cercla was enacted to protect and preserve public health and the environment by facilitating the expeditious and efficient cleanup of hazardous waste sites.pritikin,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted accord stevens creek,at cercla was enacted to provide for liability,compensation,cleanup,and emergency response for hazardous substances released into the environment and the cleanup of inactive hazardous waste disposal sites.quoting,stat.but cercla also has a secondary that responsible persons pay for the cleanup 
cercla was a response by congress to the threat to public health and the environment posed by the widespread use and disposal of hazardous substances.its purpose was to ensure the prompt and effective cleanup of waste disposal sites,and to assure that parties responsible for hazardous substances bore the cost of remedying the conditions they created.
pinal creek group,at quoting mardan music,cir.we construe cercla liberally to achieve these goals.kaiser aluminum,at.at the same time,we have cautioned that we must reject a construction that the statute on its face does not permit,and the legislative history does not support.stevens creek,at.
our conclusion that disposal does not include passive soil migration but that it may include other passive migration that fits within the plain meaning of the terms used to define disposal is consistent with cercla dual purposes.holding passive owners responsible for migration of contaminants that results from their conduct and for passive migration ensures the prompt and effective cleanup of abandoned storage tanks,which,as discussed infra,is one of the problems congress sought to address when enacting cercla.indeed,if disposal is interpreted to exclude all passive migration,there would be little incentive for a landowner to examine his property for decaying disposal tanks,prevent them from spilling or leaking,or to clean up contamination once it was found.
internal consistency and avoiding illogical results 
our interpretation of disposal also makes sense within the liability provisions of sections identifying the parties that are potentially responsible.as explained in section,cercla creates four categories of prps current owners or operators,owners or operators at the time of a disposal,arrangers,and transporters.see a.this categorization makes the best sense only under a interpretation of disposal the extreme positions on either side render the structure awkward.for example,had congress intended all passive migration to constitute a disposal,then disposal is nearly always a perpetual process.see,cdmg realty,at.hence,every landowner after the first disposal would be liable,and there would be no reason to divide owners and operators into categories of former and current.see,id.at ecodyne shah.on the other extreme,had congress intended disposal to include only releases directly caused by affirmative human conduct,then it would make no sense to establish a strict liability scheme assigning responsibility to any person who at the time of disposal owned or operated any facility.a.rather,the statute would have a straightforward causation requirement.
similarly,our interpretation of disposal is sensible in light of cercla twin concepts of disposal,on one hand,and release,on the other.as explained in section i,cercla holds a prp liable for a disposal that releases or threatens to release hazardous substances into the environment.some courts,examining this structure,note that it would be reasonable to conclude that congress meant disposal and release to mean entirely different other words,because release clearly requires no affirmative human conduct,disposal must be limited to affirmative human actions that make possible a release.see,acres of land,at i t makes sense to have disposal stand for activity that precedes the entry of a substance into the environment and release stand for the actual entry of substances in to the environment.
working on a blank slate,it might make sense to design a statute with such,distinct,and interlocking concepts.sadly,the words of the statute stand in the way of such an easy explanation.the definition of disposal,as we have noted,includes the terms discharge,deposit,injection,dumping,spilling,leaking,or placing.the definition of release includes spilling,leaking,pumping,pouring,emitting,emptying,discharging,injecting,escaping,leaching,dumping,or disposing.even a quick glance reveals two important aspects of these definitions.first,each term encompasses some form of five words dump,spill,discharge,injection,and leaking.second,release even incorporates the term disposing itself.
this structure defeats the notion that the two terms are mutually exclusive,or that subtle differences between them mean that disposal always requires affirmative human conduct and release does not.with five terms in common,the definitions compel the conclusion that there is at least substantial overlap between disposal and release,and the overlap includes some of those terms whose definitions do not necessarily require human conduct,such as spilling and leaking.thus,we reject the interpretation that the difference in the definitions requires us to put a gloss on disposal that would make the terms mutually exclusive 
this analysis suggests that the interpretation of disposal makes a good fit with the first part of cercla overall assignment of presumptive liability to various parties.
cercla next allows certain prps to avoid liability by asserting various defenses.most relevant here is the innocent owner defense,which absolves from liability landowners who can show that the real property on which the facility concerned is located was acquired by the defendant after the disposal or placement of the hazardous substance on,in,or at the facility and that a t the time the defendant acquired the facility the defendant did not know and had no reason to know that any hazardous substance which is the subject of the release or threatened release was disposed of on,in,or at the facility.a.our interpretation of disposal preserves the purpose and role of this defense within the statutory structure.the alternatives,on the other hand,would render the defense either impossible to present or entirely superfluous.
were we to adopt an interpretation of disposal that encompassed all subsoil passive migration,the innocent landowner defense would be essentially eliminated.as discussed above,in all but a tiny fraction of cases such an interpretation would lead to the conclusion that disposal is a process,rendering liable every landowner after the initial disposal.for those subsequent landowners,the innocent landowner defense would be available only if one could show that the land was purchased after the hazardous substances were placed there.thus,the defense would only be available to a small portion of the landowners who have no actual culpability in the disposal of the hazardous substances.
commentators have written the obituary for the innocent landowner defense many times since it was created in.see,rosemary beless,superfund innocent landowner defense guilty until proven innocent,land resources envtl.shane clanton,passive disposal of the innocent landowner defense,nat.resources envtl.jager smith,note,cercla innocent landowner defense oasis or mirage,colum.envtl.and,to be sure,congress intended the defense to be very narrowly applicable,for fear that it might be subject to abuse.see infra section.nevertheless,we need not narrow the defense any more than congress did in creating it.
the opposite extreme is no better fit.were we to interpret disposal to include only actions caused by affirmative human conduct,we would eliminate the need for an innocent landowner defense altogether.such an interpretation of disposal would exclude from liability even a landowner whose facilities spill or leak without affirmative human is,anything short of an intentional dump during an owner tenure.under this interpretation,there would exist no landowner capable of presenting an innocent landowner defense who would not already be excluded from liability in the first place we doubt,even in the uncertain world of cercla,that congress went to the trouble of amending the statute to create a defense that no one would need.
our interpretation,on the other hand,preserves the defense and confirms the role chosen for it by congress.it must be acknowledged,however,that our interpretation of disposal does not leave a seamless statute.the defense is phrased so as to extend to those who purchase property after disposal or placement.a emphasis added.courts facing this wording have read it in a number of ways.some have concluded that or placement is surplusage,and can be discarded.see cdmg realty,at concluding that the innocent landowner defense is available only after the disposal see also robert bronston,note,the case against intermediate owner liability for passive migration of hazardous waste.we are bound,though,to give meaning to every word of a statute.frustratingly,this canon of construction leads to the shortest of logical in this case.if we give meaning to both disposal and placement,how are the words different,particularly if we consider that placement is included in the statutory definition of disposal and if the defense is available to anyone who purchases after disposal,why repeat placement a mere subcategory of disposal 
clearly,neither a logician nor a grammarian will find comfort in the world of cercla.it is not our task,however,to clean up the baffling language congress gave us by deleting the words or placement or the word disposal from the innocent landowner defense.transported to washington,in or,armed with a red pen and a copy of strunk white elements of style,we might offer a few clarifying suggestions.but in this time and place,we can only conclude that congress meant what it said,and offered the innocent landowner defense to both those who purchased land after disposal or after placement,thereby giving disposal its statutory meaning and placement its ordinary one,despite their overlap.
in sum,we conclude that the interpretation of disposal preserves the scope and the role of the defenses established by congress.
the third part of cercla structure includes a variety of provisions that instruct courts or the agency how to administer the liability provisions.these provisions,for example,allow a court to allocate liability on the basis of culpability,see,pinal creek group,at create a system by which de minimis contributors can escape joint and several liability,g and authorize administrative policies encouraging early settlement with the epa,shielding the settler from suit by other parties,see infra note.these mechanisms are often overlooked,but are crucial to the realities of cercla administration and litigation.none of them has a direct impact on the interpretation of the term disposal,so we will not discuss them in detail.but each of them,in different ways,attempts to ensure that a prp with minimal as an owner without culpability but outside the technical parameters of the innocent owner not get stuck with more than his fair share of the financial responsibility for cleanup.in the administration of the statute as a whole,these are the provisions that allow a court or the epa to ensure that the parade of liability of the landowner,the contributor,or the unknowing not come to pass 
based on this analysis,we conclude that the plain meaning interpretation of disposal is consistent with the statute both in its constituent parts and as a whole.
legislative history 
because the conclusion we reach is compelled by the plain meaning of the statute text,our inquiry into legislative history is strictly limited.although the supreme court has advised that recourse to legislative history is not necessary where a statute plain meaning is clear,the court does suggest that we review the legislative history to ensure that there is no clearly contrary congressional intent.see,salinas united states,d dunn commodity futures trading comm n,d darby cisneros,d john doe agency john doe,d here,we scan cercla legislative history to determine whether intentions contrary to the plain meaning are present.our review reveals no such indication.on the contrary,the available materials demonstrate that the public,the epa,and drafters of the legislation used and understood the words discharge,deposit,injection,dumping,spilling,leaking,or placing in their ordinary,sense,encompassing events both caused by affirmative human conduct and,particularly in the case of spill and leak,occurring solely in a passive context as well.because we find no indication that congress intended anything other than what it said,we present here only a few brief examples.
any inquiry into cercla legislative history is somewhat of a snark hunt.like other courts that have examined the legislative history,we have found few truly relevant documents.see,cdmg realty,at.this is not surprising,given the circumstances surrounding the bill passage one searches in vain for committee reports or floor statements explaining the purpose of subtle or even dramatic changes from early versions of the bill to final passage see generally frank grad,a legislative history of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability superfund act of,colum.envtl.nevertheless,those materials that do exist confirm the interpretation of disposal.
as an initial matter,it is evident that cercla primary targets included spills and leaks from abandoned at which there was no longer any affirmative human activity.the two incidents of hazardous substance contamination that most prominently prompted congressional canal and the valley of the drums were both abandoned hazardous waste sites that were described as spilling or leaking with no affirmative human conduct.
hearing testimony further confirmed that both the epa and the legislators understood that hazardous substances legislation would deal with a wide range of disposal events,not predicated on an dichotomy.epa assistant administrator thomas jorling testified that one common problem is abandoned sites with barrels and tanks leaking,allowing contamination of surface and ground waters and frequently producing a severe fire or explosion potential the effects of the abandoned waste disposal sites are similar to spills of hazardous substances hazardous and toxic waste disposal joint hearings before the subcommittees on environmental pollution and resource protection of the senate committee on environment and public works,cong.statement of thomas jorling,assistant administrator,water and waste management,environmental protection agency,reprinted at committee print,supra note,at.assistant administrator jorling further explained why a leak or discharge can occur without human interaction 
lagoons and ponds as a group represent a large potential danger to public health and the environment in those areas where precipitation exceeds evaporation surface impoundments will eventually either leak or overflow and discharge to surface waters.
in addition,the primary legislative sponsors and relevant committees regularly used the words spill or leak to describe passive events at abandoned sites.representative florio summarized the evils that cercla aimed to fix hundreds,possibly thousands,of neglected,leaking disposal sites presently dot the to release their lethal contents,despoiling water supplies and menacing public health.cong.rec,reprinted at committee print,supra note,at house committee reports included similar statements reflecting the passive aspects of spill or leak.similar statements were made by individual senators as well as senate committee reports 
in congress enacted the superfund amendments and reauthorization act sara,aimed at speeding cleanup and forcing quicker action by the epa most significantly for our purposes,congress created the innocent landowner defense that we have already discussed.see a.it did not do so,however,by creating a straightforward exception to cercla liability.in a single stroke,sara first clarified that one who purchases land from a polluting owner or operator can not present a defense,then set conditions under which this limit would not is,if the property were purchased after disposal or placement,and the purchaser did not know and had no reason to know that hazardous substances were disposed of there.the interpretation of disposal we adopt leaves in place the narrow applicability of the defense.this reading is confirmed by floor statements of the defense author,representative frank,who indicated that the innocent owner defense was unavailable to anyone who contributed,actively or passively,to the release of the substance 
this amendment says that wholly innocent landowners will not be held liable.we have had problems before with the leases being granted improvidently.this amendment,i must say,is drafted in a way to make that extremely unlikely.to get a release from liability under this section,a landowner must not have himself or herself allowed or permitted any storage,not have contributed to the release of any substance and,and this is very important,the landowner has the burden of proof to show that this landowner had neither actual nor constructive knowledge at the time of purchase that the property had been used for hazardous waste materials.in other words,you can get a release under this only if you can show by the preponderance of the evidence that you not only did not contribute to it you did not even know when you bought it that it had this there.
cong.rec.statement of frank.accordingly,the legislative history of the innocent owner defense does not contradict the plain meaning interpretation of disposal,but rather is consistent with this formulation.
conclusion 
in sum,we hold that,in light of the plain meaning of the terms used to define disposal in,the alleged passive migration of contaminants through soil during the partnership defendants ownership was not a disposal under a.this approach is consistent with the statute as a whole and its legislative history.the partnership defendants are thus entitled to summary judgment on the cercla claim.
iv.other issues 
state claims against government defendants 
the district court held that california civil code precludes carson harbor state claims against the government defendants.section provides that n othing which is done or maintained under the express authority of a statute can be deemed a nuisance.cal.civ.code.here,the water quality board issued npdes permits to the government defendants in and.those permits authorized the discharge of storm water containing pollutants,and there is no evidence that there was any storm water runoff to the property prior to or a violation of the permits.therefore,the district court properly granted summary judgment to the government defendants on the state law claims.
indemnity claim against partnership defendants 
the district court granted the partnership defendants motion for summary judgment on carson harbor indemnity claim under the purchase and sale agreement,based on its conclusion that the response costs were not necessary under a b.see carson harbor.at.under the purchase and sale agreement,which the partnership defendants and carson harbor executed in,the partnership defendants agreed to indemnify and hold carson harbor harmless from and against any damage,cost,expense liability suffered by carson harbor resulting,directly or indirectly,from any liability or obligation of the partnership defendants which carson harbor is not specifically required to assume hereunder.thus,the partnership defendants are liable for damages and costs carson harbor suffered in connection with its cleanup of the property if the partnership defendants would have been required to clean up the property in.
to survive summary judgment on this claim,carson harbor must raise a genuine issue of material fact.carson harbor argues that,because it was required to remove the hazardous substances in,the partnership defendants would have been required to remove them in.because we conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether carson harbor cleanup costs were necessary,whether the water quality board perceived a threat to public health or the environment and whether it required the remediation,we reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of the partnership defendants.
conclusion 
we reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of unocal and the government defendants on the cercla claim.with respect to the partnership defendants,we affirm the grant of summary judgment in their favor on the cercla claim.we also affirm the grant of summary judgment to the government defendants on the state claims.finally,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to the partnership defendants on carson harbor indemnity claim under the purchase agreement.the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded.
i agree with the majority that cercla is not a model of legislative clarity.inconsistencies and redundancies pervade the statute.as a result,our task in interpreting cercla is to search for a construction that produces the fewest inconsistencies and at the same time remains true to the statute remedial purposes.in holding that passive migration of hazardous waste through soil in this case can not constitute disposal under the act,the majority misses the mark.if there is a plain meaning in cercla definition of disposal,it encompasses the sort of passive migration at issue here.finding such passive migration as a form of disposal is consistent with cercla strict liability scheme,that broadly defines potentially responsible parties as including those who may have done nothing affirmative to contribute to the contamination of a site and that requires such parties to disprove causation as an affirmative defense.by contrast,excluding this sort of passive migration from the definition of disposal,as the majority does,frustrates cercla two central purposes to encourage prompt,voluntary private action to remedy environmental hazards and to ensure that those responsible for the hazards pay their fair share of cleanup costs.accordingly,i respectfully dissent from part iii of the majority opinion.
one of the ways in which cercla encourages current landowners to clean up environmental hazards on their properties is to allow them to clean up the hazard and then bring suit to recover clean up costs from those who have some responsibility for the existence of the hazard.in order to prevail,the current owner must establish that the defendant is a potentially responsible party,a party who falls within one of four classes of persons subject to cercla liability.see a.in this case,carson harbor argued that the partnership defendants are prps because they are persons who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of.id.a.the district court granted the partnership defendants motion for summary judgment on carson harbor cercla claim because it concluded that the partnership defendants did not own the property at the time of disposal of any hazardous substances.thus,the majority rightly focuses on the meaning of disposal in deciding whether the district court grant of summary judgment was proper.if there was a disposal of hazardous waste during the period that the partnership defendants owned the property,then,as the majority notes,the partnership defendants are prps and the district court was wrong to grant them summary judgment.majority op.at.
cercla defines disposal as the discharge,deposit,injection,dumping,spilling,leaking,or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water so that such solid waste or hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters,including ground waters.emphasis added see id.referring to for the definition of disposal.although the majority recognizes that almost all of the terms defining disposal have both active and passive meanings,it concludes that these terms simply do not describe the passive migration that occurred here.majority op.at.in reaching this conclusion,the majority purports to engage in a plain meaning analysis.however,the majority analysis is nothing more than ipse dixit.remarkably,nowhere does the majority consider the ordinary,contemporary,common meaning of the terms defining disposal.see williams taylor,d we give the words of a statute their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning,absent an indication congress intended them to bear some different import.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.had it done so,the majority would have discovered that a common meaning of deposit exactly fit s the hazardous substance contamination at issue in this case.majority op.at.
the oxford english dictionary provides the following as one of the common definitions of the transitive form of the verb deposit said of the laying down of substances held in solution,and of similar operations wrought by natural agencies to form as a natural deposit.iv the oxford english dictionary oed simpson weiner,ed webster dictionary offers a similar definition to lay down or let fall or drop by a natural process foster the accretion or accumulation of as a natural deposit.webster third new international dictionary of the english language webster philip babcock gove,unabridged ed.in addition,both dictionaries state that an intransitive definition of deposit is to be laid down or precipitated,to settle.iv oed see webster.
the evidence in the record is that the slag and waste was located within a wetlands area of the plaintiff property.the evidence also indicates that the slag and substance had high concentrations of lead and tph.in addition,there is evidence that water flowing through the wetlands carried lead and tph and that these hazardous wastes settled in the soil throughout the wetlands.thus,contrary to the majority conclusory assertion,the plain meaning of disposal that includes deposit exactly describes the spread of hazardous waste throughout the wetlands the wastes were carried by the water flowing through the wetlands and deposited in the surrounding soil.majority op.at nor can the gradual spread here be characterized as a deposit,because there was neither a deposit by someone,nor does the term deposit encompass the gradual spread of contaminants.
the plain meaning of deposit applies to the soil contamination that occurred in this case.thus,the partnership defendants were owners of the property at the time of disposal.as a result,the partnership defendants are prps and the district court was wrong to grant them summary judgment dismissing carson harbor cercla claim as to them.
as we have noted,cercla has two central purposes to ensure the prompt and effective cleanup of waste disposal sites,and to assure that parties responsible for hazardous substances bear the cost of remedying the conditions they created.pinal creek group newmont mining,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.to effectuate the first purpose,congress designed cercla to broadly define prps.see a.to effectuate the second purpose,congress created affirmative defenses to allow prps who bore no responsibility for the hazardous waste to avoid liability.see id.a,b.also in furtherance of the second purpose,congress provided for the equitable distribution of cleanup costs among prps who can not avail themselves of an affirmative defense.see id.f united states,cir describing some of the equitable factors courts consider in determining the proper allocation of cleanup costs among prps.the majority exclusion of parties such as the partnership defendants from the class of prps frustrates both of cercla central purposes.
prompt and effective cleanup 
while it holds that the passive soil migration at issue in this case does not constitute disposal,the majority also concludes that disposal may include other sorts of passive migration.majority op.at.specifically,the majority opines that the passive spilling or leaking of hazardous wastes may count as disposal.see,id.at.the majority notes that counting passive spilling or leaking as disposal furthers cercla purpose to encourage prompt and effective cleanup of hazardous wastes.id.at.it also notes that were disposal read to exclude passive spilling or leaking,there would be little incentive for a landowner to examine her property for hazardous wastes and to clean up any contamination that was discovered.id.at.but,of course,counting the passive migration at issue in this case as disposal also would encourage prompt cleanup,and excluding it produces the decreased incentives about which the majority frets the majority holding would allow a property owner who discovers hazardous waste passively migrating through the soil to escape all cercla liability simply by selling the property to another.
the majority parsimonious reading of disposal also leads to plainly nonsensical results.hazardous waste that is placed directly on or in land and is actively discharging or depositing waste throughout the soil,as is the case here,is likely a more immediate and direct environmental threat than that which is placed into drums or containment pools which may or may not eventually leak.under the majority interpretation,however,cercla gives the owner of land on which hazardous waste has previously been directly placed less of an incentive to clean up the waste than it does an owner whose land contains leaking drums.the failure to count the passive migration of contaminants through soil as disposal thus frustrates cercla first central purpose.
the majority reaches this untenable result for two reasons.first,it believes that the plain meanings of spill and leak describe the passive spread of hazardous waste but that the plain meaning of deposit and other terms in the definition of disposal that could potentially describe the passive migration at issue in this case do not.id.at.second,the majority relies on statements in cercla legislative history that indicate that congress enacted cercla in part out of concern for the spillage and leakage of hazardous waste from storage tanks at such places as love canal and the valley of the drums.id.at.
however,the majority plain meaning analysis is patently flawed water,flowing through the wetlands,carried the hazardous waste and deposited it in the soil throughout the contaminated area.see supra part i.in addition,the majority recognizes that its reliance on legislative history is a weak reed.as the majority itself notes with candor,any inquiry into cercla legislative history is somewhat of a snipe hunt.majority op.at.cercla was an compromise hastily assembled by a bipartisan leadership.id.at.as such,there is precious little congressional commentary interpreting the bill that eventually became cercla.see id.at no committee or conference reports address the version of the legislation that ultimately became law.thus,while the majority finds isolated statements from congressional witnesses,senators,and representatives indicating a concern with the passive spillage or leakage of hazardous waste,this is hardly evidence that congress meant to limit cercla reach to only those forms of passive contamination that could be described as spills or leaks.
fair share of remedial costs 
the majority refusal to give full effect to the meaning of deposit and other terms also frustrates cercla second central purpose to ensure that the parties responsible for hazardous waste bear their fair share of cleanup costs.
this case presents a perfect illustration.the partnership defendants owned the property from until,when they sold it to carson harbor.from until,unocal corporation held a leasehold interest in the property.as the majority notes,unocal used the property for petroleum production,operating a number of oil wells,pipelines,storage tanks,and production facilities.majority op.at.the evidence in the record indicates that the slag and material were placed on the property some time prior to the partnership defendant ownership.thus both the partnership defendants and carson harbor owned the property while lead and tph from the tar and slag discharged into the wetlands.the only significant distinction between carson harbor and the partnership defendants is that during the latter ownership,unocal was actively engaged in petroleum production on the property.thus,the partnership defendants had more reason to suspect the possibility of hazardous waste contamination than did carson harbor.but under the majority interpretation of disposal,the partnership defendants are completely exempt from liability for the cleanup costs incurred by carson harbor.this is an absurd result.by contrast,under the interpretation i urge,the partnership defendants would be prps and so liable for some of the cleanup costs unless they were able to establish an affirmative defense.
the majority appears to believe that counting the sort of passive migration at issue here as disposal would essentially eliminate one of a prp central affirmative defenses the innocent landowner defense.majority.this defense provides immunity from liability to a prp who acquired property after the disposal or placement of a hazardous substance if,at the time the prp acquired the facility the prp did not know and had no reason to know that any hazardous substance which is the subject of the release or threatened release was disposed of on,in,or at the facility.a.the majority reasoning on this point is puzzling.the majority contends that an interpretation of disposal that included passive soil migration would lead to the conclusion that disposal is a process,rendering liable every landowner after the initial disposal.majority op.at.it then notes that for subsequent purchasers,the innocent landowner defense would be available only if one could show that the land was purchased after the hazardous substances were placed there.id.the majority then concludes that the defense would be available only to a small portion of the landowners who have no actual culpability in the disposal of the hazardous substances.id.but this conclusion is simply a.
even if we accept for the sake of argument that the more expansive interpretation of disposal implies that disposal is a process,it just does not follow that the innocent landowner defense would be available only to those who have no actual culpability in the disposal of the hazardous substances.majority op.at emphasis added.congress made the defense available to any prp who purchases property after the disposal or after the placement of a hazardous substance on the property.a.thus,if
