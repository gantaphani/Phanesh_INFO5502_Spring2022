the principal issue in this appeal is whether exemption of the freedom of information act foia,b,applies to information about the location of an endangered species where disclosure might identify individuals private property.the national association of home builders nahb appeals the grant of summary judgment to the secretary of the interior on nahb request for release of information on the location of nesting sites of the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl in arizona.the secretary provided nahb with numerous documents on the location of the owl,but,invoking several foia exemptions,the secretary redacted the documents to conceal most of the location that nahb sought.assuming that the requested files are similar files under exemption,we hold,upon de novo review,that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the privacy interests reflected in the secretary evidence.accordingly,because exemptions,and do not bar release of the requested documents,we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand the case with instructions to order the secretary to release the information without revealing individual property owners names,which nahb no longer requests.
in the secretary of the interior designated the pygmy owl as an endangered species and two years later exercised authority under the endangered species act to designate critical habitats for the pygmy owl in arizona.a determination of endangered status for the cactus ferruginous in arizona,to be codified at pt.designation of critical habitat for the cactus ferruginous,july,to be codified as pt.final rule.as a result,large tracts of land in southwest set aside as critical habitat for the owl,alerting the public as well as agencies to the importance of these areas.at.in the final rule,the secretary explained that he used data on known locations the information that nahb now to identify important areas for the owl.id.at.the secretary then used biological information to connect these important areas to determine the owl likely habitats.id.
in,nahb filed a foia request seeking previously documented,locations,with appropriate addresses,identified landmarks,parcel or subdivision maps,polygons,or other points of reference sufficient to allow an average person to locate the property where members of the species are known or believed to exist.the secretary,acting through the fish and wildlife service fws,responded to the request by producing hundreds of documents related to the location of pygmy owls.the secretary redacted these documents,however,to conceal most of the locations that nahb sought.specifically,the secretary redacted all section information,site directions,site names,and the names and addresses of owners of private lands on which the pygmy owls and their nests have been located.
dissatisfied with the secretary response,nahb filed this lawsuit to compel disclosure of the information on the grounds that nahb was entitled to the data as a matter of law under foia.the secretary defended the withholding of information under four foia exemptions exemption,for information specifically exempted from disclosure by another statute exemption,for trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential exemption,for or memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency and exemption,for personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy b.the secretary presented the affidavit of fws director jamie rappaport clark,which recounted,in pertinent part,experiences in texas and arizona,where bird enthusiasts traveled to the location of pygmy owl sightings and adversely affected both the pygmy owls and the private property owners.in clark opinion,such incidents have created in landowners a well founded fear that birdwatchers,in the hopes of glimpsing the owl,will unlawfully invade the landowners private property.
the district court granted summary judgment for the secretary,ruling that the secretary properly redacted the information under exemption,but that exemptions,and did not apply.the court,relying on the observations in texas and the arizona incident,concluded that releasing the pygmy owl data would result in an unwarranted invasion of privacy.the court recognized that withholding the information would deny the public information that would enable it to locate the pygmy owl nesting sites,and that the public would therefore be unable to determine whether the secretary had properly designated critical habitats for the owl.still,the district court was satisfied that the secretary disclosure in the final rule of the method by which critical habitats are designated was sufficient to render the decisionmaking process clear,even though the ultimate decisions remain secret.
the endangered species act instructs the secretary to determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species because of a range of enumerated factors,including the present or threatened destruction,modification,or curtailment of its habitat or range a.once the secretary identifies a species as endangered,the act imposes penalties upon any person who engages in certain prohibited actions with respect to the species.id.a.the act also provides that the secretary,to the maximum extent prudent and determinable,shall designate any habitat of an endangered or threatened species which is then considered to be a critical habitat id.a.the act specifies that the secretary should base the critical habitat designation on the best scientific data available and should consider the economic impact,and any other relevant impact,of specifying any particular area as a critical habitat.b.in the final rule,the secretary explained that,in making critical habitat designations,the information about the location of an endangered species is used to form an interconnected system of suitable and potential habitat areas.at.w ithin the delineated critical habitat boundaries,the secretary noted,only lands containing,or likely to develop,those habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs of the are considered critical habitat.id.

in considering the scope of the similar files language in exemption,the supreme court has made clear that information that applies to a particular individual may qualify for protection.dep t of state.post,at.at.the court explained in washington post that congress intended the phrase similar files to have a broad,rather than a narrow,meaning.id.at.at.this court accordingly has observed that exemption is designed to protect personal information in public records,even if it is not embarrassing or of an intimate nature ass of retired fed.employees horner.to date,courts interpreting the phrase have considered primarily government files that were maintained on a specific individual or group.for example,reporters committee,at.at,involved a request for fbi rap sheets criminal records that identified particular ray,at.at,involved a request for information about haitian nationals who had attempted to emigrate illegally to the united states and were involuntarily returned to haiti.also,in new york times nasa,this court broadly interpreted the phrase to encompass a recording of a person voice inflection at a particular moment,which the court viewed as highly personal information pertaining to specific individuals.at.
the files that nahb seeks are not files that would normally be described as detailed government records on an individual.dep t of state.post,at.at.the secretary does not suggest that the files contain information on a person date or place of birth,marriage or employment history,or other intimate details or damaging information.id.at.at.rather,nahb seeks only the government files showing where pygmy owls and their nests had been sighted in arizona.exemption similar files do not include this geographic information,nahb contends,because such an expansive reading would mean that any government document referring to an individual in some manner as to identify that individual would fall within the exemption.at oral argument nahb clarified that it does not seek release of any individual property owners names instead,it requests only the site information,such as the square and lot number where the owls were sighted.however,to the extent that square and lot information can lead to identification of individual property owners through a search of state records,the information is at least arguably personal information that falls within the category of similar files,for the inquiry turns on whether the information in the file applies to a particular individual,not the nature of the file in which the information is contained times nasa,at quoting dep t of state.post,at.at.
the court need not resolve whether the pygmy owl records constitute similar files under exemption.the supreme court has embraced the legislative history stating that the balancing of private against public interests,not the nature of the files in which the information was contained,should limit the scope of the exemption.dep t of state.post,at.at quoting.accordingly,we turn to those interests,assuming without deciding that the requested pygmy owl records are similar files under exemption.
to establish that the release of information contained in government files would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy,the court first asks whether disclosure would compromise a substantial,as opposed to a de minimis,privacy interest.horner,at.if a significant privacy interest is at stake,the court then must weigh that interest against the public interest in the release of the records in order to determine whether,on balance,disclosure would work a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.id.citations omitted.the public interest to be weighed against the privacy interest in this balancing test is the extent to which disclosure would serve the core purposes of the foia by contribut ing significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.united states dep t of def.flra,d quoting reporters,at.at.thus,unless a foia request advances the citizens right to be informed about what their government is up to,reporters,at.at,no relevant public interest is at issue.
the secretary relies on the declaration of fws director clark to show that disclosure of private landowners names and addresses would constitute an unwarranted invasion of those individuals privacy because birdwatchers and other persons intensely interested in the location of pygmy owls will unlawfully trespass upon the private lands.clark described an incident in arizona in which the audubon society placed the location of a pygmy owl sighting on its website and telephone hotline on the same day the information was placed on the audubon hotlines several car loads of birders were observed in the area of the reported location.the following day birding groups included at least two vehicles.clark noted that property owners indicated displeasure at the number of people on and around their properties during the arizona incident.she added that,in light of these prior experiences,several landowners have already discussed their fears of disclosure of the information clark also referred ambiguously to adverse effects from birders on pygmy owls in texas,but at oral argument the secretary disavowed any reliance on incidents in texas as evidence of trespass by birdwatchers.
nahb contends that the district court erred in relying on what it characterizes as director clark speculative and internally inconsistent declaration.essentially,nahb maintains that the single arizona incident cited by clark is insufficient to support the speculation that birdwatchers would not only seek out this information in order to locate the owls but would then go to the location and unlawfully trespass on private property.although it is true that clark noted that landowners indicated displeasure at the number of people on and around their properties,it is also true that clark did not affirmatively state that illegal trespass was a problem during the arizona incident.and in the study on which clark based her conclusion regarding adverse effects on the texas pygmy owl population,the author stated that the birds were located on privately owned land,and thus harassment may not be a problem.further,the clark affidavit included as an exhibit an advertisement by a private ranch proclaiming the presence of pygmy owls on its property,but the secretary offered no evidence that this establishment has been overrun by lawless birdwatchers,as feared by the secretary and the district court.
the secretary evidentiary support for unlawful trespass,therefore,is weak.one incident in which there is no claim that unlawful trespass occurred hardly demonstrates a general problem,and there is nothing to suggest that property owners can not be protected against unlawful trespassers.even if property owners have expressed displeasure about birdwatchers presence on and around their properties,those statements bear little weight in light of the landowners awareness that the owl information could be disclosed.before allowing the arizona game and fish department state agency to survey on their land for pygmy owls,the property owners sign confidentiality agreements providing that although the information will be held confidential,it is subject to public disclosure laws and court orders.as the secretary rightly notes,this court has stated that where a substantial probability that disclosure will cause an interference with personal privacy exists,it matters not that there may be two or three links in the causal chain.horner,at.here,however,the problem is one of likelihood,not causation,for the secretary has failed to show that unlawful trespass is likely to occur.although we do not question either the expertise of the fws director,who is familiar with the tenacity of birdwatchers,or other indications that birdwatching and other forms of ecotourism are growing substantially in popularity,see barton thompson,people or pr
