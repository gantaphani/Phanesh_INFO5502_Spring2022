the cultural and religious traditions of the forest county potawatomi community the community often require the use of pure natural resources derived from a clean environment.many years ago,the community became alarmed by increasing pollution levels in its lakes,wetlands,and forests.to remedy this problem,it submitted a request to the environmental protection agency epa to redesignate certain tribal lands from class ii to class i status under the prevention of significant deterioration psd program of the clean air act the act.this would have the effect of imposing stricter air quality controls on emitting sources in and around the community redesignated lands.
after nearly fifteen years of administrative proceedings and dispute resolution efforts between the community and neighboring wisconsin which were successful and michigan which were not,the epa promulgated a final ruling redesignating the community lands to class i status.it also issued two companion announcements concluding dispute resolution proceedings with wisconsin and michigan.michigan seeks review of these three final administrative rulings.it asserts that the epa pursued the redesignation in an improper manner and,as a result,needlessly complicated michigan air quality control programs.because michigan lacks standing to pursue these claims,we dismiss its petition for review.
the act,establishes a comprehensive program for air quality control and authorizes the epa to administer it.a.under the act,the epa must identify air pollutants that endanger public health and welfare and must formulate national ambient air quality standards naaqs,which specify air quality criteria,control techniques,and the maximum possible concentration of various air pollutants.
the purpose of the psd program is to preserve the naaqs where they have been met.it operates primarily through a permitting system.a major emitting facility,defined at,must obtain a permit before initiating construction of a new facility or modifying an existing facility.a.in order to secure such a permit,the emitting source must demonstrate through air quality modeling that it will not cause or contribute to the 
a maximum allowable increase or maximum allowable concentration for any pollutant in any area to which this part applies more than one time per year,
b national ambient air quality standard in any air quality control region,or c any other applicable emission standard or standard of performance under this act.
a.under the psd program,an area is designated as class i,ii,or iii,with class i lands being those for which air quality is most protected.thus,it is more difficult for emitting sources in the vicinity of a class i area to obtain a psd permit.
much of the psd program is implemented by the states through state implementation plans sip,which contain a set of and regulations.if a state has not yet promulgated its own sip,or if the epa has not approved a proposed sip,the epa will issue a federal implementation plan fip,which will govern the implementation of the psd program until the state creates a valid sip.c.indian tribes are generally treated the same as states under the act with some exceptions noted in.this means that they may implement the psd program on their lands through a tribal implementation plan tip,which is analogous to a sip.d.just as with states,if a tribe does not create a valid implementation plan,the epa will promulgate a fip to govern the tribal lands until the tribe creates a valid tip,if and when it wishes to do so.
both a state and a tribe are authorized to redesignate land within their boundaries to class i status.a,c.redesignation requires that the state or tribe hold public hearings and analyze the health,environmental,economic,social,and energy effects of the proposed redesignation.b a.if these procedural requirements are met,the epa has little discretion in denying a redesignation.see arizona epa,cir once these procedural requirements are met,epa must approve the request for redesignation.a state,however,may object to a proposed tribal redesignation and invoke dispute resolution under e.the epa must accept whatever agreement the state and tribe come to,but if they can not come to an agreement,the epa may resolve the issue and integrate it into the relevant sip,tip,or fip.id.
the epa is charged with administering the permitting process for the psd program,but it may delegate that authority.see u.it has done so in this case by entrusting psd permitting authority to the michigan department of environmental quality for sources within the state of michigan.see approval and promulgation of implementation plans delegation of authority to the state of michigan.
the community is a indian tribe in wisconsin.see indian entities recognized and eligible to receive services from the united states bureau of indian affairs.it inhabits an area rich in lakes,wetlands,and forests,and it sees the preservation of these lands as crucial to its cultural heritage.for example,the community belief system requires that plants and animals that are used for medicines and religious ceremonies be obtained in a pure form from a clean environment.with increasing pollution,the community saw its heritage threatened,and so it decided to ask the epa to redesignate certain of its reservation lands from class ii to class i status.
on december,the community submitted to the epa an informal request for redesignation of its reservation lands within forest county,wisconsin.the community gave notice to various entities of the public hearings it held on the subject,and it also submitted a technical report to the epa,outlining the various effects of the redesignation.on february,the community submitted its formal request for redesignation to the epa.the epa reviewed the community materials and determined that the procedural requirements for redesignation had been met.thus,on june,the epa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that suggested approval of the redesignation request and sought public comment.because of the proposed redesignation effect on emitting sources in surrounding lands,michigan and wisconsin objected to the proposed change and invoked the dispute resolution provisions of e.the negotiations ended successfully with the signing of a memorandum of agreement moa.in contrast,the dealings broke down,and the community requested that the epa resolve the dispute.
on december,the epa again issued a notice requesting comments on a proposed rule that would approve the community proposed redesignation and implement it through a fip promulgated by the epa.after public hearings and an extended comment period,the epa promulgated its final action redesignating the community lands to class i status on april.see approval and promulgation of air quality implementation plans wisconsin redesignation of the forest county potawatomi community reservation to a psd class i area.the epa also issued two companion announcements concluding the dispute resolutions with wisconsin and michigan.the wisconsin dispute resolution action incorporated the moa,which exempted certain wisconsin lands from class i restrictions.see redesignation of the forest county potawatomi community reservation to a psd class i area dispute resolution with the state of wisconsin,subjecting only major sources in wisconsin located within a ten mile radius of any redesignated tribal land to performing an increment analysis and to meeting consumption requirements applicable to a class i area.the epa approval of class i status for the tribal lands will affect emitting sources within michigan.see redesignation of the forest county potawatomi community reservation to a psd class i area dispute resolution with the state of michigan.michigan seeks review of these three final administrative rulings.
as the party invoking federal jurisdiction,michigan bears the burden of demonstrating that it has standing,which has three requirements 
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the
