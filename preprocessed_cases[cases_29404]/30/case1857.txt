this case involves changes in the plan for a large real estate development project in downtown los angeles and compliance with the requirements of the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et the underlying issue is whether the original environmental impact report eir with an updated addendum is sufficient,or whether the changes in the plan are such that it constitutes an entirely new project requiring a new eir or,alternatively,whether the changes in the project trigger such new and significant environmental impacts that a supplemental eir seir must be prepared.
mani brothers real estate group and francisco,llc collectively,mani brothers,rival developers and landowners,challenge the project.mani brothers contend that the modified project is so different as to constitute a new project,and that it will have new or more severe environmental effects than the originally approved project due to an increase in square footage,building height,and a change in use from office to residential.
however,we find that the focus on whether the changes amount to a new project is not determinative under ceqa.under the applicable substantial evidence standard of review,but for the issue of police services,the modified project substitution of residential use in place of some office,retail,and cultural uses results in fewer significant impacts compared to the original project,even though the overall square footage and floor area are somewhat larger in the modified project.
we thus affirm the judgment of the trial court denying a peremptory writ of mandate and upholding except as to the issue of police services the decision of the city of los angeles,the city council of the city of los angeles,and the community redevelopment agency of los angeles cra collectively referred to as the city to approve the modified project with the addendum by ids equities,llc,and to require an seir on only one issue.the trial court properly granted a peremptory writ of mandate limited to ordering a seir that deals with the necessity for increased police services required by the new,predominately residential project,as opposed to the old,commercial project that was approved by the eir.
factual and procedural summary 
overview of the original project and the eir.
the project in question is located on approximately acres in downtown los angeles,an area generally bounded by the harbor freeway,the ninth street renamed james wood boulevard northbound freeway,francisco street,and eighth street.the project is in a central business district redevelopment area and is currently vacant land used for parking lots.
the original project was reviewed under ceqa.in,an eir was certified by the cra,a public agency charged with attracting private investment in economically depressed areas health,et,which must review and approve all projects in the central business district before a building permit can be issued.the cra acted as the lead agency on the project under ceqa guidelines see,tit,hereinafter,guidelines and was responsible for ensuring compliance with ceqa and for certifying the final eir feir.the original project analyzed in the eir consisted of five buildings with approximately million square feet of development,including offices,a to hotel,retail facilities,and an optional cultural center.the structures included three towers,one tower,and one building.
the eir discussed the environmental impact in numerous areas,such as land use and planning,urban design and historic resources,shadow and wind,transportation,circulation and parking,climate and air quality,noise,energy,hazardous materials,public services and utilities,employment,housing,and fiscal factors.the eir recommended mitigation measures for certain impacts and examined alternatives,but concluded that even with mitigation measures,the project would result in unavoidable significant adverse impacts in the areas of traffic generation,air quality,and increased demand for water,sewer capacity,solid waste,and the provision of police and fire services.
approvals for the original project,and then delays and changed real estate market conditions.
in,the cra approved the original project,including an owner participation agreement opa,with a public benefits plan and a transfer of floor area ratio tfar plan,and it adopted ceqa findings.later in,the los angeles city council reviewed and approved the tfar plan and ratified the opa for the project with the developer of the original project,city center development.in,the city and the developer of the original project entered into a development agreement.
the original project analyzed under ceqa entailed several approvals over the course of time.some of the cra and city approvals have occurred,such as approval of the concept master plan,but other approvals have not yet occurred,such as approvals of the concept design drawings and certificates of completion.full implementation of the project was delayed by litigation see a local and regional monitor city of los angeles th,d,which left the developer in what was then a weak real estate leasing market in the early.
between and,the project opa was refined several times by five implementation agreements,extending the time for the developer performance.the project was also revised in to change some of the conditions of approval related to the subsurface of certain streets.the cra prepared a ceqa addendum the addendum for the project revisions approved at that time.the addendum also updated the feir analysis and conclusions by evaluating if changes in environmental or regulatory conditions have the potential to alter the findings regarding the project impacts contained in the previously certified feir.
as part of the fifth and final implementation agreement,the cra required the project developer to undertake a market study to analyze current market conditions and recommend a possible revised approach to the project.in october of,the market study was completed and submitted to the cra.the market study indicated,in pertinent part,that there was a strong demand for residential development in the downtown area.
the addendum.
in light of the changed and improved real estate market conditions indicating a transition to a residential and environment,in may of,the project developer formally requested that the cra revise the project to permit residential uses.the cra,acting as the lead agency,initiated an assessment of whether additional review under ceqa was required for the purposes of a modified project.because the project had already been the subject of a feir,pursuant to section and ceqa guidelines sections through,the cra analyzed whether any conditions required the preparation of an seir.the cra determined,in pertinent part,that because there were no new or more significant environmental impacts than had been previously evaluated in the original eir,and because the project developer had not refused to implement any appropriate mitigation measures,the changes in the project were such that no major revision to the feir as updated by the addendum was required.
thus,the cra prepared a addendum to the original project feir.the addendum was an approximately document exclusive of lengthy technical appendices analyzing the impacts of the modified project in comparison to the impacts of the previously approved original project.the modified project would reduce much of the original project office and retail space,and eliminate the optional cultural use component,while maintaining the hotel component and adding residential components.as a result of these changes,the overall size of the project would increase from approximately million square feet to a maximum of just over million square feet.
the additional density would be made possible by a tfar from the nearby convention center,a process authorized by the los angeles municipal code whereby development rights can be transferred within the central business district.using a tfar entails a monetary benefit to the city because,pursuant to the restated opa approved as a part of the modified project,the developer would pay between million and million,depending upon the amount of increased density used,with the proceeds split between the city and the cra and used to provide affordable housing.
as indicated in the addendum,the modified project would consist,in pertinent part,of the following one residential building with a maximum height of feet,open space plazas and recreational space a second residential and retail building with a maximum height of feet,up to units,open spaces and terraces a third residential and hotel tower with a maximum height of feet,up to residential units and hotel rooms,open space,recreation areas and terraces and a fourth building with a maximum height to feet and approximately million square feet of office,approximately square feet of retail,and additional open space.the modified project would encourage pedestrian use of francisco street and eighth street by providing a plaza,ground level retail space,and pedestrian amenities such as lighting,landscaping and outdoor sculptures.
as further indicated in the addendum,although the changes in the project would increase the overall size of the project by approximately percent,the project environmental impacts actually would be reduced.environmental impacts would be reduced because residential development tends to cause fewer impacts compared to retail or office development,primarily because residential development would generate significantly less traffic.by introducing residential features,the modified project would reduce vehicular trips by approximately percent in comparison to the original project.according to the addendum,the changes in the modified project would lessen many of the environmental impacts that were deemed significant and unavoidable in the original project,such as impacts on traffic,water supply,water and wastewater treatment facilities,and landfill capacity.
police protection services.
the eir had deemed the impact of the original project on the need for police protection services to be significant and unavoidable.as set forth in the certified eir,appropriate mitigation measures would entail consultation with the los angeles police department lapd crime prevention unit on design and implementation of a security plan,and the proper illumination of elevators,lobbies and parking areas.
the addendum acknowledged that the modified project would result in a somewhat greater demand for police protection services because of the residential component of the project with approximately new residents,apart from the additional people associated with the commercial component of the project.this is considered a potentially significant impact.nonetheless,the addendum found that the modified project,with its now largely residential character,would have a less than significant impact on the need for police services with certain mitigation measures implemented.
as explained in the addendum,the modified project,like the original project,would include design features intended to reduce the need for police protection services.for example,the modified project would include private security guards,electronic surveillance equipment,and electronic card keys for access to the buildings and parking structures.the modified project also would be located in an area that provides an additional security team,know as the purple patrol,which works in coordination with the lapd to ensure the safety of the downtown area.
regarding police services,the addendum concluded as follows with these project features and measures,impacts on police protection services associated with the modified project would be less than significant.additionally,given that future projects would be required to undergo lapd review on an individual basis,and the reasonable expectation that adequate funding of facility needs would continue to be maintained through the city budgeting process,including increases in tax revenue through future projects,cumulative impacts on police protection services would be less than significant.this is in contrast to the certified eir findings where project and cumulative impacts on police protection were identified as unavoidable,significant and adverse.
the addendum only identified two significant and unavoidable impacts of the modified project air quality and construction noise,both of which were impacts previously disclosed in the feir and the addendum.all other impacts of the modified the impact on police services,which was previously found to be significant and determined to be less than significant.
the approval process for the modified project.
the ensuing approval process for the modified project and the addendum included several public meetings before the cra and the city.in october of,the cra board certified the addendum and approved the modified project,and then gave the requisite statutory notice of its approval of the modified project.
several months later,the owner of the project sold the project to another entity,ids equities real party in interest in the present appeal.thereafter,pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement in november of,la metropolis became the participant in the restated opa and is the current owner and developer of the project 
after the cra approved the modified project,the cra sent to the city council appropriate documentation so that it could review the modified project and the addendum and approve the restated opa,as required by law.see admin.code,g,o p.the cra also requested,in pertinent part,that the city direct its share of the tfar payment into the city affordable housing trust fund.
beginning in december of,the city council held public meetings and then approved the modified project and directed the filing of a notice of determination on the modified project.
the superior court upheld the modified project and the addendum,except as to the analysis of police services.
in january of,mani brothers filed a petition for a writ of mandate,challenging the addendum and the approval of the modified project.the trial court denied the writ petition and upheld the addendum and the modified project in all respects,except as to the analysis of the impacts related to police services.the court entered judgment granting a peremptory writ of mandate ordering a seir that deals with the necessity for increased police services required by the new,predominately residential project,but finding that the project is in compliance with ceqa,and the petition is denied on all grounds alleged therein other than the alleged failure to provide for the necessity of increased police protection purposes.
mani brothers appeal,contending essentially that the trial court erred in not granting the petition mandating the preparation of a new eir or an seir on all of the project environmental impacts.the city on the issue of police services,contending that the modified project and the addendum complied with ceqa in all respects.
discussion 
mani brothers satisfied the requirement of the exhaustion of administrative remedies.
the city contends that mani brothers failed to establish the jurisdictional prerequisite of exhaustion as to nearly all the issues raised.the city notes that mani brothers appeared during the city council approval process on the modified project by submitting,through their attorneys,four short letters and speaking through their counsel at one city council committee hearing and at two city council hearings.according to the city,these communications improperly asserted only in the most general terms that the changes associated with the modified project and the changes in circumstances required preparation of an seir.
the rationale for exhaustion is that the agency is entitled to learn the contentions of interested parties before litigation is instituted.if plaintiffs have previously sought administrative relief the agency will have had its opportunity to act and to render litigation unnecessary,if it had chosen to do so.citizens for sensible development of bishop area county of inyo d.the exact issue must have been presented to the administrative agency to satisfy the exhaustion requirement.resource defense fund local agency formation com.d.however,less specificity is required to preserve an issue for appeal in an administrative proceeding than in a judicial proceeding because,although not the case here,parties in such proceedings generally are not represented by counsel.citizens for sensible development of bishop area county of inyo,supra,d at.
pursuant to the ceqa statutory scheme,only parties who object to the agency approval of the project either orally or in writing may thereafter file a petition,subd.b.in any action or proceeding alleging noncompliance with ceqa,the grounds alleged for noncompliance must first have been presented to the public agency orally or in writing by any person during the public comment period provided by this division or prior to the close of the public hearing on the project before the issuance of the notice of determination,subd.a.
in the present case,when the cra prepared the addendum,it did not provide for a public comment period or provide the public with notice that it was preparing an addendum.also,neither the cra nor the city provided a public hearing on the addendum under ceqa,and the city acknowledges there was no formal public comment period on the addendum.however,several meetings were held.they were not duly noticed public hearings under ceqa,but were regularly scheduled meetings of the cra or the city that were open to the public.as the city correctly explains,the exhaustion requirement nonetheless applies because the public meetings held constituted an other opportunity for members of the public to raise objections orally or in writing prior to the approval of the project,subd.e,italics added.
because mani brothers repeatedly voiced their objections to the addendum at various relevant meetings,the exhaustion requirement was satisfied.mani brothers raised their concerns about the use of an addendum to evaluate the changed project at meetings of the city council and the housing,community and economic development committee.in written and oral comments,mani brothers raised their concerns regarding the project impacts on air quality,public services,traffic,congestion,parking,aesthetics,and shade and shadow.
for example,in a letter to the city council dated december,mani brothers noted,in pertinent part,these differences and the others reflected or permitted in the amended and restated opa create new substantial environmental effects and increase the severity of previously identified effects,such as the impact on public services,traffic and shade and shadow.similarly,in a february,letter to the city council,mani brothers stated t he council must prepare a supplemental or subsequent environmental impact report these changes will introduce new significant effects on public services,such as fire protection,police protection,schools and parks the increased heights,as well as the relocation of the buildings footprints,will affect the shadows cast on the surrounding properties these developments have changed the landscape of the project area,introduced new significant environmental effects,and increased the severity of previously identified environmental effects,such as traffic,congestion,and parking and the provision of police and fire services.the letters to the city council also noted that an addendum does not require public notice or public review,objected that certain mitigation measures had been deleted,and objected to the city approval of a reduced tfar payment and the sale of the project to the new developer at a profit to the old developer.
accordingly,the objections here were more than merely a relatively few bland and general references coalition for student action city of fullerton d,and the objections thus were adequate to satisfy the exhaustion requirement.see,east peninsula ed.council,palos verdes peninsula unified school dist.d.comment about the absence of any mention of the most basic concern of residents for traffic and safety was sufficient notice for exhaustion purposes as to those issues.the objections by mani brothers satisfied the purpose of the exhaustion doctrine,which is to provide the public agency with an opportunity to receive and respond to articulated factual issues and legal theories before its actions are subjected to judicial review.coalition for student action city of fullerton,supra,d at,original italics.
ii.standards of review.
because we are reviewing the city decision against a claim of noncompliance with ceqa,the scope and standard of the appellate court review is the same as the trial court.gilroy citizens for responsible planning city of gilroy th,d.in any action to attack,review,or set aside the decision of a public agency to approve a project based on grounds of noncompliance with ceqa,where a hearing was required and a public agency exercised its discretion in making factual determinations,we do not exercise our independent judgment on the evidence,but shall only determine whether the act or decision is supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.see also in other situations,the inquiry shall extend only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
for ceqa purposes substantial evidence is defined by statute as including fact,a reasonable assumption predicated upon fact,and expert opinion supported by fact,subd.e.the applicable ceqa guideline further explains that substantial evidence includes enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion,even though other conclusions might also be reached.whether a fair argument can be made that the project may have a significant effect on the environment is to be determined by examining the whole record before the lead agency.guidelines,subd.a.substantial evidence does not include a rgument,speculation,unsubstantiated opinion or narrative,evidence which is clearly erroneous or inaccurate,or evidence of social or economic impacts which do not contribute to or are not caused by physical impacts on the environment.ibid.
to the extent there are questions about whether substantial evidence exists,t he agency is the finder of fact and a court must indulge all reasonable inferences from the evidence that would support the agency determinations and resolve all conflicts in the evidence in favor of the agency decision.gilroy citizens for responsible planning city of gilroy,supra,th at,d see also laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d.
accordingly,mani brothers have the burden here to demonstrate that the city decision to approve the modified project with the addendum,rather than to require an seir,is not supported by substantial evidence and was thus improper.guidelines,subd.a.
iii.substantial evidence supports t he city decision that the modified project will have no new or more severe impacts than the original project,and that therefore an seir was not required except as to the issue of police services.
general principles regarding use of an seir versus an addendum.
an seir is a subsequent version of an eir that revises the earlier eir to make it adequate for a project approval after conditions have changed.no subsequent or supplemental eir is required by the lead agency unless one of several events occur,the relevant event here being that s ubstantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the eir,subd.a.the ceqa guidelines implementing section elaborate upon this triggering event,and explain that an seir need not be prepared unless s ubstantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the previous eir due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects.guidelines,subd.a.
in contrast to an seir,an addendum to a previously certified eir must be prepared if some changes or additions are necessary but none of the conditions described in section calling for preparation of a subsequent eir have occurred.guidelines,subd.a.an addendum does not need to be circulated for public review or comment but can be included in,or attached to,the final eir,and it is then considered by the agency before making its decision on the project.guidelines,subds.c d.
an addendum may be appropriate for either an eir or a negative declaration.guidelines.in the context of a negative declaration that no substantial evidence supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant environmental impact which was not the case here an addendum to an adopted negative declaration is appropriate where only minor technical changes or additions are necessary.guidelines,subd.b.
when reviewing an agency decision not to require an seir,the low threshold fair argument test for requiring the preparation of an eir in the first instance is no longer applicable instead,agencies are prohibited from requiring further environmental review unless the stated conditions are met.friends of davis city of davis th,d.thus,in reviewing decisions made pursuant to section,courts are not reviewing the record to determine whether it demonstrates a possibility of environmental impact,but are viewing it in a light most favorable to the city decision in order to determine whether substantial evidence supports the decision not to require additional review.id.at,d.
the rationale for limiting the circumstances under which a supplemental or subsequent eir may be prepared is precisely because review has already occurred,the time for challenging the sufficiency of the original eir has long since expired,subd.c,and the question is whether circumstances have changed enough to justify repeating a substantial portion of the process.bowman city of petaluma d,original italics.therefore,section provides a balance against the burdens created by the environmental review process and accords a reasonable measure of finality and certainty to the results achieved.citation.at this point,the interests of finality are favored over the policy favoring public comment friends of davis city of davis,supra,th at,d.
applying the above principles,courts have upheld the use of addenda and not required preparation of an seir in numerous contexts that are instructive here.thus,for example,addenda were properly used in cases where many years had elapsed between the original eir and later project revisions see santa teresa citizen action group city of san jose,supra,th,d eight years between certified final eir and addendum,and where the project appearance had changed fairly dramatically see fund for environmental defense county of orange d.designs changed,square footage increased by percent,number of buildings increased,and project site newly surrounded by wilderness park river valley preservation project metropolitan transit development bd.th,d light rail project changed by raising the elevation of a segment of a berm by a factor of two to three times the original height and replacing a golf course with a wetland.
the recent case of save our neighborhood lishman th save our neighborhood does not compel a different analysis.
the extensive reliance by mani brothers on the recent case of save our neighborhood,supra,th,d,does not persuade us to use an analysis different from that discussed above.in save our neighborhood,the court dealt with substantial proposed changes in a project,with the new project involving the same land and mixes of use,motel or hotel,gas station,eating facilities,but with different proponents using completely different drawings,materials and configurations of structures.the city asserted the project involved only minor changes,filed an addendum to the prior project mitigated negative declaration,and then approved that addendum for the new project.id.at,d.
the court in save our neighborhood,supra,th at page,d,found that the totality of the circumstances established that the project in question was not a modified version of a prior project,but rather was a new and different project not subject to the legislative and administrative requirements guidelines,and that the city violated ceqa in relying on an addendum rather than an independent environmental review.save our neighborhood,supra,at,d.the court thus reversed and remanded the matter and directed the trial court to grant the petition for a writ of mandate,compelling the defendants to vacate the notice of determination,the approval of the project,and all other matters associated with the project.save our neighborhood,supra,d.according to mani brothers,the present case,like the situation in save our neighborhood,involves an entirely new project and mandates not merely an seir,but an entirely new eir which should be subjected to full ceqa review.
save our neighborhood,however,involved an addendum to a previously certified negative declaration and not,as here,an addendum to a previously certified eir.that is significant because an addendum is only appropriate to a previously certified negative declaration where minor technical changes or additions are necessary guidelines,subd.b and,as noted before and contrary to the contention of mani brothers,this limitation does not apply where the addendum is to a previously certified eir.guidelines,subd.a.because in the present case the addendum was to the feir previously certified for the project,not a previously certified negative declaration,save our neighborhood is distinguishable and inapplicable.
even if save our neighborhood was not distinguishable on its facts,its fundamental analysis is flawed.the court in save our neighborhood tackled what it perceived to be the threshold question of whether we are dealing with a change to a particular project or a new project altogether,and declared that section and guidelines section apply to the former but not the latter.save our neighborhood,supra,th at,d.this novel new project test does not provide an objective or useful framework.drastic changes to a project might be viewed by some as transforming the project to a new project,while others may characterize the same drastic changes in a project as resulting in a dramatically modified project.such labeling entails no specific guidelines and simply is not helpful to our analysis.
the new project test in save our neighborhood,also inappropriately bypassed otherwise applicable statutory and regulatory provisions,guidelines,when it considered it a question of law for the court whether the changed project was to be reviewed under section at all.save our neighborhood,supra,at,d.we disagree with that approach and view the issue of whether an agency proceeded properly in treating a project as subject to section not as a question of law,but rather as a question of the adequacy of evidence in the record to support the agency determination.
the question of law approach employed in save our neighborhood conflicts with the customary substantial evidence test discussed above and long used in all other cases.the case of benton board of supervisors d.ironically cited by save our neighborhood,supra,th at,d,to support the question of law approach used,is instructive.there,the project involved moving a winery to a different site,adding underground storage caves and altering access routes.the appellate court characterized the project as a modification of the prior project,upheld the decision not to prepare an eir,and found the agency mitigated negative declaration sufficient.however,the court did so based on an assessment of the environmental effects of the proposed project revisions,not on the magnitude or character of the changes or its treatment of the issue as a question of law.benton board of supervisors,supra,d at.
treating the issue as a question of law,as the court did in save our neighborhood,inappropriately undermines the deference due the agency in administrative matters.that principle of deference is otherwise honored by the substantial evidence test resolution of any reasonable doubts in favor of the administrative finding and decision.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california,supra,cal d at.
most significantly,holding that the court should decide as a matter of law if the later project is a revision of a previously approved project or an entirely new project,without consideration of the environmental impacts of the later project,violates the legislative mandate that courts shall not interpret this division or the state guidelines in a manner which imposes procedura
