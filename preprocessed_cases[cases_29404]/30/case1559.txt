appellants century exploration new orleans,llc century and champion exploration,llc champion appeal from a judgment of the court of federal claims claims court granting summary judgment to the government on the issue of breach of contract.
century and champion are in the business of oil and gas exploration,development,and production.they jointly leased the mineral rights to land on the outer continental shelf from the government.the terms of their lease allowed the government to change existing regulatory requirements under the outer continental shelf lands act of ocsla,et.the appellants argue the government breached their lease because it imposed additional regulatory requirements pursuant to the oil pollution act opa,et.we agree with the claims court that the government made these changes pursuant to ocsla,not opa,and we affirm.
background 
appellants century and champion obtained an oil and gas lease from the government for a acre tract called block,ewing bank located on the outer continental shelf.they made an initial bonus payment of to acquire the lease and have paid the government additional rental payments of per acre,per lease year per year since that initial payment.the lease lease no.ocs g became effective on august,and had an initial term running through july.section of the lease provided 
this lease is issued pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act of august,stat,et seq,as amended stat,hereinafter called the act.the lease is issued subject to the act all regulations issued pursuant to the act and in existence upon the effective date of this lease all regulations issued pursuant to the statute in the future which provide for the prevention of waste and conservation of the natural resources of the outer continental shelf and the protection of correlative rights therein and all other applicable statutes and regulations.
in mobil oil exploration producing southeast,united states,the supreme court interpreted a lease provision that was nearly identical to the one at issue here.in mobil oil,the question was whether certain oil company leases were subject to a new statute,the outer banks protection act,stat.repealed,which was enacted after the leases were signed and changed the requirements applicable to the lessees.mobil oil,at.the court held that the leases were subject to all statutes and regulations in existence as of their effective date,but,as to future regulations,were subject only to ocsla regulations issued after the effective date of the leases.id.at.thus,the court concluded that the government imposition of new regulatory requirements pursuant to the outer banks protection act breached the leases.id.at.here,appellants similarly claim that the government changed regulatory requirements after the effective date of their lease pursuant to opa,not ocsla.
on april,an explosion and fire on the deepwater horizon oil rig a drilling rig located in the gulf of mexico killed eleven workers and resulted in an oil spill that lasted several months.although the rig was equipped with a blowout preventer a mechanism designed to stop the flow of oil in the event of a blowout this device failed to function after the accident.by the time the drill operator finally managed to cap the oil well on july,days after the initial blowout,billion barrels of crude oil had been released into the gulf.as a result of the spill,the government imposed new regulatory requirements,which the appellants urge increase the cost of their required bond.the question is whether these requirements were imposed under ocsla or opa.
on january,century filed a complaint in the claims court.in its complaint,century asserted that,as a result of these new regulations,the government breached its lease agreement with plaintiffs count i that it effected an uncompensated taking of its private property in violation of the fifth amendment count ii and that the government activities may have given rise to other,unspecified causes of action count iii.in support of its breach claim,century alleged that the government changes to the applicable regulations violated various sections of the administrative procedure act apa,were therefore unauthorized,and breached the lease.on september,champion filed a complaint against the government,adopting the allegations century set forth in its complaint.since this appeal is exclusively concerned with the appellants breach claims,we confine our discussion to that issue.
on july,the government filed a motion for summary judgment on the appellants breach of contract claims.the government argued that it had not breached the appellants lease.in the alternative,the government argued that even if it had breached the contract,the sovereign acts doctrine shielded it from liability.the appellants filed a for partial summary judgment,seeking a determination that the government was liable for breach of contract.
in response to these motions,the claims court granted summary judgment to the government,holding that it did not breach any express term of the lease.the claims court also found that the government did not breach its implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.with respect to the appellants apa challenges,the court held that it did not possess subject matter jurisdiction to hear such claims.in the alternative,the claims court held that the government was not liable under the sovereign acts doctrine.the claims court entered a final judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b in favor of the government,dismissing the appellants breach of contract claims with prejudice.
century and champion timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.united states great am.ins.of.the interpretation of the lease is also an issue of law that we review de novo.sanchez son,united states.
discussion 
express breach 
the principal issue presented in this appeal is whether the government breached any express term of century and champion lease.as discussed above,the supreme court considered a nearly identical oil lease provision in mobil oil.the court held that the lease should be interpreted to protect the lessees from new statutes,new nonocsla regulations,and changes to the text of ocsla itself.mobil oil,at.but the lessees were required to comply with changes in ocsla regulations.as the court explained 
t he lease contracts say that they are subject to regulations and to certain future regulations,those issued pursuant to ocsla and certain other statutes this explicit reference to future regulations makes it clear that the catchall provision that references all other applicable regulations,must include only statutes and regulations already existing at the time of the contract,a conclusion not questioned here by the government.
id.at second omission in original internal citation omitted.this court followed the supreme court interpretation of the lease language in amber resources united states,and held that similar lease language only obligated compliance with future changes to ocsla regulations.id.at.
initially,some description of ocsla and opa is useful.ocsla provides that the united states,and not the individual states,shall have jurisdiction and control over the submerged lands of the outer continental shelf see barker hercules offshore,cir ocsla asserts exclusive federal question jurisdiction over the ocs.congress enacted ocsla to ensure that a vital national resource reserve held by the federal government for the public would be made available for expeditious and orderly development,subject to environmental safeguards,in a manner which is consistent with the maintenance of competition and other national needs.in furtherance of this objective,the department of interior interior department enters into mineral leases with private parties.these mineral leases authorize private parties,such as oil companies,to explore the outer continental shelf for oil and natural gas and extract any reserves that are discovered.thus,the only entities entitled to conduct oil and gas exploration,development,and production on the outer continental shelf are lessees of the federal government.see id.in enacting ocsla,congress was careful to stipulate that 
operations in the outer continental shelf should be conducted in a safe manner by personnel using technology,precautions,and techniques sufficient to prevent or minimize the likelihood of blowouts,loss of well control,fires,spillages,physical obstruction to other users of the waters or subsoil and seabed,or other occurrences which may cause damage to the environment or to property,or endanger life or health.
id.emphasis added.
ocsla vests the secretary of the interior interior secretary with the authority to regulate exploration under the oil and gas leases,as well as the resulting development and production activities.id.specifically,ocsla provides that the secretary 
shall prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of ocsla.the secretary may at any time prescribe and amend such rules and regulations as he determines to be necessary and proper in order to provide for the prevention of waste and conservation of the natural resources of the outer continental shelf,and the protection of correlative rights therein,and,notwithstanding any other provisions herein,such rules and regulations shall,as of their effective date,apply to all operations conducted under a lease issued or maintained under the provisions of this subchapter.
id.a emphasis added.thus,ocsla authorize s the interior department,by valid regulations,to impose anywhere in the ocs all reasonable development and production conditions it deems necessary to its stewardship of the ocs and administration of ocsla.gulf restoration network salazar,cir citing,at,reprinted in.pursuant to this authority,the interior secretary has promulgated regulations and orders that govern a lessee oil exploration,development,and production activities on the outer continental shelf.see pt.
the oil pollution act,et,is simultaneously narrower and broader in scope than ocsla.in,congress enacted opa in response to rising public concern following the exxon valdez oil spill.the oil pollution act overview,united states environmental protection agency,http last visited.this law expanded the federal government ability to respond to oil spills by imposing strict liability on parties responsible for releasing oil into navigable waters.see.thomas wagner,the oil pollution act of an analysis.com.opa also created the national oil spill liability trust fund,which can be used to clean up oil spills when the party responsible is unknown or refuses to pay.see oil spill liability trust fund,united states environmental protection agency,http last visited.thus,unlike ocsla,which covers all mineral activity on the outer continental shelf pursuant to leases from the united states,opa is specifically designed to govern oil spill prevention,clean up,and compensation in all united states navigable waters whatever the source of the exploration,development,and production rights.inho kim,ten years after the enactment of the oil pollution act of a success of a failure,marine pol y,wagner,supra,at oil pollution act of opa,united states coast guard.asp last visited.however,the opa regulations involved here only apply to activities on the outer continental shelf.see ch.ii,pt,subpt.
oil and gas companies leasing land on the outer continental shelf must comply with both ocsla and opa.these statutes contain some overlapping provisions,in particular those relating to the remediation of oils spills.for example,during the relevant period,both ocsla and opa regulations required oil companies to submit oil spill response plans.ocsla regulation required all outer continental shelf lessees to provide such a plan.see also oil and gas and sulphur operations in the outer continental shelf plans and information.opa regulation required all owners or operators of oil handling,storage,or transportation facilities located seaward of the coast line that is,on the outer continental shelf to submit a plan.ocsla and opa regulations required these plans to ensure that oil and gas companies were prepared to respond to any oil spills that might result from their activities off the united states coastline.
even prior to the execution of the appellants lease,ocsla and its implementing regulations required lessees to submit an exploration plan to the government before commencing any drilling activities.see c,e.such an exploration plan detailed the lessee proposed exploration activities on the outer continental shelf and required government approval before the lessee commenced any exploration activity.importantly,the regulations required that such an exploration plan include an oil spill response plan that contained a calculation of the volume of oil that would result from a worst case discharge scenario.id.a iv.a worst case discharge scenario was defined as the daily rate of an uncontrolled flow of natural gas and oil from all producible reservoirs into the open wellbore that would result from a blowout,such as the one that triggered the deepwater horizon disaster.worst case discharge determination,bureau of ocean energy management,worst case.aspx last visited.lessees were also required to demonstrate oil spill financial responsibility for facilities proposed in their exploration plan,e,and the appellants elected to comply by posting a bond.see describing the different methods of demonstrating oil spill financial responsibility.the appellants bond requirements depended on their worst case discharge volume the greater the worst case discharge volume,the larger the bond required to cover their potential liability.see id.setting out the correspondence between worst case discharge volume and bond requirement 
opa did not require oil companies to submit an exploration plan rather,each company was required to submit an oil spill response plan,which included a worst case discharge scenario.as with the ocsla requirements,this only applied to outer continental shelf lessees.
the ocsla regulations borrowed and incorporated the opa regulation method of calculating worst case discharge volume and the assumptions for that calculation.thus,outer continental shelf lessees were required to follow methodology when calculating worst case discharge volume for ocsla purposes,and all oil and gas operators were required to follow methodology when calculating worst case discharge volume for opa purposes.finally,an ocsla regulation,enabled the government to issue notices to lessees and operators ntls that clarify,supplement,or provide more detail about certain requirements,of the ocsla statute and regulations.as the interior department has explained,it issues ntls to explain and clarify its regulations.oil and gas and sulphur operations in the outer continental shelf plans and information.the opa statute and the opa regulations thereunder made no provision for the issuance of ntls.
the appellants contend that the ntls in this case are equivalent to new regulations within the meaning of the lease provisions.even assuming the ntls are new regulations,however,they were issued pursuant to ocsla,and thus do not breach the lease.
the change at issue here concerns the worst case discharge calculation and the bond requirement that corresponds to that calculation.the government issued notice to lessees ntl and related documents on june,after the effective date of the lease.this order and the various documents explaining it required lessees to make changes to the way they calculated worst case discharge volume.see infra slip.op.at.the only identified consequence of this alteration was to alter the lessees bond requirement.
the appellants argue that the government issuance of ntl breached their lease because it changed the worst case discharge scenario,thereby imposing additional bonding costs,and the change was made pursuant to opa,not ocsla.there appears to be no dispute as to the first question.at oral argument,the appellants clarified that,in their view,ntl resulted in four principal changes to the worst case discharge calculation,which increased their corresponding bond requirement first,and most importantly,after the effective date of the lease,the government sent an email to stating that under ntl,the appellants must i ncrease the length of time of the uncontrolled blowout response from to days.prior to ntl,the ocsla regulations,by reference to opa regulation a,only required oil company lessees to assume that oil would flow from their wells for days during a blowout when calculating their worst case discharge volumes.the government email to century explained that the appellants should revise their exploration plan in light of ntl and now assume that oil would flow from their well for days when calculating the worst case discharge volume.
second,prior to the issuance of ntl,lessees did not have to include all reservoirs that a drilling operator might pass through to reach its intended drilling location in the calculation of the uncontrolled flow that could result from a blowout.the parties do not specify the source of this obligation.however,the frequently asked questions document faq document accompanying apparently modified this requirement.under ntl,lessees must consider all reservoirs,not just where you drilling to,but anything you might pass through when calculating worst case discharge volume.oral argument,available at.html.more specifically,lessees must now determine the daily rate of an uncontrolled flow from all producible reservoirs into the open wellbore.emphasis added.
third,ntl changed assumptions regarding what could be treated as being in the wellbore when calculating worst case discharge volume.previously,lessees counted the fact that certain equipment,such as drillpipe,logging tools,and drill bits were in the wellbore,thereby reducing total discharge volume,when they calculated worst case discharge volume.again,the source of this requirement is unclear.however,the faq document explained that lessees should now assume that the wellbore is free of drillpipe,logging tools,or other similar equipment.emphasis added.thus,under ntl,lessees no longer consider anything being in the wellbore.oral argument,available at.html.
fourth,ntl prohibits lessees from including the presence of a blowout preventer the mechanism that failed to contain the deepwater horizon blowout in their worst case discharge calculation.as the appellants explained at oral argument,for years beforehand you counted the fact that you had a blowout preventer on the well when you determined worst case discharge.id.at.once again,the source of this requirement is not specified.however,the faq document stated that lessees should now assume that a blowout preventer is not connected to the wellhead.
prior to the issuance of ntl,the appellants worst case discharge volume was barrels and their corresponding bond requirement amounted to million.the appellants contend,and the government does not contest,that ntl and the various documents explaining that order increased their worst case discharge volume to barrels per day and their corresponding bond requirement to million.
while not disputing the existence of the changes or their impact,the government urges that the changes were made pursuant to ocsla,not opa.the appellants argue that they were made pursuant to opa.more precisely,appellants argue that because ntl and related documents changed the assumptions lessees must follow when calculating their worst case discharge volume,and the regulation governing the worst case scenario calculation is an opa regulation,ntl effectively changed an opa regulation.in response,the government explains that the ocsla regulation outlining what oil spill information lessees must include in their exploration plans,a iv,simply incorporates the opa methodology for calculating worst case discharge volume through reference.the government points out that ntl did not change the text of the opa regulation itself.rather,in the government view,it altered only ocsla regulatory requirements.
we agree with the government.initially,it is important that ocsla authorized the government to adopt regulations concerning blowout protection and worst case discharge scenarios the government did not need to act under the authority granted by opa.pursuant to section of the lease,the government could issue new ocsla regulations which provide for the prevention of waste and conservation of the natural resources of the outer continental shelf by the lessees.this lease provision can be traced directly to of ocsla the secretary may at any time prescribe and amend such rules and regulations as he determines to be necessary and proper in order to provide for the prevention of waste and conservation of the natural resources of the outer continental shelf,and the protection of correlative rights therein emphasis added.
the case law interpreting gives a broad scope to the phrase prevention of waste and conservation of the natural resources,making clear that it extends to environmental protection.see,pauley petroleum united states,explaining that a new regulation imposing absolute liability on lessees for any pollution resulting from their activities would be lawful and reasonable because ocsla provides t he secretary may at any time prescribe and amend such rules and regulations in order to provide for the prevention of waste and conservation of the natural resources of the outer continental shelf quoting a get oil out exxon,cir union oil of cal.morton,cir stating that the phrase conservation of the natural resources of the outer continental shelf encompasses all the natural resources of the shelf,not merely the mineral resources citations omitted gulf oil morton,cir i n authorizing the secretary to issue regulations,ocsla speaks of conservation of the natural resources of the outer continental shelf,not just of conservation of oil,gas,sulphur and other mineral resources its natural meaning would encompass all such resources,not just oil and gas,sulphur and other minerals.quoting a.thus,the case law supports a finding that ocsla endows the government with the authority necessary to regulate worst case discharge scenarios and to require adequate bonding.see also a a authorizing the interior secretary to require lessees to post a bond in accordance with the applicable regulations.
nevertheless,the appellants point out that the mere existence of government authority to act under ocsla does not immunize the government from liability for regulatory changes.to avoid liability for changes,the government must also have acted pursuant to ocsla authority.in mobil oil,the government argued that,irrespective of the statutory change at issue in that case,the government could have undertaken the exact same action pursuant to ocsla.at.the supreme court rejected this argument,recognizing that the new requirements were created by the outer banks protection act,a later enacted statute,mobil oil,at,not an ocsla regulation.the court explained that t he fatal flaw in the government argument arises out of the interior department own statement a statement made when citing the outer banks protection act to explain its approval delay.id.at.thus,even though ocsla may have permitted the government to require the exact same actions the outer banks protection act required,because the government cited the outer banks protection act as the authority for carrying out these actions,the court found that the government effectuated them pursuant to the outer banks protection act and was liable for breach.in reaching this conclusion,the supreme court emphasized the government chosen source of authority the government cited the outer banks protection act,not ocsla regulations.id.
we confirmed this approach in amber.in amber,congress amended the coastal zone management act to impose new regulatory requirements.at.thus,amber turned on whether these new requirements breached the oil companies contracts.id.relying on mobil oil,we reasoned that b ecause the coastal zone management act amendments imposed significantly more burdensome requirements for granting lease suspensions,the new statute in this case breached the lease agreements in the same way as the new statute in mobil oil.id.at.the government argued that it could have undertaken the exact same action pursuant to the ocsla regulations in effect at that time.id.at.nevertheless,because the government imposed new r
