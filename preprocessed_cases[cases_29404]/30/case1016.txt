ecology center,ecology center challenges the united states forest service forest service or service lolo national forest post burn project project,which was designed in the aftermath of the wildfires on the lolo national forest lnf.ecology center raises a number of procedural and substantive claims under the national environmental policy act nepa and the national forest management act nfma.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.because we find that the forest service decision to permit logging in critical forest and habitats was arbitrary and capricious,we reverse the grant of summary judgment to the service and remand.
in,wildfires burned approximately acres on the lolo national forest.while the fires caused considerable damage to the forest,they also created habitat for species that are dependent upon habitats,such as the woodpecker.
in response to the fires,the forest service began developing the lolo national forest post burn project and preparing the requisite environmental impact statement eis.the forest service considered four alternatives in detail,including a no action alternative.in july,the forest service selected a slightly modified version of alternative number five for the project.this alternative involves,inter alia,commercial thinning of small diameter timber and prescribed burning in forest stands,as well as salvage logging of burned and insect killed timber in various areas of the forest.
on february,ecology center filed its complaint,raising several claims under nepa and nfma.ecology center objects to the forest service decision to permit commercial logging in forest stands,raising concerns about the impact of such logging on the viability of species that are dependent upon habitat,such as the pileated woodpecker and the northern goshawk.similarly,ecology center questions the service impact analysis of salvage logging in habitat,particularly with respect to the woodpecker,a sensitive species.ecology center also raises concerns regarding the impact of the project on soil conditions and questions the reliability of the service soil quality analysis.
ecology center moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction,both of which the district court denied.the parties then filed for summary judgment.on november,the district court struck declarations that ecology center had included with its motion and granted summary judgment in favor of the forest service 
because this is a record review case,we may direct that summary judgment be granted to either party based upon our de novo review of the administrative record.lands council powell,cir,amended by cir.our review of agency actions challenged under nfma and nepa is governed by the judicial review provisions of the administrative procedure act,a.neighbors of cuddy mountain forest,cir ctr.for biological diversity forest,cir.under the apa,we review to determine if the agency actions were arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise contrary to law.lands council,at.

treatment of habitat 
the project involves what the forest service characterizes as rehabilitative treatment of and potential forest stands this treatment entails the thinning of stands via commercial logging and prescribed burning.the forest service cites a number of studies that indicate such treatment is necessary to correct uncharacteristic forest development resulting from years of fire suppression.the service also points out that the treatment is designed to leave most of the desirable trees in place and to improve their health.
ecology center highlights the scientific uncertainty and debate regarding the necessity,design,and effects of such treatment.in particular,ecology center alleges that the treatment of forest harms species that are dependent upon habitat.for example,ecology center claims that,even if treatment leaves most trees in place,it removes or alters other essential elements within habitat and disturbs bird species currently nesting or foraging within targeted stands although treatment may be designed to restore to historic conditions,ecology center points out this can be a misleading concept for example,information regarding historic conditions is incomplete altering particular sections of forest in order to achieve historic conditions may not make sense when the forest as a whole has already been fundamentally changed many variables can affect treatment outcomes and the treatment process is qualitatively different from the natural or historic processes it is intended to mimic.
while ecology center does not offer proof that the proposed treatment causes the harms it fears,the service does not offer proof that the proposed treatment at least does not dependent species.ecology center argues that because the forest service has not assessed the effects of treatment on dependent species,the service can not be reasonably certain that treating is consistent with nfma substantive mandate to ensure species diversity and viability.as a result,especially given the scientific uncertainty surrounding the treatment of stands,the forest service decision to treat additional stands was arbitrary and capricious.
although the forest service points to a report which notes that two species of woodpecker were observed foraging in treated forest,it does not otherwise dispute the charge that it has not directly monitored the impact of treating on dependent species.instead,the service maintains that it need not do so because it has observed the effects of thinning stands via commercial logging and prescribed burning on forest composition,it has reason to believe that certain dependent species would prefer the composition of forest stands,and its assumption that treatment does not harm dependent species is therefore reasonable.the service further argues that we must defer to its methodological choices regarding what to monitor and how to assess the impact of treatment.
an agency choice of methodology is entitled to deference.see,salmon river concerned citizens robertson,cir.however,there are circumstances under which an agency choice of methodology,and any decision predicated on that methodology,are arbitrary and capricious.for example,we have held that in order to comply with nfma,the forest service must demonstrate the reliability of its scientific methodology.lands council,at holding nfma require s that the hypothesis and prediction of the model be verified with observation.here,as in lands council,the forest service conclusion that treating forest is beneficial to dependent species is predicated on an unverified hypothesis.while the service predictions may be correct,the service has not yet taken the time to test its theory with any on the ground analysis,despite the fact that it has already treated forest elsewhere and therefore has had the opportunity to do so.just as it would be arbitrary and capricious for a pharmaceutical company to market a drug to the general population without first conducting a clinical trial to verify that the drug is safe and effective,it is arbitrary and capricious for the forest service to irreversibly treat more and more forest without first determining that such treatment is safe and effective for dependent species.this is not a case in which the forest service is asking for the opportunity to verify its theory of the benefits of treatment.rather,the service is asking us to grant it the license to continue treating forests while excusing it from ever having to verify that such treatment is not harmful.
the service argues that under inland empire public lands council forest,cir,we must defer to its decision to monitor only the effect of treatment on forest composition,instead of also monitoring the effect of treatment on dependent species.however,inland empire is inapposite here.in that case,we permitted the service to determine that it was complying with its duty to maintain species viability by using a method for monitoring species population.id.at.but see idaho sporting congress,at finding use of approach arbitrary and capricious where there is evidence that the methodology does not reasonably ensure viable populations of the species at issue.under the approach,the service does not ensure that it is maintaining species viability by directly monitoring species populations.instead,the service designates certain management indicator species as proxies for other species with comparable habitat needs.it then designates certain kinds of habitat as proxies for the management indicator species.finally,it assumes that a species viability is maintained so long as the requisite amount of the species habitat is maintained.here,the service is not simply maintaining the amount of habitat necessary to support dependent is altering the composition of habitat through an invasive process.
although the service concedes that the opinions of experts vary with respect to the appropriateness of management activities in areas,it also argues that it must have the discretion to rely on the reasonable opinions of its own qualified experts even if,as an original matter,a court might find contrary views more persuasive.marsh oregon natural resources council,d.however,this is not a case in which different experts have studied the effects of commercial thinning and prescribed burning in forests and reached different conclusions.here,experts have differing hypotheses regarding the effects that treating has on dependent species,yet the forest service proposes to continue treating without first taking the time to observe what those effects actually are.in light of its responsibilities under nfma,this is arbitrary and capricious.
the eis did not address in any meaningful way the various uncertainties surrounding the scientific evidence upon which the decision to treat the lolo national forest rests.seattle audubon soc y espy,cir.although the eis identifies the public concerns regarding the impact of treatment on dependent species as key or driving issues the eis does not actually explain in any detail the bases of those concerns,much less address them.id.finding nepa violation where forest service failed to include a full discussion of the scientific uncertainty surrounding its strategy for maintaining spotted owl viability.the eis discusses in detail only the service own reasons for proposing treatment,and it treats the prediction that treatment will benefit dependent species as a fact instead of an untested and debated hypothesis.even if the service considered these issues but concluded that it need not or could not undertake further scientific study regarding the impact of treatment on dependent species,it should have explain ed in the eis why such an undertaking wa s not necessary or feasible.id.for these reasons,we also find that the service analysis of the impact of treating to be inadequate under nepa 
salvage harvesting of woodpecker habitat 
the forest service has designated the woodpecker as a sensitive species,a species for which viability is a concern.the woodpecker viability is sensitive because it is particularly dependent upon landscapes,and the combination of efforts and past salvage logging has drastically reduced the amount of habitat.according to the eis,d ue to this reduction in habitat,woodpeckers went from being relatively abundant to relatively rare.to make matters worse,not all fires create woodpecker habitat,and the burned stands that do qualify only serve as woodpecker habitat for a limited number of years.as a result,new habitat must be continuously generated.
ecology center and the forest service agree that prior to the fires,there was a critical shortage of woodpecker habitat.specifically,the service estimated that from to,fires created a total of acres of habitat of those acres were burned in alone.this total was estimated to be of what would have been created historically over a comparable period.at that level,the service considered the woodpecker and other habitat dependent species to be at extreme risk.
writing in november about the effect on woodpeckers,forest service scientists explained we concluded in that salvage of any habitat on the lolo national forest will impact individuals or habitat and with a consequence that the action may contribute to a trend towards federal listing or cause a loss of viability to the population or species.they explained that a small amount less than acres of salvage could be permitted,but only if there was a commitment to creation of habitat of an equal amount through prescribed fires.under those two conditions,they believed that salvaging would not likely cause a loss of viability to the population,even though it may impact individuals or habitat.
from the eis,it appears that at the time the project was developed,there was a total of acres of woodpecker habitat in the lolo national forest there were acres that were created by fires and were less than five years old,plus acres of habitat that were created by the fires.of those acres,are located in the project area.the selected alternative originally proposed salvage harvesting of those acres.however,the record of decision reduced that amount to acres 
the forest service maintains that the project complies with nfma because the fires created a large amount of potential habitat,and only a small portion will be salvaged.the service further points out that the project includes mitigation measures designed to minimize the adverse impact of salvaging however,r esearch has also indicated that salvage logging,even when large numbers of snags are left,is detrimental to this species.for example,one study found that woodpeckers did not nest in areas that were considered lightly salvaged.in addition,the project mitigation measures do not provide for the creation of an equal amount of habitat elsewhere 
the eis fails to adequately explain the basis for the forest service conclusion that eliminating a portion of the habitat will not adversely affect the woodpeckers viability.prior to the fires,the amount of habitat was so low that the woodpecker and other habitat dependent species were deemed at extreme risk,and forest service experts concluded that salvage of any habitat would impact individuals or habitat with a consequence that the action may contribute to a trend towards federal listing or cause a loss of viability to the population or species.yet,the project eis meaningful even though salvaging habitat may negatively impact individual woodpeckers,it will not likely result in a trend towards federal listing.without more,this general statement regarding the possible impact and risk involved do es not constitute a hard look absent a justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided.neighbors of cuddy mountain,at providing that the eis shall be supported by evidence that the agency has made the necessary environmental analyses.
we can discern from the eis only one possible basis for the service changed assessment of the impact of salvaging the fact that the fires created additional habitat,which raised the total amount of habitat.however,we can not conclude from this fact alone that the habitat level is no longer critically low and that the previously prescribed restrictions on salvaging should no longer be enforced to be reasonably certain that the habitat levels would be sufficient to ensure species viability,one must know where the threshold between critical and sufficient levels of burned habitat lies.because the eis does not disclose what this threshold is,much less explain how the threshold was determined,we can not evaluate the service decision.indeed,we can not even be certain that the service determined and considered this factor when making its assessment.
similarly,the eis does not indicate how much further habitat levels have to drop before the species is downgraded from sensitive to threatened or how the service plans to generate additional woodpecker habitat to losses from salvaging,the passage of time,and ongoing efforts.where,as here,the information in the eis was so incomplete or misleading that the decisionmaker and the public could not make an informed comparison of the alternatives,revision of an eis may be necessary to provide a reasonable,good faith,and objective presentation of the subjects required by nepa.animal def.council hodel,cir quoting johnston davis,cir,amended by cir see also idaho sporting cong.thomas,cir a llowing the forest service to rely on expert opinion without hard data either vitiates a plaintiff ability to challenge an agency action or results in the courts second guessing an agency scientific conclusions.as both of these results are unacceptable,we conclude that nepa requires that the public receive the underlying environmental data from which a forest service expert derived her opinion.
thus,we hold that the forest service failed to either adequately explain its impact assessment or provide the information that is necessary to understand and evaluate the forest service decision to permit salvaging of the woodpeckers rare habitat,in violation of nepa.
the designation of a species as sensitive arises from the forest service obligations under nfma.pursuant to g b,the forest service is required to provide for diversity of plant and animal communities.the forest service duty to maintain viable populations applies with special force to sensitive species.friends of the clearwater dombeck,cir citation and quotation omitted.the lolo national forest plan requires,more specifically,that the forest service manage to maintain population viability for plant and animal species that are not threatened or endangered,but where viability is a concern,sensitive species.
because the forest service failed to provide the factual basis for its analysis and failed to adequately explain its decision,we can not be reasonably certain that the the service concedes may harm individual not jeopardize the woodpeckers viability.native ecosystems council forest,cir finding nfma violation where we can not reasonably determine that the forest service has complied with the forest plan.we therefore hold that the decision to salvage harvest woodpecker habitat is also arbitrary and capricious under nfma.
ecology center next challenges the forest service soil quality analysis.under the applicable regional soil quality standard,the forest service can not allow an activity that would create detrimental soil conditions in fifteen percent of the activity area ecology center claims that the methodology the forest service used to determine what percentage of soil is in a detrimental state in each activity area was insufficiently reliable because the service estimated soil conditions on the basis of maps,samples from throughout the forest,aerial reconnaissance,and computer modeling,but did not verify those estimates by directly observing soil conditions in the activity areas 
we addressed a nearly identical claim,involving the same regional soil quality standard,in lands council see lands council,at.in that case,based on samples from throughout the forest,and aerial photographs,the forest service estimated the quality of the soils in the project area using a spreadsheet model.id.at.we held that the forest service reliance on the spreadsheet models,unaccompanied by spot verification of the model predictions,violated nfma.id.at.in so holding,we relied on the analysis of an earlier district court case,kettle range conservation group forest,d,where the forest service,based on assumptions from general data from the forest soils,geological maps,and aerial photographs,estimated the condition of each unit,tried to determine which units might exceed established standards,and projected potassium levels.id.at emphasis in original.
although the methodologies in this case,lands council,and kettle range all appear to suffer from the same critical defect,the forest service argues that lands council is not controlling here.specifically,the service argues that the regional soil quality standard is not binding with respect to projects in the lolo national forest.in addition,the forest service argues that this case is factually distinguishable from lands council because,notwithstanding the nature of the standard,the forest service completed sufficient verification of its soil quality estimates.we address each argument in turn 
the regional soil quality standard 
the forest service argues that the standard is not binding because it was never incorporated into the lolo national forest plan,and although it was incorporated into the forest service manual,this court has held that the forest service manual does not have the independent force and effect of law.western radio servs.espy,cir.
even assuming,arguendo,that the standard does not have the independent force and effect of law with respect to the lolo national forest,it would nonetheless be arbitrary and capricious for the forest service to ignore it because both the draft eis and final eis discuss the standard as if it is binding and claim that the service developed the project in compliance with its provisions.thus,even if we were to agree that the standard is merely advisory,we would then be compelled to find that the draft eis and final eis are misleading in violation of nepa.see resources robertson,cir rejecting the argument that the forest service could treat the interagency grizzly bear guidelines as optional where the fish and wildlife service made its no jeopardy conclusion contingent on adherence to the guidelines animal def.council,at noting that a misleading eis violates nepa.moreover,the purpose of the standard is to ensure compliance with the substantive mandates of nfma.the forest service does not explain how it can be certain that the project complies with nfma if the project was not developed in accordance with the standard.
verification of soil conditions 
first,the service points to the transects it conducted during the baer assessment of the fires aftermath.however,during the project development,one of the service own experts pointed out that the transects targeted burned areas,not proposed harvest units as a result,most of the activity areas were not transected thus,the baer transects do not distinguish this case from lands council,where the service similarly did not test much of the activity area.lands council,at,as amended by at.
second,the forest service argues that its soil analysis is nonetheless sufficiently reliable because it utilized data from areas with ecological characteristics similar to the proposed harvest units.lands council expressly rejected this same argument.id.the forest service concedes that it did not test much of the activity area,but argues that because it tested similar soils within the forest,and similar soils act the same way,then the methodology is sound.we note that comments on the project by the service own expert support this holding region scientist nesser argued that the service conclusions regarding soil conditions in the activity areas were not credible because the service did not test the activity areas themselves,as the standard requires 
third,the service points to some informal field reports contained in the record,some of which indicate that a small percentage of the activity areas were observed directly the record provides little information that enables us to assess the reliability or significance of these reports for example,we do not know the qualifications of the persons conducting the field review,the methodology utilized,or whether the field observations confirmed or contradicted the service estimates.moreover,the final eis repeatedly explains that the service will conduct field testing to verify its estimates prior to any activities and there is no indication in the draft eis or final eis that the forest service actually consulted and relied upon any of the field reports it now cites when it was making its selection amongst the project alternatives.thus,we can not conclude that these reports distinguish this case from lands council.
finally,we consider whether the service plan to verify soil conditions in the activity areas after authorizing the project,but before actually commencing harvesting activities,satisfies nfma and nepa.the fact that the service plans to conduct verification prior to any harvesting implies that even the service recognizes that its estimates need to be verified.thus,we conclude that the forest service decision to authorize the project first and verify later does not distinguish this case from lands council,and that the project violates nfma.we also conclude that the service plan to verify its estimates fails to satisfy nepa,because nepa requires consideration of the potential impact of an action before the action takes place.neighbors of cuddy mountain,at quoting city of tenakee springs clough,cir emphasis in original kettle range,d at they the forest service apparently planned to field test sometime in the future.they should have done it before they completed the feis.the failure to do so is a violation of nepa because it shows that usfs did not give a hard look at the effects of the project on the soils in the analysis area.
the forest service selection of modified alternative number for the lolo national forest project violates both nepa and nfma.we reverse the district court summary judgment in favor of the forest service,and direct the district court to enter summary judgment on behalf of ecology center.we remand this case to the forest service for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
reversed and remanded.
the ninth circuit,like the other circuits,repeats frequently the legal mantras of administrative review in the context of environmental decisions arbitrary and capricious,hard look,and no second guessing.these standards are easy to articulate,but it is more difficult to know when we have crossed the line from reviewer to decisionmaker.in this case,we have gone too far.
as summarized in neighbors of cuddy mountain united states forest service,cir,we review agency actions to determine if they were arbitrary or capricious,an abuse of discretion,or not in accordance with law.the limited nature of this inquiry underscores the latitude in implementation and interpretation that congress intended for its agents.this latitude does not relieve us of our duty to insure that the agency took a hard look,as required under the national environmental policy act nepa,or to insure compliance with forest plans under the national forest management act nfma.nor does record review mean that we abdicate our obligation to scrutinize the agency underlying data,assumptions,and conclusions.as a reviewing court,we play a critical role in the review process and we have not been shy in letting the forest service know where it has fallen short as a matter of law and process however,the majority extension of lands council powell,cir,amended by,cir,represents an unprecedented incursion into the administrative process and ratchets up the scrutiny we apply to the scientific and administrative judgments of the forest service.because the majority has,in effect,displaced arbitrary and capricious review for a more demanding standard,i respectfully dissent.
the project under review is designed to address the aftermath of the lolo national forest wildfires in montana in through selected thinning of smaller timber,salvage of timber,prescribed burning and regeneration of thousands of acres.the administrative record in this case is page final environmental impact statement feis,detailed maps and pages of background information.the majority highlights only parts of this record,criticizes the qualifications of the forest service personnel,and questions various scientific judgments.in faulting the forest service soil quality analysis and concluding that forest will not be impaired,the majority changes our posture of review to one where we sit at the table with forest service scientists and the minutiae of the decisionmaking process.
my concern is perhaps best illustrated in the majority application of lands council to the soil quality analysis issue.in lands council,we addressed the forest service analysis of disturbed soil conditions in a watershed restoration project in the idaho panhandle national forest.the forest service had taken soil samples from throughout the forest but not in the activity area.id.at.based on these samples and aerial photographs,it calculated the impact of the watershed restoration project on soil quality in the activity area.id.at.
in lands council,we rejected the forest service choice of scientific methodology because it did not walk or test soil in the activity area.id.we concluded that the forest service reliance on the spreadsheet models,unaccompanied by spot verification of the model predictions,violated nfma.id.at.given the specific record and circumstances in lands council,this resolution may have made perfect sense.but in the abstract,without the ability to compare the record in lands council with the record here,there is no legal basis to conclude that the nfma requires an analysis where there is a reasonable scientific basis to uphold the legitimacy of modeling.nfma does not impose this substantive requirement,and it can not be derived from the procedural parameters of nepa.
application of lands council makes even less sense in this specific case.here,the forest service conducted exactly the kind of analyses found lacking in lands samples in activity areas.the record lists five activity areas surveyed in soil sample transects and details the walkthrough of a number of activity areas.the majority concedes that these analyses exist but criticizes them for being too few and of poor quality resting on this characterization,the majority rejects the forest service soil analysis on the ground that it was nearly identical to the one we found lacking in lands council.
lands council makes compliance with nfma and nepa a moving target.if one reads lands council to require analysis in every case,which i respectfully suggest is an of the case,the circumstances here comply with that dictate.yet the majority now says,without support in the record and absent a challenge by ecology center at the administrative level,that the analysis was insufficient and that we do not possess enough information to know if the inspectors were qualified.from this judgment,we are left to conclude that not only does the court of appeals set rules,such as requiring an,walk the territory inspection,but it also assesses the detail and quality of that in the absence of contrary scientific evidence in the record.page after page of the record contains details on field analysis,such as the following representative sample of an evaluation form 
in my view,it is not our role to criticize this evaluation because,for example,the form does not list the evaluator qualifications.nor are we in a position to unscramble and pass judgment on the investigator field notes,as in the following excerpt,which are summarized and integrated into the feis 
had ecology center offered a credible scientific critique of this methodology or provided some other basis for us to determine whether the forest service judgment was arbitrary and capricious,we would be in a different position.but just as we are not supposed to substitute our judgment for that of the forest service,neither can we rely the absence of center arguments in its briefs or in its expert declaration filed after the administrative review process.
lands council does not direct us to assess the sufficiency of the forest service soil quality analyses beyond the traditional arbitrary and capricious standard it only asks us to verify that there is such an sampling.that opinion stated four times that the forest service had failed to conduct any did not say that the service failed to conduct enough of them the majority now extends the soil analysis doctrine,initiated by lands council,while abandoning its reasoning.although analysis could plausibly be conducted in such a manner as to be arbitrary and capricious,the majority justification for finding this project to be arbitrary and capricious imports a rule where individualized analysis is appropriate.
more importantly,in lands council we did not purport to create a general rule requiring verification for all scientific hypotheses adopted by the forest service regardless of context.we did not even adopt a rule requiring all soil analyses to be verified by sampling.our decision was specific to the facts of that case.see lands council,at under the circumstances of this case,the forest service methodology,to be reliable,required that the hypothesis and prediction of the model be verified with observation.emphasis added.
nevertheless,the majority generalizes the unverified hypothesis principle articulated in lands council beyond the soil analysis context to other scientific findings made by the forest service.in so doing,the majority demonstrates the dangers of extending a from a single,technically detailed,unrelated factual contexts.for example,regarding the claim,the majority reverses the forest service judgment because h ere,as in lands council,the forest service conclusion that treating forest is beneficial to dependent species is predicated on an unverified hypothesis.op.at.the forest service hypothesis is,however,supported by observational data.there is record evidence,based on direct observation,that treatment produces and preserves habitat for dependent species 
the majority applies lands council to prohibit the forest service from inferring simply that because treating preserves or creates habitat for dependent species does not mean that such treatment will not harm the species.op.at claiming that the forest service just assumes that a species viability is maintained so long as the requisite amount of the species habitat is maintained.in reaching this conclusion,the majority acknowledges and then dismisses without explanation the very record evidence it says the forest service failed to,direct observation of certain species seen foraging in areas after treatment 
applying lands council to the issue is inappropriate for yet another reason.the panel assumes that alternative,which involves thinning,salvage,and regeneration,disrupts a stable status quo through an invasive process.op.at.yet the status quo is anything but stable.the forest service presents uncontested evidence that the failure to treat areas risks the very harms feared by ecology center,even though it has provided no evidence to support such a claim.op.at ecology center does not offer proof that the proposed treatment causes the harms it fears.in fact,the record reveals that the failure to treat areas could result in considerable loss of old growth trees from bark beetle predation,which will put at risk specific habitat niches for many wildlife species that are adapted to the more open growth character.areas are now at risk for major disturbances such as disease and insect epidemics and stand replacing fires.inaction or delay threatens the species ecology center seeks to protect.
no one contests the forest service conclusion that treatment will provide direct reduction of bark beetle infestation or risk of future infestation.faced with uncontroverted evidence that inaction may harm areas,the majority still requires the forest service to produce more evidence that treating will not harm dependent species before it will allow the service to save areas from other dangers.under these circumstances,i can not agree that the forest service decision to treat areas was arbitrary and capricious.indeed,had the forest service taken the majority approach,its decision may well have been arbitrary and capricious for fail ing to consider an important aspect of the problem.see lands council,at.
nor do i think it appropriate to analogize the forest service process to the separate and wholly inapposite regime of the food and drug administration fda.the majority writes that it would be arbitrary and capricious for a pharmaceutical company to market a drug to the general population without first conducting a clinical trial just as the forest service can not be permitted to treat more and more forest without first determining that such treatment is safe and effective for dependent species.see op.at.without commenting on the obvious differences between humans and trees and in fact acknowledging the importance of both to our environment,this analogy underscores the degree to which the majority inserts itself into the internal judgments of the forest service.the fda process dictates a substantive and specific administrative course of action in terms of clinical trials and other requirements as a prelude to the approval of drugs and medical devices.neither nepa nor nfma serve that function in the environmental context.to import the notion of clinical trials from the fda context to soil sampling in federal forests is a leap too far.
apparently we no longer simply determine whether the forest service methodology involves a hard look through the use of hard data,but now are called upon to make judgments of its worth.in reaching this conclusion,the majority takes aim at two firmly established lines of precedent in administrative law.first,this view is contrary to the basic principle that we reverse agency decisions only if they are arbitrary and capricious.this standard of review does not direct us to literally dig in the dirt or soil,as it were,get our fingernails dirty and flyspeck the agency analysis.yet the majority does exactly that by rejecting the forest service soil analysis field checks and its observations and historical data in treated forests.the majority rationale can not be reconciled with our case law requiring d eference to an agency technical expertise and experience,particularly with respect to questions involving engineering and scientific matters.united states alpine land reservoir,cir.see also westlands water dist.of interior,cir reversing a district court decision that certain alternatives violated nepa because of inadequate deference to the agency expertise.
because the majority analysis can not be squared with the deferential review required of us,i respectfully dissent.
in separate proceedings,the sierra club challenged the same project at issue here.the district court ruled in favor of the sierra club claim that the forest service was required to determine how much sediment affected streams could assimilate before implementing the project,but ruled in favor of the forest service with respect to its analysis of the project impact on unroaded areas.in a memorandum disposition decided december,we reversed the district court on both claims we found that the forest service assessment of the project effect on water quality satisfied nepa,but that its analysis of the project impact on unroaded areas was inadequate.sierra club,austin.cir.the case was remanded to the district court,and the parties then forest service moved for this court to take judicial notice of the sierra club settlement agreement,and for leave to file supplemental information and declarations explaining the terms of the sett
