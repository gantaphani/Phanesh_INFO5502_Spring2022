united states brought suit against the defendants pursuant to the federal water pollution control act amendments of,stat,as amended et,commonly known as the clean water act cwa.john rapanos,judith rapanos,prodo,rolling meadows hunt club,and pine river bluff estates,appeal the district court entry of judgment in favor of the united states.prodo,rolling meadows hunt club,and pine river bluff estates,are wholly owned by john and judith rapanos.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the rapanos,through their companies,owned various parcels of land in bay,midland,and saginaw counties in michigan.these parcels are known as the salzburg,hines road,pine river,freeland,mapleton,and jefferson avenue sites.the rapanos were charged with illegally discharging fill material into protected wetlands at these sites between and.the united states alleges that the rapanos attempted to fill these wetlands to make the land more conducive to development.
i.the salzburg site 
before filling wetlands subject to cwa jurisdiction,a landowner must first obtain a permit from the army corps of engineers corps.in december,john rapanos asked the state to inspect the salzburg site in hope of obtaining a permit to construct a shopping center at this location.the state informed him that the site was likely a regulated wetland and sent him an application for the necessary permits.a state representative toured the site in march,noting that the site probably contained wetlands but could be developed if the necessary permits were issued.rapanos hired a consultant,goff,to prepare a report detailing the wetlands on the salzburg site.goff concluded that there were between and acres of wetlands on the site,presenting his findings in the form of a report and a map.upset by the report,rapanos ordered goff to destroy both the report and map,as well as all references to rapanos in goff files.however,goff was unwilling to do so.rapanos stated he would destroy goff if he did not comply,claiming that he would do away with the report and bulldoze the site himself,regardless of goff findings.
in april,workers began leveling the ground,filling in low spots,clearing brush,removing stumps,moving dirt,and dumping sand to cover most of the wetland vegetation.this activity caused goff to note that the site now looked like nothing more than a beach.in august the state attempted to inspect the salzburg site,but was denied access.three months later,authorities from the state returned,armed with a search warrant.
in,a state representative returned to the salzburg site,noting that the site had been tiled to drain subsurface water.when rapanos refused to comply with an administrative compliance order issued by the environmental protection agency epa requiring him to immediately cease his filling of the salzburg site,the epa referred the matter to the department of justice.
ii.the hines road site 
the defendants undertook to expand drains,build roads,and fill the wetlands at the hines road site.however,in july,the state issued a cease and desist letter to stop the ongoing activity.rapanos did not reply to this letter.thereafter,the state conducted an examination of the site pursuant to a search warrant in june.in june,the state returned to the site and noted that fill had been added to certain areas since the search.accordingly,the epa issued an administrative compliance order.the epa alleges that rapanos did not comply with this order.
iii.the pine river site 
rapanos also hired contractors at the pine river site to construct ditches,spread dirt and sand,construct roads,and clear vegetation.the state sent rapanos a cease and desist order after an official observed that portions of the wetlands had been filled.the epa issued an administrative compliance order in september after rapanos refused to comply with the cease and desist order.the epa alleges that rapanos also did not comply with the administrative order.
iv.the criminal proceedings 
criminal charges were brought simultaneously with the instant civil action.in july,the district court declared a mistrial in rapanos criminal trial.the trial was moved to flint,michigan and,on march,the jury in the second trial returned a guilty verdict on two counts.united states rapanos.following trial,the district court granted rapanos motion for a new trial,finding that the court had improperly allowed the united states to pursue a line of questioning that was prejudicial to the defendant.id.at.this court,however,determined that the line of questioning was not improper and reversed the district court grant of a new trial and remanded for sentencing.united states rapanos,cir.the district court sentenced rapanos to three years probation and ordered him to pay a fine.on appeal,this court affirmed the conviction but remanded for resentencing.united states rapanos,cir.
the supreme court granted rapanos request for a writ of certiorari,vacating and remanding this court order in light of solid waste agency of northern cook county united states army corps of engineers,d swancc.rapanos united states,d.following remand from the supreme court,this court remanded the case to the district court for further consideration.united states rapanos.cir.on remand,the district court set aside the conviction,finding that the united states lacked jurisdiction in the wake of the supreme court ruling in swancc.united states rapanos,d.on appeal,this court reversed the order of the district court,reinstated the previous conviction and remanded to the district court for resentencing.united states rapanos,cir.a panel of this court determined that,despite the supreme court decision in swancc,the united states retained jurisdiction over the wetlands at issue by virtue of the cwa recently,the supreme court denied rapanos petition for a writ of certiorari.rapanos united states,d.
v.the civil proceedings 
the united states initiated this civil action in february,confining its scope to the salzburg site and naming only rapanos as a defendant.in june,the united states added rapanos to the complaint,as well as prodo,a company owned by rapanos.in february,the united states amended its complaint to add allegations concerning the hines road and pine river sites.pine river bluffs estates was also added as a defendant.
following a bench trial,the district court concluded that rapanos had filled of acres of protected wetlands at the salzburg site,of acres of protected wetlands at the hines road site,and of acres of protected wetlands at the pine river site.the district court concluded that the government had established that of the filled acres fit the three parameters for wetlands,vegetation,soils,and hydrology.in addition,the court found that the united states did not meet its burden regarding the existence of wetlands at the freeland and mapleton sites.the district court entered these findings and conclusions on march,
standard of review 
following a bench trial,this court reviews the district court findings of fact for clear error and reviews its conclusions of law de novo.pledger united states,cir.factual determinations of a trial court are not clearly erroneous unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.quoting anderson city of bessemer city,d.if the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.anderson,at.
discussion 
on appeal,rapanos argues that the district court erred when it held that the disturbed wetlands were adjacent wetlands because they had a surface connection to waters of the united states failed to make subsidiary findings to support its conclusion that the salzburg,hines road,and pine river sites had a hydrological connection to navigable waters allowed plaintiff expert willard to testify failed to consider michigan definition of wetland collaterally estopped rapanos from denying liability at the salzburg site and relied on willard testimony to determine the extent of unauthorized filling.
in,congress reacted to the problem of water pollution by enacting the cwa.the cwa is viewed by some as the federal government main weapon in its effort to protect wetlands.david dornak,a new generation is teeing off is tiger woods making divots on environmentally sound golf courses,colum.envtl.section of the cwa requires landowners to obtain permits from the army corps of engineers corps before discharging fill material into wetlands adjacent to navigable bodies of water and their tributaries.united states riverside bayview homes,d see also.
navigable waters are defined as waters of the united states,including territorial seas.the supreme court and this court have noted that congress chose to define waters covered by the act broadly in the cwa.riverside bayview,at.rapanos,at.determining the precise boundary of which waters are covered by the cwa has been difficult.it is that the cwa covers more than what has come to be known as navigable in fact waters,waters that can be navigated in the traditional sense.see id.at.as the supreme court has noted,cwa jurisdiction extends beyond traditionally navigable waters because economic activities affecting interstate commerce are susceptible to congressional regulation under the commerce clause irrespective of whether navigation,or,indeed,water,is involved.kaiser aetna united states,d.
the cwa broad reach,extending beyond traditionally navigable waters,however,does not extend to all waters.the code of federal regulations contains the corps interpretation of which waters are properly considered waters of the united states.in the present case,the district court relied on the corps exercise of jurisdiction over wetlands adjacent to traditional navigable waters as supporting cwa jurisdiction for the defendants lands.id.at a.it found that the wetlands were adjacent to tributaries of traditional navigable waters.the corps asserts jurisdiction over such waters pursuant to the cwa.id.at a,a.
determining which wetlands are considered adjacent to traditional navigable waters or their tributaries has proved to be a complication in defining cwa jurisdiction.the code of federal regulations states that adjacent means bordering,contiguous,or neighboring.wetlands separated from other waters of the united states by dikes or barriers,natural river berms,beach dunes and the like are adjacent wetlands.c.
in order to invoke federal jurisdiction the wetlands must bear some connection to navigable waters or interstate commerce.determining how much of a connection is necessary has proven difficult.unfortunately,the two leading supreme court cases on the reach of the cwa have done little to clear the muddied waters of cwa jurisdiction.
riverside bayview 
riverside bayview homes owned acres of,marshy land near the shores of lake clair in macomb county,michigan.it began filling part of the land with the intention of constructing a housing development on the site.the corps determined that the land was an adjacent wetland,thus falling under the ambit of the cwa.the district court determined that the land on the site below feet above sea level was a wetland requiring the issuance of a permit before it could be filled.riverside bayview,at.this court reversed the district court,concluding that adjacent wetlands only existed when the land was flooded by adjacent navigable waters at a frequency sufficient to support the growth of aquatic vegetation.united states riverside bayview homes,cir.
this court was largely motivated by fifth amendment takings concerns,concluding that the cwa must be read narrowly to avoid improper condemnation by the government.a unanimous supreme court,however,held that the tucker act,provides the owners of condemned land with the right of compensation and thus concluded that this court was not justified in reading the cwa jurisdiction so narrowly.riverside bayview,at.having disposed of the fifth amendment issue,the court concluded that t he plain language of c refutes the court of appeals conclusion that inundation or frequent flooding by the adjacent body of water is a sine qua non of a wetland under the regulation.id.at.
next,the court addressed the issue of which waters could be considered adjacent to navigable waters.
in determining the limits of its power to regulate discharges under the act,the corps must necessarily choose some point at which water ends and land begins.our common experience tells us that this is often no easy task the transition from water to solid ground is not necessarily or even typically an abrupt one.rather,between open waters and dry land may lie shallows,marshes,mudflats,swamps,short,a huge array of areas that are not wholly aquatic but nevertheless fall far short of being dry land.where on this continuum to find the limit of waters is far from obvious.
the court concluded that to protect against pollution at its source,congress sought to define coverage of the cwa broadly.id.at.it noted that even wetlands that are not connected to adjacent bodies of water and are not regularly inundated by flooding may still have a connection to navigable waters because such water can drain into navigable waters.id.at.these adjacent bodies of water can bring pollution to the navigable waters,resulting in possibly disastrous effects on the habitat and food chain for the native aquatic species.see id.at.thus,the court wrote that 
the corps has concluded that wetlands adjacent to lakes,rivers,streams,and other bodies of water may function as integral parts of the aquatic environment even when the moisture creating the wetlands does not find its source in the adjacent bodies of water w e can not say that the corps judgment on these matters is unreasonable,and we therefore conclude that a definition of waters of the united states encompassing all wetlands adjacent to other bodies of water over which the corps has jurisdiction is a permissible interpretation of the cwa.
after upholding a broad view of the cwa jurisdictional reach in riverside bayview,a divided supreme court invalidated one of the corps jurisdictional regulations in swancc.the regulation at issue,known as the migratory bird rule,extended the definition of waters of the united states to include isolated waters that were used as habitat by migratory birds or endangered species.final rule for regulatory programs of the corps of engineers,previously codified at.the disputed land was a acre parcel straddling the cook and kane county lines in northern illinois.the land was owned by the solid waste agency of northern cook county,a consortium of chicago cities that sought to develop a garbage disposal site.swancc,at.the corps initially determined that it had no jurisdiction over the land because it did not contain any wetlands and did not support vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.id.at.citing b.however,after learning that several migratory birds were observed at the site,the corps asserted jurisdiction under the migratory bird rule.id.
the seventh circuit concluded that the federal government had the authority to use the migratory bird rule,relying on the cumulative impact doctrine to conclude that,in toto,the impact on migratory birds from disturbing wholly intrastate,waters had a substantial impact on interstate commerce.solid waste agency of cook county united states army corps of engineers,cir.a majority of the supreme court disagreed,however,holding that the migratory bird rule was not supported by congress intent in passing the cwa and thus concluding that it was unnecessary to determine whether the migratory bird rule fell within the broadest reach of congress commerce powers.swancc,at.
in doing so,the court first reaffirmed the holding in riverside bayview,pointing out that in riverside bayview 
we noted that the term navigable is of limited import and that congress evidenced its intent to regulate at least some waters that would not be deemed navigable under the classical understanding of that term.but our holding was based in large measure upon congress unequivocal acquiescence to,and approval of,the corps regulations interpreting the cwa to cover wetlands adjacent to navigable waters.we found that congress concern for the protection of water quality and aquatic ecosystems indicated its intent to regulate wetlands inseparably bound up with the waters of the united states.
it was the significant nexus between the wetlands and navigable waters that informed our reading of the cwa in riverside bayview homes.indeed,we did not express any opinion on the question of the authority of the corps to regulate discharges of fill material into wetlands that are not adjacent to open bodies of water.in order to rule for respondents here,we would have to hold that the jurisdiction of the corps extends to ponds that are not adjacent to open water.but we conclude that the test of the statute will not allow this.
swancc,at.citations omitted emphasis in original.
the court also refused to extend chevron deference to the corps interpretation of its authority under the cwa.see chevron natural resources defense council,d.it reasoned that such deference was inappropriate where the corps was infringing upon a power usually reserved to the states,the authority to regulate land and water use.swancc,at.therefore,the court concluded that congress had not envisioned extending cwa jurisdiction to isolated,intrastate,ponds simply by virtue of the fact that they were occasionally the home for migratory birds,despite the corps contrary interpretation of its authority.id.at.
putting riverside bayview and swancc in context 
the court in swancc noted that even reading the cwa through a restrictive lens demonstrates that congress wanted to include all waters adjacent to navigable waters,such as nonnavigable tributaries and streams in its definition of waters of the united states.swancc,at.lower courts have disagreed over the extent to which swancc limited riverside bayview holding.swancc only specifically addressed the migratory bird rule,and in fact specifically held that it was not overruling any aspect of riverside bayview,yet its language has been seen by some as justification for a reduction of the cwa jurisdiction.a minority of courts have done so,reading swancc broadly to limit the cwa to navigable waters and waters that directly abut navigable waters.in re needham,cir fd p enterprises,army corps of engineers,d.conversely,the majority of courts have interpreted swancc narrowly to hold that while the cwa does not reach isolated waters having no connection with navigable waters,it does reach inland waters that share a hydrological connection with navigable waters.rapanos,at treacy newdunn,llp,cir united states deaton,cir,cert.denied,d united states rueth dev,cir,cert.denied,d headwaters talent irrigation district,cir carabell united states army corps of engineers,d,united states interstate,d.
the fifth circuit has adopted the more expansive reading of swancc and thus the more limited interpretation of the cwa jurisdiction.needham,at.the needham court disagreed that water exhibiting a hydrological connection with navigable water should be considered part of the waters of the united states,instead finding that the water must be truly adjacent to navigable waters,or at least have a significant measure of proximity to navigable waters.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the fifth circuit relied heavily on swancc,disagreeing with holdings from the fourth,seventh,and ninth circuits,as well as this court,that have adopted a limited interpretation of swancc.rapanos,at finding that the swancc court merely invalidated the migratory bird rule and did not deal with the corps adjacent waters jurisdiction treacy,at noting that swancc reaffirmed the holding in riverside bayview and did not abridge the corps authority over adjacent waters deaton,at holding that swancc did not disavow any of the corps interpretations of the cwa,save for the migratory bird rule rueth dev,at it is clear that swancc did not affect the law regarding the government alternative asserted basis for jurisdiction adjacency under the adjacent water rule.the corps adjacency jurisdiction is it was upheld by the supreme court in riverside bayview,and was reaffirmed in swancc headwaters,at holding that swancc did not impact its conclusion that waters flowing into navigable waters are within the cwa jurisdiction carabell,d at concluding that swancc holding was narrow and did not require a body of water to directly abut navigable water in order to fall under the jurisdiction of the cwa interstate,d at b ecause the supreme court only reviewed cfr a,it would be improper for this court to extend the swancc court ruling any further than they clearly intended but see fd p enterprises,d at it is the view of this court that the hydrological connection test is no longer the valid mode of analysis.
in rapanos criminal trial,a panel of this court adopted the limited reading of swancc criticized in needham.adopting the fourth circuit reasoning in deaton,this court held that 
because we find the fourth circuit reasoning persuasive,we disagree with the broad interpretation of swancc taken by the district court in this case and,instead,agree with deaton.although the swancc opinion limits the application of the clean water act,the court did not go as far as rapanos argues,restricting the act coverage to only wetlands directly abutting navigable water.instead,the swancc court,in a narrow holding,invalidated the migratory bird rule as exceeding the authority granted to the corps by the cwa,because it found nothing approaching a clear statement from congress that it intended the cwa to reach an abandoned sand and gravel pit.
rapanos,at citations omitted.this court further adopted the holding in deaton,that adjacent waterways include any branch of a tributary system that eventually flows into a navigable body of water.rapanos,at.this court concluded that the wetlands were adjacent because a ny contamination of the rapanos wetlands could affect the drain,which,in turn could affect waters.id.
thus,the primary difference between the conclusion reached by the fifth circuit and that reached by the fourth,sixth,seventh,and ninth circuits,concerns the adjacency requirement.the fifth circuit requires that the water be truly adjacent to navigable waters in order to qualify for cwa jurisdiction.the majority of courts,including this one,however,construe riverside bayview and swancc to hold that,while a hydrological connection between the and navigable waters is required,there is no direct abutment requirement.
what is required for cwa jurisdiction over adjacent waters,however,is a significant nexus between the wetlands and navigable waters,swancc,at,which can be satisfied by the presence of a hydrological connection.rapanos,at see also deaton,at cwa jurisdiction extends to those waters adjacent to any branch of a tributary system that eventually flows into a navigable water,because these waters effect the water quality of navigable waters and thus there is a substantial nexus between the tributaries and the navigable waters headwaters,at because the canals receive water from natural streams and lakes,and divert water to streams and creeks,they are connected as tributaries to other waters of the united states.waters sharing a hydrological connection are interconnected,sharing a symbiotic relationship.as congress acknowledged when passing the cwa,w ater moves in hydrological cycles and it is essential that discharge of pollutants be controlled at the source.rapanos,at citing,at,reprinted in.
unlike the absence of congressional support for the migratory bird rule discussed in swancc,congress clearly envisioned that cwa jurisdiction would extend to bodies of water exhibiting a hydrological connection to traditional navigable waters.as this court previously recognized 
i n riverside bayview the supreme court concluded that the corps regulation extending jurisdiction to adjacent wetlands was a reasonable interpretation in part because of what swancc described as the significant nexus between the wetlands and navigable waters.there is also a nexus between a navigable waterway and its nonnavigable tributaries this nexus,in light of the breadth of congressional concern for protection of water quality and aquatic ecosystems,is sufficient to allow the corps to determine reasonably that its jurisdiction over the whole tributary system of any navigable waterway is warranted.the regulation,as the corps reads it,reflects a reasonable interpretation of the clean water act.
rapanos,at quoting deaton,at.
chevron deference 
the doctrine of administrative deference,also known as chevron deference,provides an alternative ground for affirming the corps authority over waters adjacent to tributaries of navigable waters.when congress delegates authority to enforce a statute to a governmental agency,while leaving some ambiguity in how the agency is to enforce the statute,courts should assume that congress impliedly delegated the authority to interpret the ambiguity to the agency charged with administering the statute.chevron,at.the agency is thus in the position to fill the gaps left by congress.unless the agency interpretation of the statute is arbitrary,unreasonable,or manifestly contrary to the statute,the agency interpretation should be applied.id.at.
in chevron,a unanimous supreme court pointed out that deferring to agency interpretations,rather than requiring judicial interpretation,served the interests of democracy,noting that 
judges are not experts in the field,and are not part of either political branch of the government.courts must,in some cases,reconcile competing political interests,but not on the basis of the judges personal policy preferences.in contrast,an agency to which congress has delegated policymaking responsibilities may,within the limits of that delegation,properly rely upon the incumbent administration views of wise policy to inform its judgments.while agencies are not directly accountable to the people,the chief executive is,and it is entirely appropriate for this political branch of the government to make such policy the competing interests which congress itself either inadvertently did not resolve,or intentionally left to be resolved by the agency charged with the administration of the statute in light of everyday realities.
when a challenge to an agency construction of a statutory provision,fairly conceptualized,really centers on the wisdom of the agency policy,rather than whether it is a reasonable choice within a gap left open by congress,the challenge must fail.in such a case,federal have no a duty to respect legitimate policy choices made by those who do.the responsibilities for assessing the wisdom of such policy choices and resolving the struggle between competing views of the public interest are not judicial ones our constitution vests such responsibilities in the political branches.
id.at.citation omitted.before according deference to agency interpretations,a federal court need not find that the agency interpretation is the only permissible construction but only that its understanding of this statute is a sufficiently rational one to preclude a court from substituting its judgment for that of the agency.chem.mfrs.ass natural resources defense council,d citation omitted.in swancc the supreme court refused to accord chevron deference to the corps migratory bird rule.noting that where an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems,the court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of congress,the court concluded that the migratory bird rule infringed on the state traditional and primary power over land and water use,and thus was not entitled to chevron deference.id.at.citation omitted.in riverside bayview,however,the supreme court accorded chevron deference to the corps conclusion that waters of the united states included wetlands adjacent to navigable waters.at.as the swancc court recognized,deference was appropriate in riverside bayview given the significant nexus between the adjacent waters and navigable waters that was not present in the nonnavigable,isolated,intrastate ponds at issue in swancc whose only connection to interstate commerce was the fact that they were occasionally home to migratory birds.
in deaton,after conducting a thorough review of the cwa,the fourth circuit accorded chevron deference to the corps construction of the cwa that granted it authority over distant,nonnavigable tributaries of navigable waters.deaton,at.in rapanos,this court agreed with the fourth circuit holding in deaton.rapanos,at.because waters containing a hydrological connection to tributaries of navigable waters bear a significant nexus to navigable waters,as in riverside bayview and unlike the waters in swancc,chevron deference is appropriate.the corps interpretation of waters of the united states to include those waters adjacent to tributaries of navigable waters,that share a hydrological connection with those tributaries,is neither arbitrary,unreasonable,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,at.
application to this case 
the defendants argue that this court should impose a direct abutment requirement to cwa jurisdiction over water.in response,the united states asserts that the defendants waived a defense based on swancc by not raising it before the district court.it claims that,while the defendants argued that the cwa does not extend to isolated waters,they did not make the current argument that the cwa does not extend to wetlands adjacent to nonnavigable tributaries.however,the united states is splitting hairs,as this is simply part and parcel of the isolated waters argument the defendants made before the district court.alternatively,the defendants current claim falls under the exceptions to the traditional rule that appellate courts will not entertain arguments raised for the first time on appeal because this argument involves a question of law and the factual record has been fully developed below.taft broadcasting united states,cir.
as discussed supra,rapanos argument regarding swancc has previously been adjudicated by this court,in a published disposition,and its conclusion is entitled to stare decisis.see rapanos,at.indeed,rapanos acknowledged as much during oral arguments.further,this court reasoning in that case is supported by the majority of circuits,by the policy of deferring to agency interpretations,and by a careful examination of the relevant supreme court cases.there is no direct abutment requirement in order to invoke cwa jurisdiction.waters must have a hydrological connection or some other significant nexus to traditional navigable waters in order to invoke cwa jurisdiction.unlike the isolated waters in swancc,these waters are interconnected with traditional navigable waters.
next,the defendants argument that the district court did not find that there was a significant nexus between the wetlands and the navigable waters is similarly misplaced.the district court found that all three sites contained a hydrological connection to navigable waters and thus fell within the jurisdiction of the cwa.specifically,the district court found that 
the salzburg wetlands have a surface water connection to tributaries of the kawkawlin river which,in turn,flows into the saginaw river and ultimately into lake huron.willard testified that the wetlands at the salzburg site had a surface connection to the waters of the united states.in,hal harrington verified that a surface water connection exists between the salzburg site and saginaw bay.
further,hal harrington,chief of the michigan department of environmental quality great lakes submerged lands unit,testified that there was a surface water connection between the salzburg site and the saginaw bay.in he visited the site.during this visit,he observed carp spawning in a roadside stream on the north side of the property.he followed the flow of the water and each road crossing with this surface water connection to saginaw where it entered the river entering saginaw bay north of the bay city state park the kawkawlin river.an expert for rapanos,straw,testified that water left the site through the hoppler drain,which drains into the hoppler creek.this drain is immediately north of the salzburg site 
regarding the hines road site,the district court noted that 
willard testified that the wetlands at the hines road site have a surface water connection to the rose drain which,in turn,has a surface water connection to the tittabawassee river.willard also described the nature of the surface water connection between the wetlands at hines road and the rose drain.in october,dodgers and zbiciak demonstrated that the interior wetlands have a hydrologic connection with the rose drain.
in addition,zbiciak,a representative from the state of michigan,testified that the wetlands drained into the rose drain,which runs along the western side of the site and flows down to the tittabawassee river.a report by charlie dodgers,another representative of the state of michigan,indicated that the site inspection revealed five locations where water moved into the rose drain,as he testified at trial.rapanos claims that ditches he dug in were the only cause of a surface water connection to the rose drain.however,charlie dodgers testified that surface runoff occurred naturally at least seasonally,and one of the united states exhibits demonstrated surface connections to the rose drain as early as.
regarding the pine river site,the district court noted that willard testified that the wetlands at the pine river site have a surface water connection to the pine river,which flows into lake huron.the maps utilized by the united states showed that areas of wetlands on the site were in close proximity to the pine river although they did not delineate the specific paths these wetlands would have taken to drain into the river.
although the defendants claim that the evidence did not support these conclusions,the record demonstrates that there were hydrological connections between all three sites and corresponding adjacent tributaries of navigable waters.see rapanos,at because the wetlands are adjacent to the drain and there exists a hydrological connection among the wetlands,the drain,and the kawkawlin river,we find an ample nexus to establish jurisdiction.moreover,the defendants are certainly unable to show that the district court conclusions were clearly erroneous.pledger,at.the district court was in a far superior position to judge the complicated facts of this case after presiding over the lengthy proceedings and the bench trial.further,
t he rationale for deference to the original finder of fact is not limited to the superiority of the trial judge position to make determinations of credibility.the trial judge major role is the determination of fact,and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise.duplication of the trial judge efforts in the court of appeals would very likely contribute only negligibly to the accuracy of fact determination at a huge cost in diversion of judicial resources.in addition,the parties to a case on appeal have already been forced to concentrate their energies and resources on persuading the trial judge that their account of the facts is the correct one requiring them to persuade three more judges at the appellate level is requiring too much.as the court has stated in a different context,the trial on the merits should be the main event rather than a tryout on the road.wainwright sykes,d.for these reasons,review of factual findings under the its deference to the trier of the rule,not the exception.
anderson,at.the testimony and evidence in the record support the district court findings.its conclusions of fact are entitled to substantial deference and they are not clearly erroneous.
the defendants also argue that the district court was required to make subsidiary findings to support its conclusion that the sites had a hydrological connection to navigable waters,citing deal cincinnati bd.of,cir.to the contrary,the district court opinion,along with the expert testimony regarding the hydrological connection,provides a sufficient basis to examine the district court findings and supports the determination that its conclusions were not clearly erroneous.
ii.willard testimony 
at trial,the united states offered the expert testimony of daniel willard.the district court found willard to be eminently qualified as an expert in wetlands and concluded that his testimony was highly credible.the defendants argue that this testimony should have been stricken,or the trial delayed,because willard relied upon a supplemental expert witness report that was not disclosed until after trial was underway.
willard revised the map he prepared for trial delineating the areas of wetland on the rapanos land.after examining the soil analysis from the defendants expert and aerial photography,willard revised his wetlands maps,removing some of the areas he had previously marked as wetlands.he did so to be as conservative and as accurate as he could.the new maps were produced in conjunction with will bowman,a soils scientist with the natural resources conservation service of the department of agriculture,and were known as the bowman supplemental soils maps.accompanying the new maps was a supplemental report.the defendants contend that this late report made a mockery of the federal rules of civil procedure,specifically complaining that the disclosure rules specified in rule were violated.they claim that the district court denial of their motion for rule sanctions,based on the failure to disclose,requires remand for a new trial.
the united states points out that the new maps were based on analysis from the defendants experts contained in the pierce report.the version of rule e in effect at the time of the trial provided that a party was required to supplement its disclosures if the information disclosed is incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process.the data used in the supplemental report and maps was known to the defendants,as it was produced by their experts.because willard previous expert report and maps were available to the defendants,it seems unlikely that simply incorporating some of the data from the defendants own experts,which reduced the computation of wetland areas,qualifies under rule mandatory disclosure requirements.
even if we assume that the united states was required to disclose the supplemental results,exclusion of the report and testimony was not the only remedy available to the district court.rule c provides sanctions for the failure to comply with rule,including exclusion of evidence.this court reviews for abuse of discretion a district court ruling on a motion to exclude an expert witness as a sanction under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.roberts ex rel.johnson galen of virginia,cir toth grand trunk railroad,cir.rule provides that the trial judge should not exclude expert testimony unless the failure to disclose is both unjustified and harmful.roberts,at fed.c advisory committee notes even if the failure to disclose was not substantially justified,a party should be allowed to use the material that was not disclosed if the lack of earlier notice was harmless.the party bears the burden of proving that a disclosure was harmless.roberts,at.the aggrieved party,however,must show substantial prejudice before this court will grant a new trial based on an alleged rule e disclosure error.toth,at.
in this case,the failure to disclose seems harmless as the defendants were aware of the data used in the supplemental reports and the revised reports reduced the amount of wetlands found to exist at the sites.thus,the only changes made between the original disclosed report and the supplemental report were beneficial to the defendants.in summary,no substantial prejudice has been demonstrated.
even if a trial court determines that rule has been violated,rule does not mandate exclusion of evidence.roberts,at rule c provides several remedies to a district judge who is faced with violations of the provisions of rule.the provision on sanctions explicitly states in pertinent part that in lieu of this sanction of total exclusion,the court,on motion and after affording an opportunity to be heard,may impose other appropriate sanctions.the district court,after noting its concern with the failure to disclose the supplemental report,concluded that 
the defe
