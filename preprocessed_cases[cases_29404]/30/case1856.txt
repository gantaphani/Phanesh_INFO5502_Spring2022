this case concerns whether sums agreed to be paid as a settlement of litigation are subject to indemnification as damages under excess liability insurance policies.plaintiff sued for breach of contract and declaratory relief against its excess liability insurance carriers due to their refusal to indemnify plaintiff for costs it incurred to remediate polluted real property pursuant to a settlement agreement from another legal action.the trial court granted summary judgment to the insurers,determining the insurers were not liable under the terms of their policies to indemnify plaintiff for its costs.we conclude the trial court interpreted the insurance policies correctly and affirm its judgment.
background 
undisputed facts 
we recite the trial court concise statement of the case undisputed facts.plaintiff aerojet filed this action for breach of contract and declaratory relief against certain excess carriers seeking indemnification for the costs of remediating groundwater contamination near its former facility in azusa.the complaint alleges that in and various water entities filed law suits alleging that aerojet was liable for cercla response costs and other costs arising out of the alleged contamination of groundwater in the san gabriel valley.aerojet gave defendants notice of each lawsuit,but no excess carrier accepted aerojet tender of defense or indemnity.the water entity lawsuits were all settled in march and were subsequently dismissed in september.the settlement agreement obligates aerojet to pay approximately million,which exceeds the total amount of its primary and excess insurance coverage for each year in the period of.aerojet demanded payment pursuant to its policies excess carriers all denied liability.
defendants contend they are not liable under their excess liability policies to indemnify aeroject sic for the groundwater remediation claims because the water entities claims were settled and not adjudicated against aerojet to an award of damages.defendants rely on certain underwriters at lloyd of london superior court cal th,d,which held that an excess carrier is not liable under a policy providing for indemnity upon the insured payment of damages unless damages have been awarded against the insured by a court.
the insurance policies 
central to this appeal are three clauses in the insurance contracts,typically referred to as the insuring agreement,the attachment of liability clause,and the no voluntary payments clause.
the insuring agreement defines the type of costs which the insurer will indemnify.in all of the contracts at issue here,the insuring agreement obligates the insurer to indemnify for damages and nothing else.with only slight variations that do not affect the meaning,all five of the commercial union contracts and the three aig member companies policies required the insurer to indemnify aerojet for all sums which the assured shall become legally obligated to pay,or by final judgment be adjudged to pay,to any person or persons as damages 
the attachment of liability clauses state the insurers,as excess insurers,are not liable to pay until either the underlying insurers admit liability,or the insured is held liable to pay by a final judgment an amount which exceeds the underlying insurance and the underlying insurers have paid or been held liable to pay their full limits.specifically,most of the commercial union clauses state liability to pay under this insurance shall not attach unless and until the primary and underlying excess insurers shall have admitted liability for the primary and underlying excess limits or unless and until the assured has by final judgment been adjudged to pay an amount which exceeds such primary and underlying excess limits and then only after the primary and underlying excess insurers have paid or have been held liable to pay the full amount of the primary and underlying excess limits.the aig member companies attachment of liability clauses express the same conditions precedent to liability attaching.
the no voluntary payments clause requires the insurer written consent before it will indemnify any costs.the clauses in the commercial union and aig member companies policies,with only slight variations,read in the event of claim or claims arising which appear likely to exceed the primary and underlying excess limits,no costs shall be incurred by the assured without the written consent of the underwriters.
procedural history 
defendants demurred to aerojet complaint.the trial court judge loren mcmaster overruled the demurrer.the court determined the policies limitation to indemnify sums which aerojet shall become liable to pay,or by final judgment be adjudged to pay,as damages was ambiguous,and could be read to require payments in cases other than those adjudicated to a final judgment.it also distinguished powerine i,claiming the supreme court in powerine i did not decide the issue here of whether the term damages required litigating a suit to final judgment.
after discovery and on the eve of trial,each of the defendants filed separate motions for summary judgment,in which all of the other defendants joined.collectively,the motions sought judgment based on the following grounds defendants owed no duty to indemnify aerojet under the insuring agreement clauses because the costs paid pursuant to the settlement agreement were not damages,as defined in powerine i this ground is referred to by the parties as the no damages motion no duty to indemnify was owed under the attachment of liability clauses because aerojet could not establish the underlying insurers admitted liability,or that the underlying insurance policies were exhausted by a final judgment in the water entity actions,as required in the attachment of liability clauses and by an earlier unpublished decision of this court involving this issue between aerojet,defendants,and other reinsurance companies,corporation transcontinental insurance company june,wl nonpub.opn.transcontinental the no exhaustion motion and aerojet could not sustain its burden of proof to establish the damages attributable to each of the alleged occurrences at the san gabriel site,as required under golden eagle refinery associated internat.ins.th,d,and fmc plaisted companies th,d the failure of proof motion.
the trial court judge thomas cecil granted summary judgment on the no damages motion and the no exhaustion motion.under powerine,the court wrote,the language in the policies at issue providing for payment of sums aerojet becomes legally obligated to pay as damages is limited to sums aerojet was ordered to pay by the court.the monies paid in settlement do not meet this definition.
the court also determined defendants were not equitably estopped from relying on the terms of their policies to deny aerojet claims.
the court dropped the failure of proof motion on the basis it was moot in view of the court orders on the other two motions.
discussion 
aerojet appeals from the entry of summary judgment,claiming the trial court erred by interpreting the insuring agreement clause under the rule of powerine i concluding that the settlement agreement did not constitute a final judgment to trigger the attachment of liability clauses,allegedly contrary to the doctrine of retraxit and not estopping the defendants from denying the settlement agreement they allegedly approved by implication,despite the no voluntary payments clause.we disagree with each of aerojet claims 
standard of review 
our supreme court recently set forth the standard of review and rules of interpreting insurance policies in powerine oil,superior court cal th,d,powerine ii.for ease of reading,we omit citations and internal quotation marks from the passage.the court wrote when determining whether a particular policy provides a potential for coverage,we are guided by the principle that interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.
the insurer is entitled to summary adjudication that no potential for indemnity exists if the evidence establishes as a matter of law that there is no coverage.we apply a de novo standard of review to an order granting summary judgment when,on undisputed facts,the order is based on the interpretation or application of the terms of an insurance policy.
in reviewing de novo a superior court summary adjudication order in a dispute over the interpretation of the provisions of a policy of insurance,the reviewing court applies settled rules governing the interpretation of insurance contracts 
while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.the fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.if contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.
a policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.the fact that a term is not defined in the policies does not make it ambiguous.nor does d isagreement concerning the meaning of a phrase,or the fact that a word or phrase isolated from its context is susceptible of more than one meaning.l anguage in a contract must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole,and in the circumstances of that case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.if an asserted ambiguity is not eliminated by the language and context of the policy,courts then invoke the principle that ambiguities are generally construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist,the insurer in order to protect the insured reasonable expectation of coverage.powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
powerine i governs this case 
this case follows a line of relatively recent supreme court opinions that interpret indemnity obligations in commercial liability insurance policies,particularly as they may apply to the insured potential liability for environmental harm to real property.to understand the legal context in which this case arises,we first review the supreme court authority on this subject.we then explain how one of these opinions,powerine i,compels us to affirm the grant of summary judgment here.
the court in determined that an insurer duty to defend the insured in a suit seeking damages under a standard form comprehensive general liability insurance policy was limited to a civil action prosecuted in a court,national union fire ins.cal th,d.the case arose from an administrative order directing a property owner to clean up contaminated property.the owner insurance policy required the insurer to pay all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages and the insurer shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages and may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient id.at,d.
the court interpreted the phrase suit seeking damages literally,holding that the phrase limited the insurer obligation to defend to civil actions prosecuted in a court,supra,cal th at,d.following from this interpretation,the court concluded that a proceeding conducted by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute was not a suit,but rather implicated a claim.id.at,d.thus,although the insurer had the authority to investigate and settle both claims and suits,it was under no obligation to defend against a claim.ibid.
having decided the scope of the insurer duty to defend,the court in powerine i determined the scope of the standard policy duty to indemnify.it similarly limited the insurer duty to indemnify to damages,money ordered by a court.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.this case also arose from administrative orders directing a defunct oil company to clean up contaminated sites.the policy required the insurer to pay all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages for harm within coverage.id.at,d.
just as the word suit limited an insurer duty to defend,the word damages,the court reasoned,limited the insurer duty to indemnify.the court listed a number of arguments in support of its conclusion.first,the court developed a syllogism it called syllogism based on its holding in the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.the duty to defend is not broad enough to extend beyond a suit,a civil action prosecuted in a court,but rather is limited thereto.a fortiori,the duty to indemnify is not broad enough to extend beyond damages,money ordered by a court,but rather is limited thereto.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.
next,the court relied upon the literal meaning of the employed terms.the duty to defend can arise whenever damages are sought by a suit,but the duty to indemnify can arise only when damages are fixed in their amount.and damages can only be fixed in a suit through a court order.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.
thirdly,the court looked at the broader legal context,stating that damages exist traditionally inside a court,while harm exists outside a court.an insurer can become legally obligated to pay in ways other than by an order of the court,but one is not legally obligated to pay damages apart from any order by a court.thus,the word damages operated to limit the insurer obligation to indemnify only to money ordered by a court.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,the duty to indemnify does not extend to any expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute id.at,d.
having established these foundational interpretations for standard general liability policies,the court next had the opportunity to apply them to excess liability policies.in two separate cases,the court relied upon powerine i to interpret indemnity provisions in excess insurance policies.in one case,powerine ii,the court determined the excess policy language was broader than the standard policy language interpreted in powerine i and obligated the excess insurer to indemnify the insured costs arising from an administrative cleanup order.powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d.
there,the policies required the insurer to indemnify for damages,direct or consequential and expenses,all as more fully defined by the term ultimate net loss powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d,italics in original.ultimate net loss was defined as the total sum the insured became obligated to pay either through adjudication or compromise,and shall also include expenses for litigation,settlement,adjustment and investigation of claims and suits id.at,d,italics in original.
the court determined the policy use of the word expenses extended coverage beyond the limitation imposed by use of the word damages alone.it also determined that by defining expenses to include those incurred for litigation,settlement,adjustment and investigation of claims,the indemnity coverage extended to expenses incurred in responding to administratively imposed government orders to clean up environmental pollution.powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d.
by contrast,in the second case interpreting an excess insurance policy,the court held that the policy language with its limitation to damages,similar to that in powerine i,did not require the insurer to indemnify the insured for the costs of settling third party claims for environmental harm that were negotiated outside the context of a suit.county of san diego ace property casualty ins.cal th,d,county of san diego.the excess policy in that case required the insurer to indemnify the insured for all sums which the insured is obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law or assumed under contract or agreement,arising from damages caused by personal injuries or the destruction or loss of use of tangible property.id.at,d.
initially,the court noted that the syllogism developed in powerine i did not apply to this excess insurance policy because,like the policies before us,this policy contained no duty to defend.county of san diego,supra,cal th at,d.however,the court continued,the scope of the indemnification obligation under this policy remains governed by our holding in powerine i t he reasoning of our decision in powerine i regarding the limitation the term damages imposed on the scope of indemnity coverage under the standard comprehensive general lia
