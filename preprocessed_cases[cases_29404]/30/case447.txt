betty lynch lynch and harry ailor ailor collectively plaintiffs appeal from the order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of city of maynardville,tennessee city,in this action brought pursuant to the clean water act cwa,and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the lower court.
background 
clean water act 
the federal water pollution control act,or clean water act,mandates that toxic discharges into the nation waterways be monitored and regulated.to accomplish this,the cwa authorizes the administrator of the environmental protection agency epa or authorized state agencies,to issue national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permits.permit holders are subject to state and federal enforcement actions,as well as suits by private citizens.see state enforcement,compliance orders and citizen suits.
the cwa citizen suit provision permits any individual who has an interest which is or may be adversely affected to sue to enforce any limitation established by a npdes permit.a and g.the cwa limits the remedies available to citizen plaintiffs to injunctive relief,the assessment of civil penalties,and attorney fees.see a,d see also friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d.no compensatory damages are authorized under the cwa.see middlesex county sewerage auth.sea clammers ass n,d.furthermore,civil penalties are payable to the united states treasury.laidlaw,at.the cwa also does not permit citizen suits for wholly past violations.gwaltney of smithfield chesapeake bay,d see also steel citizens for a better env,d holding that citizen plaintiffs lack standing to seek civil penalties for wholly past violations.
citizen suits are merely intended to supplement,not supplant,enforcement by state and federal government agencies.gwaltney,at.such agency suits trump the cwa citizen suit provision,provided that they are initiated prior to the commencement of a citizen suit,g a i are diligently prosecuted,and are brought in a court of the united states or any state court.b b.see generally jones city of lakeland,cir en banc.likewise,where a state has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an action under a state law comparable to the cwa,citizen suits are precluded.g a ii.however,in lakeland,this court held that an action under the tennessee water quality control act is not comparable to a b g.lakeland,at.lakeland also held that a proceeding before the tennessee department of environment and conservation tdec is not court enforcement for purposes of a and b.id.at.
the city owns and operates a sewage treatment plant along bull run creek.in the past,the treatment plant has overflowed,discharging raw sewage and other pollutants into the creek.plaintiff lynch owns approximately acres of land in union county,along bull run creek,downstream from the plant.plaintiff ailor owned approximately acres of land along bull run creek,downstream from the plant until approximately october of.both parties have obtained drinking water from private wells located on their property.
the city operates its sewage treatment plant under an npdes permit.because of repeated violations of its npdes permit in the early,the tennessee department of environment and conservation tdec commenced enforcement proceedings against the city in.on november,luna,the commissioner of the tdec,issued an order and assessment against the city,in which he found that f rom january,thru december,the city self monitoring information revealed the following npdes permit violations 
the commissioner also found that the city failed to submit an industrial user survey to the tennessee division of water pollution control within one hundred twenty days after the npdes permit was issued.
the commissioner found that b y discharging wastewater effluent from the plant in violation of the terms and conditions of the npdes permit,the city had violated ann.b and,which makes it unlawful to discharge any wastes in excess of the amount allowed by the permit.the order further found that,by failing to submit an industrial user survey,the city had violated ann.b.the order and assessment therefore required the city to do the following 
the respondent the city shall initiate a continuous collection system rehabilitation program within sixty days of entry of this order.
the respondent shall submit a complete industrial user survey to the tennessee division of water pollution control within ninety days of entry of this order.
the respondent shall bring the plant into compliance with the act and npdes permit within ninety days of entry of this order.
the respondent shall pay a civil penalty to the department,hereby assessed in the amount of twenty five thousand dollars,to be paid in various increments.
the order and assessment indicated that,pursuant to ann.a,an order for corrective action shall become final and not subject to review unless a timely written petition for a hearing were filed with the tennessee water quality control board.
thereafter,through hearings and meetings between the board and the city,an agreed order order was entered on july,assessing a civil penalty against the city and requiring it to develop and implement a corrective action plan to bring its plant into compliance with the npdes permit the board adopted the facts and conclusions of law set forth in the commissioner order and assessment.
the order required the city to do the following 
s ubmit to the division knoxville field office for approval,on or before the day of may,a corrective action plan that addresses at a minimum the following 
a a review of 
b smoke testing for a representative portion of the collection systems 
c dry weather flow measurements 
d a physical survey of the systems and 
e wet weather flow monitoring 
s ubmit to the division knoxville field office for approval,within sixty days of approval of the corrective action plan,an engineering report that evaluates the current hydraulic and organic loading at the wastewater treatment plant and recommends alternatives for additional treatment capacity including a time schedule for completion of treatment plant expansion.
w ithin one hundred eighty days of approval of the engineering report,submit to the division knoxville field office for approval plans and specifications for the expansion of the wastewater treatment plant and correction of inflow and infiltration.
i mplement and complete all remedial activities set forth in the above approved plans and specifications in accordance with those time schedules included and as approved by the division but in no event any later than months from the approval of such plans and specifications.
the order further assessed a civil penalty against the city in the amount of,of which was to be paid only if the city failed to comply with the order.the city paid to the tdec on july.
the order also stated that the division reserved the right to request modifications to the corrective action report,engineering report,plans and specifications any time schedules encompassed therein as deemed necessary by the director to achieve compliance with the act.
the city completed all of the required actions under the order and placed the new wastewater treatment plant on line in november,and received the final inspection report on february.the city spent approximately million dollars in upgrading the plant.
plaintiffs 
on january,lynch and ailor filed suit against the city in state court,seeking compensatory damages under several theories of state law.on february,two and months after the city wastewater treatment plant was in full operation,plaintiffs gave the city notice of a pending lawsuit,as required under the cwa and rcra.see b b.on may,lynch and ailor again filed suit against the city,this time in federal court,under the cwa,the rcra,and state law.the complaint alleged that the city sewage treatment plant frequently overflows,thereby discharging untreated sewage and other pollutants into bull run creek,and that t his frequent discharge of raw sewage,and other pollutants,past and present,has caused plaintiffs serious bodily injury and loss of value in plaintiffs property.plaintiffs sought remedial relief,compensatory damages,punitive damages,and litigation costs,including reasonable attorney fees 
district court proceedings 
on september,the city moved for summary judgment.the city argued that summary judgment was appropriate because the city was the subject of an enforcement action commenced by the state which was being diligently prosecuted under g a ii.furthermore,the city asserted that it had complied with the terms of the corrective action.in support,the city attached several affidavits.the city recorder,hazel gillenwater,attested that,as of september,the city was operating within the npdes permit.john west,an environmental specialist for tdec,stated in his affidavit that he had the responsibility for monitoring,compliance,and enforcement of the city wastewater treatment facilities and npdes permit.west stated that t he city substantially complied with all aspects of the order such that no further penalty payments were necessary.finally,he stated that as of september,r ecent inspections revealed that the city is operating its wastewater treatment plan and collection system in substantial compliance with the laws relative to its operation of the wastewater treatment plant and is meeting the effluent standards specified by the npdes permit.in his affidavit,arthur baker,a professional engineer employed by lamar dunn associates,the city consulting engineers,stated that as of september,the city had completed the necessary improvements to its wastewater treatment plant and the replacement and rehabilitation of phase i and phase ii of its wastewater collection system.
the city also asserted that plaintiffs complaint should be dismissed because they sought recovery of compensatory or punitive damages,which are not available under the cwa.
in their response to the city motion for summary judgment,plaintiffs did not provide any evidence to controvert the city assertion that it had completed its obligations under the order.rather,plaintiffs alleged in relevant part as follows 
the plaintiffs claim that they have suffered property damages and personal injuries as a result of the defendant actions.compl.in addition,if the plaintiffs prevail in this action,they are entitled to recover their reasonable attorneys fees and litigation costs,including environmental testing and expert witness fees,all of which are typically substantial in environmental cases.d.
plaintiffs also did not assert,let alone offer proof,that the city was in violation of the npdes permit as of may or september.
in its reply to plaintiffs response to the motion for summary judgment,filed on october,the city asserted that from the time of the enforcement action taken by the tdec,the city had moved expeditiously to remedy the deficiencies in its plant.the city reiterated that its 
new waste water treatment plant was completed and waste water treatment plant operations began on november.phase i of the city waste water collection rehabilitation was completed on january,and the city phase waste water collection system rehabilitation was completed on may,the new plant has been operating for more than ten months with no discharges in violation of its npdes permit.
the reply brief also stated that 
t hroughout the process of the state of tennessee enforcement action,it has been abundantly clear that the problem which the city faced in its operation of its wastewater treatment was due primarily to an old plant which was no longer able to satisfactorily treat the wastewater being generated by a growing population.once the city new wastewater treatment plant commenced operation,its discharges have met its npdes permit.
the city therefore asserted that,as demonstrated by the affidavit of the tdec representative,the case was moot based upon events subsequent to november.
significantly,the city also stated that its discharge from its wastewater treatment plant had substantially met its npdes permit with no violations for the past four months,and only minor violations occurring in february chlorine limit,march chlorine limit and,and may.
the district court granted summary judgment to the city on november.the district court noted that the tdec enforcement action did not preclude lynch and ailor citizen suit under the cwa in light of jones city of lakeland,cir en banc.nevertheless,the district court granted the motion,stating that the relief available to lynch and ailor under both the cwa and rcra had already been granted.the court concluded that,under the unique facts of this case,a claim under the cwa is moot at this time and was moot at the time it was filed.
t he state of tennessee initiated an enforcement action against the city of maynardville in.as a result of that state action,the city was fined and forced to come up with a plan for remedying its effluent problem.the city of maynardville did what was requested by the state of tennessee and ultimately,at an expense of more than million,expanded its treatment plant which went in november.it is undisputed that the expansion of the treatment plant has remedied the overflow problem,since there is no evidence that any overflow has occurred since november of.plaintiffs then filed this lawsuit in this court in may.at the time plaintiffs filed the lawsuit here under the cwa,the state had already obtained,through its administrative procedures,any remedy which plaintiffs might have obtained with a citizens suit under the cwa.
emphasis added.
the court further observed that the rcra would not give the plaintiffs any right or remedy not available under the cwa.the district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over supplemental state law claims which were appended only to a moot federal claim.lastly,the court noted that because plaintiffs complaint under the cwa was already moot by the time the federal complaint was filed,i t would be illogical to allow the plaintiffs to recover attorney fees for a claim filed under the cwa.
on november,plaintiffs filed a motion to alter or amend judgment.plaintiffs motion was based principally on the city admission in its reply brief that it violated its npdes permit several times after the upgraded treatment plant went in november of.in support,plaintiffs attached a letter from tdec,division of water pollution control,stating that,based on the city discharge monitoring reports dmrs,the city had violated the npdes permit in february,march and may of.also attached were two letters from michael payne,chief wastewater plant operator,to john west,stating that the city incurred an overflowing manhole on february,and april.west also indicated that,in both instances the overflow subsided the same day.
in its response,the city stated that the manhole overflows were unrelated to the operations of the wastewater treatment plant itself.further,the city stated that the incidents occurred prior to the completion of phase ii of the city collection system rehabilitation project.finally,the city reasserted that because it had corrected the deficiencies in its collection and treatment systems,plaintiffs cwa suit was moot.
the district court summarily denied the motion,g ood cause not being shown.
plaintiffs filed this timely appeal,claiming that the city did not carry its heavy burden required to establish mootness,and that their rcra claim was improperly dismissed.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.banks wolfe county bd.of,cir citations omitted.summary judgment is proper when there is no dispute as to a material issue of fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in granting the city motion for summary judgment on the grounds that plaintiffs cwa claims were moot.plaintiffs submit that the city did not carry its heavy burden of persuading the court that further violations of the npdes are not likely to recur,as required by laidlaw.laidlaw holds that a defendant voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not ordinarily moot a case.laidlaw,at.citation omitted.in other words,voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct does not ordinarily moot a case unless subsequent events ma ke it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not be reasonably expected to recur.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the heavy burden of establishing that the challenged conduct can not reasonably be expected to start up again lies with the party asserting mootness.id.
as noted above,the district court held that plaintiffs cwa claim was moot at the time of summary judgment and moot at the time it was filed.although the district court characterized it as mootness,the latter half of the district court statement implicates standing.see id.at.discussing distinctions between standing and mootness.we therefore begin our analysis with standing.
s tanding concerns only whether a plaintiff has a viable claim that a defendant unlawful conduct was occurring at the time the complaint was filed.cleveland branch,naacp city of parma,ohio,cir,cert.denied,d quoting laidlaw,at.the supreme court has consistently held that jurisdiction is tested by the facts as they existed when the action was brought and that after vesting,it can not be ousted by subsequent events.id.at.to establish initial standing to bring suit,a plaintiff must demonstrate he or she has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,as opposed to conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant challenged action and it is likely,not speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.at citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
mootness addresses whether the plaintiff continues to have an interest in the outcome of the litigation.city of parma,at.a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.powell mccormack,d.in other words,i f events that occur subsequent to the filing of a lawsuit or an appeal deprive the court of the ability to give meaningful relief,then the case is moot and must be dismissed.al najjar ashcroft,cir.
as the district court implicitly recognized,this case raises both standing and mootness concerns.see generally laidlaw,at.discussing distinctions between the two doctrines.by the time plaintiffs gave notice of intent to sue in february and filed suit sixty days later on may,the state of tennessee had already procured the relief plaintiffs sought in their complaint,namely remedial efforts to stop violations of the npdes permit.in fact,by the time of plaintiffs suit,the state of tennessee had already been at the task for approximately seven years,beginning with the commissioner order and assessment on november.by the time of plaintiffs federal action,per orders of the state of tennessee,the city had installed and made operational a new wastewater treatment plant,at a cost of over million,to bring it into compliance with its npdes permit.thus,by the time plaintiffs suit was initiated,plaintiffs essentially no longer had an injury in fact that was actual or imminent.but for the fortuity of four minor discharges in february,march,and may of,lynch clearly lacked standing because the relief requested in the complaint was by that time for wholly past violations.
the district court sense that plaintiffs standing was problematic is bolstered by comparison with the supreme court decision in gwaltney.in that case,the virginia state water control board issued a npdes permit to the petitioner gwaltney of smithfield,in authorizing gwaltney to discharge seven pollutants,including fecal coliform,chlorine,and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn,from the company plant on the pagan river in smithfield,virginia.id.at.between,the company repeatedly violated the conditions of the permit by exceeding effluent limitations on five of the seven covered pollutants.id.in march,the company installed new equipment to improve its chlorination system,and the last reported chlorine violation occurred in october.id.the new chlorination system also helped control the discharge of fecal coliform,the last of which occurred in february.id.at.in october,the company upgraded its wastewater treatment system,and the last reported tkn violation occurred on may.id.
the respondents,two environmental groups,sent notice in february to the company,the epa,and the virginia board of their intent to file a citizen suit under the cwa based on the company violations of its permit conditions.id.the respondents filed suit in june.id.the company moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the act,arguing that the language of a a,which allows private citizens to bring suit against any person alleged to be in violation of the act,required the defendant to be violating the act as of the time of suit.id.at.the company contended that,because its last recorded violation occurred several weeks before the respondents filed their complaint,the district court lacked jurisdiction over the action.id.at.
the supreme court agreed,holding that t he most natural reading of to be in violation is a requirement that allege a state of either continuous or intermittent violation that is,a reasonable likelihood that a past polluter will continue to pollute in the future.id.at.the court observed that the pervasive use of the present tense throughout,especially in the definition of citizen as a person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected by the defendant violations of the act,id.at.quoting g,made plain that the harm sought to be addressed by the citizen suit lies in the present or future,not in the past.id.the court reasoned in relevant part 
any other conclusion would render incomprehensible notice provision,which requires citizens to give days notice of their intent to sue to the alleged violator as well as to the administrator and the state.b a.if the administrator or the state commences enforcement action within that period,the citizen suit is barred,presumably because governmental action has rendered it unnecessary.b b.it follows logically that the purpose of notice to the alleged violator is to give it an opportunity to bring itself into complete compliance with the act and thus likewise render unnecessary a citizen suit.if we assume,as respondents urge,that citizen suits may target wholly past violations,the requirement of notice to the alleged violator becomes gratuitous.
id.at.the court further observed that 
adopting respondents interpretation of jurisdictional grant would create a second and even more disturbing anomaly.the bar on citizen suits when government enforcement action is under way suggests that the citizen suit is meant to supplement rather than to supplant governmental action.the legislative history of the act reinforces this view of the role of the citizen suit.the senate report noted that t he committee intends the great volume of enforcement actions to be brought by the state,and that citizen suits are proper only if the federal,state,and local agencies fail to exercise their enforcement responsibility,reprinted in a legislative history of the water pollution control act amendments of,hereinafter leg.hist.permitting citizen suits for wholly past violations of the act could undermine the supplementary role envisioned for the citizen suit.this danger is best illustrated by an example.suppose that the administrator identified a violator of the act and issued a compliance order under a.suppose further that the administrator agreed not to assess or otherwise seek civil penalties on the condition that the violator take some extreme corrective action,such as to install particularly effective but expensive machinery,that it otherwise would not be obliged to take.if citizens could file suit,months or years later,in order to seek the civil penalties that the administrator chose to forgo,then the administrator discretion to enforce the act in the public interest would be curtailed considerably.the same might be said of the discretion of state enforcement authorities.respondents interpretation of the scope of the citizen suit would change the nature of the citizens role from interstitial to potentially intrusive.we can not agree that congress intended such a result.
notwithstanding its conclusion that does not permit citizen suits
