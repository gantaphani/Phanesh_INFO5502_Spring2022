more than nuclear reactors in the united states produce electricity to power american homes and businesses.those reactors provide about percent of the nation electricity.
in this case,the nuclear regulatory commission granted a license for a new,privately owned facility in new mexico to produce enriched uranium as fuel for nuclear reactors.individuals who live near the facility objected to the license,and they filed petitions for review in this court.petitioners contend that the nrc violated the national environmental policy act and the atomic energy act in granting the license.we deny the petitions and uphold the nrc decision to grant the license.
for several decades after the development of nuclear power in the,the federal government produced all of the enriched uranium used to fuel america nuclear reactors.in the early,congress privatized the uranium enrichment operations it formed the united states enrichment corporation and later approved the sale of that company.see usec privatization act,stat,energy policy act of,title ix,stat.today,usec operates the country only uranium enrichment plant,which is in kentucky.
in,congress also amended the atomic energy act so that the nuclear regulatory commission could license the construction and operation of additional uranium enrichment plants that would be privately owned and operated.see solar,wind,waste,and geothermal power production incentives act of,stat,codified as amended at.during the next years,the nrc received two such applications for uranium enrichment facilities,both filed by louisiana energy services,les.in,les applied to build the claiborne enrichment facility near homer,louisiana les later withdrew that application.see in re.energy servs.in december,les sought a license for the national enrichment facility near eunice,new mexico.that second application is at issue in this case.
among other things,an applicant for a enrichment facility must present a plausible strategy for disposing of the nuclear waste that the facility will generate.an applicant must provide a reasonable cost estimate to accompany the disposal strategy and give the nrc adequate assurance that the applicant can pay for disposal.d in re.energy.the nrc must conduct an adjudicatory hearing on the record to ensure the applicant has met all the requirements for licensure,and it must prepare an environmental impact statement under the national environmental policy act before the hearing is completed.a,b,see also c.
after les application in this case,the nrc issued a notice of hearing and opportunity for interested parties to intervene in the licensure proceeding.notice of receipt of application for license.two citizen and the nuclear information and resource filed a petition to intervene.pursuant to nrc regulations,they challenged several aspects of les application.see a requiring that parties specify contentions which they seek to have litigated in the hearing.the nrc assigned the conduct of the licensure proceeding to a atomic safety and licensing board,which considered petitioners contentions in a series of hearings.the nrc then heard appeals from the licensing board decisions.
at the licensing board,petitioners alleged that the nrc environmental impact statement had not adequately assessed the environmental impact of the proposed the environmental hazards associated with uranium waste disposal.the licensing board issued written rulings examining the environmental effects of the facility and denying petitioners claims.the nrc upheld the licensing board determinations in written rulings that further analyzed the environmental issues.
petitioners also alleged that les had not articulated a plausible strategy to dispose of the waste generated by the facility,and that it had not provided a reasonable estimate of disposal costs.the licensing board considered les two alternative disposal strategies and the related cost estimates.first,the licensing board evaluated les strategy and cost estimate for disposal at a private facility outside of new mexico.on this point,the licensing board ruled for petitioners,holding that les had not met its evidentiary burden to establish that the cost estimate for the strategy was reasonable.the nrc affirmed that conclusion.
the licensing board also analyzed les alternative,strategy.to support that strategy,les relied on a law that requires the department of energy to take title to and dispose of radioactive waste generated by uranium enrichment facilities.see.the licensing board found the strategy plausible and rejected petitioners challenge to the cost estimate for the strategy.the nrc upheld the licensing board decision,thus basing its ultimate approval of the license on les strategy and cost estimate,rather than on les plan.
in march,as it was considering petitioners contentions,the licensing board held a public hearing on the remaining issues associated with the enrichment facility.the board held this hearing to meet the mandatory hearing requirement of b.in june,the licensing board completed its review and authorized a license for construction and operation of the facility.the nrc declined to disturb the licensing board authorization of the license,and the decision became final in early august.construction has now begun.
petitioners filed timely petitions for review in this court.they raise several objections to the nrc licensing decision the nrc violated the atomic energy act by supplementing the environmental impact statement during the hearing process the nrc violated the national environmental policy act by failing to adequately address the environmental consequences of disposing of the facility uranium waste the nrc violated the atomic energy act by accepting les waste disposal strategy and cost estimate and nrc commissioner mcgaffigan should have disqualified himself from the licensure proceeding.we address each issue in turn.
before deciding petitioners claims,we first must determine whether they have standing.
under article iii of the constitution,federal courts have jurisdiction only to decide cases or controversies.one aspect of the requirement is that a party must demonstrate standing to it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is actual or imminent caused by,or fairly traceable to,an act that the litigant challenges in the instant litigation and redressable by the court.audubon soc y bentsen,en banc internal quotation marks omitted.an organization may establish article iii standing by showing,among other things,that at least one of its members would have standing to sue in his or her own right.nuclear energy,epa.
this is a procedural rights case in which a party has been accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.a party has standing to challenge an agency failure to follow a procedural requirement so long as the procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of the party.id.at.the supreme court and this court have repeatedly held that individuals who live near a proposed federal project and allege that they will suffer concrete injury from the project have standing in nepa and other procedural rights cases.see,id.at.standing for one living adjacent to the site for proposed construction of a federally licensed project,even where party can not establish with any certainty that remedying procedural defect will cause the license to be withheld or altered cmtys.against runway expansion,faa,standing where parties neighborhoods would be subjected to increased noise nuclear energy,at standing where member alleged hazardous waste would contaminate his community supplies.audubon soc y,at no standing where parties alleged only a general risk of harm and did not demonstrate a geographic nexus to any asserted environmental injury.
petitioners here live near the proposed uranium enrichment facility.they allege a risk of injury from radiation generated by the facility in particular,they allege that because the nrc has not identified a suitable disposal strategy for the waste the facility will produce,the waste will be stored at the facility site and will emit harmful radiation.see,decl
