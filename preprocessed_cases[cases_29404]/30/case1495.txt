in these consolidated cases,sierra club challenges two final actions of the environmental protection agency epa regarding ozone control plans for the washington,area.those plans were designed to bring the area into compliance with ozone standards prescribed by the clean air act and epa regulations.sierra club contends that epa violated the act by giving conditional approval to the plans notwithstanding that they lacked required statutory elements.sierra club also challenges the substance of two elements that were included in the plans,as well as epa extension of the deadlines by which revised plans must be submitted for final approval.
we agree with sierra club principal contention that epa was not authorized to grant conditional approval to plans that did nothing more than promise to do tomorrow what the act requires today.we therefore vacate the conditional approval and remand the matter to epa for further action consistent with this opinion.in other respects we deny the petitions for review.
the clean air act caa,et,directs epa to establish national ambient air quality standards naaqs that set maximum permissible concentration levels for air pollutants that endanger the public health and welfare.pursuant to that direction,the agency has adopted naaqs for ozone.under the act,epa designates areas of the country as attainment or nonattainment or as unclassifiable based on whether they comply with the ozone naaqs.d.nonattainment areas are further classified as marginal,moderate,serious,severe,or extreme,depending upon the severity and duration of their noncompliance.id.a.the act establishes air quality planning and control requirements that increase in stringency as the classification increases in severity.see id.it also establishes deadlines for attainment of the naaqs depending upon an area nonattainment classification.id,a.if an area fails to attain the naaqs by the applicable deadline,epa must reclassify it to a higher classification.id.b.generally,reclassification grants the area a later attainment deadline,but requires it to comply with the more stringent pollution control measures applicable to the higher classification.id.a,b id.
the act also prescribes the process by which areas must arrive at and maintain compliance with the naaqs.each state must adopt and submit for approval to epa a state implementation plan sip that provides for implementation,maintenance,and enforcement of applicable naaqs in each air quality region or portion thereof within the state.id.a.in addition to the general sip requirements,states in ozone nonattainment areas must submit sips meeting additional requirements that depend upon the severity of the ozone problem.id.each sip must contain an attainment demonstration that shows that the area will achieve the naaqs by the area statutory attainment deadline.id.c a.the attainment demonstration is based on the state control strategy for emissions,which must include enforceable emissions limitations,and such other control measures as may be necessary or appropriate to provide for attainment of such standard in such area by the applicable attainment date.c.
particularly relevant for this case,sips from states in nonattainment areas must also provide for the implementation of all reasonably available control measures racm as expeditiously as practicable,id.c and,for serious and severe areas,contain a rate of progress rop plan that demonstrates an average reduction of baseline emissions of per year for each consecutive period commencing in until the attainment deadline for the classification area,id.c b,d and provide for the implementation of specific contingency measures to be undertaken if the area fails to meet any rop milestone or to attain the naaqs by the statutory deadline,id.c,c d.
the washington,metropolitan area area is made up of the district of columbia and several maryland and virginia counties.pursuant to the clean air act,epa classified the area as a serious nonattainment area for ozone in.designation of areas for air quality planning purposes,final rule.the statutory deadline for ozone attainment by serious areas was november,and revised sips including the attainment demonstration and rop plans were due by november.a,c.
maryland,virginia,and the district of columbia the states did not submit their attainment demonstration and other plan provisions for the area until they amended and supplemented those submissions during.see approval and promulgation of air quality implementation plans,final rule.those sips lacked the three statutory elements noted above the racm analysis rop plans for emissions reductions and contingency measures.id.at.moreover,the sips did not demonstrate that the area would reach attainment by the statutory deadline of november.id.at.instead,the states asked epa to extend the attainment deadline by six years to november,without reclassifying the area as severe as the act would otherwise have required.id.at.on january,epa fully approved the sips and granted the states requests to extend the attainment deadline without reclassifying the area.id.at.
sierra club petitioned this court for review,contending inter alia that epa could not approve the sips without the missing statutory elements,and that it had no authority to extend the statutory attainment deadline without reclassifying the area as severe.we agreed,vacated epa approval of the sips,and remanded the matter to the agency.sierra club epa,sierra club i.on november,sierra club filed a new action in the district court for the district of columbia,seeking an injunction to compel epa to reclassify the area as severe and to take final action either approving or disapproving the previously submitted sips.the district court granted those requests and ordered epa by january,to determine whether the area had attained the naaqs for ozone by the applicable attainment date of november,and,if not,to reclassify the area and by april,to approve or disapprove the sip submittals that had been remanded in sierra club sierra club whitman.
epa responded to the district court order with the two actions that are at issue in this case.on january,in a decision known as the action,epa determined that the area had not attained the naaqs for serious ozone nonattainment areas by the statutory deadline and therefore reclassified the area as severe.determination of nonattainment as of november,and reclassification of the metropolitan washington,dc ozone nonattainment area,final rule,hereinafter reclassification.a statutory consequence of the reclassification was the extension of the ozone attainment deadline to as expeditiously as possible but not later than november.a.at the same time,epa extended until march,the deadline for submitting revised sips to comply with the requirements for severe nonattainment areas.reclassification.at.
in a second decision issued on april,the conditional approval action,epa granted conditional approval to the existing sips,notwithstanding the absence of the three elements that sierra club i had identified as precluding final approval.approval and promulgation of air quality implementation plans,final rule,hereinafter conditional approval.the agency based its conditional approval on letters submitted by the states that committed to cure those deficiencies and to comply with the additional requirements of the severe area classification by april.id.at.the agency also made determinations regarding,inter alia,two elements that were contained in the existing sips it concluded that the attainment demonstration showed that implementation of already adopted control measures would result in attainment of the ozone naaqs by the statutory deadline,and it conditionally approved the states rop plans for.
sierra club now petitions for review of both actions pursuant to the jurisdictional grant of b.in part ii,we consider sierra club attack on the april,conditional approval action,based on epa acceptance of the states commitments to cure the sips deficiencies by april.in part iii,we consider petitioner additional attack on the conditional approval action,based on epa acceptance of the two elements that were contained in the sips.finally,in part iv,we consider petitioner challenge to the deadline extension in the january,action.
we begin with sierra club primary challenge its contention that epa violated the clean air act by conditionally approving the concededly deficient area sips on the basis of the states commitment letters.epa response is that conditional approval was authorized by caa k,which provides 
conditional approval 
the administrator may approve a plan revision based on a commitment of the state to adopt specific enforceable measures by a date certain,but not later than year after the date of approval of the plan revision.any such conditional approval shall be treated as a disapproval if the state fails to comply with such commitment.
k emphasis added.we review epa construction of that section under the framework set forth in chevron natural resources defense council,d.under chevron first step,we ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if we determine that the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.only if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,do we proceed to chevron second step,and ask whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.we conclude that epa construction of the conditional approval provision is contrary to congress unambiguous intent,and we therefore reject it.
epa acknowledges that the sips did not contain a number of the elements required for full approval.indeed,it concedes that the sips were missing the same three features that led this court to vacate epa full approval in sierra club i racm analyses and the implementation of reasonable available control measures necessitated by such analyses rop plans with control measures adequate to ensure emission reductions of per year and contingency control measures to be implemented automatically if the area fails to meet a rop milestone or to reach attainment by the deadline.conditional approval.at,see c c,c b c as the agency further concedes,the plans were also missing the additional elements required for severe nonattainment areas,including specific enforceable measures to offset growth in vehicle emissions and reasonably available control technology for additional major sources.conditional approval.at see d.
notwithstanding these deficiencies,epa argues that the sips qualified for conditional approval rather than disapproval because they contained other required elements including the attainment demonstration and control strategy,and because the states submitted letters committing to remedy the deficiencies within one year,by april.but while the states did file commitment letters,those letters identified no specific enforceable measures of any kind.maryland commitment regarding contingency measures and racm is typical of the states submissions,and reads in full 
we also commit to submit to epa,not later than april,adopted contingency measures to be implemented if the area does not attain the ozone naaqs by november.additionally,by april,we commit to submitting to epa an appropriate racm analysis for the area,along with any revisions to the attainment demonstration sip necessitated by such analysis,including adopted measures to demonstrate timely attainment and to meet racm requirements,should there be any.

epa does not dispute that the states letters failed to identify specific measures that the states committed to adopt.indeed,epa argues that the states do not yet know what those measures will be because they have not yet completed the necessary analyses.as the agency explains it is true that the states have not yet identified the specific measures that could ultimately be adopted,however,it would be impossible for them to do so in advance of conducting the requisite racm and modeling analyses.conditional approval.at.epa contention is that all that the states need do to qualify for conditional approval is to commit to adopt specific enforceable measures by a date certain they do not need to tell epa what those measures are or even know what they are.oral arg.tr.at.the agency frames the issue as follows 
epa interprets the provision to require that the states commit to adopt specific enforceable measures by a date certain,but does not require that the individual measures be identified in the commitment.petitioner,on the other hand,interprets the provision to require the states to identify,in their commitments,the individual enforceable measures that will be adopted by a date certain.
resp ts br.at.
epa interpretation can not be squared with the unambiguous statutory language.the statute requires that the states commit to adopt specific enforceable measures.here,the agency has accepted as sufficient a commitment to adopt what it concedes are unspecified measures with the specifics to be named later.moreover,the statute requires a commitment to adopt specific enforceable measures by a date certain.here,not only are the measures unspecified,but the states have committed to adopt them only if such measures are determined to be needed based on further analysis.conditional approval.at emphasis added see id.t he states have clarified in their letters their intent to submit specific measures in support of the demonstrations,if appropriate.emphasis added.section k,however,contains no such qualifier.
this is not the first time that epa has defended a construction of k that we have found plainly inconsistent with the statute.indeed,in natural resources defense council epa,nrdc,we rejected the agency use of that section to permit states to meet statutory sip deadlines by submitting commital sips that contained nothing more than a mere promise to take appropriate but unidentified measures in the future.id.at.that construction of the conditional approval provision,we held,is contrary to congress unambiguous intent and must therefore be rejected.id.at.epa insists that nrdc is distinguishable because the commital sips at issue there contained no specific enforceable measures at all,while the sips here though concededly lacking several important measures do contain an attainment demonstration that includes adopted control measures and that shows attainment by the deadline.
although nrdc is factually distinguishable on the ground suggested by epa,it is not legally distinguishable.it is true that the sips in nrdc were bereft of substantive provisions.but we did not suggest that the states failure to submit the specific elements of concern to the petitioner there vehicle inspection and maintenance programs,and emission controls at stationary emission sources would have been cured had substantive provisions addressing different requirements been included.nor is there anything in the language of k to support epa contention that it may conditionally approve a sip as long as the sip submittal contains substantive provisions but not all of them.oral arg.tr.at see also virginia epa,holding,where sips contained many specific control measures,that epa could not use k to grant conditional approval based on other measures that may be promulgated thereafter to make up an emission reduction shortfall.
epa retreat to an argument based on legislative purpose is no more successful.epa does not require the commitments to identify the specific measures the states will adopt,the agency argues,because that would defeat the purpose of the conditional approval which is,in large part,to allow the states additional time to identify the measures needed.resp ts br.at.but as we explained in nrdc,the purpose of the conditional approval provision is not to permit states more time to identify control measures,but rather to give epa the opportunity to determine whether a sip,although not approvable in its present form,can be made so by adopting specific changes within the prescribed conditional period.nrdc,at emphasis added.as we further explained,s uch a determination can not reasonably be made unless the conditionally approved submittal contains something more than a mere promise to take appropriate but unidentified measures in the future.id.and that requires that the states complete the analyses necessary to identify appropriate measures before,rather than after,conditional approval is granted.
at bottom,nrdc rejected epa construction of k because it turned conditional approval into a means of circumventing sip deadlines.id.at.the same is true here.in the absence of conditional approval,epa would have been required to determine,by april,whether the sips demonstrated that the states had already adopted the required specifically enforceable measures.conditional approval.at reciting deadline issued by district court order see a,a a requiring states to adopt and submit sips including enforceable control measures by relevant deadlines.instead,epa conditional approval purports to grant the states an additional year to adopt such measures without specifying what they will be.in short,as epa conceded at oral argument,the agency position is that it may grant conditional approval on nothing more than the states promise to do next year what the clean air act requires them to have already done.oral arg.tr.at.and that amounts to nothing more than the use of k to postpone sip deadlines,a power that the section does not confer.nrdc,at.
in the previous part,we considered sierra club attack on epa conditional approval action insofar as it was based on mere promises to adopt sip elements in the future.in this part,we consider petitioner attacks on the substance of two elements that the states did submit as part of their sips.
the clean air act requires that each sip contain an attainment demonstration showing that the area will achieve the ozone naaqs by the statutory deadline.c.after reclassification as a severe nonattainment area,the area outside attainment deadline became november.id.a.in the conditional approval action,epa determined that the states had demonstrated that the area would in fact meet the naaqs by that date.sierra club contends that epa should not have approved the states attainment demonstration,because it was inconsistent with statutory requirements.
under caa c a,each state in a serious or severe nonattainment area must submit a sip that includes 
a demonstration that the plan,as revised,will provide for attainment of the ozone national ambient air quality standard by the applicable attainment date.this attainment demonstration must be based on photochemical grid modeling or any other analytical method determined by the administrator,in the administrator discretion,to be at least as effective.
c a emphasis added.sierra club argues that,in this case,the states attainment was insufficient because it was neither based on photochemical grid modeling,nor based on any other analytical method that the administrator had determined to be at least as effective.epa defends solely on the first ground that the attainment demonstration was in fact based on photochemical grid modeling.
a photochemical grid model is a mathematical model that predicts ozone levels on the attainment date based on monitoring data,meteorology,planned emission reductions,the area projected growth,and other factors.bcca appeal group epa,cir both parties agree that the states demonstration began with a photochemical grid model known as the urban airshed model uam.the model was used to predict ozone levels in by assuming implementation of the control strategy adopted in the sips and extrapolating from data collected on three summer days in july,and.both parties also agree that use of the model alone showed peak ozone concentrations exceeding the naaqs on those three days in the model indicated that on those days the area sips would result in daily maximum ozone levels of,and parts per billion ppb all in excess of the ppb naaqs for ozone epa,first amendment to technical support document for approval and promulgation of air quality implementation plans table iv,at hereinafter amendment to technical support document.
epa did not,however,conclude its analysis with these exceedances.rather,it adjusted the model extrapolations in light of the agency concerns about the model reliability and uncertainty.in particular,the agency noted that,when it applied the model to the three days in the base year and compared the model results to the actual monitored results for those days,the model known ozone concentrations by an average of.id.at at.it therefore adjusted the model calculations,using a variety of supplemental statistical techniques,to correct average modeled peak and.id.those adjustments resulted in demonstrated attainment for two out of the three modeled days.id.although the adjustments still did not indicate attainment for july,epa determined that the data used to model that day was too anomalous to demonstrate nonattainment.july,the agency found,had been the most severe day in years.id.at at.epa reasoned that t his type of day is not likely to occur often enough to be a major causative factor for nonattainment because the naaqs allows up to three monitored exceedances in any three year period.conditional approval.at.it therefore concluded that attainment of the ozone standard has been successfully demonstrated for the washington area by no later than.amendment to technical support document at at.
sierra club insists that once the model showed exceedances on three days,that should have been the end of the matter.in petitioner view,because the sips did not demonstrate attainment without epa adjustments,the demonstration was not based on photochemical grid modeling within the meaning of c a.according to sierra club,the clean air act uses based on to identify the sole basis for a decision.reply br.at.
we disagree.under chevron,when the statute is silent or ambiguous we must defer to a reasonable construction by the agency charged with its implementation.barnhart thomas,d quoting chevron,at.there is no question that the phrase based on is ambiguous.as epa points out,it does not necessarily require that attainment demonstrations rest solely on grid modeling.see bcca,at holding that the statute is ambiguous and does not require that an attainment demonstration be based solely on photochemical grid modeling mcdaniel chevron,cir noting that,in the context of various statutes,courts have held that the phrase based on is synonymous with arising from and ordinarily refers to a starting point or a foundation united states ex rel.kreindler kreindler united tech,cir holding that based upon in the false claims act does not mean based solely upon on the other hand,as the agency also properly concedes,the phrase would not permit an attainment demonstration that wholly abandoned the results of a model by using a supplemental analysis that effectively supplanted the model calculations.oral arg.tr.at.
because the statute is ambiguous,the question is whether the results obtained by adjusting the model can still reasonably be described as based on that model.we agree with epa that in this case they can,because here photochemical modeling is the primary basis for the attainment demonstration,while the supplementary analysis is merely an adjunct for assessing the photochemical grid modeling.conditional approval.at.as explained above,that analysis was employed to ensure that the model achieved its statutory purpose determining whether the sips actually provide for attainment of the ozone national ambient air quality standard by the applicable attainment date.c a.and the adjustments appear to that end,as they do no more than correct for the model of ozone levels as compared to actual observations,and for its reliance on a base day that appears to be a statistical outlier.
sierra club further contends that,even if supplemental adjustments of the model are not statutorily barred,the agency was nonetheless arbitrary and capricious in applying them in this case.see a but to withstand such an attack,the agency need only demonstrate that it examine d the relevant data and articulate d a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts
