defendant and respondent california state lands commission lands commission approved a year lease allowing real party in interest and respondent chevron chevron to continue operating a marine terminal in san francisco bay waters,near the company refinery in richmond,california.plaintiffs and appellants citizens for east shore parks and daniel doellstedt contend that in approving the lease,the lands commission failed to comply with the california environmental quality act ceqa and also violated the public trust doctrine.the trial court denied their petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief.we affirm.
background 
the long wharf marine terminal and nearby richmond refinery have been in existence since.standard oil,chevron predecessor,bought the refinery and began operating it and the terminal in.
the marine terminal is a,concrete docking structure approximately feet long.ships can dock at four outer berths and several inner berths.ships crude oil at the terminal for processing at the refinery and take on refined products which they transport to national and international markets.the marine terminal has been modified over the years.in,the original wooden structure gave way to the present concrete one.alterations in allowed for larger vessels.since then,chevron has added new platforms,breasting dolphins,and a vapor control system.in and,the company completed a major seismic upgrade and electrical system revamp.
while chevron refinery sits on private land beyond tidal reach,the marine terminal sits in the san francisco bay on submerged land owned by the state and subject to a public trust servitude and the control of the lands commission.the refinery and terminal are linked by a pipeline system that transfers oil and petroleum products between the two facilities.leaving the terminal,the pipelines first cross a foot causeway that largely stands atop submerged state land.the final feet of the causeway,however,cross private land,which is submerged or partially submerged and therefore is also subject to a public trust servitude beyond the causeway,the pipelines cross the upland area,land which is above tidal reach and not subject to such servitude.
in august,the lands commission granted standard oil a year lease for the marine terminal.chevron assumed the lease in,and the lease expired in.since then,chevron has operated the terminal on a holdover basis,until the lands commission approved the year renewal on january,
before the lands commission approved the lease renewal,it considered what actions it needed to take to comply with ceqa.the terminal predates ceqa by nearly years.thus,no ceqa study examined its construction or ensuing operation.the lands commission concluded future oil spills constituted a potentially significant environmental impact,requiring analysis in an environmental impact report eir the commission accordingly commissioned a draft eir,solicited and responded to public comments,and issued a final eir.although the reports focus on the impact of potential oil spills,they also discuss other impacts,such as those to water quality and recreation.the eir process took nearly nine years from the commission notice it would prepare such a report,dated november,to completion of the final eir,dated march.
in,at the beginning of the review process,the lands commission determined the eir should assess environmental impacts of the lease renewal against a baseline that assumed no terminal operations but the terminal structure remaining physically intact.over the years,the lands commission changed its view as to the appropriate baseline.accordingly,the draft and final eirs defined the lease renewal project as allowing chevron to continue its existing long wharf operations and used the existing,actual condition of the marine terminal,which included and operations,as the baseline by which to assess potential environmental impacts.using this baseline,the eirs concluded the lease renewal could result in significant environmental impacts due to potential oil spills.
the lands commission held public hearings on december,and january,at which it discussed and ultimately approved the final eir.plaintiffs appeared at the hearings and challenged the sufficiency of the eir,claiming it omitted consideration of other significant impacts of the terminal operation,especially in conjunction with the refinery,causeway,and pipelines.in approving the final eir on january,the lands commission adopted a statement of overriding consideration that the lease should be renewed despite the fact oil spill risks could not be wholly mitigated.
during the review process there was also discussion about how lease renewal would affect recreational activities on not only the submerged and tidal lands over which the terminal and the causeway sit,but also on the upland area where plaintiffs want a portion of the bay trail a hiking and biking trail that will encircle san francisco bay constructed.chevron met with proponents of the trail and officials of the city of richmond and entered into a community benefits agreement with the city.this agreement,dated july,obligated chevron to pay money and provide other consideration to the city if it issues permits for certain projects at the refinery.chevron commitment included specific resources for the bay trail,including an easement through its upland property and million for any security measures necessary to keep trail users out of sensitive refinery areas.
although prepared to vote on the lease renewal at the december,hearing,the lands commission postponed the vote until january,to provide chevron and interested government agencies a further opportunity to discuss additional resources for the bay trail and make progress on several other issues of public concern.by the january meeting,chevron agreed to provide a second easement on its upland property for the trail,and also agreed to a plan to reduce nighttime glare from terminal lighting and to report on ship air emissions,which may be subject to future regulation plaintiffs wanted chevron to provide an additional million to actually build the trail.the lands commission declined to impose such a condition or to delay the review process further,and approved the final eir and the lease renewal.
on march,plaintiffs filed a combined petition for writ of mandate under code of civil procedure sections and and public resources code sections and and complaint for declaratory relief.they filed an amended petition and complaint on march,alleging two causes of action against the lands commission one for violation of ceqa and one for violation of the public trust doctrine.plaintiffs sought a writ directing the lands commission to decertify the eir and vacate its approval of the lease renewal,and a declaration the commission had violated ceqa and the public trust doctrine.the trial court denied the plaintiffs writ petition and dismissed their complaint for associated declaratory relief on july,and entered judgment in favor of the lands commission on september.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
on appeal from a writ of administrative mandate in a ceqa case,this court,just as the trial court,reviews the administrative record for a prejudicial abuse of discretion.pub.resources code,sunnyvale west neighborhood city of sunnyvale city council th,d.abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.sunnyvale,supra,th at,d.judicial review of these two types of error differs significantly vineyard area citizens for responsible growth,city of rancho cordova cal th,d,vineyard.while we determine de novo whether the agency employed the correct procedures or properly interpreted ceqa requirements,we accord greater deference to the agency substantive factual conclusions.fat county of sacramento th,d fat.in reviewing for substantial evidence,the reviewing court may not set aside an agency approval of an eir on the ground that an opposite conclusion would have been equally or more reasonable,for,on factual questions,our task is not to weigh conflicting evidence and determine who has the better argument.vineyard,supra,at,d.
the baseline 
ceqa requires a public agency to prepare an eir only on projects that may have significant environmental effects.communities for a better environment south coast air quality management dist.cal th,d,communities.to decide whether a given project environmental effects are likely to be significant,the agency must use some measure of the environment state absent the project,a measure sometimes referred to as the baseline for environmental analysis.ibid.thus,an inappropriate baseline may skew the environmental analysis flowing from it,resulting in an eir that fails to comply with ceqa.see cadiz land rail cycle th,d.
as we have discussed,the lands commission initially indicated the appropriate baseline should exclude current operations at the marine terminal and consider only its physical structure.however,ultimately,the lands commission concluded the baseline should reflect the current,operative condition of the terminal.plaintiffs contend the lands commission had it right initially,and the baseline should have excluded any operational use of the terminal.they assert the lands commission chosen baseline was contrary to law and,alternatively,unsupported by the evidence.the lands commission and chevron maintain the california supreme court has made it clear the baseline for a ceqa analysis must reflect current conditions at a project site,and the baseline selected by the commission was both legally proper and supported by substantial evidence.we agree with the lands commission and chevron.
a.the baseline is not contrary to law 
the supreme court addressed the selection of ceqa baselines at length in communities,supra,cal th,d.in that case,conocophillips sought permits to modify or replace existing refinery equipment in order to produce a new,diesel fuel.id.at,d.although the modified or new equipment would release more nox gas than was currently being released at the site,the heightened emission level would still be within that allowed by existing permits.id.at,d.the air quality district therefore treated the permitted emission level as part of the baseline,even though the actual emissions at the site had not reached that level.ibid.measured against this baseline,the district concluded the fuel project would not have significant environmental impacts and did not prepare an eir.ibid.the court of appeal reversed.the supreme court affirmed the appellate court,holding the baseline did not reflect a realistic description of the existing conditions without the diesel project.id.at,d.
by comparing the proposed project to what could happen,rather than to what was actually happening,the district set the baseline not according to established levels of a particular use,but by merely hypothetical conditions allowable under the permits.communities,supra,cal th at,d,quoting san joaquin raptor rescue center county of merced th,d san joaquin raptor.however,to afford meaningful environmental review of a proposed project impact,a ceqa baseline must reflect the existing physical conditions in the affected area citation,that is the real conditions on the ground citation,rather than the level of development or activity that could or should have been present according to a plan or regulation.communities,at,d.
the supreme court observed the ceqa guidelines provide an eir must include a description of the physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project,as they exist at the time the notice of preparation is published,or if no notice of preparation is published,at the time environmental analysis is commenced,from both a local and regional perspective.this environmental setting will normally constitute the baseline physical conditions by which a lead agency determines whether an impact is significant.communities,supra,cal th at,d,quoting,tit,subd.a hereafter ceqa guidelines.accordingly,the normal rule is that the baseline must reflect the physical conditions existing at the time the environmental analysis begins.communities,at,d,see also in re bay delta programmatic environmental impact report coordinated proceedings cal th,d,in re bay delta preexisting environmental problems in the bay delta were part of the baseline conditions against which the potential impacts of the proposed project were to be measured woodward park homeowners city of fresno th,d citing the normal rule and holding potential impacts of proposed development had to be measured against current undeveloped condition of the property,not development permissible under existing zoning.
the court further observed a long line of court of appeal decisions holds,in similar terms to the guidelines,that the impacts of a proposed project are ordinarily to be compared to the actual environmental conditions existing at the time of ceqa analysis,rather than to allowable conditions defined by a plan or regulatory framework.communities,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,these cases reached this result even when the actual conditions were in violation of current regulatory provisions.ibid.fn.
for example,in riverwatch county of san diego th,d riverwatch,the appellate court approved the county chosen baseline which included illegal development that had occurred at a mining operation seeking a use permit.the respondents could not,said the court,essentially turn back the clock and insist upon a baseline that excluded existing conditions.id.at,d.how present conditions come to exist may interest enforcement agencies,but that is irrelevant to ceqa baseline determinations even if it means preexisting development will escape environmental review under ceqa.ibid.in fat,supra,th,d,the appellate court upheld the county choice of a baseline reflecting conditions to evaluate the impact of a proposed airport expansion.even though the airport developed over a period of nearly years without county authorization,there was evidence of environmental damage during that period,and the airport had been the subject of at least two zoning enforcement actions,the county acted within its discretion using current airport operations as the baseline for ceqa review.id.at,d.similarly,in eureka citizens for responsible government city of eureka th,d,the court of appeal upheld a project description for ceqa purposes that took into account an existing playground built contrary to code.while any alleged code violations in the construction of the playground may have been relevant to the city consideration of the variance requested,it was not a ceqa consideration.id.at,d,italics omitted see also fairview neighbors county of ventura th,d eir prepared in conjunction for application to expand mining operation properly discussed the existing physical condition of the affected area as including the mine bloom mcgurk th,d bloom existing facility for categorical exemption purposes means a facility as it exists at the time of the agency determination,rather than at the time ceqa was enacted this is consistent with cases that have required potential impacts to be examined in light of the environment as it exists when a project is approved.
accordingly,in communities,the supreme court affirmed the court of appeal directive that writ relief be granted and the matter be sent back to the air quality district to identify an appropriate baseline and reassess the environmental impacts of the proposed fuel project.communities,supra,cal th at,d.
as communities requires,the baseline used by the lands commission here reflected what was actually happening at the site of the proposed project communities,supra,cal th at,d,that is,an operating marine terminal.see also in re bay delta,supra,cal th at,d,fat,supra,th at,d riverwatch,supra,th at,d.indeed,we note that in riverwatch and fat,the appellate courts held even unlawful prior development and activity was properly included within the ceqa baselines for evaluation of proposed projects.here,in contrast,the real on the ground terminal operations communities,supra,cal th at,d,included in the baseline were entirely lawful.
despite the foregoing authorities,plaintiffs assert the baseline for a renewal project must exclude current conditions because the approving agency can eliminate them by refusing the renewal.thus,plaintiffs maintain the baseline here should exclude,at a minimum,use of the marine terminal and,possibly,the physical structure,itself in other words,plaintiffs claim the baseline here should reflect conditions that have not existed at the locale for more than a century this is so,say plaintiffs,because if the baseline does not exclude current conditions,there will never be full environmental review of the marine terminal,since it predates ceqa.
however,neither the statute,nor any ceqa case,supports plaintiffs revisionist approach to the baseline.to the contrary,the ceqa guidelines require a description of the physical conditions in the vicinity of the project,as they exist at the time the notice of preparation of an eir is published and specify t his environmental setting will normally constitute the baseline ceqa guidelines,subd.a,italics added.the cases further make clear the baseline must include existing conditions,even when those conditions have never been reviewed and are unlawful.see fat,supra,th at,d riverwatch,supra,th at,d see also communities,supra,cal th at fn,d.that fat and riverwatch involved applications to expand and not merely renew operations,is immaterial.in both,baselines reflecting current conditions,including unauthorized and even environmentally harmful conditions,meant those conditions would never receive environmental review.
to state the converse of what the court observed in bloom,the rule that the baseline should normally reflect the environment as it exists when a project is approved,is consistent with the categorical exemption in ceqa for existing facilities,meaning a facility as it exists at the time of the agency determination,not at the time now several decades ago when ceqa was enacted.bloom,supra,th at,d,italics added.we presume that thousands of permits are renewed each year for the ongoing operation of regulated facilities,and we discern no legislative or regulatory directive to make each such renewal an occasion to examine past ceqa compliance ibid.indeed,such a result would contravene the regulatory language and prospective character of the statute and,when applicable,also contravene limitations periods.see ibid.
ultimately,plaintiffs rely principally on league to save lake tahoe tahoe regional planning agency d tahoe i.in that case,the tahoe regional planning agency sought to increase the number of authorized mooring buoys on lake tahoe.there were already numerous,unauthorized buoys on the lake,and as to them,the agency either had to issue permits to allow their continued use,or deny permits and require their removal.id.at.the agency included all existing buoys,including those that were not authorized,in its environmental assessment baseline.id.at.the federal district court ruled this was an abuse of discretion the agency could not treat the existing but unauthorized buoys as a fait accompli incorporated into an environmental baseline.id.at.
however,as the federal district court,itself,explained in denying a motion for reconsideration based on the california supreme court then newly issued decision in communities,it was concerned with the environmental provisions of the tahoe regional planning compact,an agreement between california and nevada,and not with ceqa.league to save lake tahoe tahoe regional planning agency d at,tahoe ii.the compact environmental provisions go further than those of ceqa.ibid.accordingly,communities was not on point,said the district court,and did not counsel a different baseline analysis under the planning compact.tahoe ii,at see also tahoe i,at stating fat,supra,th,d,was not relevant because it was based on ceqa regulations.the instant case,in contrast,is a ceqa case,and communities is on point and controlling.
b.the baseline is supported by substantial evidence 
in communities,the supreme court did not attempt to spell out the particulars of the baseline the air quality district was required to adopt on remand,observing the district and conocophillips had emphasized refinery operations are highly complex and current nox emissions varied greatly depending on a variety of circumstances.communities,supra,cal th at,d.as the court explained neither ceqa nor the ceqa guidelines mandates a uniform,inflexible rule for determination of the existing conditions baseline.rather,an agency enjoys the discretion to decide,in the first instance,exactly how the project can most realistically be measured,subject to review,as with all ceqa factual determinations,for support by substantial evidence.id.at,d.accordingly,the court tasked the district with identifying a baseline that would allow comparison of what was actually happening without the proposed diesel fuel project and the conditions expected to be produced by the project,thereby permitting an informed environmental assessment of the project.id.at,d,see also san joaquin raptor,supra,th at,d established usage of the property may be considered to be part of the environmental setting,and when such usage is adequately shown in the record,agency satisfactorily acts on substantial evidence.
plaintiffs do not dispute that the baseline ultimately utilized by the lands commission reflected the conditions at the long wharf terminal.indeed,the record shows the lands commission selected the baseline looking solely at,and accurately describing,the physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project,as they exist ed at the time the notice of preparation was published.ceqa guidelines,subd.a.
rather,pointing to the lands commission initial statement made in that the baseline should exclude operational use of the terminal and reflect only its structural presence,plaintiffs claim there is no support in the record for the commission decision to modify the baseline to reflect the actual conditions at the terminal.plaintiffs claim the fact the lands commission initially selected a baseline that excluded use of the terminal established that a baseline was more appropriate.
to begin with,plaintiffs cite no authority supporting the implied premise of their argument that the lands commission could not revisit the baseline during the environmental review process and modify it as the commission deemed appropriate or necessary moreover,such a suggestion is unsound.administrative agencies not only can,but should,make appropriate adjustments,including to the baseline,as the environmental review process unfolds.no purpose would be served,for example,if an agency was required to remain wedded to an erroneous course and could only make a correction on remand after reversal on appeal.
the record also reveals a sound basis for the lands commission adjustment of the baseline.chevron presented the commission with information about other baseline determinations being made for proposed san francisco bay area projects,and urged it to take the same approach so there would be uniformity in the environmental review process.in addition,the case law in the area was being developed through decisions such as fat,th at pages,d,which endorsed and followed riverwatch,supra,th,d.thus,as the lands commission explained,its view of the appropriate baseline evolved over time,ultimately leading to modification of the baseline in the timeframe,some four years before it completed the environmental review process.
in sum,the lands commission did not abuse its discretion in defining the baseline used to assess environmental impacts of the proposed marine terminal lease renewal.the baseline was not contrary to the law,and it was based on substantial evidence.
other alleged deficiencies in the final eir 
buried pipeline alternative 
a compliant eir considers a range of reasonable alternatives to a proposed project to foster informed decisionmaking and public participation.ceqa guidelines,subd.a.plaintiffs assert the final eir failed to consider a particular alternative the removal of the causeway and burying the pipelines running between the terminal and the refinery.plaintiffs claim this alternative would have reduced the environmental impact of the proposed marine terminal project by opening up new recreational uses on the bay underneath the causeway and on the beach near the currently exposed pipelines.
an eir need not consider every conceivable alternative to a project.ceqa guidelines,subd.a.moreover,alternatives shall be limited to ones that would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project.ceqa guidelines,subd.f,italics added see pub.resources code,subd.b eir did not need to consider impacts that are not effects of the individual project see also in re bay delta,supra,cal th at,d,appellate court should not have considered alternative concerning delta environmental problems that would continue to exist even without the proposed project such problems were part of the baseline,and the alternative did not address adverse environmental impacts of the proposed project tracy first city of tracy th,d.in tracy first,for example,the eir only identified air quality and traffic as potential significant impacts and did not consider the alternative of a project.nor did it need to,said the court of appeal,because a alternative would not have addressed air quality and traffic,but only other impacts such as store closures and energy consumption,which were not identified as significant environmental impacts of the project.tracy first,at,d.
the same analysis applies here.the final eir identified potential significant impacts due to oil spills,but not due to impediment of recreation.accordingly,the eir did not need to address the causeway removal and buried pipeline alternative urged by plaintiffs,since it was directed at an asserted impact not identified in the eir.furthermore,given that the baseline properly reflected existing conditions,which included the causeway and pipelines supported thereby,the final eir correctly concluded the asserted impact on recreational uses was not a potential significant impact of the lease renewal project.
project description 
a project refers to the activity which is being approved and which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies.ceqa guidelines,subd.c.plaintiffs assert the final eir did not adequately describe the project before the lands commission and,specifically,claim the project description should have included chevron entire refinery operation,as well as continued use of the long wharf marine terminal.
however,the only approval at issue is the lands commission renewal of the lease for continued use of the marine terminal on submerged land owned by the state and controlled by the commission.the refinery,in contrast,sits on private property presently owned by chevron and requires no approvals by the commission for continued operations.
the cases cited by plaintiffs in support of their broader project description argument are inapposite.both tuolumne county citizens for responsible growth,city of sonora th,d and san joaquin raptor,supra,th at page,d,hold an approving agency may not chop up a proposed project into small segments and review each segment in a separate ceqa analysis to misleadingly downplay the impact of the proposed project as a whole.in this case,however,the refinery needs no approval from the lands commission to continue its operations,and the commission did not chop up the project before it renewal of the marine terminal lease in order to minimize environmental impacts associated with that project.
cumulative impacts 
even though a project impact may be individually limited,such impact may be cumulatively considerable.pub.resources code,subd.b ceqa guidelines,subd.a.c umulatively considerable means that the incremental effects of an individual project are considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects,the effects of other current projects,and the effects of probable future projects.pub.resources code,subd.b ceqa guidelines,subd.a.an eir shall discuss cumulative impacts of a project when the project incremental effect is cumulatively considerable ceqa guidelines,subd.a.plaintiffs assert the final eir failed to address environmental impacts of the marine terminal cumulatively with impacts of the refinery.they specifically complain the eir failed to consider the cumulative impacts of water discharges from the terminal,combined with discharges from the refinery 
however,the final eir did consider the cumulative impact of water discharges from the terminal and the refinery into the bay.section of the draft eir sets forth the state of the bay water quality,and page of that section discusses discharges from the refinery.pages to of the draft eir address cumulative impacts of the terminal discharge and other discharges into the bay,including those from the refinery.moreover,consideration of these water discharges was not required here.as we have discussed,the baseline for assessing the environmental impacts of the lease renewal project properly reflected the marine terminal operative condition,which included the water discharges.accordingly,the eir did not need to consider the cumulative impact of these discharges because they were not effects of the individual project under consideration.see,subd.b.
san francisco bay area water trail act 
the san francisco bay area water trail act,provides for the future creation of a water trail for recreational boating around the san francisco bay.plaintiffs complain the final eir failed to identify renewal of the marine terminal lease as inconsistent with the act.we need not and do not decide whether the act is merely enabling legislation as the lands commission and chevron maintain,or a regional plan requiring attention and discussion in a ceqa review.nor do we need to decide whether the terminal presence in the bay truly obstructs such a water trail.again,as we have discussed,the baseline for assessing the environmental impacts of the lease renewal project properly reflected the marine terminal operative condition,which included its physical structure.accordingly,the eir did not need to consider impacts of that existing structure on the water trail because they were not effects of the individual project under consideration.see pub.resources code,subd.b.
land based bay trail 
local and regional plans call for construction of the bay trail,a multipurpose,recreational trail around the san francisco bay.plaintiffs complain the lands commission also failed to acknowledge inconsistency between the terminal lease renewal and bay trail plans.
however,the draft eir clearly considered the issue at pages to.it concluded the bay trail,if built to plan,would run through the upland area containing supporting facilities for the terminal land not considered to be subject to a public trust easement and the lands commission control,and land not involved in the marine terminal lease renewal project at issue here.accordingly,the lands commission believed it had no authority to impose trail conditions in connection with renewal of the terminal lease.nevertheless,the lands commission urged the interested parties to discuss the issue and see if they could reach some agreement to facilitate development of the trail.it thus deferred final approval of the eir and lease renewal for a month,and the parties voluntarily entered into a side agreement whereby chevron agreed to provide two easements across its refinery property and million toward security along that portion of the trail once it is constructed.
in any case,as we have discussed,the baseline for assessing the environmental impacts of the lease renewal project properly reflected the conditions on the ground at the time,which included the presence of supporting facilities,such as the pipelines crossing the upland area.accordingly,the eir did not need to consider impacts of the existing terminal support facilities on the bay trail plans because these impacts were not effects of the individual project,the marine terminal lease renewal,under consideration.see,subd.b.
trustee agencies 
citing sections,subdivision a,and,plaintiffs contend the lands commission failed to consult with the california coastal conservancy conservancy and the california department of fish and game department about the marine terminal lease renewal project 
section,subdivision a,requires a lead agency responsible for the environmental review of a proposed project to send notice to other responsible agencies of its intention to prepare an eir,subd.a.plaintiffs contend both the conservancy and the department are trustees entitled to such notice.even assuming that to be the case,the record shows the lands commission sent notice and a copy of the draft eir to both.
section requires the state lead agency to consult with,and obtain comments from,each responsible agency,trustee agency,any public agency that has jurisdiction by law with respect to the project.the notice the lands commission sent to the conservancy and department asked for comments within days as provided for by ceqa and its guidelines.pub.resources code,subd.a ceqa guidelines,subd.a.neither the conservancy nor the department provided comments.ceqa guidelines anticipate there may be no response,and therefore provide if any public agency or person who is consulted with regard to an eir fails to comment within a reasonable time as specified by the lead agency,it shall be assumed,absent a request for a specific extension of time,that such agency or person has no comment to make.ceqa guidelines.accordingly,there was no failure by the lands commission to consult with trustee agencies.
response to public comments 
public comments allow an agency to identify,at the earliest possible time in the environmental review process,potential significant effects of a project,alternatives,and mitigation measures,subd.a.considering timely comments from the public on draft eirs is a statutory obligation,subd.d.but not all comments require a response.a lead agency need not respond to each comment made during the review process,however,it must specifically respond to the most significant environmental questions presented a local regional monitor city of los angeles th,d.plaintiffs complain the lands commission failed to respond to comments about the asserted recreational impacts we have already addressed.
to begin with,both the draft eir in sections and and responses to comments addressed comments raising recreational and bay trail issues.in any case,as we have explained,these were existing conditions and not impacts the eir for the marine terminal lease renewal project was required to discuss.accordingly,no response to these comments was required.see environmental protection information center california of forestry and fire protection cal th,d,failure to respond to patently irrelevant comments not prejudicial error.
statement of findings and overriding considerations 
finally,plaintiffs assert the lands commission statement of findings and overriding considerations,adopted when it approved the lease renewal,was not supported by substantial evidence.
if an eir finds a project will have significant environmental impacts,the agency responsible for the project must make a statement of findings for each impact.the agency may find a it has adopted changes to the project that mitigate or avoid the impact,b another agency has or should adopt such changes,or c economic,social,or other considerations make such changes infeasible.village laguna of laguna beach,board of supervisors of orange county d.a statement of overriding considerations is required i f approval of the project will result in significant environmental effects which are not at least substantially mitigated concerned citizens of south central los angeles unified school dist.th,d,citing ceqa guidelines,subd.b.such statement provides the agency reasons for proceeding with the project despite its unavoidable environmental risks.ibid.
plaintiffs argument that the lands commission statement of findings and overriding considerations is inadequate is a recycled medley of their separate challenges to the final eir,each of which we have already addressed and rejected.we therefore do not revisit these issues here.as we have discussed,the lands commission selected an appropriate baseline by which to assess environmental impacts of the lease renewal,and the final eir properly addressed identified impacts of the lease renewal project and adequately addressed those impacts.
public trust doctrine 
in addition to their ceqa challenge,plaintiffs contend the lands commission violated the public trust doctrine when it renewed the marine terminal lease.plaintiffs do not dispute that the maintenance and operation of the terminal is a permissible public trust use.nor do they dispute that the lands commission may,in its capacity as acting trustee of the public trust for the state,lease out the marine terminal facilities.rather,plaintiffs claim that before approving the lease renewal,the lands commission was required to consider other public trust uses of the property,specifically recreational uses,and to mitigate impacts on those uses to the greatest extent possible.in other words,plaintiffs maintain the ceqa environmental review process was insufficient,and the lands commission was required,under the public trust doctrine,to undertake an additional review process and impose additional mitigation conditions.as we explain,in this case,where the lands commission continued a permissible and trust use and conducted adequate review under ceqa,there was no violation of the public trust doctrine.
overview of the doctrine 
when california was admitted to the union in it acquired ownership of all tidelands and the beds of all inland navigable waters within its borders.city of berkeley superior court cal d,city of berkeley.the state owns these tidelands and submerged lands as trustee for public purposes,and a public easement and servitude exists over these lands for those purposes national audubon society superior court cal d,national audubon zack,supra,th at,d.
the public trust doctrine,traceable to roman law,rests on several related concepts.first,that the public rights of commerce,navigation,fishery,and recreation are so intrinsically important and vital to free citizens that their unfettered availability to all is essential in a democratic society.citation.an allied principle holds that certain interests are so particularly the gifts of nature bounty that they ought to be reserved for the whole of the populace finally,there is often a recognition,albeit one that has been irregularly perceived in legal doctrine,that certain uses have a peculiarly public nature that makes their adaptation to private use inappropriate.the best known example is found in the rule of water law that one does not own a property right in water in the same way he owns his watch or his shoes,but that he owns only an usufruct an interest that incorporates the needs of others.it is thus thought to be incumbent upon the government to regulate water uses for the general benefit of the community and to take account thereby of the public nature and the interdependency which the physical quality of the resource implies.zack,supra,th at,d,quoting sax,the public trust doctrine in natural resource law effective judicial intervention,supra.at,fn.omitted.
accordingly,the traditional triad of public trust uses includes navigation,commerce,and fishing on navigable waters.national audubon,supra,cal d at.commercial uses consistent with the trust include wharves or docks and other structures in aid of commerce.city of berkeley,supra,cal d at.the lands commission,in turn,acting on behalf of the state,can lease tidelands and submerged lands for such uses consistent with the trust.western oil gas state lands com.d.recreation and environmental preservation are also permissible public trust uses.national audubon,at.
standard of review 
the parties dispute the standard by which we should review the lands commission action.plaintiffs focus on the commission renewal of the marine terminal lease,maintain the renewal was a decision,and therefore the commission determination to continue the existing public trust use of the bay land and waters should be reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard set forth in code of civil procedure section.that section,which provides for,and specifies the scope of judicial review in,administrative mandamus actions,applies when the underlying administrative proceeding is one in which by law a hearing is required to be given,evidence is required to be taken,and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the agency.code civ,subd.a.t he intent of the legislature in enacting code of civil procedure section was to authorize judicial review only of the exercise by an administrative agency of an adjudicatory or function.langsam city of sausalito d.langsam see also western states petroleum superior court cal th,d,western states.
the scope of judicial review of such an adjudicatory or decision is set forth by the statute the inquiry in such case shall extend to the questions whether the respondent has proceeded without,or in excess of jurisdiction whether there was a fair trial and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law,the order or decision is not supported by the findings,or the findings are not supported by the evidence.code civ,subd.b.on appeal,the court of appeal applies the same standard of judicial review as the trial court.see ryan california interscholastic federation san diego section th,d o n appeal,our function is identical to that of the trial court schmitt city of rialto d.the appellate court reviews the administrative determination,not that of the superior court,by the same standard as was appropriate in the superior court.
chevron focuses on the lands commission decision to continue the existing public trust use,namely the maintenance and use of a marine terminal.chevron contends the commission choice of this trust use,rather than another,is a determination subject to judicial review under the traditional mandamus statute,code of civil procedure section.see western states,supra,cal th at,d,actions are properly challenged in traditional mandamus action under section,even when agency is required to hold a hearing and take evidence langsam,supra,d at.where an agency is exercising a function,judicial review must proceed under ordinary or traditional mandamus.
judicial review of agency actions that are in character is under a more deferential,arbitrary and capricious standard.see san francisco fire fighters local city and county of san francisco cal th,d,applying arbitrary and capricious standard to action western states,supra,cal th at,d,mandamus cases challenging actions are governed by the arbitrary and capricious standard.under this standard,judicial review is limited to an examination of the proceedings to determine whether the agency action has been arbitrary,capricious,or entirely lacking in evidentiary support,or whether the agency has failed to follow the procedure and give the notices required by law.major memorial hosps.th,d see also western states,supra,cal th at,d.appellate review in a traditional mandamus proceeding is ordinarily confined to an inquiry as to whether the findings and judgment of the trial court are supported by substantial evidence.agosto board of trustees of the grossmont cuyamaca community college dist.th,d,quoting saathoff city of san diego th,d.when,however,the appellant contends the respondent took action that is arbitrary,capricious,contrary to public policy,unlawful,or procedurally unfair,the appellate court faces a question of law which is reviewed de novo.personnel com.board of education d.with respect to these questions the trial and appellate courts perform essentially the same function,and the determinations of the trial court are not conclusive on appeal.see also agosto,supra,at,d,quoting saathoff,supra,at,d appellate review is de novo when the case involves resolution of questions of law where the facts are undisputed.
we need not decide whether the lands commission decision to continue a public trust use is adjudicatory or legislative in character.but see,zack,supra,th at,d administration of the trust by the state is committed to the legislature,and a determination of that branch of government made within the scope of its powers is conclusive in the absence of clear evidence that its effect will be to impair the power of succeeding legislatures to administer the trust.both the a buse of discretion standard applicable in administrative mandamus under code of civil procedure section,and the arbitrary or capricious standard applicable in traditional mandamus proceedings under code of civil procedure section,embrace review for legal error,including procedural irregularity.here,plaintiffs contend the lands commission failed to consider other public trust uses and to impose conditions mitigating impacts on those uses to the greatest extent possible in other words,plaintiffs claim the lands commission failed to comply with asserted procedural requirements of the public trust doctrine.this is a legal issue subject to de novo review under both code of civil procedure sections and.see vineyard,supra,cal th at fn,d,concluding we determine de novo whether the agency has employed the correct procedures in a case where appellant sought writ under both sections street properties,city of los angeles th,d in either case the standard of review would be the same because there are no disputed issues of fact fry saenz th,d whether under code of civil procedure section or section,we review questions of law de novo.
procedural requirements 
plaintiffs contend national audubon,supra,cal d at page,imposes the procedural requirements the lands commission assertedly failed to heed considering other public trust uses and imposing conditions mitigating impacts on those uses to the greatest extent possible.in national audubon,the supreme court sought to harmonize two separate bodies of law affecting water use california appropriative water rights system and the public trust doctrine.the los angeles department of water and power had purchased the private water rights in several nonnavigable streams flowing into mono lake and obtained permits from the california water resources board to divert the water for public consumption in the los angeles basin.id.at.the department acquisition of the private water rights and transfer and sale of the stream water,itself,was viewed as strictly a commercial use and not treated as public trust use.see id.at,diversions from a nonnavigable tributary can impair the public trust in a downstream navigable river or lake,human and environmental uses of mono lake navigable and downstream from the tributaries are uses protected by the public trust doctrine,fn,court did not need to consider whether the public trust extends for some purposes to nonnavigable streams.nor did the water resources board believe,in any case,that the public trust doctrine had any application in the context of administering and granting permit approvals in connection with appropriative water rights.id.at.
the supreme court observed,the public trust doctrine and the appropriative water rights system developed independently of each other and e ach developed comprehensive rules and principles which,if applied to the full extent of their scope,would occupy the field of allocation of stream waters to the exclusion of any competing system of legal thought.national audubon,supra,cal d at.the court concluded both systems of law were of vital importance to the public and thus sought to reach an accommodation which will make use of the pertinent principles of both the public trust doctrine and the appropriative water rights system.ibid.
d rawing upon the history of the public trust doctrine and the appropriative water rights system,the body of judicial precedent,and the views of expert commentators,the court arrived at several guiding principles,including that t he state has an affirmative duty to take the public trust into account in the planning and allocation of water resources,and to protect public trust uses whenever feasible.national audubon,supra,cal d at.the court also noted that while the state may prefer one trust use over another,it may not simply abrogate the public trust merely by authorizing a use inconsistent with the trust.id.at,fn.the court thus concluded the water resources agency could not recognize private water rights in nonnavigable streams to the comp
