on april,respondent office of environmental health hazard assessment oehha listed phthalate didp as a chemical known to cause reproductive toxicity under the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of health,commonly known as proposition.appellant exxon mobil corporation exxon sought a writ of mandate challenging oehha listing.the trial court denied the petition for writ of mandate,and exxon appealed.because we conclude that oehha did not abuse its discretion in listing didp as a chemical known to cause reproductive toxicity,we affirm.
statutory background 
overview of proposition 
californians adopted proposition through the voter initiative process in november.the provisions of proposition were subsequently codified in health and safety code sections through 
proposition requires that,at least once per year,the governor shall cause to be published a list of those chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity within the meaning of this chapter,subd.a.the listing of a chemical triggers two requirements.the first requirement,contained in section,prohibits businesses from discharging the chemical into water or onto or into land where such chemical passes or probably will pass into any source of drinking water.the second,contained in section,requires that businesses give clear and reasonable warning before exposing individuals to the chemical.no person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual.
even after a chemical has been listed,a discharge or release of the chemical is permitted under section if a business can demonstrate that the discharge or release will not cause any significant amount of the discharged or released chemical to enter any source of drinking water.subd.b.similarly,under section,a business need not warn of exposure to a listed chemical if it can demonstrate that the exposure poses no significant risk assuming lifetime exposure at the level in question for substances known to the state to cause cancer,and that the exposure will have no observable effect assuming exposure at one thousand times the level in question for substances known to the state to cause reproductive toxicity,based on evidence and standards of comparable scientific validity to the evidence and standards which form the scientific basis for the listing of such chemical,subd.c.
proposition provides that the governor shall designate a lead agency that may adopt and modify regulations,standards,and permits as necessary to conform with and implement this chapter and to further its purposes,subd.a.the governor has designated oehha as the lead agency charged with implementing proposition,tit,subd.o baxter healthcare denton,supra,th,d.
ii.the listing process 
the focus of our inquiry in the present case is section the statute,which governs the listing of chemicals under proposition.as we have said,section requires that the governor annually cause to be published a list of those chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity within the meaning of this chapter,subd.a.a chemical is known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity if 
in the opinion of the state qualified experts it has been clearly shown through scientifically valid testing according to generally accepted principles to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity,or 
if a body considered to be authoritative by such experts has formally identified it as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity,or 
if an agency of the state or federal government has formally required it to be labeled or identified as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity,subd.b,italics added.
thus,section,subdivision b of the statute sets out three different ways by which a chemical can be listed.first,a chemical will be listed if the state qualified experts the developmental and reproductive toxicant dart identification committee for reproductive toxicants or the carcinogen identification committee for carcinogens,subd.c have determined that the chemical causes cancer or reproductive toxicity.second,a chemical will be listed if a body considered to be authoritative has formally identified it as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity.third,a chemical will be listed if a state or federal agency has required it to be labeled as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity.our focus in the present case is on the second method,the authoritative body provision of section,subdivision b.
b.the regulations 
regulations promulgated by oehha and its predecessor,the health and welfare agency,identify five agencies deemed authoritative bodies for purposes of identifying chemicals known to cause reproductive toxicity within the meaning of section.a body is considered to be authoritative under this section if the dart identification committee has identified it as having expertise in the identification of chemicals as causing reproductive toxicity,subd.b.the national toxicology program the authoritative body at issue in the present one of the five identified agencies.the others are the environmental protection agency,the food and drug administration,the international agency for research on cancer solely as to transplacental carcinogenicity,and the national institute for occupational safety and health,subd.l.
the regulations provide that the lead agency oehha shall determine which chemicals have been formally identified by an authoritative body as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity,subd.c.further 
a chemical is formally identified by an authoritative body when oehha determines that the chemical has been included on a list of chemicals causing cancer or reproductive toxicity issued by the authoritative body or is the subject of a report which is published by the authoritative body and which concludes that the chemical causes cancer or reproductive toxicity or has otherwise been identified as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity by the authoritative body in a document that indicates that such identification is a final action,subd.d.further,the list,report,or document must satisfy regulatory formalities.ibid.it satisfies these formalities if it specifically and accurately identifies the chemical and has been a r eviewed by an advisory committee in a public meeting,if a public meeting is required,or b m ade subject to public review and comment prior to its issuance,or c p ublished by the authoritative body in a publication,such as,but not limited to,the federal register for an authoritative body which is a federal agency,or d s igned,where required,by the chief administrative officer of the authoritative body or a designee,or e a dopted as a final rule by the authoritative body,or f o therwise set forth in an official document utilized by the authoritative body for regulatory purposes,subd.d.
as causing reproductive toxicity means either that s tudies in humans indicate that there is a causal relationship between the chemical and reproductive toxicity,subd.g,or 
studies in experimental animals indicate that there are sufficient data,taking into account the adequacy of the experimental design and other parameters such as,but not limited to,route of administration,frequency and duration of exposure,numbers of test animals,choice of species,choice of dosage levels,and consideration of maternal toxicity,indicating that an association between adverse reproductive effects in humans and the toxic agent in question is biologically plausible,subd.g 
the regulations further provide that oehha shall find that a chemical does not satisfy the definition of causing reproductive toxicity if scientifically valid data which were not considered by the authoritative body clearly establish that the chemical does not satisfy the criteria of subsection g,paragraph or subsection g,paragraph,subd.h.if objections are made to a listing decision,oehha shall refer the chemical to the dart committee if it finds that there is no substantial evidence that the criteria identified in subsection g have been satisfied,subd.i.
factual and procedural background 
phthalate,or didp,is a substance that is part of a group of chemicals known as phthalates.phthalates are used primarily to soften and increase the flexibility of plastics.didp is used as a plasticizer in a wide variety of polyvinyl chloride pvc plastic products,including coverings on wires and cables,artificial leather,toys,carpet backing,and pool liners.it also has limited use in food packaging and handling.approximately metric tons about million pounds of didp were used in the united states in.
ii.the authoritative body report 
national toxicology program 
the national toxicology program ntp is a federal interagency program that evaluates agents of public health concern.three agencies form the core of ntp the national institute of environmental health sciences of the national institutes of health,the national institute for occupational safety and health of the centers of disease control and prevention,and the national center for toxicology research of the food and drug administration.http ntp.niehs.nih.gov objectid b bdb ceba f e a f bb as of,as of.
in,ntp and the national institute of environmental health sciences established the ntp center for the evaluation of risks to human reproduction to evaluate the potentially hazardous effects of chemicals on human reproduction and development.publishes monographs that assess the evidence that environmental chemicals cause adverse effects on reproduction and development and opine on whether these substances are hazardous for humans.as of.monographs have three parts the ntp brief on the chemical evaluated,an expert panel report,and all public comments.
b.the expert report on didp 
in,initiated a review of seven phthalates,including didp.assembled an expert panel of scientists expert panel to review and evaluate the scientific evidence on the potential reproductive and developmental toxicities of each phthalate.over months,the expert panel critically reviewed more than documents on the seven phthalates,held three public meetings,and received public comments.
the expert panel issued its report on didp,entitled expert panel report on phthalate the expert report,in october.the report discussed five studies,four in rats and one in mice,that evaluated prenatal developmental toxicity following exposure to didp.in two of the studies,didp was administered to pregnant rats by gavage,in which a small tube was inserted through the rat mouth directly into the stomach.both of these studies showed that fetuses exposed prenatally to didp had an increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities,including the growth of extra ribs.two additional reproductive toxicity studies,in which female rats were exposed to didp through diet,also showed increased mortality rates and decreased birth weight among rat pups exposed prenatally to didp.
based on these studies,the expert panel found that t here are adequate data available in rats to determine that prenatal oral exposure to didp results in developmental toxicity.further,based on toxicokinetic studies in rodents,the panel found that t here is adequate general toxicokinetic data for didp,consisting of absorption,distribution,metabolism,and excretion,over a range of oral doses in the rat while studies of toxicokinetics in humans have not been located,the didp toxicokinetic data in rats are consistent with the large body of data on phthalates that include data on rodents and primates.it is reasonable to assume that the didp rodent data is relevant to humans.
the panel concluded the toxicology database is sufficient to determine that oral maternal exposure to didp can result in developmental toxicity to the conceptus.in rats,two prenatal developmental studies have shown effects on the developing skeletal system following oral exposure to didp.the noael for these studies was milligram per kilogram of body weight per day.in addition,developmental toxicity was noted in two oral reproductive toxicity studies in rats.both studies showed effects on pup survival and growth.these effects may be due to prenatal lactational exposures to didp.the noaels for the studies were during pregnancy and during lactation.based on the results of the toxicology studies,oral exposure to pregnant humans and oral exposure to children should be examined.
c.the ntp brief on didp 
ntp issued a monograph on the potential human reproductive and developmental effects of phthalate in april ntp monograph.the monograph included the expert report as well as ntp brief on phthalate ntp brief.the ntp brief reached conclusions in four different areas about the developmental hazards posed by didp,as follows.
are people exposed to didp ntp concluded that people are exposed to didp during its manufacture,through the manufacture of products,during the use of such products,or through the presence of didp in the environment.environmental exposures can occur through air,water,or contact with products.ntp noted,however,that studies to determine the extent of human exposures to didp have not been conducted.therefore,based on exposures to di phthalate dehp,a more phthalate,ntp estimated general population exposures to didp in the united states to be less than micrograms per kilogram body weight per day.
can didp affect human development or reproduction ntp concluded that didp possibly affects human development or reproduction.it noted that while there is no direct evidence that exposure of people to didp adversely affects reproduction or development,studies with rats have shown that exposure to didp can cause adverse developmental effects.it thus concluded scientific decisions concerning health risks are generally based on what is known as.in this case,recognizing the lack of human data and the evidence of effects in laboratory animals,the ntp judges the scientific evidence sufficient to conclude that didp is a developmental toxicant and could adversely affect human development if the levels of exposure were sufficiently high.
summary of supporting evidence.ntp noted that as presented in the expert panel report,didp studies in rats addressed effects on both development and reproduction.these studies reported that exposure of pregnant dams to relatively high doses of didp causes abnormal development of the fetal skeleton,and reduced weight gain and survival of pups.in some instances,didp exposure was also associated with abnormalities of the urinary tract.the data also show that lactational exposure can contribute to reduced weight gain in pups.
are current exposures to didp high enough to cause concern ntp concluded that current exposures of people to didp are probably not high enough to cause concern.although no data are available on general population exposures to didp,ntp judged it unlikely that human exposures are any greater than to dehp,and thus it concluded that the scientific evidence does not point to an immediate concern for adverse reproductive or developmental effects.ntp thus concluded that,based on the assumption that the population is exposed to didp at less than,there is minimal concern for developmental effects in fetuses and children.emphasis omitted.however,ntp noted that i nformation is not available on the levels of exposure in children mouthing objects or in pregnant women occupationally exposed to didp.thus,no conclusions can be reached concerning the possible hazards for these exposure circumstances.
iii.oehha listing of didp 
based on the ntp brief,in may,oehha announced that it was investigating the possibility of listing didp as a chemical known to cause developmental toxicity pursuant to proposition.in march,oehha formally proposed to list didp as a chemical known to cause reproductive toxicity within the meaning of proposition.
exxon objected to the proposed listing,asserting that the ntp brief did not consider the mandatory criteria under regulation g,and did not make the required determination that an association between adverse reproductive effects in humans and didp is biologically plausible.after a period of public comment,on april,oehha issued its final decision adding didp to the list of chemicals known to the state to cause reproductive toxicity.
iv.mandate proceeding 
exxon filed a petition for writ of mandate pursuant to code of civil procedure section on june.oehha filed an answer july.the parties filed briefs in support of and in opposition to the petition,and the trial court held a hearing on the matter on november.
the court denied the petition for writ of mandate on november,finding that oehha did properly list dipd sic as a developmental toxicant based on an appropriate finding by a designated authoritative body.judgment was entered on december,and notice of entry of judgment was served on december.
exxon filed a timely notice of appeal on january.
standard of review 
exxon filed a petition for a writ of ordinary or traditional mandamus pursuant to code of civil procedure section a traditional writ of mandate brought under code of civil procedure section lies to compel the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins,as a duty resulting from an office,trust,or station.under this section,mandate will lie to compel performance of a clear,present,and usually ministerial duty in cases where a petitioner has a clear,present and beneficial right to performance of that duty.citations.mandamus has long been recognized as the appropriate means by which to challenge a government official refusal to implement a duly enacted legislative measure.citation.morris harper th,d.
in determining whether to grant a petition for traditional mandamus,we review for an abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the respondent agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law,the order or decision is not supported by the findings,or the findings are not supported by the evidence.citations.sierra club state bd.of forestry cal th,d.environmental protection information center california of forestry fire protection cal th,d.in determining whether the agency complied with the required procedures and whether the agency findings are supported by substantial evidence,the trial court and the appellate courts essentially perform identical roles.we review the record de novo and are not bound by the trial court conclusions.ibid.
a central issue in the present case is the meaning of the authoritative body provision of section and the regulations promulgated thereunder.as a general matter,courts will be deferential to government agency interpretations of their own regulations,particularly when the interpretation involves matters within the agency expertise and does not plainly conflict with a statutory mandate.see yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.w e will not disturb the agency determination without a demonstration that it is clearly unreasonable.environmental protection information center california of forestry fire protection,supra,cal th at,d.while final responsibility for interpreting a statute or regulation rests with the courts and a court will not accept an agency interpretation that is clearly erroneous or unreasonable,a s a general rule,the courts defer to the agency charged with enforcing a regulation when interpreting a regulation because the agency possesses expertise in the subject area.mileikowsky tenet healthsystem th,d.
also at issue in this case is whether oehha listing of didp comports with section and the regulations promulgated thereunder.in considering this issue,the scope of our review is limited,out of deference to the agency authority and presumed expertise the court may not reweigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the agency.citation.citation.in general the inquiry is limited to whether the decision was arbitrary,capricious,or entirely lacking in evidentiary support citation.when making that inquiry,the court must ensure that an agency has adequately considered all relevant factors,and has demonstrated a rational connection between those factors,the choice made,and the purposes of the enabling statute.citation.citation.american board of cosmetic surgery medical board of california,supra,th at,d.this limited judicial review is further constrained by the recognition that i n technical matters requiring the assistance of experts and the study of marshaled scientific data as reflected herein,courts will permit administrative agencies to work out their problems with as little judicial interference as possible.western states petroleum south coast air quality management dist.th,d,quoting stauffer chemical air resources board d.
discussion 
exxon makes a series of arguments in support of its mandate petition.
first,exxon contends that oehha may list a chemical based on the authoritative body provision of section only if an authoritative body report includes the findings prescribed by regulation g,that there are sufficient data from valid animal studies to demonstrate that adverse effects in humans are biologically plausible.
second,exxon contends that the ntp brief,the authoritative body report at issue in this case,did not include the findings required by regulation g.thus,exxon urges that oehha abused its discretion by listing didp pursuant to the statute authoritative body provision.
third,exxon contends that oehha disregarded as not relevant factors that it legally must consider when making an authoritative body listing.
we discuss each of these contentions below.
i.an authoritative body report need not make the detailed findings set out in regulation g to support a listing decision 
exxon contends that for oehha to list a chemical using the authoritative body provision of section,the authoritative body report must meet the requirements of regulation c,d,and g.where animal data are at issue,the report must take into account the scientific criteria listed in g the analysis and determine that effects in humans are biologically plausible the conclusion.in other words,exxon contends,where the report relies on animal studies,it must conclude,among other things,that the dose level and route of administration in the animal studies are relevant to the expected human exposures.further,the report must conclude that the developmental effects observed in experimental animals are biologically plausible in humans.according to exxon,an authoritative body report that neither takes into account these scientific criteria nor contains the required finding of biological plausibility in humans does not and can not satisfy the requirements of regulation g.by definition,it can not obviate the need for dart is the entire purpose of the authoritative body listing provision.
oehha disagrees.it contends that the authoritative body provision is triggered if a body considered authoritative under the statute identifies a chemical in a report,list,or other document as a developmental toxicant.the authoritative body report must satisfy the formality requirements of the is,it must accurately identify the chemical,have been reviewed by an advisory committee in a public meeting,have been made subject to public review and comment,and have been adopted as a final report by the authoritative it need not include the detailed findings set out in regulation g.instead,once the chemical is formally identified by an authoritative body as a developmental toxicant,oehha reviews the scientific record before the authoritative body to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support a listing.if it concludes on the basis of its review that the regulation g criteria are,that the experimental animal data considered by the authoritative body are sufficient to support a conclusion that an association between adverse reproductive effects in humans and the toxic agent is biologically it lists the chemical.
a.the statute section 
we begin our analysis with the language of the statute,in re th,d to determine legislative intent,we turn first,to the words of the statute,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning people akhile th,d we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual,ordinary meaning.as indicated above,the sole statutory source of the authoritative body provision is section,which provides that a chemical is known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity within the meaning of proposition if 
in the opinion of the state qualified experts it has been clearly shown through scientifically valid testing according to generally accepted principles to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity,or if a body considered to be authoritative by such experts has formally identified it as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity,or if an agency of the state or federal government has formally required it to be labeled or identified as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity.subd.b,italics added.
the statute does not contain any additional language concerning the authoritative body provision.thus,while the statute creates the authoritative body mechanism,it does not answer the question posed here about how the provision operates.
b.the regulations 
we turn next to the language of the regulations.as we have said,proposition expressly delegates to oehha the power to adopt regulations to implement its provisions,subd.a the governor shall designate a lead agency and other agencies that may be required to implement this chapter,including this section.each agency so designated may adopt and modify regulations,standards,and permits as necessary to conform with and implement this chapter and to further its purposes.pursuant to this authority,oehha adopted regulation,entitled chemicals formally identified by authoritative bodies.subdivision c of that section provides 
the lead agency shall determine which chemicals have been formally identified by an authoritative body as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity,subd.c.
subdivision g further provides that,for purposes of this section,as causing reproductive toxicity means that 
s tudies in experimental animals indicate that there are sufficient data,taking into account the adequacy of the experimental design and other parameters such as,but not limited to,route of administration,frequency and duration of exposure,numbers of test animals,choice of species,choice of dosage levels,and consideration of maternal toxicity,indicating that an association between adverse reproductive effects in humans and the toxic agent in question is biologically plausible,subd.g.
our analysis of the meaning of regulation c and g necessarily is guided by the applicable standard of review.as a starting point,the interpretation of an administrative regulation is subject to the same principles as the interpretation of a statute.citation.however,there is an important difference between the interpretation of a statute and the interpretation of a regulation.the legislature has no authority to interpret a statute.citations.on the other hand,where the language of the regulation is ambiguous,it is appropriate to consider the agency interpretation.citation.indeed,we defer to an agency interpretation of a regulation involving its area of expertise,unless the interpretation flies in the face of the clear language and purpose of the interpretive provision.citation.citation.county of sacramento state water resources control bd.th,d.
properly framed,thus,our inquiry is not the correct interpretation of regulation c and g,but whether the interpretation offered by oehha is reasonable in light of the regulation language and purpose.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that it is.
as oehha notes,regulation c expressly tasks it the lead agency with determining which chemicals have been formally identified by an authoritative body as causing reproductive toxicity.regulation g further defines what it means to caus e reproductive toxicity as causing reproductive toxicity means that s tudies in experimental animals indicate that there are sufficient data indicating that an association between adverse reproductive effects in humans and the toxic agent in question is biologically plausible.to list a chemical pursuant to regulation,therefore,oehha must conclude that an authoritative body has determined that the chemical is a reproductive,that the experimental animal data are sufficient to support a conclusion that adverse effects in humans are biologically plausible.nothing in regulation suggests,however,that oehha must base this conclusion solely on the authoritative body report.rather,as oehha suggests,the language of regulation is broad enough to allow oehha to premise its conclusion on the authoritative body report and other factors,such as the scientific literature on which the authoritative body relied and oehha knowledge of the authoritative body methodology.in other words,so long as oehha is able to conclude on the basis of the authoritative body report and the underlying scientific record that an authoritative body has identified a chemical as a reproductive toxicant and that the identification takes the regulatory criteria into account,oehha may list it pursuant to regulation.
our interpretation of regulation is bolstered by subdivision d of that section,which provides that the formal identification of a chemical may take the form of,among other things,a list of chemicals.the regulatory history notes that lists were included in regulation d because l ists and reports are methods of identification commonly used by governmental and entities alike to identify chemical hazards.final statement of reasons adopted in connection with regulation g.the fact that a list a series of names or other items written or printed together in a meaningful grouping or sequence so as to constitute a record random house webster college,is sufficient under this section suggests that an authoritative body document need not detail the scientific criteria set forth in regulation g to support a listing.indeed,exxon notion that an authoritative body document must discuss the regulation g criteria is inconsistent with the regulation clear statement that a list suffices.
exxon asserts that oehha interpretation of regulation g destroys the symmetry created by the statute,which establishes the same standard for dart and authoritative bodies.it explains that when the dart committee lists a chemical,it is required to determine that there is s ufficient evidence such that extrapolation to humans is appropriate.further,it must consider the experimental design and overall protocol of the animal studies,and make an express finding that t he exposure of the animals,in terms of route of administration,is relevant to expected human exposures.italics deleted.thus,exxon suggests,to preserve the symmetry created by the statute,an authoritative body report must contain the same findings that the dart committee would make if it were undertaking a review of the chemical.otherwise,it says,the authoritative body report has not obviated the need for dart review.
we agree with exxon that to support a listing,an authoritative body must have made the findings prescribed by the regulations.we further agree that the findings required by regulation g in large measure parallel those made by the dart committee when it reviews a chemical.we do not agree,however,that the authoritative body report is the only permissible evidence that the authoritative body made the regulatory findings.rather,as we have said,we believe that oehha properly can conclude that the authoritative body made the necessary findings based on oehha review of the scientific literature on which the authoritative body relied and its knowledge of the authoritative body methodology.so long as oehha can conclude,on the basis of the entire record before it,that the authoritative body made the regulation g findings,it may list a chemical pursuant to the authoritative body provision of the statute.
c.the final statement of reasons 
our conclusion that oehha interpretation of regulation is a reasonable one is bolstered by the final statement of reasons issued in connection with the regulatory adoption of regulation.government code section requires agencies to prepare and submit with all adopted regulations a final statement of reasons.subd.a.the final statement of reasons updates the initial statement of reasons,which states the specific purpose of each adoption and the rationale for the determination by the agency that each adoption is reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose for which it is proposed,subd.b.both parties have relied on the final statement of reasons adopted in connection with regulation g hereinafter,fsor.
the fsor notes that under the primary approach to listing,the scientific advisory panel the predecessor to the dart committee must determine whether a chemical has been clearly shown,based upon scientifically valid testing according to generally accepted principles,to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.this can be a process.fsor.thus,the apparent purpose of the authoritative bodies provision of proposition is to establish a streamlined process for the panel.rather than review each chemical already subjected to review by another organization,the panel needs only to determine the organization competence.the chemicals which the organization has formally identified as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity can then be listed.this permits the panel to focus its attention on chemicals which have not previously been evaluated.fsor.
the fsor continues that under regulation g,a chemical may be identified as causing reproductive toxicity if,among other things,sufficient evidence of reproductive toxicity exists based on animal studies.sufficient evidence is defined to mean that there are sufficient data,which take into account the adequacy of the experimental design and other specified parameters,indicating that an association between adverse reproductive effects in humans and the toxic agent in question is biologically plausible.fsor.however,i t is not the intention of oehha to substitute its scientific judgment for that of the authoritative body.oehha inquiry will be limited to whether the authoritative body relied upon scientific data in an amount sufficient to conclude that the chemical causes reproductive toxicity.oehha does not intend by this section to go behind the studies relied upon by the authoritative body to determine their scientific validity.because the body is considered authoritative,and the body utilizes the same or substantially the same criteria as set forth in subsection g,it will be assumed that the data relied upon is scientifically valid.oehha will look to determine whether the authoritative body relied upon animal or human data in an amount sufficient to satisfy the criteria.if so,the chemical will be proposed for listing.fsor,italics added.
further,a s indicated above,oehha does not intend to substitute its scientific judgment for that of the authoritative body.it does not intend to reevalu a te the science to determine whether the authoritative body should have reached a different result.in effect,there is a presumption that the authoritative body properly applied the criteria.fsor,italics added.
considered together,we understand these statements to mean that when designating a body as authoritative within the meaning of the statute,the dart committee determines whether the body uses the same or substantially the same criteria set out in regulation g.only if it does will it be deemed an authoritative body.the authoritative body designation thus allows oehha to presume that the body made the prescribed findings when it determined a chemical to be a reproductive toxicant in effect,there is a presumption that the authoritative body properly applied the criteria.fsor.
western crop protection davis 
we conclude finally that our analysis is consistent with the court of appeal in western crop protection davis th,d.there,oehha proposed to list several chemicals based on the environmental protection agency epa designation of the chemicals as known to cause or reasonably anticipated to cause reproductive toxicity.id.at,d.appellants sought a writ of mandate to block the proposed listing,contending that the federal reasonably anticipated to cause standard was lower than proposition known to cause standard.id.at,d.oehha responded that the language used by the epa in articulating its standard did not preclude it from finding that the epa had made the requisite proposition identification.in other words,oehha said,regardless of the semantic formulation used by the epa,it was authorized to examine the data on which the epa acted to determine if its listing satisfied the state standard.ibid.
the court of appeal adopted oehha position and denied the writ.assuming without deciding that the epa standard was less rigorous than the proposition standard,it concluded that it does not follow that it is improper for the state to find that a particular chemical has been placed on the epa list,formally identified,by the epa as causing reproductive toxicity.it can do so by determining whether the reasons for the epa placement meet the proposition criteria.western crop protection,supra,th at,d.in other words,the court said,i f it can be objectively ascertained that the reason the epa placed a particular chemical on the list is because it found sufficient evidence of reproductive toxicity to qualify under the california definition,that suffices to meet the criteria of the california law.id.at,d.
further,the court concluded,regulation i implies that oehha has the authority to apply the regulation g criteria to the administrative record on which the epa relied to determine whether the chemical meets the california standard.we conclude that under section now,oehha has the authority to examine the administrative record of the epa procedure to determine if there is substantial evidence that the epa has placed a chemical on the epa list because it meets the state criteria of causing reproductive toxicity.if so,the fact that the federal standard may be broad enough to allow inclusion of chemicals on the epa list that do not satisfy the california standard does not prevent oehha from determining that a chemical was placed on the list by epa as causing reproductive toxicity.western crop protection,supra,th at,d.
the court analysis in western crop is consistent with our analysis.as we have done here,the court in western crop found that an authoritative body failure to discuss the proposition listing criteria in its report does not preclude oehha from finding that a chemical has been formally identified by an authoritative body as causing reproductive toxicity.instead,oehha may consider the entire record,including both the authoritative body identification and the record on which it relied,to determine whether a chemical has been formally identified as causing reproductive toxicity.
ii.the ntp brief on didp and the underlying administrative record adequately supported oehha listing decision 
having resolved the central legal issue raised by this circumstances under which oehha may determine that a chemical has been formally identified by an authoritative body as causing reproductive now turn to the facts.specifically,we consider whether oehha abused its discretion by concluding that ntp formally identified didp as a reproductive toxicant,and further by finding that substantial evidence supported that identification.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion.
oehha did not abuse its discretion by concluding that ntp formally identified didp as causing reproductive toxicity 
the parties do not dispute that the ntp brief on didp is a final report that satisfies the procedural requirements of regulation d.the sole area of disagreement is whether the brief identified didp as a reproductive toxicant in the manner the statute and regulations require.we conclude that it does.
the ntp brief unambiguously identified didp as a developmental toxicant.it stated scientific decisions concerning health risks are generally based on what is known as.in this case,recognizing the lack of human data and the evidence of effects in laboratory animals,the ntp judges the scientific evidence sufficient to conclude that didp is a developmental toxicant and could adversely affect human development if the levels of exposure were sufficiently high.italics added.based on this statement,there can be little doubt that ntp made the determination pivotal to the authoritative body scheme that didp is a developmental toxicant in humans.
the question,therefore,is whether oehha reasonably concluded that ntp considered the factors prescribed by regulation g adequacy of the experimental data,sufficiency of the data,biological plausibility in humans when it determined didp to be a developmental toxicant.as we have said,oehha was not limited to the ntp brief in making this determination under regulation g,it was entitled to consider the whole record before ntp,including the scientific literature on which ntp relied.in this case,however,it did not need to do so,because the expert report contained the analysis necessary for oehha to conclude that ntp adequately had considered the regulatory criteria.
adequacy of the experimental design.the expert report reflects that the expert panel considered the adequacy of the experimental designs in concluding that didp is a developmental toxicant.specifically,the expert report reflects that the panel considered the number of relevant studies,the route of administration employed in each study,the number of test animals,and the dosage levels.for example,with regard to one prenatal developmental toxicity study,the expert panel noted that the experimental animals rats were dosed by gavage,the study used animals per test group,and doses were,and.with regard to another study,it noted that the experimental animals wistar rats were also dosed by gavage,the study used animals per test group,and doses were,and.
sufficiency of the data.the expert report reflects that the expert panel also considered the sufficiency of the data in concluding that didp is a developmental toxicant.the expert report specifically finds that t here are adequate data available in rats to determine that prenatal oral exposure to didp results in developmental toxicity.italics added.further,it explains the basis for this conclusion the results of two rat studies were remarkably consistent and included increases in lumbar and cervical ribs,an effect seen infrequently in controls.further,the appearance of extra ribs was identical at the common dose of in the studies and i n the study where there was a larger group size n,the litter incidence at this dose for each effect cervical and lumbar achieved statistical significance.finally,the report noted that a numeric trend of increased incidence with increased dose was seen at all doses.
biological plausibility in humans.the expert report expressly noted that humans may be exposed to didp as a result of uptake by food animals,certain vegetables,and migration of didp from food packaging.further,it said,while studies of toxicokinetics in humans had not been located,the didp toxicokinetic data in rats are consistent with the large body of data on phthalates that includes data on rodents and primates.thus,it concluded,it is reasonable to assume that the didp rodent data are relevant to humans.further,the expert report said there are no human data from which to assess the health effects associated with didp exposure studies of didp toxicity are limited to laboratory animals.in the absence of human data to the contrary,it is assumed that the effects observed in laboratory animals are relevant to humans.italics added.
exxon does not contest the existence of these findings,but it contends they are irrelevant because,not the expert panel,is the designated authoritative body in this case.thus,it contends,s tatements in the expert report are relevant only to the extent that ntp clearly adopted or relied on such statements.we do not agree.as indicated above,we have concluded that it was proper for oehha to examine the whole record,including both the authoritative body identification and the record on which it relied,to determine whether ntp made the findings prescribed by regulation g.see discussion,part,ante.the expert report is part of the record on which ntp relied.oehha thus did not abuse its discretion in examining,among other things,the expert report.
exxon also contends that the expert report is insufficient because it contains an inadequate discussion of routes of exposure.it says the expert panel report,while referring to the routes of administration used in the rat studies,contains no discussion of whether those routes of administration,and the resulting high doses achieved,were relevant to potential human exposures to didp.we do not agree.as we have said,the expert panel expressly found that h umans may be exposed to didp by oral routes of exposure and consumer exposure to didp occurs primarily by oral and dermal routes.further,it found that d irect exposure may occur through food as a result of uptake by food animals,certain vegetables,and migration of didp from food packaging.thus,the expert report contains express support for its conclusion that the rodent studies on which it relied,in which the animals were dosed orally by gavage or in the feed,were relevant to humans.
exxon further contends the expert panel also did not discuss the relationship of the routes of administration to didp physical properties for purposes of expected human exposure.neither ntp nor the expert panel discussed or even acknowledged didp high molecular weight or low vapor pressure,volatility,and water solubility in the context of potential human exposure.citation to record.nor did they address how these properties naturally limit the amount of didp that can enter the human body,or whether the oral routes of administration in the rat the high doses relevant to potential human exposures to didp.
we do not agree that the expert report was required to discuss these factors.as oehha notes,while these factors are relevant to didp water solubility,they are irrelevant to its fat solubility or its ability to contaminate food.see discussion,part,post.since the rat studies cited in the expert report relied on dissolving didp in oil or mixing it with the animals feed,didp low water solubility does not appear to be relevant to the expert panel conclusions.
oehha did not abuse its discretion by finding substantial evidence that the scientific record before ntp satisfied the proposition criteria 
exxon contends that oehha abused its discretion by concluding,on the basis of the scientific record before ntp,that there was substantial evidence that the criteria identified in regulation g had been satisfied,subd.i.specifically,exxon urges that oehha applied an incorrect standard under which findings in experimental animals alone will trigger a listing and oehha disregarded as not relevant factors that must be considered for an authoritative body listing.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
oehha did not abuse its discretion by basing its listing decision on experimental animal data 
exxon urges that oehha abused its discretion by basing its listing decision solely on data derived from experimental animal studies.according to exxon,if regulation g could be satisfied based solely on animal findings,the bar would be lower ed for authoritative body listings because experimental animal studies are designed to show adverse effects in laboratory animals citation,the consequence of oehha interpretation is that virtually any chemical tested in animals would trigger a listing under regulation g,even if the authoritative body never discussed the relevance of the animal findings to humans i t is not hard to see how this standard could lead to the very unrestrained listing of chemicals that regulation g was designed to prevent.
we do not agree with exxon that oehha finding of substantial evidence based on an extrapolation to humans from experimental animal studies was an abuse of discretion.as noted above,regulation expressly permits a finding of reproductive toxicity to be based on experimental animal studies,so long as the studies indicate that there are sufficient data indicating that an association between adverse reproductive effects in humans and the toxic agent in question is biologically plausible,subd.g.nothing in the regulation thus precludes oehha from concluding that there is substantial evidence of biological plausibility based solely on animal the contrary,the regulation appears to contemplate extrapolation from animal studies to humans.
further,there is support in the record for oehha assertion that it is a generally accepted toxicological assumption that,absent evidence to the contrary,a chemical that causes developmental harm in experimental animals
