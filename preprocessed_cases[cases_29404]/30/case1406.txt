in,the epa revised the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone from a standard to an standard.these consolidated petitions for review challenge aspects of the final rule to implement the ozone national ambient air quality.phase rule,and phase of the final rule to implement the ozone national ambient air quality of reconsideration.reconsideration notice.we hold the phase rule is inconsistent with the clean air act caa or act in allowing participation in a regional program to satisfy an statutory mandate.we further hold the epa arbitrarily eliminated one safeguard and violated the provision of the act insofar as it eliminated another from its regulations governing review of new sources of pollution.we therefore grant the petitions with respect to those aspects of the phase rule.in view of our decision in north carolina epa,in which we granted a petition for review of the clean air interstate rule cair,we defer consideration of the phase rule and reconsideration notice insofar as they relate to the cair program.we deny the petitions in all other respects.
background 
the act requires the epa to designate areas as attainment,nonattainment,or unclassifiable for each naaqs.caa d b,d b.states have primary responsibility for implementing those standards,and must submit a state implementation plan sip that specifies how the state will achieve and maintain compliance with the naaqs.id.a.part d of the act provides the sip for a nonattainment area must include certain control measures.id.et.subpart applies to all nonattainment areas,id,whereas subpart specifies additional requirements for ozone nonattainment areas,id.section of the act classifies ozone nonattainment areas from marginal to extreme based upon the degree to which the ozone level in the area exceeds the naaqs.id.an area that exceeds the naaqs by a greater margin is given more time to meet the standard but is subjected to progressively more stringent emissions controls for ozone precursors,namely,volatile organic compounds vocs and oxides of nitrogen nox.see caa.
in,the epa determined the naaqs for ozone,expressed as the amount of ozone in the ambient air averaged over one hour,was inadequate to protect public health.the epa therefore promulgated a new naaqs of ppm of ozone averaged over eight hours.under the standard,some ozone nonattainment areas are subject only to the more flexible requirements of subpart,while areas with higher levels of ozone are subject to the additional requirements of subpart.see coast air quality mgmt.dist.epa.
the epa implemented the naaqs in two phases the phase rule and reconsideration notice here under review implement the requirements of subpart and subpart for areas not attaining the naaqs.the consolidated petitions challenge those rules as follows.the natural resources defense council,the states of new jersey,connecticut,and new york,and the national petrochemical and refiners association challenge provisions implementing the statutory requirement that each nonattainment area provide for such emissions reductions as may be obtained by the adoption of reasonably available control technology ract.the nrdc and new jersey challenge provisions governing review of new sources of pollution.the nrdc also challenges two provisions implementing the statutory requirements that a sip for a nonattainment area provide for specific percentage reductions in emissions and for contingency measures.finally,the chamber of greater baton rouge and affiliated petitioners challenge the imposition of reformulated gasoline requirements in the baton rouge area.
we review the epa interpretation of the act pursuant to chevron natural res.def.council,d we ask first whether the congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if so,then we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,then we defer to the epa interpretation as long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.the act requires us to review the phase rule deferentially to determine only whether it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.caa d a,d a see bluewater network epa,we give particular deference to the epa when it acts under unwieldy and statutory schemes like the clean air act internal quotation marks omitted.
ii.reasonably available control technology 
section c of the act requires that the sips for nonattainment areas provide for the implementation of all reasonably available control measures as expeditiously as practicable including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption,at a minimum,of reasonably available control technology.c emphasis added.ozone nonattainment areas that are subject to subpart of part d are subject to more specific reasonably available control technology requirements,id.b c id.f.petitioners challenge three aspects of the implementation of the ract requirement in the phase rule.first,the nrdc challenges the rule providing that ract is satisfied for subpart areas by sips demonstrating that the area has adopted all control measures necessary to demonstrate attainment as expeditiously as possible,phase rule.at codified at c.second,the state of new jersey challenges the epa decision to allow states to meet the ract requirement under the naaqs by certifying that ract is met under the naaqs,see id.at.third,the nrdc,new jersey,the states of connecticut and new york,and the national petrochemical and refiners association challenge the epa conclusion that states may satisfy the ract requirement by participating in two programs,the nox sip call and cair,see id.the court has stayed consideration of the determination 
ract in subpart nonattainment areas 
the nrdc challenges the phase rule treatment of the reasonably available control technology requirement of caa c,c.under the phase rule,nonattainment areas governed by subpart that request an attainment deadline within five years of their designation shall meet the ract requirement by submitting an attainment demonstration sip demonstrating that the area has adopted all control measures necessary to demonstrate attainment as expeditiously as practicable.phase rule.at codified at c.the nrdc contends that this provision is an unlawful waiver of the ract requirement of c because,under the phase rule,a state need not require ract at all in such areas.it views the statutory phrase at a minimum as imposing an unambiguous requirement for all nonattainment areas.the nrdc thus contends the phase rule violates the plain text of c by doing away with this requirement in some nonattainment areas.however,we conclude that the term reasonably available control technology is ambiguous in context and that the epa interpretation is reasonable.
the court has previously concluded that the term reasonably available in the analogous phrase reasonably available control measure racm in c is ambiguous and clearly bespeaks the congress intention that the epa exercise discretion in determining which control measures must be implemented sierra club epa.the court explained that the statute did not specify which control measures would be deemed reasonably available and did not compel a state to consider whether any measure is reasonably available without regard to whether it would expedite attainment in the relevant area.id.at.thus,the epa had discretion to conclude that a measure was not reasonably available if it would not expedite attainment.id.because the same is true of the phrase reasonably available control technology,the term reasonably available within ract is also ambiguous.moreover,even if the phrase at a minimum requires that at least reductions be achieved in all nonattainment areas,the phrase does not specify the content of the ract requirement.given this ambiguity,the epa has discretion reasonably to define the controls that will demonstrate compliance.
the epa interpretation,construing reasonably available as meaning only control technologies that advance attainment,is reasonable in light of the statute accompanying text and structure.section c requires all nonattainment areas to achieve racm as expeditiously as practicable including such reductions as may be obtained through the adoption,at a minimum,of reasonably available control technology c.to the extent an area is already achieving attainment as expeditiously as possible,imposition of additional control technologies would not hasten achievement of the naaqs.in such a situation,the epa may reasonably conclude that no control technologies are reasonably available and the area need not implement further technologies to satisfy the ract requirement.sierra club epa,supports the reasonableness of the epa interpretation.in sierra club,the court held reasonable the epa interpretation of racm as requiring only those control measures that would contribute to timely and expeditious attainment.at see also sierra club epa,cir.the court explained,in part,that the act use s the same terminology in conjunction with the racm requirement as it does in requiring timely attainment.sierra club,at.the c racm requirement,like the timely attainment requirement of caa a,a,requires implementation of racm as expeditiously as practicable.thus,the court concluded,the racm requirement could reasonably be understood as a means of meeting the attainment deadline.at.because the ract requirement is located in a parenthetical modifying racm and because the racm requirement is described as including the ract requirement,the ract requirement is likewise linked to the timely attainment terminology.given this textual linkage,the epa may reasonably extend to the ract requirement its interpretation of racm as requiring only those control measures that would facilitate expeditious attainment of the naaqs.
contrary to the nrdc arguments,the ract requirement does not lose all meaning under the epa definition.when control technology is necessary to advance attainment,it is reasonably available under the definition and would be required under the rule.the fact that the ract requirement was previously located in a separate section and not in a parenthetical modifying the racm requirement does not support the nrdc position.compare caa b,b,with caa c,c.rather,the fact that the congress moved the requirement to a parenthetical modifying the racm requirement supports the epa conclusion that the ract requirement could be interpreted in the same manner as the racm requirement.although both the nrdc and the epa point to legislative history purportedly supporting their positions,neither points to legislative history bearing on the meaning of reasonably available.see,reprinted in legislative history of the clean air act amendments of,at.the term reasonably available is ambiguous,and the epa interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute.
certifying ract based upon ract 
the phase rule provides that a control measure approved as ract under the standard will be approved as ract under the standard absent information indicating it should not be approved.phase rule.at.rather than reassessing what constitutes ract,a state can certify that controls that previously satisfied the ract requirement also satisfy the requirement under the standard.new jersey contends this provision is contrary to the act and arbitrary and capricious.in new jersey view the epa should require a for all sources,not just those for which no controls had been considered ract under the standard,see id.at,because what is reasonably available changes over time.without a,new jersey maintains there is no basis for states to certify that the initial ract analysis meets the ract requirement under the naaqs and states may apply outdated ract controls.new jersey thus claims that the epa should have either updated its ract guidance documents or at least provided uniform criteria for states to use in making ract certifications.
the epa promulgates two types of guidance that assist states in determining what control techniques meet the ract requirement,control techniques guidelines ctgs and alternative control techniques acts.section of the act requires the epa to issue ctgs for certain categories of sources that emit vocs.see.where ctgs exist,they establish the presumptive level of control meeting ract.phase rule.at.still,states can opt to require alternative controls rather than following the guidance in the ctgs.notice of final determination and availability of final control techniques guidelines.section c of the act requires the epa to issue acts for major sources of vocs and nox.c.the acts describe available control techniques and their cost effectiveness but do not establish presumptive ract.phase rule.at.thus,neither the ctgs nor acts set firm ract requirements.
despite new jersey concerns,the epa certification provision does not conflict with the act and is not arbitrary and capricious.although the epa did not revise the guidance documents,the epa approach adequately ensures that ract determinations will take into account advances in technology.first,the epa has directed states to consider available information in addition to the ctg and act documents when making ract determinations.id.at.if a state is presented with information indicating that a previous ract determination is inappropriate,the state must consider that information and modify its ract determinations accordingly.id.second,when submitting ract certifications to the epa as part of their ract sip submissions,states must provide supporting information.id.at.third,if additional information is presented during rulemaking,both the state and the epa are required to consider that information as part of the rulemaking this includes information presented during rulemaking for ract sip submissions for previously controlled sources.id.because the epa could reasonably conclude that these mechanisms will ensure the determinations will take into account advances in technology,the epa could also reasonably conclude that the best way to address the possibility that ctgs or acts might not reflect all currently available technologies was by requiring each state to consider any new available information in making its certification,which will then be reviewed by the epa as part of the sip submission process,epa br.at see also phase rule.at.see wildlife fed epa.likewise,given the assurances that ract determinations will reflect advances in technology,the epa approach is consistent with the statutory goal of timely attainment of the naaqs,see caa.
additionally,even if the epa had revised the national guidelines and provided uniform criteria as new jersey preferred,such actions would not have eliminated inquiries by the states and the epa.both the ctgs and acts are guidance documents,see.fund for the env t epa,cir united states ford motor,and neither sets firm ract requirements.thus,despite the existence of the ctgs,the epa makes determinations as part of its sip approval process.notice of final determination and availability of final control techniques guidelines.at.acts are also merely guidelines and do not create presumptive ract levels.phase rule.at.as determinations would be necessary even if the epa had revised the guidance documents,the epa could reasonably determine that the costs entailed in revising the guidance documents outweighed the benefits.the epa has discretion to consider the costs of regulation unless the relevant statute precludes such a consideration.see,sierra club,at.
the epa approach also addresses new jersey concern that allowing states to make ract determinations by relying on ctgs plus new information,if any,provided by the public in comments is an inadequate substitute for requiring each state to undertake a new ract determination for each source category.as noted,the epa has directed states to submit supporting documentation along with ract certifications.phase rule.at.thus,the epa will have available the information needed to verify states determinations that the previous controls are still appropriate under the standard.additionally,persons disagreeing with a particular ract certification can seek judicial review of a particular sip approval.a state may also complete an entirely new ract analysis if it so chooses.id.at.
in sum,we hold that the epa decision to forego a revision of the nationwide guidelines in favor of ract certifications was reasonable and not inconsistent with the statutory goal of expeditious attainment.because the phase rule requires each state to verify that ract controls still satisfy the ract requirement,we need not address the epa assertion that a new ract determination will likely result in the same or similar control technology as the initial ract determination under the standard because the fundamental control techniques are still applicable.id.at.the epa did not rest the rule upon this ground each state must consider new information information that may prove the epa the state determines whether controls still represent an appropriate ract level of control.id.at.
meeting ract via nox sip call 
the nox sip call is a program that regulates nox emissions.the program covers states in the northeast and the district of columbia,and was intended to address the interstate transport of ozone.see generally final rule,finding of significant contribution and rulemaking for certain states in the ozone transport assessment group region for purposes of reducing regional transport of ozone,michigan epa.the nox sip call established for each state a nox emissions budget,which limits total emissions during the ozone season.phase rule.at.the epa also adopted a rule allowing interstate trading of emissions allowances,and all states covered by the nox sip call elected to participate in the interstate program.thus,a source within a state could meet its emissions target either by installing controls or by purchasing allowances from other sources located anywhere in the region covered by the nox sip call.see id.
the phase rule provides that to meet the nox ract requirement,the state need not perform or submit a nox ract analysis for sources subject to the state emission program where that program meets the nox sip call requirements or,in states achieving cair reductions solely from electricity generating units,cair requirements.id.at.petitioners and intervenors persuasively challenge this provision as being contrary to the express terms of the statute.
section c of the act requires that nonattainment areas achieve such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as can be achieved by the adoption of ract.c.thus,the ract requirement calls for reductions in emissions from sources in the area reductions from sources outside the nonattainment area do not satisfy the requirement.see see also caa b,b requiring implementation of ract with respect to certain voc sources in the area for moderate and above nonattainment areas.accordingly,participation in the nox sip call could constitute ract only if participation entailed at least reductions in emissions from sources within the nonattainment area.in the preamble to the proposed rule the epa stated that the overall emission reductions from sources in the nox sip call program will achieve more emissions reductions in the nonattainment area than would application of ract to each of those units,proposed rule to implement the ozone national ambient air quality standard,june,proposed rule.the preamble to the final rule does not go as far.rather,the final preamble states only that the nox sip call is estimated to achieve a degree of control regionally,phase rule.at.such regionwide reductions in emissions do not meet the statutory requirement that the reductions be from sources in the nonattainment area.because the epa has not shown that nox sip call compliance will result in at least reductions in emissions from sources within each nonattainment area,the epa determination that compliance with the nox sip call satisfies the ract requirement is inconsistent with the in the area requirement and thus violates the plain text of c.
in an analogous situation,the court invalidated the cair trading program because the epa regionwide approach made it impossible to tell whether the rule achieved a specific statutory objective.see north carolina epa.in developing cair,the court explained,the epa did not purport to measure each state significant contribution to specific downwind nonattainment areas and eliminate them in an isolated manner.id.at.despite a statutory provision prohibiting sources within the state from contributing significantly to nonattainment in any other state,caa a d,a d,the epa adopted a regionwide approach to the problem.the court therefore held that the epa was not exercising its statutory duty,reasoning that i t is unclear how epa can assure that the trading programs will achieve section a d i i goals if we do not know what each upwind state significant contribution is to another state.at.similar reasoning applies to the nox sip call.the epa has not provided assurance that the nox sip call will achieve the act goal of reductions from existing sources in the area,because it has not evaluated the effect of the program on each nonattainment area.
the epa responds that its approach gives meaning to the statute in the area language because its technical analysis shows that the programs achieve greater reductions than would the application of controls at each source.epa br.at.however,the epa cited support for this proposition is the statement from the preamble to the proposed rule stating the epa believes participation would achieve more emissions reductions in the nonattainment area than would application of ract to all sources in the area.proposed rule.at.that statement is unsupported by any record evidence and it does not appear in the preamble to the final rule.the epa further response that its technical analysis supports the conclusion that nox sip call participation meets the ract requirement is no more persuasive.the epa explains that its analysis showed that sources subject to the nox sip call collectively would achieve reductions in emissions.epa br.at.but regionwide reductions do not satisfy the in the area requirement.the epa explains further that it found that purchasing allowances was more costly than installing control technology and thus most sources meeting the nox sip call,assuming rational economic behavior,would opt to install controls rather than purchase allowances.this bare assertion is insufficient to demonstrate that nox sip call compliance would lead to reductions from sources in the area.even if most sources in a nonattainment area installed controls rather than purchasing allowances,a small number of sources purchasing allowances and increasing emissions could mean that overall emissions from sources in the area remained unchanged or even increased.
the epa attempt to show ambiguity in the act is likewise unavailing.the epa maintains the statute is ambiguous as to whether ract must be installed at each source in an area,noting that it has previously approved the concept of averaging emissions within a nonattainment area.the epa reads the statutory phrase as may be obtained to indicate that the ract requirement does not necessarily call for implementation of controls at each and every source,but rather requires an area to achieve at least reductions in emissions.even if the ract requirement could be met through an approach within a nonattainment area,averaging emissions across a region does not ensure that any reductions in emissions derive from reductions at sources within a particular area.even if the epa were correct that nothing in the statute precludes consideration of the air quality impact that controls under a program may have on nox within the nonattainment area,epa br.at,the epa has not considered the impact of the nox sip call on the air quality within specific nonattainment areas.therefore the epa has failed to demonstrate that nox sip call compliance can be equated to ract compliance.
the epa reliance on c is misplaced.that section provides that sips must include enforceable emission limitations,and such other control measures including economic incentives such as auctions of emission rights as may be necessary or appropriate to provide for attainment.c.the epa offers that its approach to ract is consistent with this express authorization of auctions.however,c merely authorizes the epa to approve measures in addition to those controls that are required by caa c,including the ract requirement it does not authorize the epa to replace the ract requirement with a program as is promulgated in the phase rule.
the epa also offers that to the extent individual sources emitting high levels of nox are in compliance with the nox sip call through the purchase of allowances,the states can define ract to require greater reductions than are required by the epa,and they must require reductions as necessary to achieve timely attainment.the epa determination that nox sip call compliance satisfies the ract requirement is not based on a state choosing to so exercise its discretion.a state decision to require stricter controls can not eliminate the defect in the epa to implement the requirement of at least reductions in emissions from sources in the nonattainment area.this part of the phase rule must therefore be remanded without vacatur because the epa may be able to reinstate the provision for most nonattainment areas if,upon conducting a technical analysis,it finds the nox sip call results in greater emissions reductions in a nonattainment area than would be achieved if controls were installed in that area.
iii.clean data policy 
under the act,each nonattainment area must attain the naaqs by a deadline,known as the attainment date,which is established by the statute itself for areas subject to subparts and,see caa,and by the epa for areas subject only to subpart,see caa,a.the act also provides that the sip for a nonattainment area subject only to subpart must require reasonable further progress rfp,id.c the sip for an area in moderate or a greater degree of nonattainment must provide for fixed percentage reductions of vocs on a specified schedule.caa b a,c b,b a,c b 
in order to ensure these requirements are met,the sip for any nonattainment area must include contingency measures to be implemented if the area fails to make reasonable further progress,or to attain the naaqs by the attainment date,caa c,c,and the sip for a serious,severe,or extreme nonattainment area must also include contingency measures that will take effect automatically if the area fails to meet any applicable milestone,caa c,c.
in the phase rule,the epa suspended the planning requirements for specified percentage reductions and contingency measures for each nonattainment area that has attained the naaqs but has not yet been designated an attainment area.the suspension lasts until the area is redesignated to attainment,at which time the requirements no longer apply or until the epa determines that the area has violated the ozone naaqs.id.the epa terms this suspension the clean data policy.at,because it applies when a nonattainment area produces clean air quality data.see memorandum from john seitz,office of air quality planning standards,rfp,attainment demonstration,and related requirements for ozone nonattainment areas meeting the ozone national ambient air quality standard,at may,www.epa.gov ttn oarpg t memoranda clean.pdf.it adopted the current version of the policy in and applied it in rulemakings specific to individual areas under the naaqs it will similarly determine whether individual areas qualify for the suspension in rulemakings.at.
the nrdc contends the clean data policy conflicts with both the letter and the purpose of the act.more specifically,the nrdc argues the statutory provisions requiring a sip to include contingency measures and percentage reductions allow no waivers for an area that has achieved the naaqs the only way for an area to be absolved of those requirements is to be redesignated an attainment area.see caa c,c until a maintenance plan revision is approved and an area is redesignated as attainment the requirements of part d shall continue in force and effect.further,the nrdc argues only its reading of the text is consistent with the intent of the congress that,in order to ensure the air stays clean,no mandatory control requirement be lifted until a maintenance plan is in place.
the epa responds first that the nrdc did not raise before the agency and therefore forfeited its objection to the suspension of the planning requirement for contingency measures.see caa d b,d b only an objection to a rule or procedure which was raised with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment may be raised during judicial review.we agree.we enforce this provision strictly,motor equip.mfrs.ass nichols,internal quotation marks omitted,and although we allow commenters some leeway in developing their argument before this court,the comment must have provided adequate notification of the general substance of the complaint,coast air quality mgmt.dist.epa.
the nrdc comments did not provide the epa adequate notice that it objected to the suspension of the contingency measures.the nrdc did object to the clean data policy,but only to the suspension of the requirements for an attainment demonstration and percentage reductions.the nrdc now contends it objected to the suspension of all subpart requirements,pointing to its comment that the epa can not authorize states to simply drop subpart measures when the area is meeting either standard.the act allows states to move mandated controls to a maintenance contingency plan,but only after the area has been redesignated to attainment.comments of clean air task force et,at.that comment,however,was made in the context of an objection to a different provision of the proposed rule,namely the epa determination that an area not attaining the standard but meeting the standard need not submit a maintenance plan meeting the requirements of caa.the epa can not be expected to take the nrdc argument,raised in support of one specific objection,and apply it sua sponte to another provision.because the nrdc did not raise its objection with reasonable specificity,the act bars us from considering it.caa d b,d b.
on the merits,the epa maintains the clean data policy does not waive the planning requirements for percentage reductions instead,it contends,those requirements are by their terms inapplicable when an area meets the applicable naaqs.see phase rule.at.
the two planning requirements for percentage reductions are caa b,which requires an initial reduction of of voc emissions in the first six years for an area in moderate or greater nonattainment,and c b,which requires subsequent reductions in voc emissions averaging per year for an area in serious or greater nonattainment unless an exception applies.see b,c b.as the epa interprets these provisions,specific percentage reductions are required only as necessary to achieve attainment.
we think the statute unclear as to whether those sections apply to an area that is already attaining the naaqs.for the reasons below,we join the tenth circuit in holding the epa interpretation is reasonable.see sierra club epa,cir.
section b a i initially requires the sip for an area in moderate or greater nonattainment to plan a total reduction in voc emissions of over six years.b a i.in the very next sentence,however,it elaborates that a plan should mandate such specific annual reductions as necessary to attain the naaqs for ozone by the attainment date.id.moreover,each percentage reduction is linked to the requirement that an area make reasonable further progress toward attainment.see id.b entitled plan provisions for reasonable further progress id.c b entitled reasonable further progress demonstration.reasonable further progress,in turn,means such annual incremental reductions in emissions as are required for the purpose of ensuring attainment.caa.the act is therefore ambiguous as to what reductions are required when no further progress toward attainment is,for that matter,possible.the epa reasonably resolved this ambiguity by concluding the specific percentage reductions are simply inapplicable in that circumstance.as the tenth circuit put the matter,if a moderate ozone nonattainment area has in fact already attained the ozone standard,it would make little sense to require a state to demonstrate the area will make reasonable progress toward attainment.sierra club,at.
the epa reasoning disposes as well of the nrdc contentions that the clean data policy unlawfully circumvents the redesignation requirements,caa d e,d e,violates the mandate that all part d requirements remain in force until an area has an approved maintenance plan in place,caa c,c,and disregards the supreme court admonition that the epa can not render subpart carefully designed restrictions on epa discretion utterly nugatory,whitman am.trucking ass ns,d.the clean data policy does not effect a redesignation an area must still comply with the statutory requirements before it can be redesignated to attainment.furthermore,part subpart in force insofar as it applies but,as we have just seen,the epa has reasonably concluded the provisions of the act requiring percentage reductions do not apply to an area that has attained the naaqs.
iv.voc reduction 
caa section b requires that,for a moderate nonattainment area,no later than years after november,the state shall submit a revision to the applicable implementation plan to provide for volatile organic compound emission reductions,within years after november,of at least percent from baseline emissions,accounting for any growth in emissions after.a b a i.caa section c,d and e incorporate the voc reduction requirement for,respectively,serious,severe and extreme nonattainment areas.id.a c e.after the initial period,caa section c,d and e impose on the same areas an additional rfp requirement that the sip be revised so that it will result in voc emissions reductions from the baseline emissions of at least percent of baseline emissions each year,averaged over each consecutive period beginning years after november,until the attainment date.id.a c b i imposing requirement on serious areas see id.d,e incorporating reduction requirement for severe and extreme areas as used in the cited provisions,the term baseline emissions means the total amount of actual voc or nox emissions from all anthropogenic sources in the area during the calendar year.caa b b,b b see also caa c b,c b 
in the phase rule,the epa determined that for all moderate and above areas that had not met the percent voc emission reduction requirement for the standard,the rfp reduction requirement would apply under the standard.at.conversely,the epa determined,moderate and above areas that had already satisfied the voc emission reduction for the standard will not be subjected a second time to the requirement under the standard.id.at.thus,a reas classified under subpart as moderate that had met the percent voc emission reduction requirement for the standard are treated in the final rule like areas covered under subpart,while a reas classified under subpart as serious and above that had met the percent voc emission reduction requirement for the standard would be subject to the rfp requirement in section e sic and the final rule would require them to obtain an average of percent annual reductions of voc nox emissions reductions for the first years after the baseline year and every subsequent years out to their attainment date.id.for both the and the reductions rfp requirements,the phase rule provides that the rfp periods would be equivalent to the periods congress established in subpart,id.at,running from a new baseline year,for areas designated nonattainment for the ozone naaqs with an effective date of june,id.at.
first,the nrdc argues that the epa illegally waived subpart rfp requirement that each sip be revised three years after the statute effective date to provide for a voc reduction within years after enactment for all areas classified as moderate and above for ozone 
as an initial matter,the epa did not waive the requirement but simply determined that,if a state had made the required revision for an area classified as moderate or greater when the naaqs took effect,the state did not have to do so a second time after the standard took effect.in so doing,the epa reasonably resolved a statutory ambiguity under step of the framework set out in chevron natural resources defense council,d.see natural res.def.council epa,under chevron we first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,in which case we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,however,we move to the second step and defer to the agency interpretation as long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.quoting chevron,at.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we reject the nrdc challenge to the voc reduction provision.
the nrdc contends that the epa reading of the statute is untenable because the statute requires that the sip provide for a reduction from baseline emissions which the epa itself defines for purposes of the ozone standard as emissions in,not and that the reduction be effected within years after the baseline is,between and for the standard.nrdc br.at.this argument,however,sidesteps the epa rationale for its interpretation.the epa identified a gap in the statutory scheme because t he caa is silent regarding whether a nonattainment area that implements the voc emission reduction of b a must implement that provision a second time if the naaqs is revised,or instead must implement other rfp provisions that expressly would have applied had there been no revision of the naaqs.epa br.at.the epa filled this gap by selecting the latter resolution.as the epa explained in the phase rule,while it believes that the caa is quite clear that the sip must provide for a percent reduction in baseline voc emissions for some period after in an area subject to section b a,it disagrees that the caa plainly requires that the sip for an area must require a second percent reduction in voc baseline emissions under a revised ozone standard.at first emphasis added see also id.at for those areas that have an approved percent plan for their ozone sips,an additional percent voc reduction is not necessary.because the epa ended its statutory analysis with the threshold inquiry whether section b a i must be applied a second time under its revised standards concluding it need not,the agency did not need to decide how to interpret the term baseline emissions or to identify a baseline year for the purpose of so applying the provision.further,because it had no need to reach these issues,it did not resolve them arbitrarily or capriciously,as the nrdc asserts,by allowing a select group of nonattainment areas to rely on a different baseline from the distant past.nrdc br.at.had the epa required a nonattainment area to undertake a second voc reduction,it might have been arbitrary to use a different baseline or baseline year from that applicable to areas undertaking the first voc reduction under the standard.but the agency did not do so and we will not speculate whether it could lawfully have done so.
the nrdc also argues that the epa approach is inconsistent with its treatment of section c b i reduction requirement for serious and above areas in that the epa does not read the act as excusing such continuing emission cuts for serious and above nonattainment areas merely because they may have had plans under the standard to achieve continuing cuts of yr from a baseline.nrdc br.at.the provision,however,is fundamentally different from the provision in that the former does not as does the latter establish a reduction requirement but instead imposes a continuing obligation that applies to each consecutive period beginning years after november,until the attainment date.caa c b,c b.
finally,the nrdc asserts that the epa can not override an express statutory command simply by asserting that its preferred approach would be better policy,nrdc br.at quoting engine mfrs.ass epa,referring to the epa observation that its approach provides flexibility to states to use a mix of nox and voc reductions under caa section,rather than the required reductions mandated by caa section b a,b a.at.as already explained,however,the epa interpretation does not override an express command but rather resolves an ambiguity.id.at.in commending the flexibility afforded,the epa merely offered one more reason why its interpretation of the ambiguous statutory language is reasonable.
new source offset credit for past emission reductions 
caa section b requires that each state containing a nonattainment area submit a nonattainment sip meeting the requirements of section c pursuant to a schedule set by the epa but not later than three years after a nonattainment area is so designated.b,c.section c of the act requires that each nonattainment area sip shall require permits for the construction and operation of new or modified major stationary sources anywhere in the nonattainment area,in accordance with section of title.id.c.section sets out the permitting process,known as new source review nsr,in greater detail,providing that a permit may be issued only if,inter alia,the permitting agency has determined that by the time the source begins operation,sufficient offsetting emissions reductions are obtained that the emission levels from the offsets and the plan provisions represent rfp from the levels,id.a a and the proposed source will comply with the lowest achievable emission rate laer,id.a section further requires that s uch emission reductions shall be,by the time a new or modified source commences operation,in effect and enforceable and shall assure that the total tonnage of increased emissions of the air pollutant from the new or modified source shall be offset by an equal or greater reduction,as applicable,in the actual emissions of such air pollutant from the same or other sources in the area.id.c.subpart specifically applies the nsr requirement to ozone nonattainment areas,caa a c i,a c i,and mandates increasingly stringent offset ratios as the ozone classification increases,caa a,b,d,a,b,d 
the phase rule allows proposed new and modified sources to meet this offset requirement using credits from sources that shut down or curtailed operations as long ago as.at to be codified at.the epa has long allowed emissions reductions occurring before a permit application to qualify as offset credits under specified circumstances.before,such emissions reductions could be offset only if the proposed source was a replacement for the productive capacity represented by the proposed offset credit.requirements for implementation plans air quality new source review,june,the rule eliminated this restriction for an area with an approved attainment demonstration.id.at.in the phase rule,the epa lift ed the requirement to have an approved attainment plan before using preapplication credits from shutdowns or curtailments as offsets.at.the nrdc challenges both the epa longstanding policy allowing reductions as nsr offsets and the epa elimination in the phase rulemaking of the approved attainment demonstration requirement.we reject as untimely the nrdc challenge to the general policy of allowing offset credits but we agree that eliminating the attainment demonstration requirement was arbitrary and capricious and therefore in violation of the apa.
caa section b,which governs judicial review of a rulemaking under the act,requires that a ny petition for review shall be filed within sixty days from the date notice of such promulgation appears in the federal register.b.as already noted,the epa has allowed emission reductions from source shutdowns and curtailments to qualify as nsr offset credits since at least.see.at.thus,the deadline for filing a petition for review of section a ii c insofar as it authorizes offset credits for emission reductions is long since past and the court lacks jurisdiction to review it.see motor equip.mfrs.ass nichols,section b filing period is jurisdictional in nature,and may not be enlarged or altered by the courts internal quotation marks omitted.nonetheless,the nrdc contends that the epa reopened the offset policy so as to make its challenge timely.we disagree.
the reopening doctrine allows an otherwise stale challenge to proceed because the agency opened the issue up anew,and then reexamined and reaffirmed its prior decision.p v enters.army corps of eng rs,quoting pub.citizen nuclear reg.comm n,internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,the epa did not expressly reopen the issue of offsets for emission reductions.in its proposed rule,the epa offered two alternative amendments to section a ii c,each of which eliminated the attainment demonstration requirement under certain circumstances.see prevention of significant deterioration psd and nonattainment new source review nsr,july,proposed rules.in the phase rule,the epa selected the less restrictive of the two alternatives neither alternative proposed changing the regulation insofar as it permits offset of emission reductions generally or even mentioned the matter.further,other than eliminating the approved attainment demonstration requirement,the language of amended section a c remains substantively identical to the regulation.compare.at a c as effective june,with.at a c as effective.accordingly,the subject of allowing offsets in general was not expressly reopened.see ass of reversionary prop.owners surface transp,when an agency invites debate on some aspects of a broad subject,it does not automatically reopen all related aspects including those already decided.
nor did the epa constructively reopen the issue,as the nrdc contends.under some circumstances an issue may be deemed to have been constructively reopened even though it was not actually reopened in a literal sense.kennecott utah copper dep t of interior.a constructive reopening occurs if the revision of accompanying regulations significantly alters the stakes of judicial review as the result of a change that could have not been reasonably anticipated.sierra club epa,quoting kennecott,at envtl.def.epa.the epa elimination of the attainment determination requirement did not work such a sea change.the basic regulatory scheme remains unchanged offsets are permitted if certain requirements are met.the only change is the elimination of the attainment demonstration was itself added in to replace the more stringent requirement that the proposed new source be a replacement for the shutdown or curtailment.a ii c alteration added see supra note.that the nrdc challenge to the change may have merit,as indeed we conclude infra,does not provide a ground to conclude that the broader issue of allowing any offsets at all has been reopened.it simply means the particular change it challenges is unlawful.the stakes here are not quantitatively different from what they were in when a coalition of environmental groups argued to the epa that the attainment demonstration requirement itself was inadequate to ensure rfp.see.at.yet no one then challenged the general policy allowing offsets.further,it could have been reasonably anticipated at that time that the epa might subsequently eliminate the attainment demonstration requirement itself in favor of an alternative safeguard which would likewise allow more liberal use of offset credits,as in fact happened here.in sum,the epa has done nothing since to reopen the general issue of allowing offsets either expressly or constructively.
we next address the nrdc objection to the specific nsr revision that is subject to review in this the epa erred in eliminating the attainment demonstration requirement.we agree with the nrdc that the epa acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it did so.
in the rulemaking,the epa imposed the approved attainment demonstration requirement in order to comply with caa section a,which allows an nsr permit to issue only if 
the permitting agency determines that 
a by the time the source is to commence operation,sufficient offsetting emissions reductions have been obtained,such that total allowable emissions from existing sources in the region,from new or modified sources which are not major emitting facilities,and from the proposed source will be sufficiently less than total emissions from existing sources allowed under the applicable implementation plan prior to the application for such permit to construct or modify so as to represent when considered together with the plan provisions required under section of this title reasonable further progress as defined in section of this title 
a a.the epa concluded that the essence of this provision is that a new source may be allowed in a nonattainment area only where its presence would be consistent with rfp toward attainment of the naaqs and that this policy is satisfied if there is in place for the area a fully approved sip since,b y definition,any fully approved sip has independently assured rfp and attainment.at.w here an attainment demonstration is lacking,however,the epa concluded that retention of the current shutdown credit restriction on offset transactions that is,for a shutdown,the proposed source is a replacement for the productive capacity represented by the proposed offset,id.at is necessary both to assure rfp and to guarantee that a new source does not cause or contribute to a violation of the naaqs.id.at.nonetheless,when the epa amended section a c in the phase rule,it eliminated the sip requirement without adding any other safeguard to ensure that issuing a particular permit is consistent with caa section mandate that total reductions represent reasonable further progress.a a.the epa justified eliminating the requirement on the ground that the amendments to the act changed the considerations involved in that they emphasized the emission inventory requirement in section c as a fundamental tool in air quality planning and added new provisions keyed to the inventory requirement,including specific reduction strategies and milestones that measure progress toward attainment from the base year emissions inventory or subsequent revised inventories along with several adverse consequences where states fail to meet the planning or emissions reductions requirements.at see also reconsideration notice.at.but imposing post hoc sanctions for failing to achieve rfp milestones does not accomplish what caa section requires,namely,that the epa ensure that by the time the source is to commence operation,sufficient offsetting emissions reductions have been obtained to produce rfp,a a emphasis added.because the epa has not explained how the amended rule,stripped of the approved attainment demonstration requirement,ensures that emission reductions are achieved by the time the new source begins operation rather than sometime down the road after milestones have been missed,we conclude that eliminating the requirement is arbitrary and capricious.see baja pipeline,llc ferc,under arbitrary and capricious standard,agency conclusions must be reasonable and reasonably explained citing fuel gas supply ferc,transactive united states,in order to ensure that an agency decision has not been arbitrary,we require the agency to have identified and explained the reasoned basis for its decision.citing vollmer higgins,treasury employees union horner,
vi.nsr limits on pollution from new and modified major sources 
pursuant to the sip nsr requirements of caa part d,supra,the phase rule accords a state three years to develop and submit an approvable nonattainment major nsr program for the naaqs.at.in addition to the part d requirements for nonattainment areas,however,caa section a c imposes on states a general duty to implement a nsr program in their sips for all areas,see supra note,which exists during all periods,including before a state has an approved part d nsr permit program.id.at.although section a c requires that the sip contain nsr provisions,it does not specify what nsr requirements apply during the period after an area is designated nonattainment but before the nsr sip is effective.to fill this gap,the epa decided in the phase rule to retain an interim nsr regime it has used for this purpose since,namely,appendix s to part,which both establishes interim nsr permitting requirements paralleling the act in section and provides for an exemption from the same requirements under certain circumstances in section vi.the epa further decided in the phase rule,however,to eliminate an existing time limit on the applicability of appendix s including section vi exemption provision to a given nonattaiment area.petitioners nrdc and new jersey challenge both the epa general authority to exempt new sources from permitting requirements under section vi and,more specifically,its decision to eliminate the limit on such exemptions.we reject the petitioners objection to the epa general exemption authority as untimely but agree that eliminating the limit violates the provision in caa section e,e.
in,the epa codified in its regulations a three emission offset interpretative ruling as appendix s to part and directed that appendix s was to govern permits to construct and operate applied for before the deadline for having a revised sip in effect that satisfies part approval and promulgation of implementation plans statutory restriction on new sources under certain circumstances for nonattainment areas,july,codified at c now k see emission offset interpretative ruling,codifying interpretive ruling in regulations.in so applying the interpretive rule,the epa allowed a nonattainment area to avoid,during the period before the sip was due,the statutory ban on all major source construction or modification in any nonattainment area not subject to a sip that me t the requirements of part d relating to nonattainment areas.see clean air act amendments of,b,stat,establishing construction ban caa amendments.the epa noted at the time that the congress had similarly adopted the rule as may be modified by rule of the administrator to govern nsr during the interim period from enactment of the caa amendments until july,when the statutory ban was to take effect.at caa amendments a,stat.at adopting interpretive rule for interim before ban.the congress eliminated the construction ban in.clean air act,amendments,c,stat.
in,the epa clarif ied appendix s to limit to eighteen months the period during which it governed nsr in a qualifying nonattainment area.approval and promulgation of implementation plans statutory restriction on new sources under certain circumstances for nonattainment areas.since that time the epa has continued to apply appendix s nsr requirements in the interim after an area nonattainment designation and before implementation of a revised sip.thus,after the congress amended the act in,inter alia,subpart epa again affirmed its policy that appendix s govern during the period between nonattainment designation and sip approval and implementation.see state implementation plans general preamble for the implementation of title i of the clean air act amendments of supplemental.
since appendix s was formally codified in,section vi thereof has exemption from section permitting requirements for an area whose attainment date had not passed if the source satisfied two conditions 
in such cases,a new source which would cause or contribute to an naaqs violation may be exempt from the conditions of section.so long as the new source.meets the applicable sip emission limitations and.will not interfere with the attainment date specified in the sip under section of the act.
at codified at appendix s,vi pt,app,vi same.in the phase rule,the epa added a third condition so that the reformulated provision now exempts new sources from the permitting requirements in section if the conditions in paragraphs through c are met,namely 
a.the new source meets the applicable sip emission limitations.
b.the new source will not interfere with the attainment date specified in the sip under section of the act.
c.the administrator has determined that conditions a and b of this section are satisfied and such determination is published in the federal register.
at codified at pt,app,vi.the epa further eliminated the limit on the applicability of appendix s including section vi to a nonattainment area.at see k.
as noted above,petitioners nrdc and new jersey challenge the epa authority generally to exempt an area from appendix s permitting requirements and specifically the epa removal of the limit.we address each in turn.
first,we consider the general challenge to the epa exemption authority and conclude that it is.under caa section b,any objection to the exemption policy was required to be raised in a petition for review filed within sixty days from the date notice of its promulgation appears in the federal register,b.in this case the triggering date was july,when the epa published its final rule promulgating c now k,which directed that t he emission offset interpretative ruling,cfr part,appendix s which,as then codified,contained the exemption provision in section vi.at governs permits to construct and operate applied for before the deadline for having a revised sip in effect that satisfies part.at codified at c now k.it was on that date that the epa unequivocally asserted its authority to exempt new sources from permitting requirements under section vi.thus,the petitioners challenge to such authority in this case comes almost thirty years late and we are precluded from considering it.see motor equip.mfrs.ass n,at.nonetheless,the petitioners again as with the emission offset authority issue treated supra seek to circumvent the statutory time limit by invoking the reopening doctrine.once again their attempt is unavailing.
the petitioners contend the epa implicitly reopened the question of its exemption authority because during the rulemaking,the agency sought comment on an alternative exemption proposal which it subsequently declined to adopt.see edison inst.epa,by soliciting comments on the existing regulations and advancing a possible alternative approach,the epa clearly provided the type of opportunity for renewed comment and objection that suffices to restart the statutory period for seeking review.quoting ohio epa.specifically,the petitioners argue that the epa reopened the question of its exemption authority when it proposed to remove the general waiver language from appendix s entirely,and replace it with a transitional program that would only allow relief from nsr in a limited group of areas that,among other things,submitted plans by adequate to attain standards by a proposal the epa subsequently declined to adopt.nrdc br.at citing.at emphases in brief.as the petitioners characterization demonstrates,however,the epa reopened only the question of how broadly it should exercise its exemption authority and not whether it had such authority in the first place.the abandoned proposal would have replaced section vi exemption provisions with a transitional program,which would,like section vi,provide exemptions from section nsr requirements but would allow the exemptions for a narrower class of eligible areas.see proposed rule to implement the ozone national ambient air quality standard,june,setting out eligibility requirements for transitional program.thus,the epa alternative proposal did not implicitly reopen the question of its statutory authority vel non to grant any nsr exemptions but only whether section vi as previously applied might violate the act by making exemptions too broadly available.because the epa did not seek comment on its general authority to exempt areas from the permitting requirements,this case is plainly distinguishable from edison electric institute,in which the epa explicitly invited comments on the precise question for which petitioners there sought review.edison,at.accordingly,we conclude that the issue of the epa general exemption authority is foreclosed under caa section b,b.
the petitioners also argue that the epa constructively reopened the entire exemption provision by dramatically expanding its scope and effect when it eliminated the limit on section vi exemptions.nrdc br.at citing kennecott,at see also nrdc reply br.at.the extension of the exemption term,however,did not significantly alter the stakes of judicial review as the result of a change that could have not been reasonably anticipated.sierra club epa,at quoting kennecott,at envtl,at.in fact,when first codified in,the interpretive ruling lacked such a its general exemption authority went unchallenged.further,an exemption from nsr for even months,if unlawful,seems worth challenging in its own it could have been when the limit was added in.to the extent that the epa removal of the limit extends the exemption period,the extension is subject to direct challenge in this proceeding and we next address the petitioners challenge thereto.
the petitioners contend that the epa elimination of the limit on nsr exemptions violates caa section e,the act provision.section e provides that if the epa relaxes a national primary ambient air quality standard,it must promulgate requirements applicable to all areas which have not attained that standard as of the date of such relaxation which shall provide for controls which are not less stringent than the controls applicable to areas designated nonattainment before such relaxation.e.although section e expressly applies only when the epa relaxes a naaqs,the epa has interpreted the language to also apply when it strengthens a it did when it adopted the ozone that if congress intended areas to remain subject to the same level of control where a naaqs was relaxed,they also intended that such controls not be weakened where the naaqs is made more stringent.final rule to implement the ozone national ambient air quality,phase rule.in south coast air quality management district epa,we upheld this interpretation,id.at,and also concluded that nsr is a control subject to section e backsliding prohibition,id.at.accordingly,the epa elimination of the exemption limit violates section e if the resulting nsr requirement is less stringent than the existing requirement.insofar as appendix s now provides for waiver of nsr for an unlimited time pending sip approval,it is plainly less stringent than the previous version which limited an nsr waiver to an term.as the petitioners argue,the epa revision could delay implementing nsr controls in eligible nonattainment areas for years beyond the previous limit.accordingly,we conclude that the revision constitutes backsliding in violation of section e.
the epa offers three defenses of its revision.first,because the epa established the time limit to allow a nonattainment area a reasonable time to develop a sip before the statutory construction ban applied,see.at,the epa contends that it reasonably removed the limitation after the congress repealed the new source construction ban in.the epa might have done so but for section e unequivocal backsliding constraint,which plainly prohibits a less stringent nsr what the revision produced.second,the epa asserts there is no basis to speculate that it will grant waivers for the entire period before sip approval because it would be highly disinclined to grant a waiver where the sip submission deadline has passed and epa had not received the required submission.epa br.at quoting.at.we do not speculate,however,in concluding that,notwithstanding the epa promised discretionary restraint,the revised section vi will produce some waivers lasting beyond the previously prescribed period and thus impose a control less stringent than before.this result contravenes section e.nor are we persuaded by the epa third argument,that the revision new,third that the epa determine that the existing two satisfaction of applicable sip emission limitations and with sip attainment date have been met and publish the determination in the federal register tightened part vi requirements.epa br.at.the new simply formalized and made explicit what was already implicitly the epa find the existing two satisfied.thus,the additional produced no tightening effect on the contrary,it did nothing to counteract the indisputably relaxing effect of removing the limit.
vii.baton rouge reformulated gasoline requirement 
the chamber of greater baton rouge and affiliated petitioners chamber contend the epa arbitrarily and capriciously concluded that the baton rouge,louisiana area baton rouge is a covered area under caa section k,k,and therefore subject to a statutory ban on the sale to consumers of conventional gasoline we conclude that the epa correctly determined the statutory definition of covered area is ambiguous as to baton rouge under chevron step and that it reasonably resolved the ambiguity under chevron step.
caa section k authorizes the epa to promulgate regulations establishing requirements for reformulated gasoline to be used in vehicles in specified nonattainment areas.k.section k makes unlawful t he sale or dispensing by any person of conventional gasoline to ultimate consumers in any covered area necessitating the use of reformulated gasoline instead.id.k a.section k,in turn,designates as a covered area each of nine specific,high ozone areas and further provides effective one year after the reclassification of any ozone nonattainment area as a severe ozone nonattainment area under section b of this title,such severe area shall also be a covered area for purposes of this subsection.id.k d.
in,the epa classified baton rouge as a serious ozone nonattainment area under the standard.on april,the epa reclassified baton rouge as severe,effective june,pursuant to the provision,caa b,b,because baton rouge failed to reach attainment by its november,attainment date.notice of withdrawal of october,attainment date extension,determination of nonattainment as of november,and reclassification of the baton rouge ozone nonattainment area,effective june.at that time,the epa advised that under section k of the act the use of reformulated gasoline rfg will be required in the baton rouge area beginning one year from the effective date of this rule,that is,as of june.id.at.on april,the epa designated baton rouge as nonattainment under the standard and classified it as marginal,effective june.air quality designations and classifications for the ozone national ambient air quality standards early action compact areas with deferred effective dates.
the chamber filed a request for extension of the deadline to commence using rfg or waiver of the rfg requirement,which the epa denied in a letter dated may.the chamber then petitioned the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit for review of the denial and the fifth circuit stayed the rfg deadline on june.on august,the fifth circuit granted a joint motion to stay its proceedings pending the outcome of the administrative decision making process,with the rfg deadline stay to remain in effect during remand.city of baton rouge epa,cir.
in the phase rule,the epa concluded that an area such as baton rouge,which automatically became a covered area subject to the rfg requirement on the anniversary of its to severe,should remain subject to the rfg requirement notwithstanding its classification to a status under the standard and the subsequent revocation of the standard epa has determined that areas that lose their severe classification based solely on revocation of the naaqs should remain rfg covered areas at least until they are redesignated to attainment for the naaqs.at the epa concluded that section k d is ambiguous on the issue of whether a area continues to be a covered area when it is no longer classified as severe and that therefore epa has discretion to determine whether section k d authorizes removal of a area from the rfg program when it is no longer classified as severe,and to set appropriate criteria for such removal.id.the epa explained that it d id not believe that congress would have intended that removal of the severe classification based solely on revocation of the less protective naaqs should result in backsliding of the rfg requirement.id.the agency further found it instructive that if epa had never revised the naaqs,the area would continue to be a covered area at least until it was redesignated to attainment for the naaqs.id.accordingly,because h ere,the removal of the severe classification is through revocation of the naaqs,not through redesignation to attainment,the epa determined that the removal of the severe classification for these areas as a result of revocation of the standard should not lead to removal of the rfg requirement.id.the chamber offers three arguments against the epa interpretation.we address and reject each argument in turn.
first,the chamber contends that at chevron step baton rouge never became a covered area because the plain and unambiguous language of the statutory definition requires that a covered area be a severe area that remains severe one year after the reclassification,chamber br.at quoting caa k d,k d,that is,on june,on which date baton rouge was no longer a severe area as it had become a marginal area on june.the epa does not quibble with the chamber interpretation of the statutory language to require that the area remain classified as severe on the anniversary of the reclassification.see epa br.at o nce an area is reclassified as severe,the only other precondition to becoming covered is that the area remain in severe nonattainment status for one year.emphasis in original.the epa points out,however,that as of the anniversary of the,rouge was not only a marginal area under the standard but was also a severe area under the standard,which was not revoked until june,almost a year later.see phase rule.at we will revoke the standard in full,including the associated designations and classifications,year following the effective date of the designations for the naaqs.thus,the epa reasonably determined that under the plain language of the statute,baton rouge was a severe area as of june,and became a covered area on that date 
second,the chamber asserts at chevron step that even if the definition of covered area is ambiguous,the epa resolved the ambiguity unreasonably in two respects.the chamber first argues the epa improperly relied on the supreme court decision in whitman am.trucking ass ns,d.in support of its interpretation,the epa cited whitman caution against epa making subpart abruptly obsolete.at quoting whitman,at,observing that,a lthough the rfg requirement itself is not set forth in subpart,the requirement to use it in severe areas is tied directly to the classifications that arise by operation of subpart and therefore it would appear that the supreme court caution should be as relevant for rfg areas as it is for the subpart control obligations.id.notwithstanding the chamber contrary assertions,the epa reasonably determined that the inclusion of a area in the rfg program is integrally tied to the subpart provisions that establish the original classification and attainment date for an area and its later reclassification,which provisions cause an area to become a covered rfg area by operation of law.accordingly,the epa reasonably relied on whitman general admonition to preserve subpart to support the agency particular determination that the effects of the integrally connected provisions should remain intact following conversion to the standard.
the chamber also asserts the epa interpretation falters at chevron step because the agency unreasonably relied on the very same provisions it referred to in the phase rule at,which provisions,the chamber maintains,did not support the phase rule,nor do they support the imposition of rfg.chamber br.at citing.at.the chamber examines each of the statutes cited in the phase rule and asserts,correctly,that none of them directly relates to the rfg requirement.see id.at.the chamber makes too much,however,of the epa citation to the phase rule.the epa was simply referring readers f or further discussion of the reasoning behind provisions in the phase rule because the agency also relied on the rationale for its interpretation of the covered area definition in the phase rule see.at.
having rejected the chamber contrary arguments,we conclude that the epa statutory interpretation readily satisfies chevron step.in upholding the epa interpretation as reasonable,we,like the agency,find it instructive that but for the happenstance of the epa adoption of standards,the chamber would have no statutory basis to dispute that baton rouge is a covered rfg area under the mandatory and rfg provisions because baton rouge remained a severe area for one year following its classification as such.see.at quoted supra.
finally,the chamber contends the epa was arbitrary and capricious in not making a specific determination that rfg would protect the public health in baton rouge and asserts that in fact rfg will interfere with the area progress toward attainment,thereby harming the public health.the chamber first asserts that the epa was required by caa section b to make a specific finding that requiring rfg protects the public health of baton rouge,citing b national primary ambient air quality standards,prescribed under subsection a of this section shall be ambient air quality standards the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the administrator,based on such criteria and allowing an adequate margin of safety,are requisite to protect the public health.the chamber further argues that requiring rfg in baton rouge will interfere with the area attainment because studies have shown rfg increases nox levels and baton rouge sip strategy for reducing ozone relies largely on reducing nox and not vocs.by interfering with attainment,the chamber contends,rfg in fact endangers the public health.as an initial matter,the chamber objections based on harm to public health and interference with rfp and attainment are forfeited because they were not raised before the agency.see caa d b,d b only an objection to a rule or procedure which was raised with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment including any public hearing may be raised during judicial review.to the extent baton rouge argues that rfg will not improve the public health,the epa adequately addressed these objections and reasonably determined they may best be resolved through individual waiver requests 
in the phase rulemaking,the baton rouge clean air coalition asserted that rfg use in baton rouge would provide no measurable benefits for nox,less than tons per day of voc reductions,and an ozone benefit of around ppb,and asked whether these data qualify as an absurd result and would be subject to consideration for waiver.letter from mike mcdaniel,executor director,baton rouge clean air coalition to epa at july,see phase rule.at.in response,the epa noted that baton rouge had submitted requests for an rfg waiver and for a waiver of the rfg oxygen content requirement,which are currently before the agency.at.based on its determination that the transition to the more protective standard should not result in less restrictive requirements for rfg than would apply if the epa had never revised the standard,the epa advised that t he appropriate mechanism to address baton rouge concerns is in the context of baton rouge petitions for relief under the rfg program,and not by establishing different,less restrictive rfg requirements as part of the transition to the standard.id.baton rouge waiver request is ongoing before the agency with judicial review available in the fifth circuit.the epa decision to address data and concerns in an individual waiver proceeding,rather than in the general rulemaking,is reasonable.wildlife fed epa,upholding as reasonable epa decision to address color pollution on a basis through individual national pollutant discharge elimination system permits or,when appropriate,through local limits rather than to establish nationwide standards for discharge of color.
viii.conclusion 
in sum,we hold the phase rule violates the act by allowing participation in the nox sip call to satisfy the requirement that a nonattainment area mandate such reductions as can be achieved by the application of ract,the epa acted arbitrarily when it eliminated the requirement that an attainment demonstration be approved for an area before a new source would be allowed to use a past emission reduction to offset new emissions,and the elimination of the time limit for nsr waivers under appendix s violates the provision of the act.in light of the likelihood the epa will be unable to cure the backsliding inherent in the removal of the time limit,we vacate that provision of the phase rule and remand it to the epa.see.pub.telecomms.ass fcc,when this court remands a rule with little or no prospect of the rule being readopted upon the basis of a more adequate explanation of the agency reasoning,the practice of the court is ordinarily to vacate the rule.we remand to the epa without vacatur the other two provisions of the phase rule we hold invalid.we defer consideration of the phase rule and reconsideration notice insofar as they relate to the cair program,and we deny the petitions in all other respects.
so ordered.
i join the court opinion regarding challenges to the phase rule except in three respects.the petitioners met their burden to show reopening of both the general policies allowing new and modified sources to use offset credits from past emission reductions to meet the requirements of section of the clean air act caa,and epa authority to waive interim new source review nsr appendix s permitting requirements,pt,app.s,vi.additionally,the challenge to the contingency measure element of the clean data policy was not forfeited because comments submitted by the nrdc and other environmental groups put epa on notice of the challenge,which epa,in fact,addressed.
the principles underlying the reopening doctrine are.it is only their application that may obfuscate the reality of what an agency regulatory action entails.this is the situation here.
under the reopening doctrine,which is an exception to the statutory limits on the period for seeking judicial review of agency action,see env.defense epa,an issue is reopened when an agency implicitly or explicitly,see west virginia epa,solicits comment on a preexisting regulation or otherwise indicates its willingness to reconsider such a regulation by inviting and responding to comments,kennecott utah copper dep t of interior.the entire context must demonstrate that the agency has undertaken a serious,substantive reconsideration of the existing rule.p v enters.army corps of eng rs,internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.also,when a new rule increase s the significance of preexisting regulations,kennecott,at,and thus significantly alters the stakes of judicial review,the new rule constructively reopens the previously settled issue,id.at.applying these principles demonstrates epa reopened consideration of two subjects.
offset credits.the phase rule allows new and modified sources to meet emissions offset requirements under caa c,c,by using credits from sources that shut down or curtailed operations as long ago as august.see a ii c ii op.at.contrary to the court suggestion,this court opinion in kennecott makes clear that the fact that the basic regulatory scheme remains unchanged,op.at,is not dispositive of whether an issue has been constructively reopened.see kennecott,at.analyzing the reopening doctrine at that level of generality begs the question.if adding new terms to an old rule can result in reopening,see,then so can removing old terms from an old rule,at least where those old terms were an important part of the underlying regulatory scheme.furthermore,kennecott also makes clear that the question whether the stakes are quantitatively different,op.at,does not turn on whether the petitioner or another failed to object to a different change earlier.see kennecott,at.although a rule made it easier to use offset credits,see requirements for implementation plans,air quality new source review,final rule,june,rule,the concomitant addition of the attainment demonstration requirement mitigated the impact of the change and may well have meant it was not worth challenging,kennecott,at,the regime as a whole.however,once epa eliminated the attainment demonstration requirement and failed to replace it with a comparable substitute,the need for a challenge by environmental groups such as the nrdc arose because epa had dramatically expanded authority to use offset credits,nrdc br.at.this change meant that a major new pollution source may add substantial new emissions to a nonattainment area without any contemporaneous offsets,even when the state has no plan for meeting standards and no idea of what total reductions are needed to attain standards.id.at.
both epa and the court analysis show that a constructive reopening occurred.see op.at.in announcing the rule,epa stated that to comply with the reasonable further progress rfp requirement of caa a a,a a,the restriction on offset credit was necessary both to assure rfp and to guarantee that a new source does not cause or contribute to a violation of the naaqs,rule.at.this evaluation by epa supports the conclusion that environmental groups would have determined in that it was not worth challenging the regulatory scheme as significant limits remained in place.once epa removed this necessary,limitation without adding any other safeguard to ensure that issuing a particular permit is consistent with section mandate that total reductions represent reasonable further progress,op.at quoting caa a a,a a,the stakes of judicial review were significantly altered.the court speculation it could have been reasonably anticipated in that epa might eliminate the attainment demonstration requirement,op.at too much.given epa evaluation in the rule of the importance of restricting the availability of offset credits,environmental groups had no reason then to lodge a challenge based on the possibility that epa might,perhaps,at some point in the future reverse course.coast air quality mgmt.dist.epa.although the reopening doctrine may not apply if the change could have been reasonably anticipated,see env.defense,at,such a limit on the doctrine does not go so far as preventing review because a petitioner might have guessed epa could later change its evaluation of what was necessary.such an approach would render the constructive reopening precedents nugatory.
on the merits,the nrdc persuasively contends that epa final rule unlawfully permits total allowable emissions after the new source starts operating to be higher than emissions from existing sources before the new source applied for its permit.nrdc br.at.the phase rule allowance of offset credit for shutdowns and curtailments is contrary to the plain text of the caa and fails under chevron step one.chevron natural res.def.council,d.section a a requires that sufficient offsetting reductions shall be obtained such that total allowable emissions from existing sources in the region,from new or modified sources which are not major emitting facilities,and from the proposed source will be sufficiently less than total emissions from existing sources prior to the application for such permit to construct or modify so as to represent reasonable further progress.a a.section c requires that offsets come from an equal or greater reduction,as applicable,in actual emissions of such air pollutant from the same or other sources in the area.id.c emphasis added see also,pt.referring to reductions in actual emissions.under the phase rule,new and modified major sources may claim offset credit from reductions in emissions resulting from the shutdown or curtailment of operations from more than three decades ago.the absence of any meaningful time limit means the rule is inconsistent with caa c requirement that new sources emissions shall be offset by an equal or greater reduction in actual emissions,c.congress is presumed,absent any indication to the contrary,to have intended the ordinary meaning of the word actual,as existing or occurring at the time,merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed emphasis added accord webster third new int l dictionary.see engine mfrs.ass coast air quality mgmt,d.congress has given no indication in the surrounding text,or elsewhere,that it intended to depart from the common meaning of actual.hence,allowing an offset for emissions from sources closed decades ago is inconsistent with the statutory text.
epa offers that because the phase rule requires the old offsets to be included in the area emissions inventory,allowance of offset credits is consistent with the requirement in caa a a,a a,that offsets ensure reasonable further progress toward attainment.see phase of the final rule to implement the ozone national ambient air quality standard,final notice of reconsideration,june,final notice of reconsideration.but using emissions in an accounting exercise can not render those emissions actual as that word is commonly understood.likewise,epa offers that because f rom an air quality planning perspective emissions from the previously shutdown or curtailed sources had impacted the area designations as nonattainment,they are actual emissions reductions.phase rule.at see also final notice of reconsideration.at.but that emissions were actual as long ago as the does not mean they continue to meet the common understanding of actual years later when a source applies for a construction or modification permit.
because the flaws in this part of the phase rule,see a ii c ii,can not be remedied by further explanation by epa,it must be vacated.see,nuclear reg.comm n.to what extent the court holding that elimination of the requirement of an approved attainment demonstration is arbitrary and capricious under caa d a,d a,op.at,will result in a different outcome than vacatur remains to be seen upon remand.
nsr waiver authority.section a c,a c,does not specify what nsr requirements apply in the period between an area designation as nonattainment and approval of its nsr state implementation plan sip.prior to promulgating the phase rule,epa had filled this statutory gap by retaining appendix s interim nsr regime,which by its terms could apply for only months.given the limited duration of its effect,the previous regulation may not have been worth challenging,kennecott,at.however,epa decision to eliminate the limitation alter ed the stakes of judicial review,id.by parity of reasoning,if there was a reopening in kennecott where industry petitioners faced a new requirement creating the possibility of the imposition of additional penalties,then there was a constructive reopening where epa change meant nsr controls could be postponed indefinitely,thereby dramatically changing the scope and effect of the waiver provision.
additionally,epa constructively reopened the issue of its nsr waiver authority when it proposed to remove the general waiver provision in appendix s and replace it with a transitional program in which waivers would be available in only a limited set of nonattainment areas.see proposed rule to implement the ozone national ambient air quality standard,june,nprm.epa has described the proposal as a major rewrite of a ppendix phase rule.at.in explaining the proposal,epa stated we do not believe that areas not meeting the transitional approach would be able to ensure that they were implementing an nsr program as necessary to ensure the attainment of naaqs nprm.at quoting caa a c,a c.in other words,epa expressed doubt about a broad waiver consistency with statutory mandates in certain circumstances.although it ultimately rejected the proposed alternative,epa reopened the issue of its authority to waive interim nsr requirements by raising the question whether a broad waiver would be inconsistent with the caa.see edison inst.epa.
on the merits,the challenge by the nrdc and the state of new jersey to epa authority to exempt new sources from the interim nsr permitting requirements is unpersuasive.they contend that w here congress has intended to allow exceptions to nsr requirements,it has expressly said so,nrdc br.at citing,inter alia,caa a b,a b,excepting economic development zones.however,epa persuasively responds that the waivers are the product of epa authority.see chevron,at.in exercising that authority,epa established requirements substantially similar to the requirements of part d,caa et,et,although not identical to the major nsr program under part see phase rule.at.the minor nsr program under caa a c calls for regulation of the modification and construction of any stationary source within the areas covered by the plan as necessary to assure that naaqs are achieved.a c emphasis added.epa thus could reasonably conclude that the interim nsr requirements are inapplicable when the exemption conditions are met.in those instances,a waiver would be available only if the new source emissions would not interfere with timely attainment,see pt,app.s,vi,making additional nsr requirements unnecessary.
although epa had authority to provide waivers on a basis where a waiver would not interfere with timely attainment,i concur in holding that epa elimination of the limitation violates the provision in caa e,e,see op.at.
