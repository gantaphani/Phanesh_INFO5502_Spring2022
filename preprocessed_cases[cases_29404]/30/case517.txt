in,bricks began planning to develop the property.bricks wished to install an access road connecting the property to orchard road and deerpath road.bricks hired environmental planning team chicago ept to perform a wetlands delineation on the property,following the procedures set forth in the army corps of engineers wetlands delineation manual.ept found that there were approximately eleven acres of wetlands on the property,of an acre of which would be filled to construct the access road,and advised bricks that it would need to obtain a nationwide or individual permit before filling the wetlands bricks directed its engineering consultant,manhard consulting,manhard to obtain permits from the corps,and manhard hired environmental consultants and planners encap to obtain any necessary permits.encap concluded that bricks plans to install the access road would impact acres of wetlands and would be covered under a nationwide permit.encap then submitted a notification to the corps,asking the corps to confirm that the project was covered under a nationwide permit.
bricks began constructing the access road before it received a response from the corps,completing the road between august and.the corps notified bricks on august,that it had received bricks notification and that,according to a preliminary evaluation,the project would require authorization under nationwide permit or under an individual permit.
subsequently,the corps was informed that bricks was already developing the property.a corps employee visited the property and observed that bricks had placed fill in a wetland area while constructing the access road.the corps issued a cease and desist order to bricks on august.during later investigations,employees of the corps,the epa,and the local soil conservation district found that bricks had destroyed wetlands when constructing the access road and two retention basins.
the corps then responded by letter to bricks notification.the corps reported that nationwide permit would cover bricks construction of the access road,but not the two retention basins.bricks would need to obtain an permit to be covered by nationwide permit.while bricks was attempting to obtain an permit from the corps,the epa issued a findings of violation and compliance order compliance order stating that bricks was in violation of section of the cwa.the compliance order required bricks to submit an application to the epa,containing a mitigation plan for restoring wetlands located on the property.bricks submitted the application in january.on june,the corps issued bricks an permit pursuant to nationwide permit,authorizing bricks to discharge materials into acres of wetlands on the property.
on july,the epa filed an administrative complaint,alleging that bricks used bulldozers and other earthmoving machinery to discharge approximately cubic yards of fill into wetlands on its property that,under the cwa,this activity constituted discharge of pollutants and that because bricks did not have a permit under section of the cwa,bricks had violated section of the cwa.the complaint also alleged that the wetlands are adjacent to an unnamed tributary of blackberry creek,which is itself a tributary of fox river,an interstate water within the ambit of the cwa.this made the wetlands waters of the united states,protected by the cwa.see.bricks responded by arguing,among other things,that the wetlands were isolated and did not fall under cwa jurisdiction.therefore,according to bricks,the company was not required to obtain a section a permit.see a.
the alj commenced a hearing to consider the epa complaint.the alj found in his initial decision that the epa had shown by a preponderance of evidence that bricks violated section of the cwa by filling wetlands located on the property.section a prohibits any person from discharging dredged or fill material into waters of the united states,a,unless the corps issues a permit,a.under regulations promulgated by the corps,waters of the united states include waters that are currently used,or were used in the past,or may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce,navigable waters,a,tributaries of those waters,a,and w etlands adjacent to waters of the united states or their tributaries,a.the epa and bricks agreed that the property contains wetlands.
bricks argued,however,that the wetlands were isolated not connected to waters of the united hence not covered by the cwa.bricks central legal argument was that the epa was precluded from asserting jurisdiction over the wetlands located on the property,because of the supreme court decision in solid waste agency of northern cook county army corps of engineers,d swancc,in which the court rejected the corps argument that isolated ponds were navigable waters under the migratory bird rule.the alj rejected this argument and pointed out that the court in swancc had distinguished that case from united states riverside bayview homes,d,in which the court found that wetlands adjacent to navigable water were navigable waters,based on the significant nexus between wetlands and navigable waters.swancc,at.bricks also argued that there was no hydrological connection between the wetlands on its property and navigable waters.the alj rejected this argument as well.the alj relied on the testimony of four witnesses and a site map prepared by bricks contractor to find that,although it was a close question,the preponderance of the evidence demonstrated that the wetlands on bricks property were waters of the united states subject to the cwa.specifically,the wetlands ran into a tributary of blackberry creek,and blackberry creek ran into fox river,a navigable water.the alj assessed a penalty against bricks.
the board reversed the alj initial decision.the board examined the testimony and evidence relied on by the alj and concluded that the epa had failed to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that there was a hydrological connection between the wetlands on bricks property and the fox river.
