like many counties in california,orange county the county maintains a large database of information about land parcels in a geographic information system gis file format.with this database,called the oc landbase,a user with appropriate software can create a layered digital map containing information for over specific parcels of land in orange county,including geographic boundaries,assessor parcel numbers,street addresses,and links to additional information on the parcel owners.the issue in this case is whether the oc landbase is subject to disclosure in a gis file format at the actual cost of duplication under the california public records act or whether,as the county contends,it is covered by the statute exclusion of c omputer software,subd.a a term that includes computer mapping systems,subd.b from the definition of a public record.we hold that although gis mapping software falls within the ambit of this statutory exclusion,a database like the oc landbase does not.accordingly,such databases are public records that,unless otherwise exempt,must be produced upon request at the actual cost of duplication.
in june,petitioner sierra club sent a letter to the orange county assessor requesting a copy of the oc landbase pursuant to the california public records act pra.amici curiae representing a variety of media and groups explain the functionality and value of the database at issue using software available on the open market and the landbase that is at issue in this case,any interested person can layer other publicly available electronic datasets on top of the landbase and perform a analysis of those datasets in ways that are simply not possible without the base layer for example a property owner can use landbase data to locate other similar parcels and see whether the owner taxes are higher or lower than those being paid by others,or to determine whether zoning decisions are similar as to comparable properties,which in turn can shed light on the fairness of a government taxing or zoning decisions p ublic dissemination of mapping data is also critical to the sector ability to monitor and respond to government actions involving real property.for example,petitioner sierra club sought the records at issue in this action to determine and convey to the public the status of large areas of open space in orange county,including whether each area is protected from development by conservation easements or public ownership or is threatened by a proposed development.
sierra club request began a lengthy exchange between the two parties concerning the public record status of the oc landbase.in march,the county agreed to produce records containing the information underlying the oc landbase,including assessment rolls,parcel maps,tract maps,survey records,lot line adjustments,and transfer deeds.the county offered to provide such records in adobe pdf electronic format or as printed paper copies.however,the county took the position that the pra did not require it to disclose the same records in a gis file format and that it would provide the records in that format only if sierra club paid a licensing fee and agreed to the license restrictions on disclosure and distribution.according to the county,the licensing agreement enables the county to recoup a portion of the substantial costs it incurs to develop and maintain the oc landbase.a declaration by the county surveyor reported that the county had spent over million in the previous five years to maintain the oc landbase.according to sierra club expert,the county licensing policy is different from the practice of most counties in california of the state counties,including los angeles county,provide access to parcel base maps as public records.if the oc landbase must be disclosed as a public record,the county could charge sierra club only the actual cost of duplication.if it is not,the county has the option to license the database according to the terms of its licensing policy.
sierra club sought a writ of mandate from the superior court to compel the county to provide the oc landbase in a gis file format as a public record for a fee covering only the direct cost of duplication,with no requirement that sierra club comply with the licensing agreement.before ruling,the superior court permitted extensive briefing from both parties and conducted a evidentiary hearing.the hearing focused on the county claim that the oc landbase was excluded from the pra definition of a public record because it fell within the statutory exclusion for computer software,a term that includes computer mapping systems.gov.code,subds.a,b hereafter section a and section b all further undesignated statutory references are to the government code.
before the hearing,the parties stipulated that the oc landbase refers to the county parcel data in a gis file format.they defined gis file format to mean that the geographic data can be analyzed,viewed,and managed with gis software,and it includes formats such as esri shape files,modular gis environment mge,and oracle spatial.although the county uses the term landbase internally to refer to its entire mapping system not only the data but also the software used to run it the county confirmed at the hearing that the term landbase,when used externally,refers only to the parcel map data held in a gis file format.the parties agree that t he oc landbase in the format the sierra club has requested,and in which it is currently distributed to oc landbase licensees,does not contain programs,routines,and symbolic languages that control the functioning of computer hardware and direct its operation.the county relies on software obtained from oracle to create and access the oc landbase.if the oc landbase is produced in a gis file format,sierra club must use its own gis software to access the data.
following the evidentiary hearing,the superior court issued an order denying the petition for writ of mandate,along with a page statement of decision.the court found that the county offered persuasive testimony and evidence that the term gis refers to an integrated collection of computer software and data used to view and manage information about geographical places,analyze spatial relationships and model spatial processes.the court further credit ed the county evidence and the testimony of witnesses that the oc landbase in a gis file format is part of a computer mapping system.to that end,the oc landbase in gis file format is not a public record,but falls within section exception to the pra general rules of disclosure.on that basis,the superior court denied sierra club petition for writ of mandate.
on appeal,the court of appeal affirmed.finding the statutory language ambiguous,the court of appeal determined that the legislative history of section supported the county position that files fall within the meaning of computer mapping system.based on its review of the legislative history and purpose of section,the court of appeal concluded that the county met its burden to prove that the oc landbase was not a public record subject to disclosure.
we granted review and now reverse.
the pra and the california constitution provide the public with a right of access to government information.as this court has explained openness in government is essential to the functioning of a democracy.implicit in the democratic process is the notion that government should be accountable for its actions.in order to verify accountability,individuals must have access to government files.such access permits checks against the arbitrary exercise of official power and secrecy in the political process.citation.international federation of professional technical engineers,local,afl cio superior court cal th,local.in adopting the pra,the legislature declared that access to information concerning the conduct of the people business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.as the result of an initiative adopted by the voters in,this principle is now enshrined in the state constitution local,at.the california constitution,article i,section,subdivision b provides the people have the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people business,and therefore,the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to public scrutiny.
the pra applies to public records,defined as any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public business prepared,owned,used,or retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or characteristics,subd.e.in this case,the county offer to produce alternative records with the information underlying the oc landbase implicitly recognizes that the information within the oc landbase constitutes public records subject to disclosure unless otherwise exempt from the pra.what the parties dispute is whether the oc landbase in a gis file format is a public record that must be disclosed in that format pursuant to the pra.
the format of information is not generally determinative of the public record status of government information.a amendment to the pra makes electronic data available in whatever format it is normally maintained by the agency,added by stats,ch.section provides in relevant part a unless otherwise prohibited by law,any agency that has information that constitutes an identifiable public record not exempt from disclosure pursuant to this chapter that is in an electronic format shall make that information available in an electronic format when requested by any person and,when applicable,shall comply with the following the agency shall make the information available in any electronic format in which it holds the information.the cost of duplication shall be limited to the direct cost of producing a copy of a record in an electronic format,subd.a,hereafter section a and section a.section further provides nothing in this section shall be construed to require the public agency to release an electronic record in the electronic form in which it is held by the agency if its release would jeopardize or compromise the security or integrity of the original record or of any proprietary software in which it is maintained,subd.f.
however,a separate provision of the pra,section a,excludes c omputer software from the definition of a public record.section b says,computer software includes computer mapping systems,computer programs,and computer graphics systems.the question before us is whether the term computer software,as used in section,encompasses the oc landbase in a gis file format.if so,then the oc landbase is not a public record subject to disclosure if not,then it is a public record subject to disclosure unless otherwise exempt under the pra.
when we interpret a statute,o ur fundamental task is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.we first examine the statutory language,giving it a plain and commonsense meaning.we do not examine that language in isolation,but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment.if the language is clear,courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the legislature did not intend.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th.furthermore,we consider portions of a statute in the context of the entire statute and the statutory scheme of which it is a part,giving significance to every word,phrase,sentence,and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.curle superior court cal th.
in this case,our usual approach to statutory construction is supplemented by a rule of interpretation that is specific to the issue before us.in,california voters approved proposition,which amended the state constitution to provide a right of access to public records.as noted,article i,section,subdivision b provides the people have the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people business,and therefore,the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to public scrutiny.subdivision b provides guidance on the proper construction of statutes affecting this right of access a statute,court rule,or other authority,including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision,shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people right of access,and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.in addition,subdivision b provides this subdivision does not repeal or nullify,expressly or by implication,any constitutional or statutory exception to the right of access to public records or meetings of public bodies that is in effect on the effective date of this subdivision,including,but not limited to,any statute protecting the confidentiality of law enforcement and prosecution records.cal,art.i,subd.b.
sierra club does not independently challenge the denial of access to the oc landbase as a constitutional violation if disclosure is not required by the pra,and in light of article i,section,subdivision b,we may not countermand the legislature intent to exclude or exempt information from the pra disclosure requirements where that intent is clear.but to the extent that legislative intent is ambiguous,the california constitution requires us to broadly construe the pra to the extent it furthers the people right of access and to narrowly construe the pra to the extent it limits the right of access.cal,art.i,subd.b.given the strong public policy of the people right to information concerning the people business,and the constitutional mandate to construe statutes limiting the right of access narrowly cal,art.i,subd.b,all public records are subject to disclosure unless the legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.office of inspector general superior court th,quoting williams superior court cal th,italics added by the court of appeal see also local,supra,cal th at conc.dis.opn.by kennard,courts must narrowly construe any statute limiting the people right of access to public records.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the relevant statutory language.section a provides computer software developed by a state or local agency is not itself a public record under this chapter.the agency may sell,lease,or license the software for commercial or noncommercial use.section b says as used in this section,computer software includes computer mapping systems,computer programs,and computer graphics systems.further,section,subdivision d hereafter section d provides nothing in this section is intended to affect the public record status of information merely because it is stored in a computer.public records stored in a computer shall be disclosed as required by this chapter.we must decide whether the statutory exemption for c omputer software a a term that includes computer mapping systems b encompasses mapping data in a gis file format,as the county contends,or only gis mapping software,as sierra club contends.
in construing computer mapping systems in section b,neither party has offered any standard definition of the term,and dictionary definitions provide little help.the court of appeal relied on a definition of the word system as a complex unity formed of many often diverse parts subject to a common plan or serving a common purpose quoting webster new internat.dict.to conclude that a computer mapping system should include more than solely a computer program component.similarly,the county argues that a computer mapping system includes not only mapping software but also databases in a format compatible with mapping software,since such formatting,unlike a printed copy or pdf version of the underlying data,enables a database to function as part of a computer mapping system.but this interpretation,though reasonable,is not compelled by the ordinary meaning of system,a rather general word that is just as reasonably construed to refer only to mapping software.
part of the challenge in construing computer mapping system is that the technology for geographic information management and analysis has evolved significantly since its inception in the.as recounted by sierra club expert,early computer graphics systems could only create drawings with lines and other geometric features.at the next stage,drafting systems allowed users to create more precise engineering drawings.next came automated mapping systems,also called mapping,which allowed users to link their drawings with coordinating degrees representing the surface of the earth.later programs allowed users to connect automated mapping am systems with facility management fm systems.these systems linked drawings with informational databases,including parcel databases.finally,systems were supplanted by modern gis systems that allow complex geospatial and topographical analysis.
according to the county deputy surveyor,the term computer mapping system as used in,when section was enacted,is simply a precursor to gis technology and necessarily includes both software and related databases.sierra club expert counters that while the term gis can be used broadly today to refer to both software and data,the term computer mapping system as used in the referred only to a system of linked software modules and did not include any related databases.both parties point to a text defining gis as a n integrated collection of computer software and data used to view and manage information about geographic places,analyze spatial relationships and model spatial processes.a gis provides a framework for gathering and organizing spatial data and related information so that it can be displayed and analyzed.wade sommer,a to z gis an illustrated dictionary of geographic information systems ed.but a definition of gis does not shed light on what the legislature meant by the term computer mapping system in.
although the term computer mapping system by itself is susceptible of either sierra club or the county interpretation,we must also consider the statutory context in which the term appears.section b refers to computer mapping systems as an item include d in the term computer software.we agree with sierra club that because the statute refers to computer mapping systems as a species of computer software,the term computer mapping systems should be construed in light of the meaning of computer software.
according to sierra club,the plain meaning of the subject term software in subdivision a is commonly understood to be distinct from the data upon which the software operates.dictionary definitions contemporaneous with the adoption of section tend to support sierra club view.see webster new collegiate dict.defining software as the entire set of programs,procedures,and related documentation associated with a system and esp.a computer system specif computer programs oxford english dict.ed defining software as a.the programs and procedures required to enable a computer to perform a specific task,as opposed to the physical components of the system esp.the body of system programs,including compilers and library routines,required for the operation of a particular computer and often provided by the manufacturer,as opposed to program material provided by a user for a specific task.american heritage dict.ed defining software as the programs,routines,and symbolic languages that control the functioning of the hardware and direct its operation.these definitions of software do not encompass data in a format compatible with specific software.
the legislature gave a similar meaning to the term computer software in when it enacted business and professions code section,subdivision c,which defines computer software as a sequence of instructions written in any programming language that is executed on a computer.stats,ch.on the other hand,the legislature in nine months before the adoption of government code section defined computer program or software more broadly in the penal code to mean a set of instructions or statements,and related data,that when executed in actual or modified form,cause a computer,computer system,or computer network to perform specified functions,subd.b,italics added stats,ch.thus,although the ordinary meaning of computer software tends to support sierra club contention that the term computer mapping systems in section b refers only to mapping software,the legislature contemporaneously used computer software elsewhere to mean not only a program or sequence of instructions but also related data.
whether the legislature intended a similarly broad meaning of computer software in section is illuminated by considering another feature of the statutory context namely,section b reference to computer programs and computer graphics systems in addition to computer mapping systems as forms of computer software.see b as used in this section,computer software includes computer mapping systems,computer programs,and computer graphics systems.w hen a statute contains a list or catalogue of items,a court should determine the meaning of each by reference to the others,giving preference to an interpretation that uniformly treats items similar in nature and scope.citations.in accordance with this principle of construction,a court will adopt a restrictive meaning of a listed item if acceptance of a more expansive meaning would make other items in the list unnecessary or redundant,or would otherwise make the item markedly dissimilar to the other items in the list.moore california state bd.of accountancy cal th.
the county adopts the court of appeal view that interpreting computer mapping systems to encompass only mapping software would make that term superfluous in light of section b inclusion of computer programs as a form of computer software.although this argument is not without force,sierra club responds that one could just as easily argue that computer mapping systems are also computer graphics systems,a term that is also used in b.thus,even if the term computer mapping systems in b was construed to include the data such mapping systems operate upon,the term would remain surplusage.
further,sierra club contends,if a computer mapping system includes not only mapping software but also parcel data in a compatible format,then presumably a computer graphics system would include not only graphics software but also graphics data in a compatible format a construction that would arguably exclude from the pra all computer data operated upon by programs using a graphical interface such as those found on microsoft windows or apple macintosh computers amicus curiae electronic frontier foundation similarly notes that computer graphics systems,under the county reading,would include public databases of mug shots or other images consisting of files for example,jpeg files formatted to be viewed and manipulated by graphics software.as a practical matter,such an interpretation would tend to make the mandate in section a that t he agency shall make the information available in any electronic format in which it holds the information a virtual nullity or,at least,a limited exception rather than a general rule.almost all data stored in computers are formatted in some manner to be used with application software.it seems implausible that the legislature having expressly stated that information stored in a computer is a type of public record subject to disclosure d and having provided for access to such information in any electronic format in which the agency holds the information a would have intended to exclude large categories of computer databases mapping and graphics merely because the files they contain are formatted to be read and manipulated by mapping and graphics software.
in sum,the analysis above leads us to conclude that although the term computer mapping systems by itself is ambiguous,the ordinary meaning of computer software supports sierra club contention that the public records exemption for computer mapping systems covers gis mapping software but not data.it is true that the legislature has elsewhere used the term computer software more broadly to include related data,subd.b.but such an interpretation applied not only to computer mapping systems but also in parallel to computer graphics systems in section b would substantially undermine section a general mandate th
