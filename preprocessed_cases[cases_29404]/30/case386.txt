georgia gulf corporation georgia gulf brings this appeal under b challenging the district court denial of its b motion to dismiss and alternative rule motion for summary judgment,as well as the district court ruling that ronald bain bain stated a claim under the false claims act fca,a,and that he pleaded his claim under that statute with sufficient particularity as required by federal rule of civil procedure b.we reverse and remand this case for further proceedings.
facts and proceedings below 
this is a qui tam action under the false claims act fca,et,filed by bain on july.the government declined to intervene on november,and the district court unsealed the complaint and ordered it served on georgia gulf.the case is now before this court on the defendant georgia gulf interlocutory appeal from the district court order denying georgia gulf motion to dismiss the complaint under.b and b.
bain began his employment with georgia gulf in plaquemine,louisiana in.one of the primary products manufactured by georgia gulf at its chemical facility in plaquemine is polyvinyl chloride pvc,which is a known carcinogen.the pvc is produced in eighteen reactors which must be routinely opened in order to conduct physical inspections.when the reactors are opened,vinyl chloride is released into the atmosphere.this is known as open lid loss.the complaint alleges that p ursuant to the laws of the united states of america and the state of louisiana,including the rules and regulations of and permits issued by the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq and the environmental protection agency epa,georgia gulf is required to monitor and report emissions of vinyl chloride which occur during the production of pvc.
the complaint states that bain was transferred in late or early to the pvc unit to work as a top deck operator.his responsibilities included monitoring and measuring releases of vinyl chloride during open lid losses and then recording the amount of each release into the open lid loss logs.these logs were then submitted to the environmental protection agency epa and the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq.
the complaint alleges that w hen relator commenced employment as a top deck operator in the pvc unit he learned that it was georgia gulf standard operating procedure to vent vinyl chloride into the atmosphere without monitoring or measuring the releases and then to make false records of the emissions during open lid loss.they in turn allegedly routinely and knowingly submitted these false records to the epa and ldeq.the complaint alleges in general terms that this practice was in contravention of a,the reverse false claims provision of the fca,because the actions of georgia gulf have deprived the united states of america and state of louisiana of fines,and other monetary assessments which would have been made had the actions of georgia gulf not been concealed.
on april,georgia gulf moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,but on june,the district court ordered that bain first amend his complaint to comply with rule b,and gave him twenty days in which to do so accordingly,bain filed an amended complaint on july,that a added miscellaneous allegations related to his section a reverse false claim concerning avoidance of fines for excessive vinyl chloride emissions during open lid loss by making false records of such emissions and b added an entirely new claim,namely one for a direct false claim of acquiring emission reduction credits erc by false reporting of vinyl chloride emissions,as follows 
at all material times herein,georgia gulf corporation was entitled to and,on information and belief,did participate in the emission reduction credit banking program established and operated by the louisiana department of environmental quality.further,on information and belief,georgia gulf obtained emission reduction credits erc based on its reports of emissions of vinyl chloride from the polyvinyl chloride unit.
on information and belief,the submission of false and fraudulent records by georgia gulf of vinyl chloride emissions from the polyvinyl chloride unit allowed georgia gulf to obtain erc which are a thing of value and could be used by georgia gulf or transferred to another person or company in exchange for consideration.
on september,no further motions,pleadings or briefs having been filed after bain july,amended complaint,the district court denied defendant april,motion to dismiss,stating that bain had adequately alleged that georgia gulf submission of false records and documents had prevented the government from collecting the penalties it would have received had the records and documents been accurate.the court held that,assuming the truth of the allegations,this conduct would fall within the reverse false claims act because the making of false or fraudulent records prepared by the defendant would allow georgia gulf to avoid an obligation to pay what the government would have received had georgia gulf submitted accurate records.the district court order did not address bain direct false claim concerning emission reduction credits which was added by his july amended complaint and was not addressed by georgia gulf april motion to dismiss.
georgia gulf on september,filed a motion to reconsider,and in the alternative,a rule motion for summary judgment.on september,the district court denied georgia gulf motion for reconsideration respecting its b motion,and ordered the parties to conduct discovery.plaintiff then filed an ex parte motion to clarify the ruling confirming that the district court had dismissed the summary judgment motion.the district court ruled that to the extent georgia gulf was filing a motion for summary judgment,it failed to comply with the rule procedures and therefore the motion was denied without prejudice.
on october,the district court stayed these proceedings pending a decision by this court in a similar case,united states,ex rel.john doe dow chemical,cir dow,which had been decided by another district court,and which was directly opposite the decision rendered by this court in this case on the same issue.the district court certified the order for interlocutory appeal,and georgia gulf filed a petition for permission to appeal the district court orders of september and.on january,this court granted leave to appeal from the interlocutory orders of the district court.
on august,this court decided dow without reaching the issue of whether the complaint stated a claim under the fca 
discussion 
the reverse false claims act 
under the fca,the government,or a party suing on its behalf,may recover for false claims made by the defendant to secure a payment by the government.under the reverse false claims act subsection,a plaintiff may recover against any person who knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to conceal,avoid,or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government.a.in a reverse false claims suit,the defendant action does not result in improper payment by the government to the defendant,but instead results in no payment to the government when a payment is obligated.
plaintiff amended complaint did not state a claim under the reverse false claims act.
bain based his section a complaint on allegations that georgia gulf concealed from the government the fact that it had falsified emissions records in an effort to avoid a fine or monetary penalty to which the company might have been subjected if the government had known of the illegal emissions and had then decided to take action against georgia gulf.the district court held that bain complaint stated a cause of action under the reverse false claims act.we disagree.
bain argues on appeal that georgia gulf obligations under the reverse fca are based on its environmental permits,specifically those which incorporate provisions of the clean air act caa,et.the caa requires the epa to establish regulations for air quality standards.section requires each state to develop an implementation plan sip that describes the manner in which the state will achieve the national minimum standards on air pollution.the ldeq was established to ensure louisiana compliance with environmental regulations,including the air quality mandates.see.ldeq issues permits which impose limits on the quantities of air pollution that a source can emit.admin.code iii.
under,the federal government is charged with enforcement of sip and air quality permits,which have the effect of federal law.the permits issued by the ldeq are enforced by the state of louisiana.georgia gulf claims that its ldeq permit is merely a grant of authority to discharge,not a contract setting forth obligations owed to from the government.however,bain makes the wholly conclusory argument on appeal that the permit is or should be considered a contract with the government,though that was not alleged or suggested in the complaint or amended complaint.
bain argues that this court should interpret a potential fine or monetary penalty,such as those to which georgia gulf could be subject for causing emissions precluded by the caa or the sip and in circumstances or quantities not authorized by its permit,as an obligation to the government within the meaning of the statute.however,georgia gulf argues that such a potential fine or penalty can not be the basis for a reverse false claims action.the united states,as amicus,although taking a somewhat broader general view of section a than does georgia gulf,nevertheless asserts that a potential fine that may be imposed upon a person simply for performing an act that the government has defined as unlawful or prohibited is not an obligation within the meaning of section a.therefore,the government argues,the avoidance of such a potential fine or civil penalty in the present situation does not give rise to reverse false claims liability.we agree that,at least in these circumstances,there is no reverse false claims liability.
standard of review 
dismissals for failure to state a claim under frcp b are reviewed de novo.cousin small,cir.a district court can not dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief.united states,ex rel.thompson healthcare,cir.however,conclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.jones alcoa,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
discussion 
bain alleges that georgia gulf submitted false emissions records in an attempt to avoid a fine or monetary penalty to which georgia gulf might have been subject if the government had known of the actual emissions and then decided to seek fines or civil penalties against the company.the district court agreed with this interpretation,holding that the relator complaint stated a cause of action under section a.the court held that,as bain had asserted,the obligation to pay the government was satisfied by the performance of an unlawful act that may result in a fine or monetary penalty.
neither the complaint nor the amended complaint alleges,and bain does not contend,that at any time at or after the making of the herein complained of false statements any fine or penalty,with respect to the emissions allegedly misrepresented by such statements,had ever been imposed on georgia gulf or that any proceeding seeking to impose,or to determine whether to impose,any such fine or penalty was ever pending or instituted.
georgia gulf argues that the fca section at issue,section a,should be read so that potential fines or penalties can not form the basis of an fca reverse claim.in support of its argument,georgia gulf principally relies on united states,ex rel.american textile mfrs,v.the limited,cir a reverse false claim action can not proceed without proof that the defendant made a false record or statement at a time that the defendant owed to the government an obligation sufficiently certain to give rise to an action of debt at common law and united states q international courier,cir quick holding that under the fca an obligation must be for a fixed sum that is immediately due.
georgia gulf contends that,following the reasoning of american textile atmi,a defendant must have made or submitted a false record at the time that the defendant owed an obligation to the government sufficiently certain to give rise to an action of debt at common law atmi,at.the sixth circuit in atmi based its decision in part on quick,but also referred to the difference between a claim and an obligation.the court stated,c laims encompass requests for payment not only based on contracts,but also because of the many privileges and benefits doled out by the government.when seen in context,the act use of obligation suggests a more limited meaning at.in quick,the court held that in order to prevail,the government must show that there was an existing,specific legal duty in the nature of a debt that quick or the other defendants owed the united states at the time of their violative activities.georgia gulf agrees with these readings of the statute,contending that a defendant must have made a false record at the time that the defendant owed an obligation to the government sufficiently certain to give rise to an action of debt at common law.
on the other hand,bain argues that potential fines and penalties should be considered obligations for the purposes of section a.to bolster his argument,bain relies on the opinion in united states,d,for the proposition that congress desired the fca to be given a broad reading and intended it to reach all types of fraud,without qualification,that might result in financial loss to the government.although that case was decided well before the legislation which,among other things,added the section a reverse false claims act provision,stat.october,the above passage from was quoted with approval in the legislative history of section a.see.at,reprinted in at.following this reasoning,the district court held that in submitting false records and documents,georgia gulf prevented the government from collecting fines or penalties that it could have imposed and received if the records had been accurate,and therefore bain stated a claim.
bain also cites united states pemco aeroplex,cir,for the proposition that the existence of a need for further government action before an obligation is liquidated does not preclude a reverse false claims action.in that case,the court found that a reverse false claim existed when the defendant had an existing agreement with the government,in the form of an actual contract,that created a specific legal obligation at that time to dispose of any excess property in accordance with the government instructions.the eleventh circuit distinguished quick because that case did not involve a government contract,and held that a potential obligation satisfied the requirements of section a.see also united states ex rel.sequoia orange oxnard lemon,wl.may,violation of an administrative enforcement statute constituted an obligation united states mcginnis,wl,defendant failure to report and record pollution discharge as required by the clean water act supported a reverse false claim however,this case has been superseded by atmi.
the united states,as amicus herein,takes the position that the statute does not require that there always be a specific fixed legal obligation at the time the alleged false record or statement was made.according to the government,there are essentially two ways an obligation within the meaning of section a could arise first,there may be a fixed obligation,spelled out by a judgment,contract,statute,or regulation,that imposes a duty on the person to pay money or transmit property to the government.this fixed obligation may be liquidated,as with a judgment,or it may be unliquidated but easily determinable,as with the tariffs or fees due on imported goods.avoidance of a fixed obligation is indisputably a sufficient condition supporting a reverse false claims action under section a.the government goes on to state that contrary to georgia gulf contention such an existing fixed obligation is not always necessary to state a reverse claim,provided that the obligation avoided,though only
