conoco and condea vista chemical company appeal the district court order granting summary judgment to geraghty and miller,in this environmental action.this case includes a claim under cercla,the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act,as well as state common law claims.we affirm in part and,because a genuine issue exists as to certain material facts,we reverse in part.
the parties do agree on a sufficient number of background facts to set the stage.this dispute arises out of an environmental at the lake charles chemical complex in westlake,louisiana.the complex has been owned and operated by conoco or vista since,and in conoco began managing ethylene dichloride at the facility.ethylene dichloride,a feedstock in the production of vinyl chloride monomer,is a hazardous substance as cercla defines that term.as a result of historic releases and migration,ethylene dichloride contamination occurred in soil from the surface to at least feet down and in shallow groundwater zones.
the louisiana department of environmental quality required conoco to investigate and address the ethylene dichloride contamination under state groundwater protection laws and regulations and federal and state solid waste laws and regulations.it also required conoco to put in place a groundwater monitoring and assessment program pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra,and its corresponding regulations and their louisiana state counterparts.as is often the case in such,the process was set to take place in stages.conoco and entered into a contract on march,under which was to furnish all required services for quality assessment,phase at the vinyl chloride monomer plant area and waste water treatment area the plant of the complex.vista was a beneficiary under the contract.
under the contract,was to assess possible contamination beneath several suspected source areas at the complex.it was to perform that assessment by preparing design specifications for the installation of groundwater monitor wells and piezometers used to monitor possible groundwater contamination at the complex installing the monitor wells and piezometers and sampling the monitor wells following installation.completed the installation of fifty monitor wells on july.
for approximately the following year,sampled the monitor wells and interpreted the monitoring data to determine the nature and extent of contamination.submitted quarterly reports to to advise them of the results.
sometime before may,began to suspect potentially serious technical and physical deficiencies in three of the monitor wells had installed.they were concerned that such deficiencies were aggravating the contamination.received approval from the louisiana department in may to plug and abandon those wells.allege that they uncovered physical evidence that the three wells were not installed according to the contract specifications,and they sent a series of letters to concerning the deficiencies.in december,plugged and abandoned a fourth well,and they allege that this well also was not installed according to specifications.
these experiences caused to question the soundness of the remaining wells and other parts of the groundwater monitoring system.and discussed who was responsible for the costs associated with these allegedly defective wells,but they were unable to resolve the issue.on august,the parties entered into the groundwater wells interim agreement.the interim agreement called for the parties to agree upon criteria for determining whether a given monitor well was suspect or not suspect of being improperly installed,and to agree upon criteria for determining whether a given well was properly or not properly installed.once the criteria were in place,the parties would apply them to each of the wells to determine which needed to be removed and who would bear the costs.that never occurred,however,because the parties never agreed on the criteria.
the parties entered into the interim agreement to allocate responsibility between them for the costs of plugging and abandoning additional wells that they were to agree upon as being suspect.maintains that there was no other purpose for entering into the deal,but insist that the interim agreement gave the parties time to investigate the integrity of the wells while not allowing the statute of limitations to run on any defect claims that remained unresolved.assert that received,as consideration for the deal,a release from approximately in monitor well plugging and abandonment costs.
retained other environmental consulting firms to continue the groundwater assessment program.upon the recommendation of one such consultant,plugged and abandoned the remaining installed wells in and replaced them.
in april,filed suit against in texas state court,alleging state common law causes of action.during the course of that litigation,the texas court of appeals held that the language in the interim agreement concerning a possible tolling and extension of the statute of limitations was ambiguous as a matter of law.
in april,with the state court lawsuit still pending,filed the instant cercla action,seeking reimbursement from for past and future response costs.filed a counterclaim two months later,also seeking relief under sections and of cercla.meanwhile,the state court case was trifurcated for trial,with the first phase focused on whether the interim agreement tolled the statutes of limitations.trial began in phase one in november and,while the jury was deliberating,took a voluntary and the state court judge dismissed the lawsuit.
after the district court granted partial summary judgment to,amended their counterclaim to omit their section cercla claim and to add the state common law claims.ultimately,voluntarily dismissed its complaint,leaving only cercla section and state common law counterclaims at issue.
less than a month before this case was to begin trial,unsuccessfully sought leave to file a partial summary judgment motion on the basis that cercla counterclaim was.when the parties appeared for trial on the scheduled date,the district court discussed the case with counsel and suspended the start of the trial.less than a week later,the district court granted summary judgment to on several grounds including that the cercla claim was.
the district court held that state common law claims were barred by texas statutes of limitations that was not liable for contribution because it was not a covered person under cercla as an operator,arranger,or transporter of hazardous materials and that the limitation period of g barred cercla claim.we address each of these issues,along with complaint that the district court entered summary judgment without giving them notice and an opportunity to respond.
the district court entered summary judgment for without providing the notice required by rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.argue that they were unfairly prejudiced because they did not have notice that the district court was contemplating entering a dispositive order,nor did they have an opportunity to respond or to present evidence.we review under the harmless error standard.see nowlin resolution trust,cir.
by the time this case reached its trial date,had filed three motions for partial summary judgment and had attempted to file a fourth.the district court had granted motion that be declared covered persons under cercla,had denied motion that it be declared not to be a covered person,and had yet to rule on motion seeking summary judgment on state common law claims.had filed briefs and affidavits in opposition to those three motions.had sought leave to file a motion that the remaining cercla claim be declared barred by the statute of limitations,but the district court denied leave because the motion was untimely.thus,all of the issues except the cercla statute of limitations had been fully briefed by the time the case was ready for trial.
when the district court entered its order granting complete summary judgment to,the parties expected to be in the midst of a trial.when they arrived for trial on the appointed day,the district court announced the view that it would be beneficial to take some time to narrow the issues so that the evidence could be streamlined.the court indicated that it would review the file and directed the parties to return the following day to begin trial.after its review,the district court concluded that all of the claims were amenable to judgment as a matter of law.
while the district court erred by not observing the notice requirements of rule c,this procedural error was later cured.after the district court entered its summary judgment order,filed a motion for trial along with a brief on the cercla statute of limitations issue.in their motion,pointed out what they believed to be disputed material facts and offered citations to the record for those facts.they did not,however,submit any additional affidavits or documentary evidence.
pointed out that they had not received notice and an opportunity to respond to the cercla statute of limitations issue,as the court had denied leave to file its partial summary judgment motion on that issue.to support their argument,attached an affidavit and an exhibit to their separate brief on the cercla statute of limitations issue.
the district court considered both the motion and the brief and determined that summary judgment was still appropriate.the district court thus revisited all of the issues in the summary judgment order.ultimately had an opportunity to be heard on all of the issues and the district court judgment consideration and ruling cured any procedural defect.see barney irs,cir united states shelly riverside heights lot x.
district courts are empowered to enter summary judgment sua sponte.see celotex catrett,d.although we disagree with some of the district court legal conclusions,its consideration of summary judgment in the first instance without notice and hearing was harmless error.
we turn now to the district court rulings on the substantive legal issues.we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.see uniroyal chemical deltech,cir.bears the burden of showing the absence of evidence to support case,and must set forth specific facts demonstrating a genuine issue for trial.we view the facts in the light most favorable to and draw all reasonable inferences in their favor.if set forth specific facts essential to their claims,a genuine issue of material fact will preclude summary judgment.see coleman houston indep.school,cir.
cercla contains different statutes of limitations for section a actions and for section contribution actions.see g b statute for initial action for recovery of remedial costs under section a,triggered by beginning of physical construction g period for contribution action under section,with three alternative triggering events a prior judgment,an administrative order,or a judicially approved settlement.whether a party is seeking recovery under section a or contribution under section does not always determine the applicable statute of limitations.in cases such as this one where a party seeks contribution but none of the triggering events has occurred,congress did not designate the statute of limitations.
the district court determined that cercla claim is governed and barred by the statute of limitations.the court characterized this as an initial action for the recovery of remediation costs and found that initiated remedial construction in.according to the district court application,the statute of limitations expired in.because did not file their cercla counterclaim until,the district court found it.
argue that their cercla contribution claim is governed by the limitations period,as g is the only section that on its face applies to contribution actions.insist that their counterclaim was timely because it was filed before any of the triggering events contained in section g occurred.under their theory,it is indeterminate when the limitations period would ever expire.
in the alternative,assert that,even if section g applies,the statute of limitations has not run or material facts are in dispute as to whether it has run.they further assert that waived the affirmative defense of section g by not properly or timely pleading it.
the circuits are split on the appropriate statute of limitations to apply in a case that is neither a recovery claim under section nor derivative of or responsive to any other formalized dispute.there are three basic approaches to the issue,see city of merced fields,collecting cases,but our court has not yet adopted any of the three.under the first approach,we would find that the plain language of section g establishes no statute of limitations for this case.under the second,we would use the statute of limitations in section g,for reasons explained below.under the third,we would use the statute of limitations in section g and import another triggering event from federal common law.see id.
we conclude that the tenth circuit reasoning in favor of the second approach in sun,cir,is the most persuasive.in sun,the tenth circuit analyzes the statutory framework and applies it in a practical way.its rationale begins with the explanation that while section f is the vehicle for bringing a contribution action,it does not create a new cause of action or create any new liabilities.rather,it is a mechanism for apportioning costs that are recoverable under section.see id.at citing cases.in other words,a section contribution action is a claim for collection of the costs referred to in section.by definition,the tenth circuit reasons,a contribution action is merely one type of action.see id.at.if there has been no prior section action,a contribution action becomes an initial action for recovery of the costs referred to in section of this title,and must be brought within years after initiation of physical construction of the remedial action.id.quoting g b.
we hold that the statute of limitations found in cercla section g applies to initial contribution actions such as this.if we were to accept argument and apply section g,the statute of limitations would be indefinite because a triggering event might never occur.this result would undermine the certainty that statutes of limitations are designed to further.
contrary to argument,did assert this affirmative defense in a sufficiently timely manner.included the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense in its first responsive pleading,thereby putting on notice of the issue.even though initially relied on the limitations period of section g,a mere assertion of the defense satisfies the pleading requirements of rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.see daingerfield island protective soc y babbitt.moreover,the pretrial order recited assertion that the cercla claim was barred by the statute of limitations,with a precise citation to the statute.were not surprised or prejudiced by the district court consideration of the issue.see allied chem.mackay,cir hargett valley fed.sav.bank,cir.
our review of the cercla statute of limitations issue does not end with our determination that section g applies.we must next decide whether response actions at the complex are properly categorized as remedial or removal to determine whether the counterclaim is timely.see g under subsection a,an action for recovery of costs of a removal action must be filed within years after completion of the removal action under subsection b,an action to recover costs of a remedial action must be filed within years after initiation of physical construction of the remedial action.
the district court determined that were engaged in ongoing remediation at the complex and that physical construction began in.it also determined that were currently involved in removal and remediation activities.argue that their counterclaim seeks recovery of costs for what can only be characterized as removal of the contamination.not surprisingly,agrees with the district court determinations that remediation activities were in place and that they began in.
congress provided definitions for removal and remedial action,and the classification of the activity is determined as a matter of law.see advanced micro devices,national semiconductor,d,united states vertac chem,d.in reviewing the undisputed facts and the parties arguments concerning how we should apply the relevant law to those facts,it strikes us that confusion often results because the industry use of remediation is not synonymous with cercla definition of remedial.moreover,the cercla definitions are expansive enough that certain activities may well be covered by both.this is a question of law with some complexity.elements of either response action may overlap and semantics often obscure the actual nature of the cleanup performed.public serv.gates rubber,cir.
although the cases on this issue tend to be highly,certain principles emerge.we have often noted that removal actions generally are immediate or interim responses,and remedial actions generally are permanent responses.see,ohm remediation servs.evans cooperage,cir.in addition,congress intended that the term removal action be given a broad interpretation.see,kelley dupont de nemours and,cir.
with these principles in mind,we conclude that the response action in this case is properly classified as removal.the groundwater quality assessment program that instituted by order of the louisiana department was conducted in three phases.the first phase was one of assessment only,to confirm the presence of contaminants and understand the groundwater flow and other underground conditions.the second the only one that participated a more detailed assessment to determine the extent of contaminants in the first fifty feet of soil and to investigate water quality below that level.the third phase included establishing a groundwater monitoring and remediation program and conducting a feasibility study of remedial alternatives.in the specifications and contract documents,described the third phase as a comprehensive assessment of migrating contaminants,and if necessary,a determination of the appropriate remedial actions necessary to abate contaminant movement.
the operative facts are that installed monitor wells and piezometers at the complex.in describing the scope of the work it was to perform under the contract,stated that it had designed the monitor wells and piezometers to collect data but also so that they can be converted to recovery wells if needed.at the time,apparently did not consider its work to include any remediation efforts,and only considered it a possibility that its work would be part of a recovery effort.
although eventually removed and replaced these wells,they were part of a pilot corrective action program that instituted in response to the louisiana department order.their ultimate use is irrelevant,however,because the crucial response activity is that which occurred during involvement.thus,even if the wells had remained in place and their use converted to an unquestionably remedial purpose,that would not change the classification for statute of limitations purposes.see louisiana braselman,d,monitoring wells were used during investigation and design phases of project their continued use during remedial action phase did not convert the pilot study to remedial action advanced micro devices,d at the fact that the extraction activities ultimately did not turn out to be,because they were implemented in the final remedy four years later,can not now be considered in hindsight.
the undisputed facts show that no permanent remedy was in place for the complex when constructed and installed the wells.even if the wells performed some function that falls within the definition of remedial activity,that does not automatically exclude them from classification as removal activities.there can be some overlap between the two.see general litton indus.automation,cir although cercla lists excavation as an example of remedial activity,excavation can be and under facts of case is a removal activity.
although suggests that a program of this magnitude and duration must be categorized as remedial,we are not persuaded.the record shows that the louisiana department had yet to issue its final decision,and only that decision will define the ultimate remedial strategy for the complex.even if the replacements for these wells are integral to the remediation of the site,that does not mean that their initial placement can not be categorized as removal.see general,at advanced micro devices,d at epa tmg.
we hold that the activities at issue are properly categorized as removal activities,and the statute of limitations does not bar counterclaim for cercla contribution.
having determined that cercla counterclaim was timely,we must next decide whether is a covered person under cercla and therefore amenable to a contribution claim.see cercla a,a the statute defines a covered person as 
the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility,
any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of,
any person who by contract,agreement,or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment,or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment,of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person,by any other party or entity,at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances,and 
any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities,incineration vessels or sites selected by such person,from which there is a release,or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs,of a hazardous substance 
the district court held that is not an operator,arranger,or transporter of hazardous substances the court described as merely an environmental contractor employed to investigate and assist in constructing a facility for remedying contamination already in the soils.
we agree with the district court concerning status as a transporter,but we conclude that the disputed material facts preclude the entry of summary judgment declaring that is not an operator or an arranger.
although the first category of covered persons refers to the owner and operator of a facility,those words are not redundant.in some circumstances the operator may not be the owner.in addition,a facility may have more than one operator.
while we normally begin our analysis with the statutory language,we do not obtain much assistance from the cercla definition of a facility operator as any person operating the facility.a ii.we look then to see how case law has supplied a definition.
u nder cercla,an operator is simply someone who directs the workings of,manages,or conducts the affairs of a facility a n operator must manage,direct,or conduct operations specifically related to pollution,that is,operations having to do with the leakage or disposal of hazardous waste,or decisions about compliance with environmental regulations.
united states bestfoods,d.for one to be considered an operator,then,there must be some nexus between that person or entity control and the hazardous waste contained in the facility.this nexus has been described as a rule that operator liability only attaches if the defendant had authority to control the cause of the contamination at the time the hazardous substances were released into the environment.kaiser aluminum chem.catellus dev,cir see also cpc int l,the most commonly adopted yardstick for determining whether a party is an under cercla is the degree of control that party is able to exert over the activity causing the pollution.
a court must decide whether a contractor is an operator after considering the totality of the circumstances concerning its involvement at the site.see.partnership reade,d.while point out that had a great deal of control over the placement,design and installation of the wells,including the selection and supervision of the subcontractor who performed the actual installation,portrays its role as one of lending advice and expertise to the project that was ultimately controlled by.however,it is more than the portrayal of the roles that is in dispute.the parties also disagree on material facts concerning technical expertise,their supervision of the work,and the parties relative authority at the.because the facts concerning the degree of control over the monit
