synthetic organic chemicals have few direct consumer uses,but they often serve as raw materials in the production of plastics,rubbers,fibers,protective coatings,and detergents.petitioners,the natural resources defense council and the louisiana environmental action network,challenge epa residual risk rulemaking under subsection f of the clean air act for facilities that use or produce synthetic organic chemicals the industry.petitioners also challenge epa technology review under subsection d.in a rather unusual bit of rulemaking,the agency determined by rule not to change its previous rule,which gave rise to petitioners challenge.we deny the petition.
section of the clean air act regulates hazardous air pollutants.when the act was passed in,hazardous air pollutant was defined as a substance which may reasonably be anticipated to result in an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible,or incapacitating irreversible,illness.sierra club epa,citation omitted.the administrator of the epa was required to prepare a list of air pollutants that fell within this definition,then promulgate standards to protect the public health from these substances with an ample margin of safety.id.
as we have explained,this arrangement proved problematic.id.in light of unrealistic time frames and scientific uncertainly over which substances posed a threat to public health,epa only listed eight pollutants as hazardous between and.id.in,congress sought to hasten the process by adopting a new regulatory approach for hazardous air pollutants.rather than have epa list those substances likely to be harmful,the amended version of section provides a list of substances that congress deemed to be hazardous.b.epa could subsequently add to or subtract from this list.id.b.
instead of basing its regulations on health risks the ample margin of safety,epa was required by the amendments to adopt standards in the first instance.that is to say,in the first round of regulation,the agency was obliged to look to the best available control technology to control emissions for each category of major sources that emits one or more of the listed hazardous air pollutants id.d.the control technology used to meet this standard is referred to as the maximum achievable control technology or mact.under this approach,standards for new sources may not be less stringent than the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source.id.d.and for existing sources,the emission standards may not be less stringent than the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing percent of the existing sources.id.after setting the floor,the minimum required reduction in emissions for a new or existing has discretion to require an even greater reduction in emissions,taking into account costs,health effects,environmental effects,and energy requirements id.d.
in the second stage of regulation,epa was obliged to review any residual health risks that had not been eliminated by the initial standards.id.f.this second stage is described as or because it requires epa to set a standard based on a medical assessment of a given pollutant health risks as was true of the statute,rather than the current state of control technology.see generally percival,schroeder,miller leape,environmental regulation law,science policy ed.within six years of promulgating the standards,epa was required to prepare a report to congress analyzing any residual health risks.if congress did not act on the report,then epa was to conduct residual risk analysis under subsection f.
epa initially promulgated emission standards for the industry in there are facilities in the united states that produce or use synthetic organic chemicals those standards required the use of control technologies such as recovery devices,thermal oxidizers,carbon absorbers,and steam strippers.after submitting the required report to congress in,the agency commenced residual risk rulemaking,apparently we discuss read the statute as requiring a rulemaking proceeding to consider whether to revise the standards,since the industry emissions pose lifetime excess cancer risks of greater than million.
in the notice of proposed rulemaking,epa listed two options for the residual risk rulemaking,one of which would have imposed somewhat stricter standards.but the other,which epa adopted in the final rule,fed reg,was a reaffirmation of the existing rule.epa determined that under the existing standard,no individual would face an excess lifetime cancer risk of greater than million,which epa regards as the presumptively acceptable level under its precedents.in the same regulatory procedure,epa sought to satisfy another statutory requirement,subsection d,which commands the administrator to review,and revise as necessary the standards in light of technological developments at least every eight years.d.it concluded there were no such developments.
petitioners challenge epa actions on several grounds.their primary argument is one of statutory construction.they contend that the statute obliged epa,in the residual risk rulemaking,to tighten the standards for the industry so that the lifetime excess cancer risk to exposed persons would be no greater than million.it is also argued that in reviewing the standards,epa violated subsection d by taking costs into account.alternatively,even if epa complied with the statute,petitioners claim that the rulemaking violated the apa,as arbitrary and capricious,because it relied on faulty data and overlooked significant sources of emission.
petitioners contend that subsection f a obliged epa to revise industry standards to reduce lifetime excess cancer risk to million.petitioners rely primarily on the last sentence of that subsection,whereas epa looks to the whole subsection.that provision states in full 
if congress does not act on any recommendation submitted under paragraph,the administrator shall,within years after promulgation of standards for each category or subcategory of sources pursuant to subsection d of this section,promulgate standards for such category or subcategory if promulgation of such standards is required in order to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health in accordance with this section as in effect before november,or to prevent,taking into consideration costs,energy,safety,and other relevant factors,an adverse environmental effect.emissions standards promulgated under this subsection shall provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health in accordance with this section as in effect before november,unless the administrator determines that a more stringent standard is necessary to prevent,taking into consideration costs,energy,safety,and other relevant factors,an adverse environmental effect.if standards promulgated pursuant to subsection d of this section and applicable to a category or subcategory of sources emitting a pollutant or pollutants classified as a known,probable or possible human carcinogen do not reduce lifetime excess cancer risks to the individual most exposed to emissions from a source in the category or subcategory to less than one in one million,the administrator shall promulgate standards under this subsection for such source category.
it is undisputed that facilities that produce or use synthetic organic chemicals emit carcinogens and are,therefore,within the reach of the last sentence.it is also undisputed that,in light of the fact that existing standards do not reduce the risk to less than million,epa was obliged to promulgate standards under subsection f.petitioners contend that the third sentence obviously means that residual risk standards must meet the threshold,epa must reduce such risks to million.that may well be a possible interpretation,but the sentence contains a glaring omission it does not say what petitioners would like us to infer.rather,that sentence instructs the administrator to promulgate standards,but it says nothing about the substantive content of those standards.if congress had wished to set a bright line standard,it would have been rather easy for the draftsmen to say just that.the failure to do so could not have been accidental.in light of the rest of the subsection language and other provisions,it seems to us that the subsection was drafted as a deliberately ambiguous compromise 
we reach that conclusion because the second sentence,which sets forth the substantive standard to be applied,simply calls for standards that provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health unless the administrator wishes to go further to avoid adverse environmental effects.no distinction is drawn between carcinogens and.the third sentence,on which petitioners rely,not only lacks the language that petitioners ask us to infer it also specifically states that if the million trigger is met,the administrator must promulgate standards under this subsection,which,perforce,takes us back to the second sentence 
epa construction of the subsection is bolstered by another paragraph,f b,which states 
nothing in subparagraph a or in any other provision of this section shall be construed as affecting,or applying to the administrator interpretation of this section,as in effect before november,and set forth in the federal register of september,federal register.
f b.the cited item in the federal register is epa emission standard for benzene,which is a carcinogenic hazardous air pollutant.in the benzene rulemaking,epa set forth its interpretation of ample margin of safety,as that term was used in the version of the clean air act.it said that the ample margin was met if as many people as possible faced excess lifetime cancer risks no greater than million,and that no person faced a risk greater than million thousand.at.in other words,the benzene standard established a maximum excess risk of million,while adopting the million standard as an aspirational goal.this standard,incorporated into the amended version of the clean air act,undermines petitioners assertion that epa must reduce residual risks to million for all sources that emit carcinogenic hazardous air pollutants.
petitioners respond that subsection f b is a savings clause that only preserves epa specific regulations regarding benzene.but the text belies this contention.subsection f b makes clear that nothing in subparagraph a shall be construed as affecting,or applying to the administrator interpretation of section,as set forth in the benzene standard.the word interpretation indicates that the savings clause is not limited to epa determinations,but applies broadly to the agency construction of the clean air act in the benzene standard.petitioners also contend that subsection b should only be read as applying to,but this is not persuasive.subsection f b incorporates epa interpretation of the clean air act from the benzene standard,and the text of this provision draws no distinction between carcinogens and.indeed,benzene is itself a carcinogen.at,so it would make little sense for congress to incorporate this standard only for.
the parenthetical clause in the second sentence of subsection f a lends further support to epa position.that sentence states e missions standards promulgated under this subsection shall provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health in accordance with this section as in effect before november,epa interprets the parenthetical as a shorthand reference to the benzene standard,given that subsection b uses almost identical language,incorporating the administrator interpretation of this section,as in effect before november,and set forth in the federal register the phrase this section as in effect before november,is certainly broad enough to encompass epa prior interpretations of this section as well as the text itself.in fact,the operative provision of the version of section uses the exact same ample margin of safety language as subsection f a currently uses.see sierra club,at.thus,the parenthetical must refer to something more than the bare text of this section,or else it would be surplusage.
petitioners insist that epa interpretation renders the third sentence effectively meaningless.to be sure,the third sentence,as epa interprets it,seems relatively anodyne it lacks substantive force.but,at least as epa reads it,the word promulgate means the agency is obliged to conduct a rulemaking to consider residual risks for sources that emit carcinogens.that extra procedural step is not a trivial obligation.congress often imposes procedural requirements without dictating substantive outcomes.see,strycker bay neighborhood council karlen,d discussing the national environmental policy act.we also disagree with petitioners argument that epa did not promulgate standards under subsection f because it simply readopted the initial standards.this position finds no support in the text of the statute.subsection f only mandates that residual risk standards provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health.if epa determines that the existing standards already provide an ample margin of safety,then the agency is free to readopt those standards during a residual risk rulemaking.
finally,petitioners argue that epa unlawfully considered cost while setting the ample margin of safety in the residual risk standards.petitioners are correct that the supreme court has refused to find implicit in ambiguous sections of the clean air act an authorization to consider costs that has elsewhere,and so often,been expressly granted.whitman am.trucking ass n,d.in this case,however,we believe the clear statement rule has been satisfied.as explained above,subsection f b expressly incorporates epa interpretation of the clean air act from the benzene standard,complete with a citation to the federal register.in that rulemaking,epa set its standard for benzene at a level that provides an ample margin of safety in consideration of all health information as well as other relevant factors including costs and economic impacts,technological feasibility,and other factors relevant to each particular decision.at emphasis added.epa considered cost in benzene,and subsection f b makes clear that nothing in the amended version of the clean air act shall affect the agency interpretation of the statute from that rulemaking.
in sum,we conclude that epa interpretation of subsection f,although not an inevitable one,certainly is,at least,a reasonable construction of the statute.see chevron,nrdc,d.
petitioners second statutory argument is based on subsection d,which states 
the administrator shall review,and revise as necessary taking into account developments in practices,processes,and control technologies,emissions standards promulgated under this section no less often than every years.
d.it is argued that epa was obliged to completely recalculate the maximum achievable control other words,to start from scratch.we do not think the words review,and revise as necessary can be construed reasonably as imposing any such obligation.even if the statute did impose such an obligation,petitioners have not identified any technological innovations that epa has overlooked.
more troublesome,however,is petitioners assertion that the agency improperly considered costs in considering whether to revise the standards.epa did,in fact,state in its notice of proposed rulemaking that leakless components should not be considered the maximum achievable control technology because of the high cost of replacing existing components.at.that could be thought in tension with our cases holding that epa may not consider costs in setting the maximum achievable control technology floors,but only in determining whether to require beyond the floor reductions in emissions see lime ass epa,see also nrdc epa.epa may have done just that in setting the initial floors.yet the time period for challenging those standards has long since passed,b,which raises the question whether epa reaffirmation of its reasoning in its technology review gives rise to a new opportunity for petitioners to challenge this apparent defect 
fortunately,we do not have to decide this question because in its final rule,epa squarely found that there were no significant developments in practices,processes and control technologies,and petitioners do not challenge this conclusion.at.since that is the core requirement of
