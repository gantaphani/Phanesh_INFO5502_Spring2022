petitioners seek review of permits issued by the united states environmental protection agency epa authorizing the operators of log transfer facilities in alaska to release bark and woody debris into marine waters.we conclude that the epa failed to provide adequate notice and opportunity for comment prior to issuing the final general permits,and we grant the petition for review in part.
to achieve the goal of reducing and eventually eliminating pollution,congress prohibited the discharge of any pollutant from a point source into the waters of the united states,unless that discharge complies with the clean water act cwa of.a.the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes is one of the primary means of controlling water pollution under the cwa.see cwa.under the npdes,a pollutant can not be discharged from a point source unless the discharge is authorized by an npdes permit.see see also cwa.a state may create its own program for issuing npdes permits.see cwa a c,a c.alaska has not chosen to do so,and thus the epa issues npdes permits for discharges of pollutants within alaska.
npdes permits come in two varieties individual and general.an individual permit authorizes a specific entity to discharge a pollutant in a specific place and is issued after an informal agency adjudication process.see.general permits,on the other hand,are issued for an entire class of hypothetical dischargers in a given geographical region and are issued pursuant to administrative rulemaking procedures.see id,a.general permits may appropriately be issued when the dischargers in the geographical area to be covered by the permit are relatively homogenous.see id.a.after a general permit has been issued,an entity that believes it is covered by the general permit submits a notice of intent to discharge pursuant to the general permit.id.b.a general permit can allow discharging to commence upon receipt of the notice of intent,after a waiting period,or after the permit issuer sends out a response agreeing that the discharger is covered by the general permit.id.b iv.whichever of these three authorization methods is used in the general permit,the permit issuer can require a particular discharger to undergo the individual permit application process.id.b.
under the cwa,each state sets its own water quality standards,subject to review and approval by the epa.see cwa.before approving a state proposed standards,the epa must be satisfied that the standards comply with the requirements of the cwa.cwa a,a.alaska has enacted water quality standards that have been approved by the epa.see alaska admin.code tit,ch.
before the epa can issue either an individual or a general npdes permit,the state in which the discharge will occur must certify,or waive its right to certify,that the discharge authorized by the permit will comply with the state water quality standards.cwa a,a b.
because of alaska unique and rugged terrain,most logs cut in alaska are transported to market through marine waters.for transport,the logs are tied together into bundles that form log rafts.the bundles are placed into the water at log transfer facilities ltfs.see note.from these points,the bundles are towed to destinations such as sawmills and shipping ports.
during this process,particularly at the point where the logs are placed into the water,the logs rub against each other and sometimes against the bottom of the body of water.this friction,as well as the contact of the logs with the water itself,causes bark and woody debris to be rubbed or broken off and released into the water.different methods of placing the logs into the water result in different amounts of bark and woody debris being released.bark and woody debris remain in the water and do not decay for many years.in areas where the water lacks strong currents or where high amounts of bark and woody debris enter the water,the bark and woody debris can accumulate into significant concentrations.these accumulations of bark and woody debris create problems for marine life and worsen the quality of the water.
the epa identified bark and woody debris as a pollutant in the early.consequently,the epa required new ltfs to obtain individual permits before discharging bark and woody debris.see water quality act of,a,stat,see also cwa,note.
most ltfs in existence before october,however,have not been required to obtain new permits.congress enacted a special statutory provision allowing them to continue discharging under the authority of permits issued pursuant to prior statutory authority.see water quality act b see also note.however,if the epa determines,after the opportunity for a hearing,that an ltf existing permit does not comply with current substantive standards,the epa can modify the permit to incorporate additional requirements in order to ensure compliance with current substantive standards.see id.
in the,the epa came to the conclusion that the pre permits did not comply with the cwa.according to the epa,the pre permits did not include a zone of deposit for underwater accumulations of bark and woody debris at the ltf include uniform monitoring and reporting requirements or provide uniform application of best management practices and specific effluent limitations.
accordingly,the epa proposed to modify all permits for ltfs in alaska.the epa issued for comment a draft general permit that would apply to nearly all ltfs in alaska,including new ltfs and existing ltfs functioning under individual,post npdes permits as well as ltfs functioning under permits.the proposed permit included changes in monitoring and reporting requirements,management practices,and effluent limitations.it also noted that alaska proposed to allow a zone of deposit for bark and woody debris,defined by accumulations of percent cover that exceed four inches depth at any point,and to allow patchy distribution of bark beyond the zone of deposit.
a zone of deposit,a creature of alaska state law,is an area in which alaska water quality standards can be violated.see alaska admin.code tit,a.alaska water quality standards consist of maximum levels for the amount of pollutants that can be in waters of different classifications.see id.b.bark and woody debris fall into the category residues.the maximum amount of residue that can be in the highest class of water is defined as the amount that does not make the water unfit or unsafe for use,or cause a sludge,solid,or emulsion to be deposited beneath or upon the surface of the water,within the water column,on the bottom,or upon adjoining shorelines.id.b at.the parties interpret this provision as meaning that,in general,any bark or woody debris released into the water would violate this standard.because a zone of deposit is an area in which the standards can be violated,however,bark or woody debris can be released into an approved zone of deposit without violating alaska water quality standards.
the size for the zones had been prior practice for at least some permits and some individual npdes permits.as noted by the epa in the draft general permit,the size for the zones stemmed from interim guidelines promulgated by the alaska timber task force attf in.
as it was required to do,the epa sought certification from alaska before it finalized the proposed general permit for ltfs in alaska.the alaska department of environmental conservation adec is the alaska agency that provides such certification,and it follows its own public comment and review procedures before providing certification.the epa noted this fact in the draft general permit,stating that p ersons wishing to comment on state certification of the proposed general npdes permit should submit written comments within this public notice period to adec.
in its first and second draft certifications,adec proposed that the zones of deposit be one acre of continuous bark coverage at least ten centimeters deep at any point.it also indicated that a zone of deposit could include patchy or discontinuous coverage outside the one acre of continuous coverage.it proposed that ltfs be required to submit remediation plans detailing feasible means of reducing bark and woody debris when an accumulation exceeded acres
