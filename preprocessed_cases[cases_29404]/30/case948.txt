the rattlesnake coalition the coalition appeals the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and lack of standing of its action against the united states environmental protection agency the epa,the administrator of the epa,and the city of missoula missoula.the coalition brought suit under the national environmental policy act nepa,seeking injunctive,declaratory,and other relief related to the preparation of environmental assessments eas and environmental impact statements eiss prior to implementation of the missoula wastewater facilities plan update mwfpu.the coalition argues that the district court erred by evaluating its complaint as two separate nepa claims relating to two constituent projects of the mwfpu,and thereby concluding that the mwfpu itself was not a single,major federal action subject to nepa regulations.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm the district court.
in the missoula planned and made many improvements to its wastewater treatment and collection system.in,missoula created the wastewater advisory group,consisting of representatives from city and county departments,to lead the efforts to update the wastewater treatment plan.in,missoula published the mwfpu,which identified improvements necessary over a period and suggested the implementation of several projects costing more than million.mwfpu goals included developing plans for wastewater treatment to protect the clark fork river and for serving unsewered areas with a wastewater collection and treatment system.federal funds were not used in the creation of mwfpu.
in,missoula applied for a grant of million from the epa to support completion of the wastewater treatment plant upgrade wtpu,a constituent project of mwfpu.the epa awarded the grant on september,subject to the epa nepa review.the nepa review consisted first of the epa adoption of an ea prepared by the montana department of environmental quality deq to assess the environmental impact of the projects identified in mwfpu.also,on june,the epa signed a finding of no significant impact fonsi for mwfpu,which it published in the missoulian newspaper on june.the epa received no significant comments regarding the fonsi,and on july,the epa notified missoula of its final approval of mwfpu for purposes of the million grant.
from november,to september,the epa dispensed all of the million grant.missoula completed the wtpu in october,expending the entirety of the federal grant in the completion of the project.
in,the united states congress appropriated to the epa earmarked for missoula rattlesnake sewer project rsp.on may,the epa regional office advised montana deq that the epa would undertake a nepa review specific to the rsp.on july,missoula applied to the epa for a grant of the money from the appropriation.
on may,the coalition filed a complaint against the epa and missoula alleging that the epa should have prepared an eis on both the wtpu and the rsp.the coalition sought declaratory,injunctive and other relief against the epa and missoula to prevent missoula from taking any action related to the planned construction of the rsp until the epa complied with nepa.
both the epa and missoula filed federal rule of civil procedure b motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court granted both defendants motions,concluding that missoula mwfpu was not a major federal action triggering nepa application.the district court interpreted the coalition complaint as alleging two separate nepa violations one relating to the wtpu grant and one relating to the application for rsp funding.
the district court concluded that the coalition did not have constitutional standing with regard to the million grant to missoula in for the wtpu,concluding that any harm it suffered was not redressable because the upgrades were complete and the federal funds were expended.as for the rsp appropriation,the district court ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the epa had not taken a final agency action as required to trigger application of nepa.
the district court also concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the coalition claims against missoula.the district court based its dismissal on the fact that missoula,as a actor,was not subject to the requirements of nepa.the district court further held that the coalition lacked standing to bring the action because missoula could finance the construction of the rsp solely with state funds and avoid nepa requirements altogether.
on september,the district court filed an order dismissing the case against both missoula and the united states for lack of standing and lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the coalition timely appealed.

preliminarily,the united states argues that the coalition waived its ability to oppose the district court rulings by failing in its opening brief to challenge the district court determination that the coalition lacked standing because any injury it suffered from the wtpu is not redressable,and the district court lacked jurisdiction over disposition of the claim regarding the rsp because there has been no final agency action by the epa.we reject this argument because the coalition challenged both of the district court findings in its opening brief.
the federal rules of appellate procedure require that a brief contain the appellant contentions and the reasons for them,with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies fed.a a.issues raised in an opening brief but not supported by argument are considered abandoned.estelle,cir int l union of bricklayers allied craftsman local union,martin jaska,cir w e will not ordinarily consider matters on appeal that are not specifically and distinctly raised and argued in the appellant opening brief.
the coalition opening brief challenges both of the district court rulings in the body of its opening brief.the coalition discussion of what constitutes a major federal action under nepa and its argument that the district court should have evaluated the mwfpu as a single,major federal action instead of separately evaluating the wtpu and the rsp,constitute a challenge to the district court dismissal for lack of standing.the coalition also contends in its opening brief that the epa waived sovereign immunity under the administrative procedure act apa so that nepa provides jurisdiction for this action.
the coalition opening brief mounts an attack on both of the district court rulings.we therefore reject the waiver argument presented by the united states and proceed to analyze the coalition appeal.
we first address the coalition claim that the district court erred in evaluating the complaint as containing two separate nepa claims involving two distinct projects.the coalition argues that the district court should have evaluated the mwfpu to determine if it,and not its constituent projects,was a single,major federal action.the coalition contends that had the district court found mwfpu to be a major federal action,it would have found that the coalition injury was redressable in the form of adequate environmental review of the uncompleted portion of the mwfpu in accordance with nepa and a stay of further construction of the project until that review is completed.the coalition argument fails,however,because there is insufficient federal control over mwfpu to make it a major federal action under nepa.
to trigger the application of nepa,an action must be federal.c see also a actions include new and continuing activities,including projects and programs entirely or partly financed,assisted,conducted,regulated,or approved by federal agencies emphasis added.while t here are no clear standards for defining the point at which federal participation transfo
