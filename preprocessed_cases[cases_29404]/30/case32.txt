invoking diversity jurisdiction,appellant travelers casualty and surety company,travelers sought a declaratory judgment that appellee providence washington insurance company,pwic is obliged to join in the defense of new england container company,ne container or necc,in connection with a contribution action involving costs for the rhode island centredale manor superfund site superfund site or site.granting summary judgment to pwic,the district court ruled that pwic did not owe ne container a duty to defend in the underlying action.on travelers appeal,we reverse the decision,vacate the judgment,and remand.
background 
the dispute between the two insurance companies stems from efforts that the environmental protection agency epa initiated over a decade ago to remediate environmental contamination at the superfund site under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla.see.this case touches only the tip of the litigation iceberg regarding the site to decide it,we broach rhode island law on the duty to defend in the environmental damage context,albeit under circumstances in which the rhode island supreme court has had little opportunity to apply its own precedents.
the catalyst for this litigation occurred in,when the epa issued a unilateral administrative order to compel several entities,including ne container and emhart industries,emhart,to remove hazardous substances that had been disposed of at the site as part of the former operations of several companies.the agency noted that hazardous substances had been found in surface and subsurface soil,in sediment,and in the groundwater and surface water of the adjacent woonasquatucket river.it described emhart as a successor to the liability of several chemical companies that had operated at the site from about to approximately and had buried drums and other containers at the site.the epa also stated that ne container had conducted business operations at the site from approximately to around.those operations included obtaining gallon drums containing residual chemicals,disposing of drum residuals in the soil,and incinerating the residuals.finally,the current owners of the site property were identified as two limited partnerships that had acquired the property in and,respectively,and had constructed two apartment buildings,a roadway and parking lots in the mid and the early.
some years after the administrative order was issued,in emhart filed federal and state court actions against ne container and the two ne container insurers that are the parties currently before us emhart action or emhart complaint each action levied essentially the same general claims that ne container is liable for at least some of the response costs that emhart has been paying,and would pay in the future,in connection with the of the superfund site and that ne container insurers are obliged under their policies to provide coverage to ne container for any monies that it owes emhart in relation to the site response costs the insurers had provided general commercial liability policies to ne container during different time periods from the late through the mid.travelers policies extended from to,and pwic policies spanned the years to.
ne container subsequently tendered the emhart action to its insurers.travelers agreed to contribute to ne container defense pursuant to a reservation of rights,while pwic took the position that it had no duty to defend.travelers has since incurred significant defense costs associated with the emhart action,bringing us to the matter that is the basis for this appeal.
in,travelers filed the instant action in federal court,seeking a judgment compelling pwic to contribute to ne container defense in the emhart action and an award for pwic fair share of the past defense costs that travelers has incurred.the two insurance companies eventually filed for summary judgment.the district court ruled that pwic was not contractually obligated to defend ne container in the emhart action,observing that,the alleged property damage occurred before the commencement of the pwic policy period between and.this timely appeal followed.as we explain,the district court mistakenly focused solely on the timing of the insured alleged polluting activities,rather than also considering the potential timing of property damage caused by those activities.
ii.analysis 
this diversity case is governed by rhode island substantive law.our review is de novo because the question of an insurer duty to defend is one of law in rhode island.see flori allstate ins.before delving into the particulars of the case we outline the legal landscape.
rhode island insurance law 
generally speaking,an insurer obligations toward its insured are a duty to defend and a duty to indemnify.see,mellow med.malpractice joint underwriting ass of,per curiam.t he duty to defend is broader in its scope than the duty of an insurer to indemnify,and its existence does not depend on whether the injured party will ultimately prevail against the insured.employers fire ins.beals,abrogated on other grounds by peerless ins.viegas.whether an insurer duty to defend arises from the inception of a lawsuit against its policyholder hinges 
on whether the complaint in the underlying tort action alleges facts and circumstances bringing the case within the coverage afforded by the policy.that question is resolved by comparing the complaint in that action with the policy issued by the insurer if the complaint discloses a statement of facts bringing the case potentially within the risk coverage of the policy the insurer will be to defend irrespective of whether the plaintiffs in the tort action can or will ultimately prevail.
flori,at emphasis added accord hingham mut.fire ins.heroux.
rhode island thus applies the common pleadings test.see progressive cas.ins.narragansett auto sales,see also emhart,at reviewing rhode island law.as suggested by its name,the pleadings test focuses on the pleading allegations without consideration of extrinsic evidence therefore,the duty to defend may arise even where known facts conflict with the facts alleged in the complaint.flori,at see also beals,at concluding that a liability insurer duty to defend is predicated not upon information in its possession which indicates or even proves,but instead upon the allegations in the complaint filed against the insured.
once triggered,an insurer duty to defend continues until the coverage question is resolved either by the establishment of facts showing no potential for coverage or by the conclusion of the underlying lawsuit.see shelby ins.ne.structures,conanicut marine,ins.of.an insurer may seize the initiative and seek resolution of coverage questions,including the duty to defend,in a declaratory judgment action.see emhart,at construing rhode island law conanicut marine,at see also beals,at.
against this legal backdrop,we set forth the pertinent policy language as informed by rhode island law.we then describe the emhart complaint,and finally turn to assess the grant of summary judgment.
providence washington policies 
the general grant of coverage and duty to defend provisions provide 
the company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an occurrence,and the company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such property damage,even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless,false or fraudulent.
emphasis added.an occurrence is defined as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which results in property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.emphasis added.in turn,property damage,is defined,in part,as physical injury or destruction of tangible property which occurs during the policy period,including the loss of use thereof at any time resulting therefrom emphasis added.with respect to property damage caused by pollution,the policies provide 
this insurance does not apply to property damage arising out of the discharge,dispersal,release or escape of smoke,vapors,soot,fumes,acids,alikis,toxic chemicals,liquids or gases,waste materials or other irritants,contaminants or pollutants into or upon land,the atmosphere or any water course or body of water but this exclusion does not apply if such discharge,dispersal,release or escape is sudden and accidental.
emphasis added.
rhode island case law provides a gloss on the meaning of the term occurrence as set forth in the pwic in the environmental pollution context.especially germane here,the state supreme court has addressed when there has been an occurrence sufficient to trigger coverage under a general liability policy where the insured sustains a chemical spill that results in a property loss that is not discovered until years after the spill took place.cpc int l,northbrook excess surplus ins,clarification denied.the court determined that the policy terms property damage and occurrence were inextricably intertwined,and that coverage extended to 
an event that results in compensable property damage during the policy period.in other words,there can be no occurrence under the policy without property damage that becomes apparent during the policy period,and property loss and compensable damages can not be assessed unless the property damage is discovered or manifests itself.
id.at emphasis added.ultimately,it held that coverage under a general liability policy is triggered by an occurrence that takes place when property damage,which includes property loss,manifests itself or is discovered or in the exercise of reasonable diligence is discoverable.id.at see also textron,aetna cas.and sur.textron wheatfield,textron,aetna cas.and sur.textron gastonia,holding that each part of the cpc int l test independently triggers liability coverage under an policy jeffrey thomas et,new appleman on insurance law library edition f summarizing rhode island approach for environmental property damage coverage triggers.
the parties agree that the only cpc int l trigger category that potentially is implicated in the present circumstances is that an occurrence takes place when the property damage was discoverable in the exercise of reasonable diligence during the policy period,notwithstanding the fact that it was not actually discovered.textron gastonia,at.for this trigger category to implicate coverage under an policy,the rhode island supreme court has explained that 
the contamination must not only exist during the period of coverage,but also be discoverable in the exercise of reasonable diligence.in other words,in order to trigger coverage in the absence of actual discovery,the insured must have had some reason to test for contamination,and must actually have been able to discover it in the exercise of reasonable diligence.
id.at citation omitted see also textron wheatfield,at citing textron gastonia in distilling the components required for the discoverable in the exercise of reasonable diligence coverage trigger.the obligation to exercise reasonable diligence calls upon a reviewing court to examine what the insured should have known,see cpc int l,northbrook excess surplus ins,cir interpreting rhode island law it does not,however,require the business operator to go around looking to find out if it is contaminating anything,textron wheatfield,at internal quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,in the context of the pleadings test,the emhart complaint gives rise to pwic duty to defend ne container if its allegations show the potential that property damage was discoverable in the exercise of reasonable diligence during the policy period,between and.
allegations in the emhart complaint 
the complaint first sketches the epa charges against the multiple polluters of the site,including the notice of potential liability issued to ne container and the epa demand in that emhart remediate the site and reimburse the epa for the response costs.the epa also issued a unilateral administrative order to ne container and emhart,as well as to other entities,requiring them to undertake certain actions to remediate the environmental conditions at the site.the complaint identifies the site as two parcels of land and portions of the adjacent woonasquatucket river and its floodplain.according to the complaint,the epa still needed to complete a remedial investigation to characterize the nature and extent of the contamination at the site 
the emhart complaint also describes ne container alleged polluting activities at the site.it alleges that ne container operated a facility for reconditioning steel drums on a portion of the site from about until the early that the drums often contained small amounts of residue including trichorophenol and that during its business operations ne container had incinerated the drums that it received and spills and leaks of the residual contents of the drums occurred when they were brought to the incinerator.the complaint further states 
t he actions of necc in incinerating drums,as part of the reconditioning process,resulted in the release into the environment,within the meaning of and,of various congeners of dioxin 
in addition to the release of dioxin,the operations of necc resulted in the release into the environment,within the meaning of and,of other hazardous substances,within the meaning of 
d uring the period in which necc was an operator of a portion of the site,there was disposal,within the meaning of,of hazardous substances,within the meaning of,at the site as a result of the activities of necc 
a s a result of activities conducted at the site by necc,there have been releases or threatened releases,within the meaning of and,of hazardous substances,within the meaning of,at and from the site.
the aforesaid releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at the site have caused emhart to incur necessary response costs,within the meaning of,for which necc is liable to emhart for its proportional share 
t here is a controversy between emhart and necc concerning the nature and extent of the obligation of necc to pay for anticipated future response costs with respect to the site.
the complaint describes emhart liability for site as based on the activities of a predecessor chemical manufacturing company that conducted business operations on a portion of the site from the through about.ultimately,emhart sought,among other things,an award for the damages to which it is entitled as a result of the conduct of new england container company,
d.the district court analysis 
the district court determined that the complaint failed to show that the damage potentially occurred between and.the court observed that by,the start date of the pwic insurance policy,ne container no longer had any operations on the centredale manor site,and there was no allegation that ne container had any connection with the property in question during the mid policy time frame.remarking that it had found no rhode island court decision holding that the coverage trigger was satisfied when the policy period did not correspond at all to the period during which the insured conducted its allegedly harmful activities,the district judge underscored that,here,there is not even a small speck of an overlap between the policy period and the period of the insured allegedly damaging activities.
we agree with travelers that looking only to the timing of ne container alleged polluting activities is too narrow a focus,and that rhode island law requires consideration of the potential timing of the property damage itself.
it is true,as the district court noted,that there is a dearth of rhode island case law on the bounds of the reasonable diligence coverage trigger.in fact,textron gastonia and textron wheatfield are about the only cases in which the state supreme court has explored the scope of this coverage trigger,see also truk away of,aetna cas.sur,but neither case did so in the context of an insurer duty to defend,see emhart,at discussing textron cases and concluding that neither provided a holding on the insurers duty to defend.even with little express direction from state precedents,however,we are confident that the discoverable in the exercise of reasonable diligence coverage trigger does not require a temporal overlap between the policy period and the insured active business operations during which the allegedly damaging activity took place.see,travelers indem.children friend,no,wl,at unpub.ruling that under an general liability policy,the timing of the property damage is the relevant focal point for determining the potential for coverage and the insurer duty to defend,and emphasizing that whether the causative event happened during or before the policy period is not material ins.of am.kayser roth,no.pc,wl,at,unpub.following the cpc int l trigger framework and ruling that,at a time when the insured had already closed its facility and long sold the property to a third party,the insured could have discovered with reasonable diligence the environmental property damage resulting from a chemical spill event that took place during its business operations.
as construed by the rhode island courts,the very aim of that state coverage trigger is to make clear that a covered occurrence can indeed take place when the latent injury or damage becomes manifest at some point down the road from the actual polluting event or activity.see textron wheatfield,at.the rhode island supreme court has explained that the reasonable diligence category of coverage trigger,in particular,is meant to address 
the problem of latent injury such as asbestos poisoning or latent damage such as groundwater contamination,when the injury or damage,although covered by the policy,is not immediately discernible or occurs after an unexpected event sets in motion a series of incidents that eventually results in the manifestation of the damage.
id.and,the tandem textron decisions neither purport to truncate,nor operate to truncate,the supreme court holding in cpc int l,which rejected a test premised on when the event occurred in favor of one focusing on the manifestation,discovery or discoverability with reasonable diligence of the resulting property damage.see cpc int l,at.instead,both cases simply display the application of the precedent established under cpc int l in the summary judgment setting,further clarifying that the trigger categories are independent of one another such that actual discovery of the property damage during the policy period is not required.see textron wheatfield,at textron gastonia,at.
to be sure,in both textron cases the insureds polluting activity during the operation of their respective business facilities including spills and leaks into the soil overlapped with the policy periods at issue.see textron wheatfield,at,textron gastonia,at.also in both cases,with respect to the insureds reason to test for,and their ability to discover,the environmental damage during the policy period,the rhode island court noted evidence that their former employees had personal knowledge of the polluting activity taking place during the business operations.see textron wheatfield,at textron gastonia,at.one lesson to be drawn from these cases is that the ultimate resolution of the coverage trigger question between the insured and its insurer depends on evidence that the insured had some reason to test for the contamination and must actually have been able to discover it in the exercise of reasonable diligence during the policy period.but,we read neither case as requiring a temporal overlap between the policy period and the alleged polluting activity during an entity business operations.in each case,the state supreme court simply was addressing the facts of the case as presented.
it may be difficult to unearth evidence and prove for indemnity purposes that property damage occurred in accord with the reasonable diligence coverage trigger during a time frame when the insured has long ceased its business operations that coincided with the pollution activity.still,there is a vast array of factual circumstances in the progressive environmental damage context,and we must take our cue from the rhode island court demarcation of an occurrence coverage trigger for delayed manifestation scenarios.emhart,at concluding that the state court silence on the duty to defend issue does not sufficiently support the claim that the rhode island supreme court would not apply the pleadings test in the cercla context.accordingly,we do not subscribe to the district court narrower view that the emhart complaint failed to show the potential that reasonably discoverable property damage occurred during the mid simply because there was no overlap between the policy period and ne container polluting activities.without this constraint,we consider de novo whether the allegations in the complaint triggered pwic duty to defend.see flori,at.
sufficiency of the allegations under the pleadings test 
pwic contends that the occurrence of property damage at the site during the policy period that is attributable to ne container alleged polluting activities is never even intimated in the emhart complaint.further,it says that there is a complete absence of any allegations showing that ne container had a reason to test for environmental contamination or that any such property damage was capable of detection during the policy periods.in contrast,travelers,although acknowledging that the emhart complaint does not expressly identify the date on which property damage was discoverable at the site,urges that a fair reading of the allegations in accord with the broad pleadings test shows a potential for coverage.travelers has the better view.
the emhart complaint alleges that the epa named both emhart and ne container,among others,as the sources of the environmental damage found throughout the superfund site,a site that incorporates a broad swath of contaminated land and water extending beyond the boundaries of ne container former facility.the complaint description of ne container polluting activities consists of spills and leaks of residuals from the drums,as well as the release of hazards resulting from the incineration of the drums.this pollution may have taken place during the entire course of the facility operations,allegedly spanning from until the early.additionally,according to the complaint,ne container activities caused releases of hazardous substances at and from the site.finally,the complaint notes that the eventual discovery of widespread environmental damage in the late allegedly showed damage both at and in the vicinity of the ne container site,including both land and water contamination.
fairly read,these allegations give rise to the potential that ne container polluting activities may have spanned two decades,and that the pollution migrated from ne container property and eventually caused damage to surrounding land and waterways,which damage was discovered in.while the complaint does not include specific allegations showing when property damage became detectable,the potential magnitude of ne container alleged polluting activities supports a reasonable inference that property damage was discoverable in the exercise of reasonable diligence some time before its actual discovery,including during the policy period.certainly,the complaint raises many questions about the timing and scope of the damage allegedly caused by ne container,and about whether ne container had a reason to test for damage at the site and could have detected damage during the policy period.but faithful application of the pleadings test leads us to conclude that the allegations give rise to the potential that a state of facts exists demonstrating that environmental property damage caused by ne container was discoverable in the exercise of reasonable diligence at the site during the pwic policy period.
it also bears observing that the question of when latent environmental damage became reasonably discoverable is ultimately a matter,often requiring considerable investigation which may not necessarily take place prior to the inception of a private contribution action between multiple polluters.indeed,while the specific timing of the discoverability of latent property damage allegedly caused by the is crucial for purposes of implicating coverage under a particular insurance policy,it is not central to the privat
