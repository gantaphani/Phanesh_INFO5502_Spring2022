this is an environmental protection case in which the plaintiff the city of detroit thought it had reached a settlement with one of the corporate defendants eaton corporation during the second day of trial.when the trial court was advised that eaton and the city had resolved their differences,the terms of the settlement were placed on the record in open court.some weeks later,however,eaton denied that there had been a meeting of the minds with respect to the scope of the contribution protection,indemnification against demands for contribution among tortfeasors that eaton was to receive from the city.the city position was and is that the record contains a clear expression of agreement on the scope of such protection.
professing itself unable to determine precisely what the parties had come to agreement on,the trial court denied a motion by the city for entry of a settlement judgment.the case was eventually tried to completion,and a final judgment was entered on all claims.
upon review,we conclude that the trial court erred in declining to hold eaton to the settlement it had said it was accepting.the record,as we read it,shows that the city lawyer adequately clarified the scope of the agreed contribution protection.the record further shows that eaton lawyer explicitly acknowledged that the clarification was correct.insofar as the district court subsequently found that the record did not manifest a meeting of minds,we are satisfied that the court finding was clearly erroneous.
both the city and the remaining defendants challenge other aspects of the final judgment as well.unpersuaded,we shall reject these challenges.
for a period of several decades ending in,as we understand the uncontested facts,subsidiaries or corporate predecessors of eaton corporation owned and occupied a tract of industrial real estate located at the intersection of french road and grinnell avenue in the city of detroit.there were several buildings on the site,including a factory,a warehouse,a garage,a boiler house,and some office buildings.
various firms occupied the property before and after eaton occupancy.different occupants disposed of different hazardous wastes on the site.the contaminants included polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs,petroleum,and petroleum such as ethyl benzene,toluene,and xylene.
during a period that ended in the property was occupied by defendant equipment,a subsidiary of defendant group.the latter corporation is connected with defendants george,joseph,norina and shirley simon.it will be convenient for us to refer to the simons,equipment,and group collectively as the simon group.
the city of detroit acquired the real estate by condemnation in.the purpose of the city acquisition was to clear flight paths for a municipal airport located on the far side of a railroad track that runs next to the property.
the city demolished the factory and other buildings,cleaned up the pcbs,and,through consultants,made a detailed survey of the remaining contaminants.the city then brought the instant lawsuit against the simon group,eaton,general motors corporation a sometime lessee of the property and others.the relief sought included both recovery of the environmental cleanup and investigation costs already incurred by the city and entry of a declaratory judgment with respect to future remediation costs.the city claims were based in part on the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act,et.cercla,and the former michigan environmental response act mera,et,now recodified in part of the michigan natural resources and environmental protection act,et.nrepa.
in the city moved for partial summary judgment on a claim that the simon group was responsible for all of the pcb cleanup costs.the district court granted the motion,ultimately awarding the city for reimbursement of its costs plus attorney fees.general motors was dismissed with the acquiescence of the city.
on march,the case went to trial on the remaining claims against the simon group and eaton.shortly before the trial was to resume the next day,the court was informed that eaton and the city had reached a settlement.the terms of the settlement were promptly memorialized,at the court request,in proceedings conducted on the record.with the reader indulgence,we shall describe these proceedings in some detail.
after stating his understanding that there had been a resolution of the dispute between the city and eaton,but no resolution of the dispute between the city and the simon group,the trial judge turned to the city for an account of what was being agreed to.david fink,one of the lawyers representing the city,responded as follows 
the terms of the settlement with eaton will be a full and final settlement in the dispute between the city of detroit and the eaton corporation would be the following 
one,the payment by e aton of million cash that is,no trust funds or anything.it would be one straight payment of million.
two,the city of detroit would provide contribution protection with respect to any claims brought in the past or in the future with respect to this site by the city of detroit.that,of course,would include the pending claims against the simons but would also include any other claim that might be brought by the city of detroit against any other parties.they would have contribution protection.
there would not be any guarantee of indemnification as to claims.the city is not aware of any claims that have been brought or threatened in any way with respect to the site with the exception of issues related to epa and epa has long since given up with respect to the simon defendants.emphasis supplied.
fink went on to describe two obligations to be assumed by eaton an obligation to cooperate with the city on a statutory claim not directly relevant here,and an obligation to cooperate on the city claims against other parties.more specifically,as far as the latter obligation was concerned,fink explained that eaton was agreeing not to object to the city working with experts initially retained by eaton,it being understood that eaton would not have to incur further costs in this connection.
at this point,the transcript shows,james russell,environmental litigation counsel for eaton,asked for permission to confer with.russell may have been referring here to eaton house counsel sharon,or lead trial counsel harry quick,or both.after an discussion between counsel,russell went directly to the expert witness point he offered no objection or other comment regarding fink explanation of the scope of the protection eaton would receive against claims for contribution among tortfeasors.
what russell said was this 
we do not expect a problem in the operation of the last point that f ink has just identified.i do know that we prepared to put that into the agreement.
the reason is that the experts that fink would wish to have are independent contractors they are outside experts.
the court then proposed a way of resolving the expert witness problem,if it was a problem,and russell responded to the court proposal by saying w e have no objection.
fink,on behalf of the city,then returned to the subject of contribution protection 
your honor,the only item on the list that i see that will require any fl e shing out in the agreement itself is the form of the contribution protection and i just want to be clear from the city p er spective and that is that we would expect that any claims brought against eaton that arise from a claim brought by the city,that the defense of that claim would be tendered to the city of detroit and the city would have to affirm,as it would,as to the absolute guarantee to provide that contribution protection brought by the city of detroit but then that the city would,of course,having taken on that responsibility,would control the defense of the claim.emphasis supplied.
at this juncture the court offered a suggestion with regard to the final wording of the agreement with respect to such claims 
well,let me suggest this if there is any dispute,that is to say,as to the wording of this portion of the agreement you will each submit your respective draft to the court and the court will choose between the two.emphasis supplied.
adding that he envisioned the possibility that there may be a dispute over the phraseology of this portion of the agreement,the judge described his proposal for resolving any such dispute as baseball arbitration.russell,speaking on behalf of eaton,said that the court suggestion was fine with us.fink indicated that the suggestion was acceptable to the city as well,as long as the court did not find what i stated on the record is objectionable.
the judge assured fink that i do find it objectionable.fink explained that he wanted to avoid any misunderstanding on the record.in response,the court asked russell if he agreed in principle with what fink had said.russell answered in the affirmative in principle,yes.russell then repeated that eaton had no problem with the court baseball arbitration suggestion.
the transcript continues as follows 
fink your honor,experience suggests to me is the best thing at this point would be to be candid with the court about where the disagreement fell at one point in the settlement negotiations to be sure that the 
the court all right,go ahead.
fink at one point in discussions among counsel there was a suggestion opposing contribution protection might involve the city reimbursing eaton for the cost of defending claims under the circumstances 
the trial court,unfortunately,did not allow fink to finish his sentence.cutting fink off as he was starting to describe what eaton had suggested about contribution protection,the court said no,that not part of this.that not contribution protection.
the court interjection evoked the following response 
fink the city,obviously,would be only able to control the defense if it accepted liability and it must accept liability in any kind of contribution action that may arise from city action.then we do have an agreement.emphasis supplied.
turning to russell,the court asked if he had any problem with what fink had said.the following exchange ensued 
russell i sorry,i missed the first part of it and i wonder if he would be good enough to repeat it 
fink contribution protection is any claim brought against us by anyone,the simons or anyone else in connection with this,would be tendered by us to the plaintiff under the contribution protection.plaintiff then wants the right to control that litigation.
that the nature of contribution protection,they want to be immunized from any affect of any contribution other party.
eaton brief on appeal characterizes this particular statement as uninterpretable.the characterization strikes us as apt.the trial judge,however,thought he understood what fink was trying to say 
the court what fink is saying is that if you incur any expense as a consequence of being named,other than expenses relating to any alleged breach of the city obligation,they your own.
russell we agree with that.
the court is that what you said 
fink if i did,i should have.
russell that fine.
evidently wanting to get back to the point he had been about to make when interrupted by the court,fink then spoke as follows 
fink there was one thing that was said by russell i do think it was intentionally excluded but i want to be clear.he referenced any claim brought against eaton.any claim brought against eaton arising from a claim brought by the city of detroit.it not indemnification through any to be filed.emphasis supplied.
these words,it seems to us,are far from uninterpretable.they are entirely consistent with what had already been said several times,and,taken in context,we believe their meaning is clear.fink was obviously saying that the city would protect eaton against any claim for contribution that arose from a claim the city was asserting against the party seeking contribution.fink was also saying that the city would not indemnify eaton against claims that did not arise from claims asserted by the city.
fink clarity on this point is fully matched by the clarity of the response given by counsel for eaton 
russell that correct.emphasis supplied.
that correct,we take it,means what it says.we do not interpret russell response as meaning that not correct.yet on april,a little over seven weeks after telling the court and counsel that fink was correct in his description of what the parties were agreeing to,russell sent fink a letter asserting that t he form of protection eaton would receive was never clarified by the city tendered with the april letter was a proposed settlement agreement containing an indemnity provision so broad as to be irreconcilable,in our judgment,with the agreement in principle memorialized in the march transcript.
the settlement agreement proposed by eaton on april would have obligated the city to indemnify eaton against all claims involving the city eaton asserted by any or all persons or entities,governmental or nongovernmental,in connection with contamination at the french avenue site.there was no exclusion of claims not arising from claims asserted by the city.contrary to the understanding reflected in the march transcript,the new proposal called for indemnification of eaton by the city against any such claims,as well as against contribution claims arising from claims by the city.
the city did not sign the proffered agreement,so eaton moved to have the case reset for trial.a brief opposing this motion was filed by the city,together with a motion for entry of a settlement judgment.the city proposed form of judgment would have required the city to defend and hold eaton harmless from and against any and all claims or demands for contribution or lawsuits or other actions for contribution brought against eaton as a direct result of any claim,demand,lawsuit or other action brought by the city in connection with environmental contamination of the real property and improvements located at the intersection of french road and grinnell avenue emphasis supplied.
eaton opposed the city motion in a brief accompanied by affidavits from russell and quick.the russell affidavit contained the following averments,among others 
that in the environmental legal community,as russell believed,contribution protection was widely understood to be a term of art signifying that upon the settlement of a cercla claim,all contribution liability of an alleged joint tortfeasor is extinguished 
that this usage stemmed from of cercla we quote the relevant statutory language in the margin 
that in settlement discussions conducted with the city counsel prior to march,russell had made it clear that eaton would require broad and final protection from future claims 
that russell had used the term contribution protection in formulating eaton settlement offers,and in so doing he had been he believed fink had been referring to statutory contribution protection under of cercla 
that settlement discussions conducted under the district court auspices on the morning of march,had failed,and the parties had been ordered back into the courtroom to recommence trial then,seconds before the judge the courtroom,fink approached eaton trial table and said we take the 
that there was no discussion of any other component of the settlement until the court asked fink to summarize the agreement and 
that s ince it was clear to both counsel for detroit and the court that the settlement between eaton and detroit needed to be reduced to writing,russell did not regard the comments of counsel before the court in open court to set forth the details of the parties proposed settlement.
attorney quick affidavit,which was much shorter,averred in essence that 
once settlement discussions had commenced,quick made it clear to the city counsel that eaton intended to condition settlement upon the city providing eaton complete protection from any future claims by the michigan department of natural resources,adjoining landowners subsequent purchasers of the subject property and 
fink told quick that the city was prohibited by law from lending its credit so as to provide eaton with indemnity,but that fink,knowing what eaton desired,indicated that equivalent protection could be provided with respect to such claims.
on august,after hearing oral argument on the pending motions,the district court announced from the bench
