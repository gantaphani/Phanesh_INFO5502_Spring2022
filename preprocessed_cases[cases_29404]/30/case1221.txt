copar pumice company,copar,proceeding under the administrative procedure act,et apa,appeals the district court denial of its petition for review concerning the notice of noncompliance that the united states forest service fs issued to copar concerning its pumice mining activities.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm.
copar operates the el cajete pumice mine on four unpatented mining claims located within the jemez national recreation area in new mexico.pursuant to a written settlement agreement with the fs,copar may extract pieces of pumice in excess of inches in size pumice,subject to all pertinent statutes and regulations.at.copar pumice is an uncommon variety of pumice that has a distinct and special value as a stonewashing agent in the garment finishing industry the pumice abrade s denim fabric,especially jeans,by creating a worn look on new denim fabric.aple.at.copar acknowledged in the settlement agreement that it could not dispose of any common variety pumice produced from these claims.
after el cajete mining operations began,the fs learned that copar was not exclusively selling its pumice to the garment finishing industry rather,copar was selling some of its pumice to other industries for common variety uses.the fs claimed that this practice violated the applicable regulations,as well as the settlement agreement.according to the fs interpretation of its regulations,pumice not used in an application that utilized its distinct and special value was nothing more than common variety pumice that copar could not extract from el cajete.copar disagreed,and the fs eventually issued copar a notice of noncompliance.
statutory and regulatory background 
the cornerstone of federal legislation dealing with mineral lands is the general mining law of,act of may,stat.codified as amended at et.united states coleman,d.the general mining law declared that all valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the united states shall be free and open to united states citizens,and allowed citizens to go onto unappropriated,unreserved public land to prospect for and develop these mineral deposits,united states locke,d.after discovering a valuable mineral deposit,and complying with minimal procedures to formally locate the deposit,citizens have the right of exclusive possession of the land for mining purposes.see locke,at.these unpatented claims are fully recognized possessory interest s.locke,at.citizens can also patent their claims under the general mining law,which allows them to acquire ultimate title to the land.freese united states.
two tests have been applied for determining what qualifies as a valuable mineral deposit under the general mining law the prudent man test,and the marketability test.a mineral deposit is valuable under the prudent man test if the deposit is of such a character that a person of ordinary prudence would be justified in the further expenditure of his labor and means,with a reasonable prospect of success,in developing a valuable mine.coleman,at quotation and citation omitted.the marketability test is the logical complement to the prudent man test it requires a mining operator to show that the mineral can be extracted,removed and marketed at a profit.id.at,quotation omitted.
because c ertain very common minerals,such as common earth and common clay,were never disposable under either the mining law or the mineral leasing acts,congress enacted the materials act of,stat.codified as amended at et,to provide a method for their disposal.american law of mining ed.congress later amended the materials act when it enacted the surface resources act of also known as the common varieties act,stat.codified at et.together,these acts provide that the secretary of the interior and the secretary of agriculture,under such rules and regulations as they may prescribe,may dispose of mineral materials including but not limited to common varieties of the following sand,stone,gravel,pumice,pumicite,cinders,and clay on public lands of the united states.emphasis added.generally,the disposal of these mineral materials occurs by contract let through competitive bidding.american law of mining.
crucial to the issues in this case,the common varieties act removed certain common varieties of minerals from the general mining law definition of valuable mineral deposit.
no deposit of common varieties of sand,stone,gravel,pumice,pumicite,or cinders and no deposit of petrified wood shall be deemed a valuable mineral deposit within the meaning of the mining laws of the united states so as to give effective validity to any mining claim hereafter located under such mining laws 
emphasis added.disposal of these common varieties was now permissible only under the materials act of.watt nuclear,d.however,as its title makes clear,the common varieties act only removed certain common varieties of minerals,such as pumice,from the application of the general mining law.
common varieties as used in this subchapter and sections and of this title does not include deposits of such materials which are valuable because the deposit has some property giving it distinct and special value and does not include block pumice which occurs in nature in pieces having one dimension of two inches or more.
emphasis added.thus,an ordinarily common variety mineral,such as pumice,would remain locatable under the general mining law as an uncommon variety if it had some property giving it distinct and special value.
the department of agriculture has promulgated regulations,contained in part,that regulate mining operations conducted on national forest system lands.subpart c of these regulations governs the disposal of mineral materials those minerals that fall within the ambit of the materials act and the common varieties act.subpart c regulations set forth the procedures for disposing of mineral materials on national forest service lands.see generally.
subpart a of these regulations governs the removal of locatable minerals those minerals subject to location under the general mining law,including the uncommon varieties of minerals exempt from the common varieties act from national forest service lands.these regulations require that mining operations shall be conducted so as to minimize adverse environmental impacts on national forest system surface resources.mining operators must submit a plan of operations for approval,which must include a description of mining operations,the period during which the proposed activity will take place,and the environmental protection measures the mining operator will undertake to comply with the regulations.id.c.forest officers shall periodically inspect operations to determine if the operator is complying with the regulations in this part and an approved plan of operations.id.a.when a mining operator fails to comply with its plan of operations or with the regulations,and that noncompliance unnecessarily or unreasonably caus es injury,loss or damage to surface resources,the fs shall serve a notice of noncompliance upon the operator.id.b.
the controlling regulation in this case is,which defines the scope of the subpart c regulations.this regulation sets forth a system of classification that determines whether a mineral qualifies as a common variety such that it is subject to subpart c regulations,or whether a mineral qualifies as an uncommon variety such that it is subject to subpart a regulations.subsection c of describes the types of minerals considered to be common variety.
mineral materials to which this subpart applies.this subpart applies to mineral materials which consist of petrified wood and common varieties of sand,gravel,stone,pumice,pumicite,cinders,clay,and other similar materials.such mineral materials include deposits which,although they have economic value,are used for agriculture,animal husbandry,building,abrasion,construction,landscaping,and similar uses.
c underlining emphasis added.subsection d describes the types of minerals considered to be uncommon variety.
minerals not covered by this subpart.mineral materials do not include any mineral used in manufacturing,industrial processing,or chemical operations for which no other mineral can be substituted due to unique properties giving the particular mineral a distinct and special value nor do they include block pumice which in nature occurs in pieces having one dimension of two inches or more which is valuable and used for some application that requires such dimensions.disposal of minerals not covered by this subpart is subject to the terms of the united states mining laws,as amended et,on those portions of the national forest system where those laws apply.
id.d underlining emphasis added.subsection e indicates that the use of a common variety mineral could potentially transform it into a uncommon variety a use which qualifies a mineral as an uncommon variety under paragraph d overrides classification of that mineral as a common variety under paragraph c of this section.id.e.
the central legal question in this case is whether the fs interpretation of its regulations is arbitrary and capricious.the fs contends that under c,d,and e,copar pumice is an uncommon variety of pumice only if it is actually used in the garment finishing,an application that utilizes its distinct and special value.thus,the fs contends that under its regulations,the of the mineral determines whether it is common or uncommon variety.copar instead argues that its pumice is an uncommon variety simply because it is suitable for use in the garment finishing industry.
procedural background 
in the late,kelly armstrong,debbie cantrup,richard cook,and shirley cook collectively cook family located mining claims within the santa fe national forest.aple.at.the claims were called the brown placer mining claims the el cajete mining operation is situated on the claims numbered.all claims were leased to copar,and the cook family filed a patent application with the bureau of land management blm in september.id.on january,the blm issued a first half final certificate,which is an administrative recording of an applicant compliance with the initial paperwork requirement of the general mining law.independence mining,babbitt,cir.
the blm never patented the claims.on october,congress enacted the jemez national recreation area act,to jnraa,which designated approximately acres of the santa fe national forest as the jemez national recreation area,which included the brown placer mining claims.a b.under the jnraa,no patents shall be issued after may,for any location or claim made in the recreation area under the mining laws of the united states,id.a,and s ubject to valid existing rights,after october,lands within the recreation area were withdrawn from location under the general mining laws and from the operation of the mineral material disposal laws,id.b.the act directed any party claiming to have been deprived of any property right to file a claim against the united states in the court of federal claims.id.a.the act also directed the secretary of agriculture to examine all unpatented mining claims,including those for which a patent application has been filed,within the recreation area.upon determination by the secretary of agriculture that the elements of a contest are present,the secretary of the interior shall immediately determine the validity of such claims.id.d.finally,n o mining activity involving any surface disturbance of lands or waters within the recreation area shall be permitted except in accordance with requirements imposed by the secretary of agriculture,including requirements for reasonable reclamation that would restore lands as close as possible to their premining condition.id.c.
the cook family filed a takings claim in the court of federal claims,contending that the jnraa deprived them of their vested property interest in the mining patents they expected to receive.cook united states,cook united states.in january,the court of federal claims granted the cook family partial summary judgment on the takings claim for brown pacer mining claims numbered the el cajete mine.the court concluded the patent application claim ed discovery of a locatable mineral valuable and marketable pumice,unique because of its size,purity,and lack of discoloration or staining qualities and the government could not prove that the cook family failed to comply with the terms and conditions entitling them to a patent.cook.at.
meanwhile,pursuant to d,the fs examined the validity of the cook family unpatented mining claims.the fs did not contest the validity of the claims that formed the el cajete mine.the fs issued a mineral report in that concluded that pumice from claims,used in the garment finishing industry,is locatable under the mining law and should be administered under regulations at cfr subpart.at.
the fs contested the validity of the remaining claims.the agency contended that the pumice on these remaining claims was not a valuable mineral deposit because it was not marketable any pumice from these claims would exceed the already declining demand for pumice in the garment finishing industry.in august,an administrative law judge from department of the interior office of hearings and appeals agreed with the fs and concluded these remaining claims were null and void for failure to discover a valuable mineral deposit within the limits of each claim.aple.at.
on april,the cook family and copar entered into a settlement agreement with the fs that resolved the takings claim.the fs agreed to pay nearly million in compensation,which include d just compensation,all interest,attorneys fees and costs,and any other litigation expenses.at.had the cook family mining claims been patented,both common and uncommon variety pumice could have been mined therefore,part of the million payment was compensation for any right copar may have had to dispose of common variety pumice from brown placer mining claims.aple.br.at.the parties withdrew all pending litigation,and the cook family and copar relinquished the other unpatented claims.the fs agreed that the cook family and copar will retain brown placer mining claims as unpatented mining claims subject to all pertinent statutes and regulations,and the cook family and copar acknowledged they were prohibited from the disposal of the common variety pumice produced from brown placer mining claims pursuant to b.at.
el cajete mining operations and the use of pumice 
the parties began developing plans for operating the el cajete mine while this prior litigation was ongoing.in december,copar submitted a plan of operations for mining activities on national forest lands for fs approval.id.at.the plan of operations provided a detailed overview of the mining activities as well as the environmental protection measures that copar would undertake.the plan stated that f or the total life of the project,approximately years,it is anticipated that tons of inch pumice will be mined.id.at.the common variety pumice that will not be removed from the pit would be used to contour the pit to a less than slope as mining progresses westward.id.at.on november,the fs approved the plan of operations for a period of years or until.id.at.
copar also submitted an el cajete pumice mine monitoring plan.id.at.among other requirements,the monitoring plan detailed how fs personnel would ensure that only pumice left the el cajete mine for processing,check pumice trucks to inspect haul tickets to verify their origination and destination of haul,and verify that pumice trucks are covered properly.id.at.as the district court noted,neither the plan of operations nor the monitoring plan expressly required that all of the pumice produced from the el cajete mine be used exclusively in the garment finishing industry.
the dispute in this case originated less than one year into production.in september,the fs advised copar that selling pumice from the el cajete mine for common variety purposes has significant implications regarding the locatability of the mineral and future administration of the el cajete mine.aple.at.in the past the fs had no specific indications from copar that there was any plan to use the pumice for use other than in the garment finishing market.id.at.recent events,however,caused the fs to believe that copar was operating under the belief that the pumice could be sold for any purpose.id.the fs warned copar that this was not the case,and requested from copar some means of verification that the pumice removed from the el cajete mine is currently and continually selling for garment finishing uses,at a value above that of construction grade pumice in general.id.at.
in subsequent correspondence with copar during october and march,the fs stressed that any pumice removed which does not go to the laundry industry is common variety,and the removal is a violation of the jemez national recreation act and the cfr part regulations.at.copar had recently lost access to its guaje canyon mine,which placed copar in a bind for common variety pumice.aple.at.although the fs was processing copar application for alternate access to the guaje canyon mine as expeditiously as possible,the fs reminded copar that it was prohibited from removing common variety pumice from el cajete.id.the fs was also unwilling to consider any application to expand the el cajete mine until it had received verifiable evidence of the amount of pumice copar was selling into the laundry industry.at.confirming the final use of the pumice is of utmost importance,and to date,copar has not cooperated in providing any documentation showing the pumice is going for the laundry industry.id.at.
copar met with the fs in early may,and agreed to develop a proposed method for verifying that its pumice was being sold for a locatable use.aple.at.however,copar failed to provide the fs with any proposed system of verification,and on october,the fs sent copar another letter that gave copar fifteen days to provide the fs with a verifiable method of proving all of the pumice produced from the el cajete mine since april,the date of the settlement agreement has been used only in the stonewash laundry industry and the pumice continuing to be mined today is being used only in the stonewash laundry industry.id.at.after copar disagreed with the fs interpretations of its regulations and did not comply,the fs issued the notice of noncompliance on december.
the notice of noncompliance declared that copar failure to provide verifiable proof of the stonewash laundry industry use of the pumice removed from the el cajete mine as requested in our letter of october,is noncompliance with the forest service regulations,and concluded that t he removal of pumice in excess of the stonewash laundry industry pumice is unnecessarily causing injury,loss or damage to surface resources by causing surface disturbance exceeding what is necessary to extract stonewash laundry industry pumice.id.at.to correct this noncompliance,the notice required copar to produce complete records since april of showing how much pumice was removed each month total production,not just stonewash laundry industry pumice,and the names and contact information for the purchasers of the pumice.id.at.in accordance with e,the notice also required copar to submit a modification to its plan of operations that would essentially restrict the company to mining only the pumice it could prove is being used in the stonewash pumice industry.id.
copar filed an administrative appeal challenging the notice of noncompliance.the fs affirmed its decision to issue the notice of noncompliance on november,and declined to conduct a discretionary review on december.
copar then filed a petition for review and reversal of agency decision in the united states district court for the district of new mexico,seeking review and a reversal of the decision to issue and subsequently affirm the notice of noncompliance.id.at.copar sought a declaration that these agency actions were an unconstitutional taking,in violation of the apa because of their numerous and significant violations of the principles of reasoned decision making,in excess of statutory jurisdiction and authority and without observance of procedure,and arbitrary and capricious.copar also sought to enjoin the enforcement of these agency actions and to enter a stay prohibiting modifications to el cajete plan of operations until this present case is resolved and for such other relief as this court deems just and proper.id.at.the district court denied copar petition for review in a memorandum opinion.following the district court decision,copar produced its records for fs inspection aplt.reply at see also aple.br.at.
it is undisputed that copar has sold a portion of its pumice for common variety uses.fs correspondence indicates that copar president,kelly armstrong,and its operations manager,richard bell,stated the pumice was not all going for locatable uses.at.fs meeting notes indicate that armstrong admitted copar was crushing el caj e te pumice to meet their common variety needs and it makes her sick to crush the valuable pumice.aple.at.finally,richard bell explained in an affidavit that copar guaje canyon mine provided the primary source of common variety pumice for alternate markets.at.copar decision to sell processed materials from el cajete mine was largely made necessary when the fs revoked copar use of forest road to access its guaje mine.id.copar became unable to fulfill its ongoing obligations to supply its customers,and would not abandon its established commercial relationships.id.
before addressing the merits of this case,we first consider whether the expiration of copar plan of operations moots copar challenge to the requirements the fs imposed in the notice of noncompliance.
the fs approved copar plan of operations on november,for a period of years or until.at.the plan expired while this case was pending in this court.days before the scheduled oral argument in this case,the fs filed a suggestion of mootness arguing that this case must be dismissed as moot.fed.aples suggestion of mootness at.because the plan has expired,the fs reasoned,copar can not operate its mine,and its activities therefore can no longer be affected by the order that copar challenged.id.at.the motion filed by the fs was taken under advisement,and the case proceeded to oral argument.
during oral argument,we questioned the fs about the existence of a live controversy concerning the notice of noncompliance requirements that copar produce its mining and sales records and that copar submit a modification to its plan of operations.while the fs insisted that a live controversy did not exist with the modification requirement,the agency acknowledged that a live controversy potentially existed over the agency authority to demand mining and sales records.copar had produced its records,but the fs considered those records incomplete.the fs also explained that it expected copar to demonstrate that it disposed of its pumice into a qualifying market,and a showing by copar that it sold its pumice to wholesalers at a price reflective of the mineral distinct and special value as a stonewashing agent would be a step towards compliance.
copar filed a response to suggestion of mootness that argued this case was not moot because the fs still insists that the notice is valid,and our determination that the fs improperly imposed its limitation and verification requirements would alter the real world legal relationship between the parties.aplt.resp.to suggestion of mootness at.

applying these principles,we conclude that the expiration of copar plan of operations has completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the plan modification requirement set forth in the notice of noncompliance.davis,at.were we to determine that the fs improperly required copar to modify its plan of operations,that ruling would have no effect on the parties relationship because that plan has already expired.copar challenge to that requirement is therefore moot.
however,we conclude that the expiration of the plan of operations does not moot copar challenge to the notice of noncompliance record production requirement.unlike the modification requirement,the record production requirement did not expire with the plan of operations as the fs indicated during oral argument,the parties dispute the completeness of the records copar produced to the fs.this dispute not only concerns the fs authority to demand copar records,an authority that is predicated upon the fs interpretation of its regulations,but also concerns the extent to which the fs can require copar to verify the of its pumice.because determining these issues will affect the parties relationship,copar challenge to this requirement is not moot.
having concluded that copar challenge to the notice of noncompliance record production requirement is not moot,we now consider the merits of this challenge.
years of litigation concerning the jnraa impact on the cook family mining claims ended with a settlement agreement on april.copar and the cook family retained their unpatented claims comprising el caj ete subject to all pertinent statutes and regulations,and acknowledged that the jnraa prohibited them from dispos ing of the common variety pumice produced from those claims.at.but despite this settlement agreement,and despite repeated admonitions by the fs that pumice not destined for the garment finishing industry was merely common variety pumice,copar has essentially circumvented the settlement agreement by selling a portion of its pumice for common variety uses,and has been largely unresponsive to the fs repeated requests for a proposed method of verifying the of el cajete pumice.now,in the face of final agency action demanding mining and sales records as a means of verifying,copar assails the fs notice of noncompliance,and the underlying interpretation of fs regulations,as arbitrary and capricious,an abuse of statutory and regulatory authority,and an unconstitutional taking.having reviewed the applicable statutes,pertinent regulations,and the entire administrative record,we reject each of these challenges and affirm the district court denial of copar petition for review.
we review de novo the district court decision in a case brought pursuant to the apa.wyoming ex rel.crank united states,cir.under the apa,a reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.in performing arbitrary and capricious review,we accord agency action a presumption of validity the burden is on the petitioner to demonstrate that the action is arbitrary and capricious.sorenson commc ns,cir.agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or if the agency action is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the state farm mut.auto.ins,d.though probing and,arbitrary and capricious review is narrow in scope.sorenson commc ns,at.we do not substitute our judgment for that of the agency,and we do not supply a reasoned basis for the agency action that the agency itself has not given.state farm,at quotation and citation omitted.
the notice of noncompliance record production requirement is predicated on the fs interpretation that under its regulations,a mineral is an uncommon variety only if it both has special value and is used for an application that requires the unique qualities that give it distinct and special value.aple.br.at italicized in original.copar argues that this interpretation is arbitrary and capricious because it is inconsistent with the common varieties act,fs regulations,and mining law precedent.copar also argues that the record production requirement is arbitrary and capricious because it is a radical departure from prior practice,it is vague,and compliance is impracticable.we reject each of these challenges in turn.
our review of an agency interpretation of its own regulations is substantially deferential.anthony hosp.dep t of health human,cir.rather than decide which among several competing interpretations best serves the regulatory purpose,we give the agency interpretation controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.thomas jefferson shalala,d citations and quotations omitted see also fed.express holowecki,d auer robbins,d.therefore,we must defer to the secretary interpretation unless an alternative reading is compelled by the regulation plain language or by other indications of the secretary intent at the time of the regulation promulgation.thomas jefferson,at citations and quotations omitted.
the fs interpretation centers on the meaning of subsections c,d,and e of,which became effective on january.the department of agriculture promulgated these additions,among others,to end the long standing confusion and misinterpretation of what is a common variety of mineral,and to bring consistency to classification of mineral materials.at.in the final rule statement,the department of agriculture response to a public comment illustrated how these regulatory additions classify minerals as common or uncommon variety based on their actual use.
one respondent raised a concern about the requirement that minerals must be actually used for the purposes stated and indicated that if a c laimant can demonstrate the likelihood of profitability penetrating the market for uncommon varieties,the deposit will support a valid mining claim despite present common variety use.in support of this view,the respondent made an analogy to how the discovery test is employed in dealing with locatable minerals.we disagree.as discussed later,we believe the use of a mineral should play a determinative role in establishing whether or not it is considered to be a common variety.as many minerals may be suitable for both common and uncommon variety uses,actual use must be the basis of a classification,and this is confirmed by administrative and court decisions.
at emphasis added alterations in original.
consistent with a classification system based on the actual use of the mineral,subsections c,d,and e of provide a sort of field guide for determining whether a mineral qualifies as a common or uncommon variety.subsection c of this regulation indicates that the disposal of mineral materials regulations contained in subpart c,which implement the materials act of and the common varieties act of,apply to common varieties of pumice,and other similar materials.such mineral materials include deposits which,although they have economic value,are used for agriculture,animal husbandry,building,abrasion,construction,landscaping,and similar uses.c emphasis added.for each of the categories listed in subsection c,the regulation provides representative examples of uses that would qualify a mineral as a common variety.see,id.c abrasive materials.this category includes minerals used for filing scouring polishing sanding and sandblasting.underlining emphasis added.
subsection d identifies the minerals that are not subject to subpart c regulations,and are instead subject to location according to the terms of the united states mining laws,on those portions of the national forest system where those laws apply.id.d.mineral materials do not include any mineral used in manufacturing,industrial processing,or chemical operations for which no other mineral can be substituted due to unique properties giving the particular mineral a distinct and special value id.d emphasis added.subsection d includes seven examples of minerals that would qualify under this subsection the regulation employs similar phraseology in describing each example that emphasizes how actual use,and not the mere suitability for use,governs this classification.see,id.d gypsum suitable and used for wallboard,plaster,or cement.emphasis added.because these uncommon variety minerals are subject to location under the general mining law,the locatable minerals regulations contained in subpart a govern their extraction from national forest system lands.
finally,subsection e explains how the particular use of a mineral can transform an otherwise common variety mineral into an uncommon variety.a use which qualifies a mineral as an uncommon variety under paragraph d overrides classification of that mineral as a common variety under paragraph c of this section.id.e.
in light of this regulatory language,and in light of the department of agriculture intent in promulgating c e,it was not plainly erroneous or inconsistent for the fs to conclude from its regulations that an uncommon variety mineral becomes a common variety mineral when it is no longer used in an application that emphasizes its distinct and special value.to qualify as an uncommon variety mineral under subsection d,a mineral must be suitable and used in an application for which no other mineral can be substituted due to the unique properties giving the particular mineral a distinct and special value.id.d.the portion of pumice that copar has sold for common variety uses does not meet this definition because it is not being used in an application that emphasizes its distinct and special value.in this situation,this particular pumice becomes a common variety,a deposit with some economic value that is used in a generic copar acknowledged it has no authority to mine.
copar argues that the fs interpretation is contrary to the common varieties act.copar contends that constitutes a legislative declaration that deposits of the minerals listed which are valuable because of some distinct and special value are valuable mineral deposits within the meaning of the general mining law.aplt.reply at quoting italicized in original.according to copar,the fs interpretation is therefore inconsistent with th is legislative declaration because the agency seeks to exclude a portion of the otherwise unique,uncommon el cajete deposit from the operation of the general mining law.id.at.this argument is misplaced because it ignores how the regulations,and the fs interpretation of those regulations,require an uncommon variety mineral to possess a distinct and special value.d.this argument is also misplaced because it ignores the posture of this case.acting pursuant to its delegated authority,see,the department of agriculture has promulgated regulations that identify the circumstances in which a common variety mineral on national forest system lands remains locatable under the general mining law.copar does not challenge the regulations themselves,only the fs interpretation of them.because we have already determined that the fs interpretation was not clearly erroneous or inconsistent with its regulations,we reject this argument.
copar also argues that subsections c and d of are simply a guide,and that because the regulations do not expressly define the term uncommon variety,we should focus on subpart c definition of mineral materials,which excludes entire deposits of minerals according to their distinct and special value and not according to the end use.aplt.reply at italicized in original.subpart c defines mineral materials,in pertinent part,as common varieties of pumice,and other similar materials,but notes that c ommon varieties do not include deposits of those materials which are valuable because of some property giving them distinct and special value.we also reject this argument because the regulatory definition of mineral materials does not decide the interpretative issue in this case.though d is not a formal definition of uncommon variety,that subsection identifies the circumstances in which a mineral on national forest system lands remains subject to location under the general mining law,and is therefore controlling in this case.moreover,the regulations refer to d as the de facto definition of uncommon variety.see id.e a use which qualifies a mineral as an uncommon variety under paragraph d overrides classification of that mineral as a common variety under paragraph c of this section.emphasis added 
copar contends that two interior board of land appeals decisions ibla,united states multiple use,and.pitkin iron,refute the argument that the government may regulate or restrict the actual of uncommon variety materials.aplt.br.at.these decisions are not persuasive because neither of them interprets the fs regulations contained in part.instead,each decision cites and discusses the blm prior regulation that defined common variety minerals,b,which provided that m ineral materials which occur commonly shall not be deemed to be common varieties if a particular deposit has distinct and special properties making it commercially valuable for use in a manufacturing,industrial,or processing operation.see,at multiple use,at.the ibla has often applied this regulation with a standard that the ninth circuit articulated in mcclarty sec y of interior,cir,which set forth five guidelines for distinguishing between common and uncommon variety minerals see david tognoni,citing examples.as copar repeatedly emphasizes in its briefings,the ibla in multiple use engaged in a lengthy discussion of the uncommon variety nature of pumice under the blm regulation and the mcclarty analysis.multiple use,at.however,the important distinction in this case is that here we are analyzing the interpretation of a different regulation that does not wholeheartedly embrace the mcclarty standard.in promulgating its classification system based on actual use of the mineral,the department of agriculture recognized that mcclarty has been regarded as definitive and has provided a broad framework.at.nevertheless,the fs concluded that u se of the standards established in the mcclarty decision leaves a number of unanswered questions for the operator and the forest service.id.underlining added.
finally,copar also argues that the fs interpretation is contrary to the elementary tenet of mining law that the locatability of a mineral deposit is determined as of the date of withdrawal of the land from location or as of the date of a contest hearing and in certain cases,both.aplt.reply at italicized in original.each of the cases copar cites answers the factual question of whether a mining operator had discovered a valuable deposit of common variety minerals before congress withdrew those minerals from the public domain when it enacted the common varieties act on july,the ibla decisions copar cites acknowledge that the question of present marketability must be determined by reference to the date on which the claimant fulfilled all of the prerequisites to the making of the entry,no later than the date of the issuance of the final certificate.united states whittaker on reconsideration.these decisions simply do not inform the interpretative issue in this case whether a mineral extracted from national forest system lands can lose its status as an uncommon variety mineral when it is no longer used in an application that utilizes its distinct and special value 
copar additionally argues that we should set aside the notice of noncompliance record production requirement as arbitrary and capricious.copar insists that the notice requires copar to produce an facto accounting of all the el cajete pumice produced,and this verification requirement is arbitrary and capricious because it is a radical departure from prior practice,it is vague,and compliance is impractical and oppressive given the nature of the pumice market and industry practices.aplt.br.at,italicized in original.because none of these arguments find support in the administrative record,we accordingly reject them.
copar monitoring plan and its plan of operations did not require copar to sell its pumice exclusively to the garment finishing industry,or to maintain records of its sales.in its september,letter,the fs explained why it never memorialized those requirements in those documents.in the past the agency had no specific indications from copar that there was any plan to use the pumice for use other than in the garment finishing market.aple.at.when those indications surfaced,the fs requested some means of verification that the pumice removed from the el cajete mine is currently and continually selling for garment finishing uses.id.at emphasis added.
in light of copar admission that the pumice was not all going for locatable uses,the fs in subsequent correspondence stressed that c onfirming the final use of the pumice is of utmost importance and reminded copar that it ha d not cooperated in providing any documentation showing the pumice is going for the laundry industry.at.copar met with the fs in early may,and agreed to develop a proposed method for verifying.later that month,the fs told copar that it look ed forward to reviewing copar suggestions on how to bring this operation into compliance,acknowledged the difficulty in developing a proposed method of verification,and suggested potential accommodations 
as mentioned during the meeting,there is no formal agency direction on how to implement cfr.on their face,the regulations require a use accounting for uncommon variety minerals.we recognize the laundry pumice market is very competitive and some information must remain confidential.we also recognize many clothing are very sensitive to any publicity about their use of domestic pumice in the laundry process.copar use of distributors,instead of marketing the pumice directly to the end users,also complicates the situation because tracking the use will require the distributors to disclose where and to whom the pumice is sold.an accounting logically requires the operator cooperation,either by providing verifiable reports of the material produced and sold,or by opening their books to audit by the forest service.in copar case,the accounting would not only be of copar sales to the distributors,but the distributors sales to the end users.if you prefer,we may be able to approve,after consultation with counsel,an alternative proposal that would provide an independent certification if it could satisfy our responsibility for verification of use.
at.communications confirm that copar was working on a proposal to verify the use of its pumice during the summer of.aple.at.
on october,not having received any proposal from copar,the fs demanded that copar provide the agency with a verifiable method of proving all of the pumice produced from the el cajete mine since april,the date of the settlement agreement has been used only in the stonewash laundry industry and the pumice continuing to be mined today is being used only in the stonewash laundry industry.at emphasis added.when copar did not comply,the fs issued its notice of noncompliance on december.the notice stated that copar failure to provide verifiable proof of the stonewash laundry industry use of the pumice removed from the el cajete mine is noncompliance.id.at emphasis added.to correct this noncompliance,the fs demanded that copar p rovide complete records since april of showing how much pumice was removed each month total production,not just stonewash laundry industry pumice,and the names and contact information for the purchasers of the pumice.id.at.
on the record presented,we reject copar argument that the requirement is a departure from prior practice.though the plan of operations and monitoring plan did not require copar to sell its pumice exclusively to the garment finishing industry,at that time the agency was unaware that copar intended to sell its el cajete pumice for common variety uses.upon learning that copar intended to do so,the fs has consistently sought some means of verif ying the of copar pumice.aple.at.
we also reject copar argument that by including the term verifiable proof in the notice of noncompliance,the fs imposed a vague standard.copar failure to provide verifiable proof caused its noncompliance,but t o correct this noncompliance the notice specifically required copar to produce its mining and sales records,including the names and contact information for the purchasers of the pumice.at.this requirement is not vague.
nevertheless,copar argues that the fs is insisting that el cajete pumice be tracked to its ultimate end use,and that this requirement is impracticable and oppressive given the nature of the garment finishing industry.aplt.br.at.copar argues that it lacked notice of this requirement because the fs never included it within the plan of operations and monitoring plan thus,the retroactive proof of information the fs seeks is not within copar possession,custody or control,but rather,is known by third parties and end users themselves.aplt.br.at.copar claims it can not obtain this information because it sold most of its el cajete pumice to brokers who will not disclose the identity of their customers because such disclosure could result in the broker loss of that customer or by the bypassing of the broker.id.at.
we reject this argument because it is inconsistent with the administrative record.the final agency action that copar is challenging in this case did not demand proof that every single ounce of pumice removed from the el cajete mine was actually used in the stonewash laundry industry.aplt.br.at italicized in original.rather,the notice of noncompliance requested mining and sales records and the names and contact information for the purchasers of the pumice.at.production of these records avoids the impracticalities and difficulties that copar alleges.and demonstrating the price that copar received for its pumice also avoids these alleged concerns.as the fs explained during oral argument,the agency expects copar to demonstrate that it disposed of its pumice into a qualifying market,and a showing by copar that it sold its pumice to wholesalers at a price that reflects the mineral distinct and special value would be a step towards compliance.sold as a stonewashing agent,copar pumice commands a price significantly higher than the price it would fetch if sold for common variety application the mineral report indicated that b ulk shipments for garment finishing pumice sell for per cubic yard as compared to the range of per cubic yard for common variety pumice,app.at,and copar emphasized a similar price disparity at oral argument.given the economic realities of the pumice market,we expect that the price copar received for its pumice would be a significant,if not dispositive,step towards verifying disposition into a qualifying market.therefore,the degree of verification the fs ultimately seeks will likely not require copar distributors to disclose the identities of their customers.
finally,the administrative record simply does not support copar assertion that it was unaware of the fs requests for verification.copar knew as early as september that the fs wanted some means of verif ying the of el cajete pumice.aple.at.moreover,the administrative record reveals that the fs persistently requested verification,and was amenable to developing a verification method that would not upset the confidential nature of the pumice market.shortly after copar agreed to develop a method of verification in may,the fs acknowledged the difficulties of this process,and highlighted the potential for an alternative proposal that would provide an independent certification if it could satisfy our responsibility for verification of use.at.though an agency acts arbitrarily and capriciously when the agency entirely fail s to consider an important aspect of a problem,state farm,at,here the fs did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in consistently articulating its request for verification,attempting to work with copar in developing a proposed verification method,and ultimately selec
