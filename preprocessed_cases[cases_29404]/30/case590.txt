background 
voyageurs national park,which lies in the southern part of the canadian shield,was created by a act of congress.the park received its name from a group of,known as voyageurs,who traveled its waters in their canoes from the great lakes to the interior of the western united states and canada a vast wilderness area,voyageurs is home to some of minnesota most endangered wildlife,including the gray wolf and the bald eagle.the park also provides a recreational resource for boaters,campers,hikers,anglers,skiers,snowshoers,and snowmobilers.
congress delegated certain regulatory authority to the park service by which it can control visitor access and use of voyageurs.two of these park service and implicated in this appeal.the first,is a general regulation applicable to all units of the national park system while the second,is a more narrow regulation that specifically governs snowmobiling at voyageurs.
section,promulgated in,designated certain areas of voyageurs as available for snowmobile use.those areas include t he frozen waters of rainy,kabetogama,namakan,mukooda,little trout and sand point lakes.b i.the regulation further provided that the park superintendent may determine yearly opening and closing dates for snowmobile use,and temporarily close trails or lake surfaces,taking into consideration public safety,wildlife management,weather,and park management objectives b.
much litigation followed the passage of indeed,the association immediately brought suit challenging the regulation and seeking to enjoin the park service from opening the designated areas to snowmobiling.in resolving the dispute,we held that neither the park service regulations permitting snowmobiling nor the ultimate decision to open areas of voyageurs to snowmobiling were arbitrary or capricious.voyageurs region national park lujan cir voyageurs ii.
however,in december of,the park an exercise of its authority under closed seventeen of voyageurs bays to snowmobiling.the park service renewed these closures for the and snowmobiling seasons.in,the park service was again sued.this time the suit was brought by a group of snowmobilers,including the minnesota united snowmobiling association.the suit alleged that the bay closures were improper and legally defective.once again,an appeal came to this court.we determined that the park service actions were neither arbitrary nor capricious.mausolf babbitt,cir mausolf iii.we also noted that the closures were only temporary and,thus,annual renewal was required in order for the closure to remain effective.id.
in,the park service reopened six of voyageurs seventeen to snowmobile use,but eleven of the bays remained closed.however,in,these eleven bays were reopened to snowmobilers.upon reopening,the park service reserved the right to limit the use of sports in the bays for safety reasons or to promote other interests of park management.
over a decade after the park service initially passed snowmobiling regulations,the litigation over these regulations meaning and implementation continues.in this latest case,the association argues that because snowmobiling may harm the and the populations,the eleven bays that were closed between and should remain closed to snowmobiling.as to the relief the association seeks,it requests that we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in the park service favor and asks us to remand with direction to order these eleven bays closed to winter recreational use.in the alternative,the association asks that it be granted limited discovery and the district court decision be vacated for further proceedings.

national environmental policy act 
the association argues that the park service failed to conduct a proper national environmental policy act nepa review prior to its decision to reopen the eleven bays that had been closed from until.the nepa requires all federal agencies,including the park service,to prepare an environmental impact study for all major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.there is,however,no dispute that the park service conducted a full nepa review in conjunction with the enactment of,which governs snowmobile usage at voyageurs.the question we consider is whether the park service must conduct a full nepa review before deciding that it will not renew its decision to close some of voyageurs bays to activity.
our court has twice reviewed the park service decisions regarding the use of snowmobiles at considering the park service decision to allow snowmobile use,then considering its decision to suspend their use.in each of these decisions,we were satisfied that the park service could limit or expand the scope of permissible snowmobile activity without a nepa review.now,after reviewing the instant appeal we are satisfied that the park service has complied with its obligations under the law.the opening and closing of the bays are temporary measures,which must be renewed annually.it is impractical to require full nepa review each year.rather,we conclude that the opening and closing of the bays is a discretionary park service decision that is subject only to the park service obligation as by the district court to be a faithful steward of national resources and its own procedural rules and regulations as set forth at.
according to the park service own rule b,a closure or the termination or relaxation of such,which is of a nature,magnitude and duration that will result in a significant alteration in the public use pattern of the park area,adversely affect the park natural,aesthetic,scenic or cultural values,require a or significant modification in the resource management objectives of the unit,or is of a highly controversial nature,shall be published as rulemaking in the federal register.however,closures or terminations of closures that do not rise to this level are subject only
