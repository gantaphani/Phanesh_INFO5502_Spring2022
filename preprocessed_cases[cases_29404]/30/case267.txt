factual background 
the district court made extensive findings establishing the following facts,none of which is disputed.plaintiffs own a parcel of land consisting of approximately acres located on joshua road in whitemarsh township the property.zaid purchased the property from whitemarsh in and subsequently conveyed it to joshua hill.the property has not been developed.from the early to the early,whitemarsh operated the property as a landfill.the landfill was unlined and operated pursuant to the trench method by which trenches were excavated,filled with refuse and covered with soil.it contains approximately tons of waste material.in proximity to the property is a sewage treatment plant operated by whitemarsh as well as an incinerator formerly operated by whitemarsh.the incinerator accepted refuse from whitemarsh,cheltenham township,and some commercial entities.when the incinerator was operating,whitemarsh deposited ash from the incinerator in the landfill.when it was not operating,waste intended to be incinerated was deposited directly into the landfill on the property.during whitemarsh operation of the landfill,officials from the pennsylvania department of environmental resources der inspected it periodically.der inspection reports show disposal of solids,liquids or hazardous wastes without der approval.reports also note that incinerator residue,sewage plant,pumping station and household waste were deposited at the landfill.a whitemarsh employee familiar with the operation of the landfill confirmed that the landfill received incinerator ash,sewage sludge and waste that could not be burned in the incinerator.sewage sludge and incinerator ash commonly contain concentrated levels of metals left over from the treatment processes.household and industrial wastes often contain numerous organic chemicals that can be hazardous substances.during the period the landfill operated there was no limit on what substances whitemarsh residents could set out for curbside waste pickup.
ii.hazardous substances on the property 
environmental testing conducted over time disclosed the presence of various hazardous substances on the property.testing done for national label company,owner of an adjacent property,by quality control laboratories qc labs,revealed the presence of arsenic,barium,cadmium,chromium,lead,silver,acenaphthene,anthracene,phenol,toluene,ethylbenzene,naphthalene and pyrene in samples from the landfill at the property.tests conducted for whitemarsh by valley forge laboratories of samples from the landfill revealed the presence of barium,lead,mercury,anthracene,pyrene,chrysene,benzo a anthracene,benzo b fluoranthene,benzo k fluoranthene,benzo a pyrene,indeno,d pyrene and benzo g,h,i,perylene.
in,roy weston,performed an environmental assessment.weston drilled five monitoring wells to assess potential groundwater contamination on the property,monitoring well being the most upgradient well and monitoring wells and and being the most downgradient with reference to the landfill.the weston testing detected elevated levels of pce and low levels of,chloroform,trichloroethene tce,toluene,ethylbenzene and xylene in.these tests also detected elevated levels of lead in.subsequent testing conducted in by blazosky associates,bai found the presence of volatile organic compounds vocs in and lead in monitoring well.
at trial,plaintiffs experts testified that the contaminants found in the groundwater originated from the landfill.defendants experts testified to the contrary,stating that materials in the landfill were not impacting the groundwater under the property and that the pce found at could have come from a dry cleaner located some feet from the property.
iii.the district court findings and conclusions 
the district court correctly held that to make a prima facie case of liability under hsca,plaintiffs must establish that 
defendants are responsible parties 
there has been an actual or threatened release of a hazardous substance from a site 
response costs were or will be incurred and 
the response costs were reasonable and necessary or appropriate.
dcop see united states alcan aluminum,cir addressing the analogous provisions of section of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla.it found and concluded that materials listed as hazardous materials in are present in the landfill on the property that each of the substances detected in the landfill by qc labs and in the groundwater by weston and bai are listed materials that these substances were probably disposed of,and can be the of waste disposed of at the landfill and that,accordingly,defendants were owners or operators of a site where a hazardous substance was placed or came to be located,and are responsible parties within the meaning of hsca.id.dcop.
the district court found,however,that plaintiffs had failed to establish that hazardous substances are being released into the environment or that there is a threat of release.it found,first,that,with the exception of lead and pce,the levels of chemicals detected had not been shown to be above background levels second,that the detection of elevated levels of lead is likely the result of laboratory contamination or mistranscription and,third,with respect to the detection of pce,if hazardous substances were leaching from the landfill,other vocs would have been discovered.the court also found persuasive that for leachate to have migrated to,it would have had to flow upgradient that the downgradient wells did not indicate the presence of hazardous substances in detectable quantities or above background levels and that samples did not reveal the presence of pce in the landfill.dcop.
as the district court put it,the principal dispute between the parties is whether the defendants caused a release of hazardous substances from a site.dcop.the court rejected plaintiffs argument that because hazardous substances were found in the groundwater below the property,there was a release of hazardous substances from the site.liability under hsca,the court held,is triggered when a hazardous substance is released from a site rather than at,in or on the site.it explained 
t he plaintiff must show that the hazardous substance is not only present in the environment at the site,but also that the hazardous substance made its initial entrance into the groundwater,land surface or subsurface strata at some location on that property.
dcop.having failed to prove that a release or threatened release occurred,the court concluded,plaintiffs are not entitled to relief under hsca.dcop.
because the district court findings of fact are not challenged on this appeal and we review only its legal conclusions with respect to the interpretation and application of hsca,our review is plenary.buncher official comm.of unsecured creditors of genfarm.iv,cir.
iv.release 
hsca provides that 
a person shall be responsible for a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance from a site when 
the person owns or operates the site 
i when a hazardous substance is placed or comes to be located in or on a site 
ii when a hazardous substance is located in or on the site but before it is released 
the district court held that plaintiffs had failed to prove a release or threatened release from the landfill into the environment.dcop.we think that the district court misconstrued release.we conclude that the plaintiffs have fulfilled the requirement of showi
