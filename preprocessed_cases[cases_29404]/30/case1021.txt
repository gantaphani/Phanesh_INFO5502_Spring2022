the issue we address is whether ashley creek phosphate company has standing to bring this action under the national environmental policy act nepa.ashley creek has no environmental stake in the phosphate mining project at issue,which is some miles from the phosphate ashley creek controls.indeed,its only interest is an economic one if the project does not go forward,ashley creek speculates that it might become an alternate supplier of phosphate.because it has shown neither an injury in fact nor an interest within the zone of interests protected by section c of nepa ashley creek lacks standing to bring this nepa challenge.
procedural and factual background 
agrium conda phosphate operations manufactures fertilizer at the conda phosphate processing plant the plant near soda springs,idaho.agrium historically has obtained phosphate for the plant from the rasmussen ridge mine,which is about twelve miles from the plant.with the rasmussen ridge mine nearing depletion,agrium began exploring alternate sources of phosphate in the late.
one option that agrium initially considered was to supply the plant with phosphate from deposits near vernal,utah vernal deposits.the vernal deposits are controlled by ashley creek,which leases large portions of the deposits from the state of utah.agrium contacted ashley creek to find out whether it could supply phosphate for the plant,but after investigating the cost of mining and transporting phosphate from the vernal deposits,agrium decided that obtaining phosphate from ashley creek was too expensive.
agrium turned its attention to expanding its existing operations at the rasmussen ridge mine into north rasmussen ridge where it had not previously mined.much of the land on north rasmussen ridge is administered by the bureau of land management blm,which required agrium to submit a mine and reclamation plan.the blm determined that an environmental impact statement eis was necessary to evaluate the potential impact of exposing harmful materials,such as selenium,and possible harm to the canada lynx,a species recently listed as threatened under the endangered species act.the exposure of selenium and other elements contained in phosphate increases the potential for release of those elements into the water and soil.
the blm prepared a draft eis that considered three alternatives,including the proposed at north rasmussen a no action alternative.in response,ashley creek submitted a letter commenting that the draft eis was deficient because it did not consider as an alternative the possibility of mining the vernal deposits that ashley creek controls.ashley creek wrote that the vernal deposits were not only,but were also environmentally superior to the proposed action.
in declining to include mining the vernal deposits as an alternative in the final eis,the blm explained that its responsibility was to respond to the proposed mining expansion on north rasmussen ridge,not to compare various phosphate supplies 
the blm responsibility is to either approve the plan of operations as proposed,modify the mine plan with alternatives,or disapprove the operation with the no action alternative.as such,a comparative analysis of the cost or other environmental factors of mining north rasmussen ridge with other viable phosphate reserves is not within the scope of this analysis.the fundamental question to be decided by this nepa analysis is not how agrium conda fertilizer plant will be fed,but if the north rasmussen ridge reserve will be mined at this time.
the blm also observed that agrium investigation indicated that the vernal deposits were not a viable supply of phosphate because ashley creek had not developed the reserves,had no mine plan,and lacked a host of other conditions for mining.
following the issuance of the final eis,ashley creek filed a complaint in the district court alleging that the alternatives analysis in the eis was deficient because it failed to consider supplying the plant with phosphate from the vernal deposits.the district court dismissed the suit for lack of standing,reasoning that ashley creek interest was purely economic and economic interests do not fall within the zone of interests protected by nepa.
discussion 
to resolve this appeal,we must address the threshold question of standing.the supreme court has described standing as being i n essence the question of whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.warth seldin,d.because article iii of the constitution limits the role of the judiciary to hearing only cases or controversies,constitutional standing ensures that a plaintiff has sufficient stake in a case to establish a case or controversy.see united food commercial workers union local brown group,d.grafted on top of this constitutional backbone are prudential standing requirements consisting of several judicially limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,our standing analysis entails an examination of both constitutional and requirements.see city of sausalito,cir.we review a district court determination of standing de novo.id.at.
article iii standing 
because article iii standing is based on constitutional limits on the federal courts power,const.art.iii,article iii standing requires as an irreducible minimum,brown group,at,that the plaintiff show an injury in fact that is both a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical that the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d.the injury in fact prong is determinative of this appeal.
the injury ashley creek asserts is that the blm refused to include in the eis the alternative that agrium could mine phosphate from ashley creek vernal deposits.ashley creek alleged injury is a procedural one that,in essence,amounts to a claim that the blm injured it by failing to comply with nepa procedural requirement of considering alternatives.see nepa c iii requiring an eis to consider alternatives to the proposed action.
nepa is a procedural statute,and thus it is not surprising that procedural injuries frequently suffice for standing in the nepa context.see,citizens for better forestry united states dep t of,cir plaintiffs had standing when they alleged procedural injury of deprivation of opportunity to comment on environmental reviews see also,lujan defenders of wildlife,d plaintiff assuredly can enforce procedural rights.but a plaintiff asserting a procedural injury does not have standing absent a showing that the procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of his that is the ultimate basis of his standing.lujan,at.a assertion of a procedural violation,without a concrete link to the interest protected by the procedural rules,does not constitute an injury in fact.see id.at nn.see also city of sausalito,at plaintiff alleging a procedural injury must also assert a concrete interest that is threatened by failure to comply with the procedural requirement cantrell city of long beach,cir plaintiff alleging procedural injury must show that the procedures protect a concrete interest.
for claims brought under nepa,we have described this concrete interest test as requiring a geographic nexus between the individual asserting the claim and the location suffering an environmental impact.cantrell,at citing douglas county babbitt,cir.accordingly,plaintiffs who use the area threatened by a proposed action or who own land near the site of a proposed action have little difficulty establishing a concrete interest.see,citizens for better forestry,at plaintiffs established geographic nexus by showing that they used and enjoyed national forests affected by proposed national forest management policy kootenai tribe of idaho veneman,cir plaintiffs with ownership interests in land adjacent to forest affected by proposed action established geographic nexus.
ashley creek,whose phosphate leases are in utah,lacks any judicially recognizable geographic nexus to the area that would be affected by mining on the north rasmussen ridge,which is approximately miles away in idaho.although miles is not some magic numerical distance beyond which a party is too far removed from the immediate environmental impact of a project to assert standing,we observe that this distance prevents an assumption,in this case,that ashley creek is geographically connected to north rasmussen ridge.ashley creek has not shown that its phosphate fields are tied to the location of the proposed mining or that the impacts of the mining will affect its property interests.contra kootenai tribe of idaho,at plaintiffs had ownership interests in lands adjacent to national forests that could be affected by implementation of forest service rule.nor has ashley creek alleged that it uses,appreciates,or in any way has an interest in the region surrounding north rasmussen ridge.contra citizens for better forestry,at members of plaintiff organization used and enjoyed the forests at issue and,consequently,alleged a concrete interest.
what is missing in this case is a legally sufficient link between ashley creeks the blm to analyze unrelated phosphate deposits miles away from the proposed nepa procedural requirement that agencies analyze the environmental impact of the proposed mining at a specific site,north rasmussen ridge.not only is the geographic link missing,the substantive concrete injury is wholly absent.
under ashley creek theory,any owner of a phosphate mine,whether located in alaska,utah,or florida,would have standing to challenge the eis.why stop there taking ashley creek framework one step further,the blm would be obligated not only to analyze the environmental suitability of unrelated phosphate deposits,but also phosphate substitutes that might be more.
indeed,ashley creek is strikingly similar to justice scalia example of the kinds of plaintiffs who can not assert procedural injuries persons who have no concrete interests who live and propose to live at the other end of the country from the proposed project.lujan,at.without evidence that ashley creek leases have some geographic nexus to the proposed mines,they are for standing purposes at the other end of the country from those mines.we therefore hold that the geographic disconnect between ashley creek and the proposed mining project at north rasmussen ridge precludes ashley creek from alleging a procedural injury sufficient to confer standing.
ii.prudential standing 
not only does ashley creek fail to satisfy the injury in fact component of article iii standing,it fails to meet the zone of interests test,a prudential standing requirement.the prudential standing analysis examines whether a particular plaintiff has been granted a right to sue by the statute under which he or she brings suit.city of sausalito,at.the bottom line is that ashley creek interest in the eis analysis is purely financial.nepa,on the other hand,is directed at environmental concerns,not at business interests.for reasons closely related to its lack of a concrete injury,ashley creek challenge does not fall within nepa zone of interests.as an alternate basis for our decision,we hold that ashley creek lacks standing under the prudential standing requirement.
because nepa does not provide for a private right of action,see,sierra club penfold,cir,plaintiffs challenging an agency action based on nepa must do so under the administrative procedure act apa,et.under the apa,a person adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,is entitled to judicial review thereof.the supreme court has interpreted this section of the apa as imposing a prudential standing requirement that the interest sought to be protected by the complainant must be arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute in question.ass of data processing serv,camp,d.
the zone of interests test is not intended to impose an onerous burden on the plaintiff and is not meant to be especially demanding.see clarke sec.indus.ass n,d.but when,as here,the plaintiff is not the subject of the contested regulatory action,the test denies a right of review if the plaintiff interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it can not reasonably be assumed that congress intended to permit the suit.id.
we have long described the zone of interests that nepa protects as being environmental.see,nevada land action ass united states forest,cir the purpose of nepa is to protect the environment,not the economic interests of those adversely affected by agency decisions.port of astoria hodel,cir purely financial interests are outside of nepa zone of interests.accordingly,we have consistently held that purely economic interests do not fall within nepa zone of interests a plaintiff who asserts purely economic injuries does not have standing to challenge an agency action under nepa.nevada land action ass n,at see also ranchers cattleman united states dep t of,cir an economic injury alone will not support a claim under nepa western radio servs.espy,cir holding that a plaintiff whose only complaint was that agency action would cause economic harm asserted an interest outside nepa zone of interests port of astoria,at holding that injuries that were only pecuniary losses and frustrated financial expectations that were not coupled with environmental considerations were outside of nepa zone of interests.
under this rule against purely economic interests falling within nepa zone of interests,ashley creek fails to establish prudential standing.rather,ashley creek has never claimed to be protecting an interest that is even remotely intertwined with the environment.ashley creek sole interest is in selling phosphate to agrium ashley creek has not linked its pecuniary interest to the physical environment or to the environmental impacts of the project evaluated in the eis.as the district court noted,ashley creek conceded as much,stating in its brief before that court that it does not have an interest in the local idaho environment.
ashley creek attempts to escape the conclusion that its bare financial interest falls outside nepa zone of interests by arguing that the rule prohibiting those with purely economic interests from suing under nepa ceases to apply once an agency decides to move forward with an eis.ashley creek argument depends on a determination that provision of nepa that sets out the content requirements of the environmental report once an agency determines that an eis is purely economic interests that determination,in turn,would require us to conclude that,for purposes of standing,there is a distinction between cases involving nepa threshold applicability,whether an eis is necessary and cases in which an eis is clearly required.in the end,ashley creek theory is undone by the structure of nepa and the purpose of.section does not support this bifurcated reading of the statute.
ashley creek argument springs from the supreme court decision in bennett spear,d,in which the court considered the zone of interests protected by a different environmental statute,the endangered species act esa.the court clarified that whether a plaintiff interest is within the zone of interests protected by a statute is to be determined not by reference to the overall purpose of the act in question here,species preservation,but by reference to the particular provision of law upon which the plaintiff relies.id.at.in bennett,the particular provision at issue was of the esa,which requires each federal agency to insure that any action it authorizes,funds,or carries out is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species a.when evaluating potential effects on endangered species,agencies must use the best scientific and commercial data available.id.
the court concluded that the language requiring the use of data indicated that one objective of was to avoid needless economic dislocation produced by agency officials zealously but unintelligently pursuing their environmental objectives.bennett,at.the purpose of requiring agencies to use high quality data,the
