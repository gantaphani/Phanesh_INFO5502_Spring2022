james fejes appeals from the judgment entered following his felony convictions for conspiracy to violate the lacey act under,and two substantive violations of the lacey act under a a,d b,and.the jury found that fejes sold caribou in violation of the lacey act by providing guide services to two hunters that took the caribou in violation of alaska law.fejes contends that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that the illegal taking of the caribou must have preceded his sale of guide services in order for criminal liability to apply.we hold that a sale of wildlife for purposes of d b encompasses not only the agreement to provide guide or outfitting services,but also the actual provision of such services.we conclude that the district court properly instructed the jury,and thus affirm fejes convictions.
fejes was indicted along with three codefendants in a three count indictment on october.the defendants were charged with conspiracy and two substantive violations of the lacey act.the indictment also alleged a forfeiture under a.
fejes is a licensed hunting guide in alaska.in the summer of,fejes agreed to take two hunters,jon buck mcneely and michael doyle,on a guided caribou hunt in alaska.doyle paid fejes for the hunt when doyle first arrived in alaska on august.mcneely,who produces a syndicated outdoorsman television show,did not pay cash for the guided hunt,but agreed to give fejes a advertising spot on mcneely show in exchange for fejes services.mcneely estimated the value of the advertising spot to be approximately.
on august,fejes and his employees flew mcneely and doyle to a remote spike camp to hunt caribou.also in the party were john helgren,a videographer hired by mcneely to film the hunts,and blaine morgan,a licensed hunting guide employed by fejes.after fejes dropped off mcneely,doyle,helgren,and morgan at the spike camp,fejes flew off to another location.shortly thereafter,morgan guided mcneely,doyle,and helgren in pursuit of caribou.doyle shot and killed a caribou,in violation of an alaska regulation that prohibits hunting on the same day that a hunter is airborne.see alaska admin.code tit,
the hunting party hiked back to the spike camp,where they met up with fejes.morgan immediately told fejes about the caribou kill,and fejes testified that he recognized that there was a problem because airborne is not legal.fejes and his employees then flew the hunting party,along with meat and the antlers from doyle caribou,back to the base camp.
on august,fejes piloted mcneely from the base camp to look for caribou from the air.fejes and mcneely spotted a caribou,and fejes landed the airplane nearby.cameraman helgren was in another airplane piloted by one of fejes employees which also landed at the site.a few minutes later,mcneely shot and killed a caribou that he and fejes had spotted from the air.fejes testified that mcneely was carrying a gun as he approached the caribou,but that he expected helgren to film the caribou.he did not know that mcneely intended to kill it.helgren testified,however,that fejes told him that morning that w e going out to kill a caribou here today.helgren also testified that fejes congratulated mcneely for killing the caribou.fejes and mcneely then posed for a photograph standing over the dead caribou,both with their thumbs up.
morgan the caribou,and fejes and his employees flew the caribou meat back to base camp.neither fejes,mcneely,doyle,nor any of fejes employees reported either of the illegal hunts to state authorities.doyle and mcneely took caribou meat from their kills back to their home states.the doyle and mcneely hunts were featured on mcneely syndicated television program,which aired twice.an advertisement for fejes guide services was shown at the conclusion of both airings.
prior to trial,fejes three codefendants pleaded guilty to misdemeanor violations of the lacey act.fejes proceeded to trial.the jury convicted him of felony conspiracy to violate the lacey act and felony violations of the lacey act under,a a,d b,and.the district court sentenced fejes to serve six months and one day in prison,followed by two years of supervised release,and imposed a fine of.fejes filed a timely notice of appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
fejes contends that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that the illegal taking of wildlife must precede the sale of guide services to fall within the criminal provisions of the lacey act.the district court instructed that to convict fejes,the jury must find that fejes knowingly engaged in conduct that involved a sale or purchase of the caribou,that fejes knew that the caribou had been taken,possessed,transported or sold in violation of law,that the market value of the caribou exceeded,and that fejes knowingly sold or transported the caribou in interstate commerce.fejes objected to the court instruction on the grounds that it incorrectly stated the elements required for criminal liability under the lacey act.we review de novo whether a jury instruction misstates elements of a statutory crime.see,united states frega,cir,cert.denied,d,and cert.denied sub nom.adams united states,d.
the lacey act makes it unlawful to transport,sell,or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any fish or wildlife taken,possessed,transported,or sold in violation of any law or regulation of any state a a.a sale of wildlife includes the offer or provision of guiding,outfitting,or other services for the illegal taking,acquiring,receiving,transporting,or possessing of fish or wildlife.c.the lacey act imposes felony penalties if the defendant knowingly engages in conduct that involves the sale of wildlife with a market value in excess of,knowing that the fish or wildlife or plants were taken,possessed,transported,or sold in violation of any underlying law,treaty or regulation d b emphasis added.
fejes argues that we must reverse the judgment of conviction because mcneely and doyle took caribou in violation of alaska shooting ban after fejes agreed to guide their hunts.fejes contends that this interpretation is mandated both by a plain reading of the statute,and by united states romano,cir.the first circuit held in romano that a hunter who purchases guiding or outfitting services to assist him in a prospective unlawful taking of wildlife can neither know nor have reason to know at the time of his purchase that the wildlife he has constructively purchased by operation of c were taken or,for that matter,possessed or transported in violation of state law.id.at.the romano court reasoned that congress use of the word were in the criminal statute implies that,at the time of the purchase,the underlying taking,possession,or act of transport can not still be in prospect it must have already occurred.id.
in determining the scope of a statute,we look first to its language.united states turkette,d.if the statutory language is unambiguous,in the absence of a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.id.citation omitted.we agree with the first circuit that the plain language of d b limits the felony liability under that section to instances where a defendant knows that wildlife were illegally taken before he sells or purchases the wildlife.
this is not the end of our inquiry,however.we must also determine when a sale of wildlife is deemed complete for purposes of d b.the romano court considered this issue in regards to a a seller like concluded that it is obvious,or at least plausible,that romano engag ed in this purchase only for so long as it took him to consummate his purchases of services.at citation omitted.we reject fejes contention that this definition of a purchase by a hunter controls our interpretation of a sale made by a guide or outfitter.
the lacey act defines a sale of wildlife to encompass the situation where a person for money or other consideration to offer or provide guiding,outfitting,or other services for the illegal taking of wildlife.c a emphasis added.the plain language of the statute indicates that the provision of guide services for the illegal taking of wildlife constitutes a sale,not m
