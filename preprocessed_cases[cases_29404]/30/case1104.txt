fidelity exploration development company fidelity extracts methane gas for commercial sale from coal seams located deep underground in the powder river basin,montana.in the process of extracting coal bed methane cbm,fidelity pumps groundwater to the surface and discharges this water into the tongue river.the water discharged is salty,contains several chemical constituents identified as pollutants by environmental protection agency epa regulations,has characteristics that may degrade soil,and is unfit for irrigation.the montana department of environmental quality mdeq advised fidelity that no permit was required to discharge the coal bed methane groundwater because montana state law exempts unaltered groundwater from state water quality requirements.northern plains resource council nprc filed a citizen suit under the federal clean water act cwa in the district court for the district of montana,alleging that fidelity unlawfully discharged pollutants into navigable waters of the united states.nprc appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to fidelity.
on appeal,we decide whether the cbm discharge water is a pollutant within the meaning of the cwa,and whether montana state law can exempt fidelity from obtaining national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permits under the cwa.we hold that the unaltered groundwater produced in association with methane gas extraction,and discharged into the river,is a pollutant within the meaning of the cwa.we also hold that states can not create exemptions to the cwa,whether or not the epa has delegated permitting authority to the state.
in,fidelity began exploring and developing natural gas from coal seams in the powder river basin,montana.the coal reserves in powder river basin are several hundred feet below the ground and contain reservoirs of methane gas.the methane is trapped by groundwater that fills the interstitial areas of the coal reserves.to extract the methane,fidelity drills a conventional well into the coal seam and pumps the trapped water to the surface to reduce water pressure.this pumping releases the trapped methane,which is captured at the surface and piped to market.fidelity does not add chemicals to the pumped groundwater cbm water.fidelity discharges the unaltered cbm water into the tongue river.because cbm water comes from deep underground aquifers,it would not reach the tongue river were it not for fidelity extraction process.
though fidelity does not add any chemicals to the cbm water before discharge,the water in its natural state contains suspended solids,calcium,magnesium,sodium,potassium,bicarbonate,carbonate,sulfate,chloride,and fluoride.the cbm water also contains measurable quantities of the following metals aluminum,arsenic,barium,beryllium,boron,copper,lead,iron,manganese,strontium,and radium.
the cbm water is salty,a characteristic measured by total dissolved solids or specific conductance.the mean total dissolved solids for the tongue river is as compared to for the cbm water.related to the saltiness of the cbm water is the water high sodium absorption ratio sar.sar measures the ratio of sodium to calcium and magnesium in the water.the sar of the cbm water discharged by fidelity is on average to times greater than the background sar of the tongue river.for all these reasons,the cbm water is distinctly different from the tongue river water to which it is added.
farmers who use water from the tongue river for irrigation are concerned with the saltiness and high sar of cbm water because of the potential hazards these characteristics pose to soil structure.high sar water,such as cbm water,causes soil particles to unbind and disperse,destroying soil structure and reducing or eliminating the ability of the soil to drain water.the montana department of environmental quality mdeq,in a final environmental impact statement analyzing coal bed methane extraction,warns that clayey soil,like that in the tongue river valley,is vulnerable to damage from high sar water.montana statewide final oil and gas environmental impact statement and proposed amendment of the powder river and billings resource management plans hereinafter montana feis,soils appendix,available at.fidelity soil expert concluded that the sar of cbm water creates a permeability hazard and precludes its use for irrigation without mixing,treatment or addition of soil amendments.the mdeq cautioned that unregulated discharge of cbm water would cause s urface water quality in some watersheds to be slightly to severely degraded,resulting in restricted downstream use of some waters.id.some of the cbm water,however,is used by fidelity grazing lessee,cx ranch,in livestock watering ponds and stock tanks.
in august,fidelity contacted the mdeq about the possibility of discharging its cbm water into the tongue river and squirrel creek.by letter,the mdeq told fidelity that it did not need a permit from the mdeq to discharge into the tongue river because the discharge was exempt under montana code section b,which provides 
discharge to surface water of groundwater that is not altered from its ambient quality does not constitute a discharge requiring a permit under this part if 
i the discharge does not contain industrial waste,sewage,or other wastes ii the water discharged does not cause the receiving waters to exceed applicable standards for any parameters and iii to the extent that the receiving waters in their ambient state exceed standards for any parameters,the discharge does not increase the concentration of the parameters.
the mdeq,however,warned fidelity in the same letter that the epa,which provides state program oversight under the federal clean water act,does not agree with the montana water quality act permit exclusion under b.therefore,they may ask at some point that you obtain an montana pollution discharge elimination system mpdes permit from us,or an npdes permit from them.the epa told mdeq that section b of the montana code conflicts with the cwa because it exempts some discharges otherwise subject to the cwa from npdes permitting requirements.the epa stressed that the fact that a discharge does not increase the concentration of a particular parameter does not exempt it from permitting requirements.the mdeq responded,resisting revocation of the section b exemption and arguing that the exemption is consistent with federal requirements governing npdes programs because discharges of unaltered,natural groundwater do not contain pollutants as that term is defined under the clean water act.in a final letter sent to the mdeq by the epa,the epa reiterated its objection to section b if applied to discharges that would otherwise require a permit under the cwa.
even though mdeq informed fidelity in august that montana state law exempted the discharge of unaltered groundwater,fidelity filed mpdes permit applications in january.at that time,fidelity was discharging into both squirrel creek and the tongue river without a permit.
nprc sent a notice of intent to sue letter to fidelity,the mdeq,and the epa on april.nprc alleged unpermitted discharges of pollutants into squirrel creek and the tongue river.on june,nprc filed a citizen suit under the cwa in federal district court alleging unpermitted discharges into squirrel creek.an amended complaint was filed on june,to add allegations of unlawful discharges into the tongue river from outfalls not covered by an mpdes permit 
the parties filed for summary judgment in district court.the parties stipulated that of the five elements necessary to prove a violation of the cwa discharge,pollutant,from a point source,to a navigable water,without a permit,the only element at issue is whether the cbm water constitutes a pollutant the other four elements are satisfied.the district court held that the cbm water was not a pollutant and granted summary judgment to fidelity.nprc appeals 
the cwa prohibits the discharge of any pollutant from a point source into navigable waters of the united states without an npdes permit.a.see also ass to protect hammersley,eld,and totten inlets apheti taylor,cir.fidelity and nprc agree that fidelity discharged cbm water from a point source into navigable water without an npdes permit.given this agreement,we need only decide whether the groundwater derived from cbm extraction is a pollutant within the meaning of the cwa.
the district court granted summary judgment to fidelity based on two conclusions cbm produced water is not a pollutant within the meaning of the cwa,and montana state law exempted fidelity from cwa permitting requirements.we have jurisdiction,a,we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,see oliver keller,cir,and we reverse.
to determine whether cbm water is a pollutant regulated by the cwa,we begin with the plain language of the statute.see gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay,d.the cwa defines pollutant broadly 
the term pollutant means dredged spoil,solid waste,incinerator residue,sewage,garbage,sewage sludge,munitions,chemical wastes,biological materials,radioactive materials,heat,wrecked or discarded equipment,rock,sand,cellar dirt and industrial,municipal,and agricultural waste discharged into water.this term does not mean water,gas,or other material which is injected into a well to facilitate production of oil and gas,or water derived in association with oil or gas production and disposed of in a well,if the well used either to facilitate production or for disposal purposes is approved by authority of the state in which the well is located,and if such state determines that such injection or disposal will not result in the degradation of ground or surface water resources.
emphasis added.because this definition does not literally list unaltered groundwater as a pollutant,fidelity argues,and the district court held,that cbm water is not a pollutant.fidelity argument and the district court holding are untenable.the plain language of the cwa requires the conclusion that cbm water is a pollutant subject to regulation under the cwa.
the reasons for our conclusion are apparent from the statute terms.first,cbm water is a pollutant because it is industrial waste.contrary to fidelity suggestion that industrial waste refers to sludge oozing from manufacturing or processing plants,barrels filled with toxic slime,and raw sewage floating in a river,industrial waste is not limited to only the most heinous and toxic forms of industrial byproducts.see sierra club,lone star chapter cedar point oil,cir concluding produced water is encompassed in industrial waste see also hudson river fishermen ass city of new york,holding that chlorine residues are pollutants,aff,cir umatilla waterquality protective ass n,smith frozen foods,holding that brine residues are industrial waste and therefore pollutants.industrial means of,pertaining to,or derived from industry.american heritage dictionary.industry,in turn,is defined as the commercial production and sale of goods and services.id.waste is defined as any useless or worthless byproduct of a process or the like refuse or excess material.id.at.combining these ordinary meanings,industrial waste is any useless byproduct derived from the commercial production and sale of goods and services.because fidelity is engaged in production of methane gas for commercial sale and because cbm water is an unwanted byproduct of the extraction process,cbm water falls squarely within the ordinary meaning of industrial waste.even fidelity referred to cbm water as wastewater in its application to the epa for an npdes permit.
second,cbm water is also a pollutant by virtue of being produced water derived from gas extraction.see cedar point oil,at addressing whether discharge of water produced during the extraction of oil and gas without an npdes permit violated the cwa and concluding that produced water is an industrial waste regulated by the cwa.the epa defines produced water as water brine brought up from the strata during the extraction of oil and gas,and can include formation water,injection water,and any chemical added downhole or during the separation process.bb,bb emphasis added.fidelity argues that the cbm water is not produced water because fidelity adds no chemicals to the water.whether cbm water is produced water,however,does not turn on the addition of chemicals or any other alteration.the epa regulations provide that produced water can include added chemicals,but the definition does not require it.see id.cbm water is produced water because it is brought up from the coal seams underlying powder basin to extract methane gas.
the cwa contemplates that produced water,as defined by epa regulations,is a pollutant within the meaning of the act.the cwa only exempts water derived from gas extraction from regulation when the water is disposed of in a well and will not result in the degradation of other water bodies.b.cedar point oil,at produced water is a pollutant if its discharge does not meet exemption criteria.fidelity disposes of the cbm water by direct discharge to the tongue,not by reinjection into a well.because fidelity discharges produced water and does not meet exemption criteria,the cbm water discharged by fidelity is a pollutant within the plain meaning of the cwa and is subject to npdes permitting requirements.
third,concluding that cbm water is a pollutant is consistent with the cwa definition of pollution.apheti,at considering the definition of pollution to determine whether biological materials emitted by mussels are pollutants.pollution is the or maninduced alteration of the chemical,physical,biological,and radiological integrity of water.by discharging cbm water into the tongue river,fidelity alters the water quality of the tongue river.in particular,the mdeq,in the montana environmental impact statement analyzing the impact of cbm production on montana waterways,cautions that the resulting alteration may degrade,and limit uses of,the receiving water surface water quality in some watersheds would be slightly to severely degraded,resulting in restricted downstream use of some waters.montana feis at.and,unregulated discharge of cbm water to the tongue river threatens to make the water unfit for irrigation.id.at.
because fidelity discharges of cbm water alter the water quality of the tongue river,those discharges cause pollution as defined by the cwa.see pud of jefferson county.dep t of ecology,d citing d b and recognizing cwa antidegradation policy requiring state water quality standards to prevent further degradation of the nation waters antidegradation policy regulation.were we to conclude otherwise,and hold that the massive pumping of salty,industrial waste water into protected waters does not involve discharge of a pollutant,even though it would degrade the receiving waters to the detriment of farmers and ranchers,we would improperly undermine the integrity of the cwa prohibitions.apheti,at.
the district court determined that the cwa definition of pollution supports a conclusion that cbm water is not a pollutant because fidelity does not alter the cbm water before discharging it.we disagree with the district court interpretation of the definition.the requirement that the physical,biological,or chemical integrity of the water be a alteration refers to the effect of the discharge on the receiving water it does not require that the discharged water be altered by man.see miccosukee tribe.water mgmt,cir i n determining whether pollutants are added to the navigable waters for purposes of the cwa,the receiving body of water is the relevant body of navigable water.a contrary reading of the definition is illogical because the goal of the cwa is to protect receiving waters,not to police the alteration of the discharged water.see the objective of the cwa is to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.here,the alteration of the chemical integrity of the tongue river is,as the cbm water would not flow into the tongue river but for fidelity methane extraction processes,and that must be a focus of our concern under the cwa.contrary to the district court conclusion,the definition of pollution supports a finding that cbm water is a pollutant.
in arguing that cbm water is not a pollutant,fidelity makes much of the fact that the cbm water is unaltered,naturally occurring,and that it is on
