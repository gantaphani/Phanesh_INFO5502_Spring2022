in this case,the sierra club challenges the environmental protection agency air pollution standards for brick and ceramics kilns.because most of the standards violate the clean air act as interpreted by this court in cement kiln recycling coalition epa,per curiam,and national lime ass epa,and because the remaining standards violate the act requirements for work practice standards,we vacate the standards in their entirety and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the clean air act,directs the environmental protection agency to establish emission standards for major sources of hazardous air pollutants listed in the statute.id.d.in cement kiln,we described the act as follows 
until,the clean air act required the environmental protection agency to set air pollution standards that would provide an ample margin of safety to protect the public health.id.b b see also,at.to address problems with the implementation of regulation,congress amended the act in to require epa to set the most stringent standards achievable,d,that is,standards based on the maximum reduction in emissions which can be achieved by application of the best available control technology,at,cong.admin.news at.
the amendments included d which directs epa to set standards limiting emissions of listed hazardous air pollutants haps,id.b,c,from major stationary sources.section d provides that 
emission standards shall require the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of the hazardous air pollutants subject to this section that the administrator,taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction,and any quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements,determines is achievable for new or existing sources 
supplementing this general guidance,congress imposed minimum stringency calls them emission floors which apply without regard to either costs or the other factors and methods listed in section d.lime ass epa,national lime ii.for new sources sources on which construction begins after epa publishes emission standards,a t he maximum degree of reduction in emissions that is deemed achievable shall not be less stringent than the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source id.d.for existing sources,what epa deems achievable shall not be less stringent than the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing percent of the existing sources for which the administrator has emissions information id.as we explained in national lime ii,epa implements these requirements through a process the agency first sets emission floors for each pollutant and source category and then determines whether stricter standards,known as limits,are achievable in light of the factors listed in section d.at.
cement kiln,at.
in cement kiln we considered the sierra club argument that epa emission floors for hazardous waste combustors violated section d of the act,the provision at issue in this case.id.at.for existing sources,epa had identified the percent of sources for which it had information.among these sources,epa then identified the median source emission control technology,which it called the maximum achievable control technology or mact control as the average emission limitation of the best performers.see d a.epa next identified the source using the mact control and set the floor at the emission level of that source.at.for new sources,epa followed the same approach,except that instead of using the technology of the median source as the mact control,it used the technology of the single source.see d.
the sierra club argued that this approach violated section d requirement that floors reflect emissions actually achieved or achieved in practice by the sources.at.in response,epa argued that section d floor provision is a gloss on section d,which requires that emission standards be achievable by all sources,based on costs and other factors.id.according to epa,section d incorporates section d achievability requirement,meaning that emission floors must also be achievable by all sources.id.we rejected epa interpretation,finding it to be an impermissible reading of the statute unambiguous language 
section d limits the scope of the word achievable in section d.while standards achievable by all sources using the mact control might also ultimately reflect what the statutorily relevant sources achieve in practice,epa may not deviate from section d requirement that floors reflect what the best performers actually achieve by claiming that floors must be achievable by all sources using mact technology.
id.citing chevron,natural res.def.council,d holding that if congress has spoken directly to the disputed issue of statutory construction,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress see also ne.waste disposal auth.epa,per curiam reiterating that floors based on achievability can not satisfy the statute actual achievement requirement.epa chose not to file a petition for rehearing en banc or to seek supreme court review.
cement kiln was not the first time this court invalidated an epa interpretation of section d.six months earlier,in national lime ii,we considered the sierra club challenge to epa setting of no control is,no emission floors at certain haps emitted by cement plants.at.defending its decision,epa relied on sierra club epa,sierra,in which we explained that epa would be justified in setting the floors at a level that is a reasonable estimate of the performance of the best controlled similar unit under the worst reasonably foreseeable circumstances.id.at.based on sierra,epa argued that because cement plants used no emission control technology,no control floors reasonably estimated variability among the best performers.national lime ii,at.we found epa interpretation of the statute untenable 
nothing in the statute even suggests that epa may set emission levels only for those listed haps controlled with technology.to the contrary,the statute requires epa to promulgate regulations establishing emission standards for each category or subcategory of major sources of hazardous air pollutants listed for regulation.d 
contrary to epa argument,nothing in sierra relieves it of the clear statutory obligation to set emission standards for each listed hap.although sierra permits the agency to look at technological controls to set emission standards,see at,it does not say that epa may avoid setting standards for haps not controlled with technology.
id.at.following the panel decision,epa filed an unsuccessful petition for rehearing,lime ass epa,order denying rehearing,but again sought neither en banc nor supreme court review.
with this background in mind,we turn to the facts of this case.at issue are epa emission standards for brick and structural clay products bscp kilns and clay ceramics kilns.over brick kilns and more than ceramics kilns operate throughout the united states.bscps include brick,clay pipe,and clay roof tile ceramics include tile and sanitaryware,such as toilets and sinks.production of bscps and ceramics involves processing common clays and shales and forming and firing shapes.because transporting clays and shales over long distances is infeasible,kilns are located close to the mines supplying the clays and shales used in their products.bscps and ceramics are fired in one of two types of kilns those that operate continuously,which include tunnel and roller kilns and those that operate in batch cycles,known as periodic kilns.epa divided brick kilns into three subcategories large tunnel brick kilns,small tunnel brick kilns,and periodic brick kilns.it divided ceramics kilns into four subcategories large tunnel ceramics kilns,small tunnel ceramics kilns,roller ceramics kilns,and periodic ceramics kilns.reflecting the different standards set forth in sections d and d a,epa further divided each subcategory into new and existing kilns.
each year,brick and ceramics kilns emit over tons of haps,including hydrofluoric acid,hydrochloric acid,and particulate matter containing toxic metals,such as antimony,arsenic,beryllium,cadmium,chromium,cobalt,lead,manganese,nickel,and selenium.these haps can cause severe respiratory problems,cancer,neurological and organ damage,and adverse reproductive effects.national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for brick and structural clay products manufacturing and clay ceramics manufacturing,may,to be codified at pt.
in,epa issued a proposed rule setting floors to limit hap emissions from new and existing brick and ceramics kilns.national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for brick and structural clay products manufacturing and clay ceramics manufacturing.proposed july,to be codified at pt.for the subcategories in which few or no kilns use air pollution control devices,epa proposed floors of no emissions reductions in other words,no floors at all.id.at.for all remaining subcategories,epa proposed floors based on the pollution control devices used by the kilns,those with the lowest emissions.id.at.in their comments on the proposed regulations,industry members insisted that installing the devices used by the sources would be technologically and economically infeasible.for its part,the sierra club complained that epa had failed to consider,fuel type,raw materials,additives and surface coatings,kiln design,and operator contribute to emissions.envtl.prot.agency,national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for brick and structural clay products manufacturing summary of public comments and responses,hereinafter summary of public comments.
in response to these comments,epa final emission standards set floors for several subcategories based on the pollution control devices used by the,as epa had proposed,the best replaced no emissions reductions floors in other subcategories with a work practice standard of using fuels.at,see h explaining requirements for setting work practice standards in lieu of emission standards.the sierra club filed a petition for reconsideration,but epa adhered to its standards.national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for brick and structural clay products manufacturing,reconsidered,to be codified at pt.
the sierra club now petitions for review.see b authorizing petitions for review of epa promulgation of emission standards.the brick industry association and two ceramics producers intervene in support of epa.
the sierra club argues that epa methodology in setting floors for brick and ceramics kilns violates the clean air act plain language as interpreted by cement kiln and national lime ii.we agree.see cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d a court prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute.
achieved,not achievable 
as discussed above,we held in cement kiln that epa may not deviate from section d requirement that floors reflect what the best performers actually achieve by claiming that floors must be achievable by all sources using mact technology.at.in setting the floor for existing large tunnel brick kilns,however,epa did just that.
most large tunnel brick kilns that have installed air pollution control devices use dry lime adsorbers dla.others use technology,including dry lime injection fabric filters diff,dry lime filters,and wet scrubbers ws.in its notice of proposed rulemaking,epa concluded that these pollution control devices represent ed the best control.fed reg.at.because the percentile the median of the top percent of the large tunnel brick kilns used technology,required by cement a floor based on this technology.id.at.but after receiving numerous comments from industry representatives saying that kilns were unable to retrofit with ws because of a lack of sewer access to treat wastewater from the device,or with diff or without affecting production,epa changed course in its final rule.at.finding that technology would have potentially significant impacts on the production process,id.at,and contrary to cement kiln requirement that floors reflect emission levels of the sources,epa excluded technology from its ranking of kilns,id.at.it then set the floor for existing large tunnel brick kilns based on dla.id.
epa argues that it has reasonably construe d the term best performing to allow it to consider whether retrofitting kilns with a particular pollution control technology is technically feasible.resp t br.but epa can not circumvent cement kiln holding that section d requires floors based on the emission level actually achieved by the best performers those with the lowest emission levels,not the emission level achievable by all sources,simply by redefining best performing to mean those sources with emission levels achievable by all sources.see at.moreover,epa rationales for excluding kilns equipped with technology from its ranking of the large tunnel kilns the infeasibility of retrofitting all kilns with certain technology and the negative impact other technology would have on productivity amount to nothing more than a concern about ensuring that its floor is achievable by all kilns in the the position we rejected in cement kiln.
epa emission standards run counter to cement kiln and national lime ii in several other variations on the agency fundamental failure to set floors at the emission levels actually achieved by the sources.
variability 
in cement kiln we declared unlawful epa method of estimating variability among the best performers by lowering floors to the level of the worst performer using the same technology.we explained 
w e are unpersuaded by epa claim that to account for the sources operational variability,it had to base the floors on the worst performers emissions.while we have recognized that a given control can experience operational variability,the relevant question here is not whether control technologies experience variability at all,but whether the variability experienced by the sources can be estimated by relying on emissions data from the sources using the mact control.in this case,the evidence epa cites to support the mact approach as a means of accounting for operational variability fails to demonstrate the relevant relationship.some of the agency citations to the record merely contain assertions that the approach fully accounts for normal process variability.the actual variability data epa cites suggest only that emissions from sources using a given control vary over a wide range,not that the high emission levels achieved by sources at one end of that range reflect levels achieved by sources at the other end,nor that the sources ever experience a wide range of variability at all.
at citations omitted.
here,epa used the same flawed process to set floors for new large and small tunnel brick and ceramics kilns,as well as for existing large tunnel brick kilns.in its rulemaking,epa explained that it used the highest emission level associated with the best performers,all kilns to set the emission standard because it was epa intent to set emission limits that reflect the performance that the sources continually achieve considering variability.at justifying approach for existing kilns see also summary of public comments at same,with regard to new kilns.citing a range of emission datapoints from a single kiln,epa explained that a ll sources,including the sources,have variability in emissions.at.because these reasons for using the emission level achieved by the kilns to predict the variability of the best performers differ little from the reasons epa gave in cement kiln,this element of the agency methodology is similarly unlawful.
defending its approach,epa points to mossville environmental action now epa,in which we held that floors may legitimately account for variability because each source must meet the specified standard every day and under all operating conditions.id.at.in mossville,however,record evidence demonstrated that the floor reasonably estimated the actual variability of the source.id.noting factual data that a standard based on the sources reasonably estimates the performance of the top performers.here,by contrast,although epa has some evidence that the best performers experience variability,it ha
