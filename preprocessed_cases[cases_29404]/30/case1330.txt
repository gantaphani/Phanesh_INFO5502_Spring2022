the southern utah wilderness alliance,the wilderness society,the grand canyon trust,escalante canyon outfitters,escalante grand staircase b,and boulder mountain lodge sought leave to intervene in this action by the utah association of counties to enjoin and have declared illegal the presidential proclamation establishing the grand staircase escalante national monument.the district court denied the motion to intervene.we reverse.
background 
on september,president clinton issued presidential proclamation number establishing the grand staircase escalante national monument and reserving approximately million acres of federal land in southern utah from public entry under the public land laws.the proclamation describes the land at issue as follows 
the grand staircase escalante national monument vast and austere landscape embraces a spectacular array of scientific and historic resources.this high,rugged,and remote region,where bold plateaus and cliffs run for distances that defy human perspective,was the last place in the continental united states to be mapped.even today,this unspoiled natural area remains a frontier,a quality that greatly enhances the monument value for scientific study.the monument has a long and dignified human history it is a place where one can see how nature shapes human endeavors in the american west,where distance and aridity have been pitted against our dreams and courage.the monument presents exemplary opportunities for geologists,paleontologists,archeologists,historians,and biologists.
proclamation.
on june,the utah association of counties filed a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief against the president and various federal officials,alleging that the creation of the monument was an illegal attempt by the secretary of the interior to prevent a proposed underground coal mine at smokey hollow,owned by andalex resources corporation and located within the monument.the complaint sought to have the presidential proclamation set aside on the grounds that it violated the separation of powers doctrine,exceeded powers vested in the president by the antiquities act of,and failed to comply with the national environmental policy act,nepa,the federal land policy and management act,et.flpma,and the administrative procedure act,apa.on december,the mountain states legal foundation filed its first amended complaint,seeking the same relief against the same defendants and asserting virtually the same alleged illegalities.the two cases were consolidated later that month.
on march,the intervenors sought leave to represent the interests of public interest organizations and individuals whose goals include protecting the nation public lands and assuring their continued integrity in perpetuity.at.the district court held a hearing on the motion and denied it,stating that 
t his case is not about the environment,it is not about the intervenors property rights or interests in the monument in question.it is not about that.it is about the legality of the president action in creating the monument.the allegations are that he violated several statutes,primarily the antiquities act,by the way this monument was created.this issue is adequately represented by the government.
the intervenors appeal arguing the district court erred in its application of the standards governing intervention as of right under.a and under a proper assessment of the relevant factors they are entitled to intervene as a matter of right.alternatively,the intervenors contend the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant permissive intervention under rule b.plaintiffs respond that the application for intervention failed to meet any of the requirements for intervention as of right,asserting the application was not timely and plaintiffs would therefore be prejudiced by allowing intervention,the intervenors interests do not meet the requirements for intervention,the intervenors have not shown those interests would be subject to impairment,and their interests would be adequately represented by the government in any event.
intervention is authorized by rule,which provides in pertinent part 
upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant ability to protect that interest,unless the applicant interest is adequately represented by existing parties.
accordingly,an applicant may intervene as of right if the application is timely the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action the applicant interest may as a practical matter be impair ed or impede d and the applicant interest is not adequately represented by existing parties.
coalition of mexico counties dep t of interior,cir quoting.a.this circuit follows a somewhat liberal line in allowing intervention.id.at quoting farm lines interstate commerce comm n,cir.we generally review a district court ruling on the timeliness of a motion to intervene under an abuse of discretion standard.id.at.when the court makes no findings regarding timeliness,however,we review this factor de novo.see glickman,cir sierra club espy,cir.we review de novo the court rulings on the three remaining requirements of rule a.see coalition,at.
timeliness 
we turn first to the issue of timeliness.as mentioned above,the complaints in this case were filed in and the motion for leave to intervene was not filed until.plaintiffs contend the application did not meet the timeliness requirement of rule a.
at the beginning of the hearing on the application to intervene,the district court stated 
you are late.you two and a half years late.this case has been kind of slow going anyway with the briefing and discovery,and i am sure it is for valid reasons,but it has been a fairly slow process anyway.it is kind of late to be adding parties.
at.in response,counsel for the intervenors contended plaintiffs had not identified any prejudice arising from the length of time between the filing of the complaints and the motion to intervene promised the intervenors would agree to be bound by whatever discovery schedule was already in place,would not seek additional discovery,and would not file a counterclaim or raise defenses not raised by the government and pointed out that while some discovery had occurred,not a lot had happened in the case.when counsel for the utah association of counties subsequently proposed to address the timeliness issue,the district court directed him to move on to another matter.shortly thereafter,in ruling from the bench,the court did not mention the timeliness factor,basing its denial instead on other grounds.the court written order denying intervention likewise does not refer to the matter of timeliness.while the court initially observed that the application was late,we conclude the court simply made no findings regarding timeliness.we therefore review this question de novo.see,at when district court makes no findings on timeliness,court of appeals does not remand but applies de novo level of review.
the timeliness of a motion to intervene is assessed in light of all the circumstances,including the length of time since the applicant knew of his interest in the case,prejudice to the existing parties,prejudice to the applicant,and the existence of any unusual circumstances.sanguine,united states dep t of interior,cir citations omitted.the analysis is contextual absolute measures of timeliness should be ignored.sierra club espy,at see also,at absolute measure of time between filing of the complaint and the motion to intervene is one of least important circumstances.the requirement of timeliness is not a tool of retribution to punish the tardy intervenor,but rather a guard against prejudicing the original parties by the failure to apply sooner.federal courts should allow intervention where no one would be hurt and greater justice could be attained.sierra club espy,at citation omitted see also charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice procedure,at ed.the requirement of timeliness is not a means of punishment for the dilatory and the mere lapse of time by itself does not make an application untimely.footnote omitted.
on appeal,plaintiffs maintain that allowing intervention under the circumstances would prejudice them because the case is ready for disposition.the record indicates,to the contrary,that the case is far from ready for final disposition no scheduling order has been issued,no trial date set,and no date for motions set.according to the district court docket,all that had occurred prior to the motion to intervene were document discovery,discovery disputes,and motions by defendants seeking dismissal on jurisdictional grounds 
plaintiffs also assert that they would be prejudiced by allowing intervention because adding additional parties would double the work load and add issues.these factors,however,are a function of intervention itself rather than the timing of the motion to intervene.the prejudice prong of the timeliness inquiry measures prejudice caused by the intervenors by the intervention itself.ruiz estelle,cir.
in view of the relatively early stage of the litigation and the lack of prejudice to plaintiffs flowing from the length of time between the initiation of the proceedings and the motion to intervene we conclude the request for intervention is timely.
the intervenors interest 
under rule a,the intervenors must claim an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action.the property that is the subject of plaintiffs lawsuit is the monument itself.the intervenors claim they have an interest in the continued existence of the monument and its reservation from public entry,both on the basis of their financial stake in the tourism the monument has created and on the basis of their desire to further their environmental and conservationist goals by preserving the undeveloped nature of the lands encompassed by the monument.they point out that they were vocal and outspoken champions and advocates for the creation of the monument,they have regularly commented on and participated in the government monument land management plan,and they regularly visit the monument for aesthetic,scientific and recreational purposes.br.of aplts.at.
we recently addressed the nature of the interest an applicant for intervention must demonstrate in coalition of mexico counties,at.in that case,a commercial wildlife photographer,robin silver,who had a particular interest in the mexican spotted owl,sought to intervene in a suit brought against the united states fish and wildlife service challenging the service decision to protect the owl under the endangered species act.silver had studied and photographed the owl in the wild and had been instrumental in the service initial decision to protect the owl under the act.
in addressing whether silver had the requisite interest to intervene as of right,we observed that while t he contours of the interest requirement have not been clearly defined,in this circuit the interest must be direct,substantial,and legally protectable.id.at quoting in re kaiser steel,cir.we further pointed out that the inquiry is highly,and that the interest test is primarily a practical guide to disposing of lawsuits by involving as many apparently concerned persons as is compatible with efficiency and due process.id.at citations omitted.we concluded that silver involvement with the owl in the wild and his persistent record of advocacy for its protection amounts to a direct and substantial interest for the purpose of intervention as of right.id.in reaching this conclusion,we drew support from the supreme court statement that the desire to use or observe an animal species,even for purely esthetic purposes,is undeniably a cognizable interest for purposes of standing.lujan defenders of wildlife,d we cited numerous cases in which environmental organizations and other special interest groups have been held to have a sufficient interest for purposes of intervention as of right in cases in which their particular interests were threatened.see coalition,at citing cases.we also held that silver interest was legally protectable as evidenced by his efforts to ensure the owl protection under the endangered species act.id.at.
in our judgment,the circumstances in coalition are sufficiently analogous to those here to indicate persuasively that the intervenors have the requisite interest.in addition to coalition and the authority upon which it relies,we find persuasive those opinions holding that organizations whose purpose is the protection and conservation of wildlife and its habitat have a protectable interest in litigation that threatens those goals.see,mausolf babbitt,cir conservation groups seeking to preserve wilderness nature of national park had requisite interest in lawsuit seeking to undo snowmobiling restrictions sagebrush rebellion,watt,cir national audubon society had sufficient interest in lawsuit challenging withdrawal of federal land to create bird conservation area.
in ruling to the contrary,the district court stated that t his case is not about the environment,it is not about the intervenors property rights or interests in the monument in question it is about the legality of the president action in creating the monument.at.plaintiffs rely on the district court statements in maintaining the intervenors do not meet either the interest or impairment prong of the rule a inquiry.both the district court and plaintiffs have simply misperceived the interest inquiry mandated by the rule.the interest of the intervenor is not measured by the particular issue before the court but is instead measured by whether the interest the intervenor claims is related to the property that is the subject of the action.see sagebrush rebellion,at.plaintiffs challenge the creation of the monument itself it is thus beyond dispute that the subject of the action is the monument.the intervenors claim an interest relating to the monument and its continued existence by virtue of their support of its creation,their goal of vindicating their conservationist vision through its preservation,their use of the monument in pursuit of that vision,and their economic stake in its continued existence.under the authority discussed above,we conclude the intervenors interest is sufficiently related to the subject of the action to support intervention as of right.
impairment of interest 
rule a also requires the intervenors to demonstrate that the disposition of this action may as a practical matter impair or impede their ability to protect their interest.this court has pointed out that the question of impairment is not separate from the question of existence of an interest.natural res.def.council united states nuclear regulatory comm n,cir.moreover,the rule refers to impairment as a practical matter.thus,the court is not limited to consequences of a strictly legal nature.id.to satisfy this element of the intervention test,a intervenor must show only that impairment of its substantial legal interest is possible if intervention is denied.this burden is minimal.grutter bollinger,cir quoting michigan state miller,cir.
the intervenors argue on appeal that their interest in the preservation and protection of the monument would be significantly impaired by an adverse decision setting aside the creation of the monument.they point out that under the land use plan in effect before the monument was established,much of the land it now encompasses was open to unrestricted travel,and that as a result the land itself was being degraded and its wilderness character was deteriorating.the monument management plan,in which the intervenors have had input,significantly restricts travel and reserves the land from public entry.in the intervenors view the management plan has enhanced the land with respect to their scientific,recreational,and aesthetic interests in the monument.the intervenors contend these environmental and conservationist interests would be impaired were the monument to lose its protected status and previous land use plans to be reinstated.the intervenors al
