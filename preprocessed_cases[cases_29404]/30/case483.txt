in the appellees,arrow and precision,brought separate suits under section b of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,b,seeking to shift some of the costs that arrow and precision had incurred,as a result of having been found liable for groundwater contamination,to other polluters of the same site.those other polluters are the defendants in arrow and precision suits.the district court dismissed the suits as barred by res judicata.we have consolidated the appeals,but discuss only arrow appeal because precision presents no additional issues.we address issues of appellate and jurisdiction,res judicata,and interpretation of settlement agreements.
along with a number of other companies,arrow operated commercial facilities in ellsworth industrial park,in downers grove,illinois,that used industrial solvents.the solvents leaked into groundwater and contaminated adjacent residential areas.the environmental protection agency began to investigate the contamination in,and later filed an enforcement action.it is continuing to investigate,and,depending on what the investigation reveals,may seek additional relief.
in a class action,muniz rexnord,was brought in federal district court on behalf of residents of the contaminated area against a number of the polluters,including arrow,on a variety of grounds.the suit asked for damages,mainly for impairment of property values.the parties agreed in to a settlement of in round numbers million.the defendants had then to allocate the expense among them,and they did so in a series of agreements.each agreement,so far as relates to arrow present suit which,remember,is a suit for contribution by one polluter against other polluters,releases in the broadest possible terms any claims for contribution by any defendant against any other defendant that had been or could have been made from the beginning of time.but this sweeping release is qualified the agreement does not release any claims other than the specified claims and do es not release claims that may arise in other litigation or in other contexts related to alleged contamination at the ellsworth industrial park.we are quoting from one of the agreements,but the others are worded similarly.
after the settlement agreements were signed in one instance before,the district court dismissed the muniz suit with prejudice.the court did not reserve jurisdiction to resolve disputes arising out of the settlement order of dismissal does not so much as mention them.the defendants in arrow suit argue that the dismissal,being with prejudice,is res judicata in the present suit because this suit arises out of the same facts as groundwater contamination caused by the leakage of industrial solvents at ellsworth industrial park.
the issue of appellate jurisdiction arises from the fact that the district judge did not dismiss arrow suit against all the polluters that it sued.the suit remained pending against two of them.so the dismissal was not a final judgment,appealable under.arrow could have asked the judge to enter a final judgment under rule b of the civil rules,which permits a district judge,upon finding no just reason to delay an appeal,to enter a final is then appealable under section respect to one or more,but fewer than all,claims or parties.but the judge was not asked to enter a rule b judgment and did not.instead arrow took a voluntary dismissal,without prejudice,of its pending claims against the two remaining defendants,thus the time being at any litigation in the district court,and then appealed the involuntary dismissal of its claims against the remaining firms that it had sued.as the defendants who were not dismissed and are thus the appellees in arrow appeal point out,arrow maneuver,if allowed,would prevent the entirety of the contested issues,involving all the parties,from being resolved in a single appeal it would exemplify piecemeal appealing,which is disfavored in the federal court system.when a claim is dismissed without prejudice,the plaintiff can refile it,and if that were done after the decision of this appeal the plaintiff filed new claims against the dropped defendants,as it could do because its dismissal of them was without would be as if interlocutory appeals were freely permissible,with no need to obtain an order under rule b.
we have held,therefore,that a decision is not final for purposes of appellate jurisdiction if the court rendering it has dismissed one or more of the plaintiff claims or one or more of the defendants with leave to refile.office of cook county public guardian,cir itofca,megatrans logistics,cir west macht,cir.this is the rule in most though not all of the other courts of appeals to have considered the issue.compare rabbi jacob joseph school province of mendoza,cir lnc investments llc republic nicaragua,f d,cir swope columbian chemicals,cir jackson volvo trucks north america,cir,and mesa united states,cir,with hope klabal,cir,and james price stern sloan,cir.
a dismissal without prejudice does always enable a suit to be refiled,even in a different court,and when that is litigation is over,its resolution in the district court is no objection to an immediate appeal.the statute of limitations may have run,as in doss clearwater title,cir,or in the cases discussed in lnc investments llc republic nicaragua,supra,at.and although dismissal for want of jurisdiction which might be a voluntary dismissal,though it makes no difference whether it is or not is without prejudice,a suit dismissed on that ground can not be refiled in the same court and likewise if the basis for dismissal and so again a dismissal without prejudice is forum non conveniens,which does not extinguish the claim but does expel it from the court in which it was filed.ma√±ez bridgestone firestone north american tire,llc,cir.these dismissals are final from the standpoint of the court that orders them,unlike the case in which dismissal without prejudice of a complaint for failure to state a claim allows the plaintiff to start over in the same court.
this is a start over case.arrow could refile the identical claim in the same court against the two parties that it has dropped,and,if it did,an appeal from the final judgment in the new case would bring up to us many of the same issues as an appeal from a final judgment in this case would have done had the two parties not been dropped.so at argument we gave arrow lawyer the following choice stand your ground and we dismiss the appeal,or convert your dismissal of the other two defendants to dismissal with prejudice,which will bar your refiling your claims against them.he quickly chose the second option,committing not to refile the suit against them,and so,because the final judgment in the district court is now definitive,we have jurisdiction of the appeal.india breweries,miller brewing,cir helcher dearborn county,cir jtc petroleum piasa motor fuels,cir.precision had dismissed any defendants,so we had no occasion to confront its lawyer with a similar choice.
the next jurisdiction of the district from a misinterpretation by the district judge and the defendants of cases concerning jurisdiction to enforce settlements of federal lawsuits.the issue in those cases was whether a district court,in dismissing a suit because the parties have settled,and failing as in this case to reserve jurisdiction to resolve issues arising from the settlement agreement,can nevertheless entertain a suit to enforce the settlement even if there is no federal jurisdictional basis such as diversity separate from the basis of federal jurisdiction in the original suit.the cases answer no,the court can not entertain the suit to enforce the settlement unless there is an independent basis of federal jurisdiction over such a suit.kokkonen guardian life ins.of america,kay board of education of city of chicago,cir lynch,samatamason,cir.the original suit may have been a federal antitrust suit,of which the district court had jurisdiction under.but if the new suit to enforce a settlement of the antitrust between citizens of the same state,and the law on which the new suit was based was state contract law a settlement is a contract rather
