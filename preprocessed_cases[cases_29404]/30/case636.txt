pesticides epa 
the panel vacated the united states environmental protection agency epa conditional registration of the pesticide an antimicrobial materials preservative that uses nanosilver as its active ingredient because the epa failed to support its requisite finding that nspw was in the public interest under c c.
the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act governs the sale,use,and distribution of pesticides,and the act requires that pesticides generally must be registered with the epa before being sold or distributed.the epa may grant a temporary,conditional registration if it first determines that use of a pesticide was in the public interest.
the panel held that substantial evidence supported the epa findings that npsw has lower application and mobility rates than pesticides.
the panel held,however,that substantial evidence did not support the epa finding that use of npsw was in the public interest because it had the potential to reduce the amount of silver released into the environment.the panel held that the epa finding was based on two unsubstantiated assumptions first,that current users of pesticides would replace those pesticides with nspw and second,that nspw would not be incorporated into new products to the extent that such incorporation would actually increase the amount of silver released into the environment.the panel concluded that without evidence in the record to support the assumptions,it could not find that the epa finding was supported by substantial evidence as required by the act.

this case involves the pesticide nspw.manufactured by nanosilva llc,nspw is an antimicrobial materials preservative that uses nanosilver as its active ingredient.petitioners the natural resources defense council,the center for food safety,and the international center for technology assessment opposed the epa conditional registration of nspw during public notice and comment.petitioners argued the epa failed to support its findings that use of npsw is in the public interest and nanosilva llc had insufficient time to submit the required data.the epa,nonetheless,conditionally registered nspw in may.petitioners filed a timely petition for review and now renew their arguments before this court.we have jurisdiction for direct review of the agency action pursuant to b.
after reviewing the conditional registration for substantial evidence,we conclude the epa failed to support its finding that nspw is in the public interest.we therefore vacate the registration in whole and need not reach petitioners arguments.
nspw is a materials preservative incorporated into plastic and textile products.when so incorporated,the epa explains,nspw can help suppress the growth of bacteria,algae,fungus,mold,and mildew,which cause odors,discoloration,stains,and deterioration.nspw may be used in products such as trash cans,mops,window blinds,furniture,baseboards,light switches,plastic decking,carpet,toilet seats,shower curtains,tubs,cell phones,computers,plastic components in humidifiers,vacuums,combs,brushes,electric razors,blow dryers,beds,wall coverings,wheelchairs,linens,golf bags,exercise equipment,life preservers,sportswear,nursing uniforms,watch bands,restaurant uniforms,litter boxes,swimming pool equipment,ink pens,portable toilets,office supplies,and luggage.nspw may not be used,however,in products designed for food contact,food packaging,or drinking water.
the active ingredient in nspw is nanosilver.simply put,nanosilver is a version of conventional silver that is engineered to have a much smaller particle size.conventional silver has long been recognized as an antimicrobial agent and is the active ingredient in a number of currently registered pesticides used as materials preservatives.nanosilver,due to its much smaller particle size,can have significantly different properties than conventional silver.these different properties provide new benefits and opportunities to industry.
but with these new benefits come new risks.after companies seeking to market nanosilver and other nanomaterials began approaching the epa for pesticide registration,the epa convened a meeting of the fifra scientific advisory panel the panel in november to discuss potential hazards.in part,the panel summarized its meeting as follows 
the panel was not aware of any information that suggested that silver ions released from silver nanomaterials would behave differently than silver ions generated by any other source.however,the panel believed that the rate of silver ion production,as well as the distribution of silver in biological tissue,may differ substantially between silver nanomaterials and other forms of silver.nanomaterials can deliver ions directly to specific tissues,cell membranes or inside cells.the biological effects of silver nanomaterials including temporal pattern for ion delivery,as well as their environmental fate,can be affected by other materials present in the preparation,surfactants.nanosilver can also potentially act as a carrier for other toxic chemicals.these issues led the panel to suggest that the hazard profile of silver nanomaterials may differ from other forms of silver.
the panel thus recommended that the epa treat nanosilver differently from its conventional silver counterpart.the panel also cautioned about extrapolating from one nanosilver formulation to another when assessing hazards.
after the panel convened,the epa evaluated and conditionally registered two pesticides containing a form of nanosilver and nspw.like nspw,is a antimicrobial pesticide used as a materials preservative.however,unlike nspw,which is a liquid suspension incorporated into plastics and textiles,is a powder which may be used as a surface coating or by incorporation with textiles only.the nanosilver in also has different size range and surface coatings than the nanosilver in nspw.the epa conditionally registered in december,approximately three years after its manufacturer submitted its application for registration 
granting conditional registration to nspw,however,took longer.while nanosilva llc submitted an application to register nspw in,the epa did not conditionally register nspw until may.this conditional registration is for a period.
in granting conditional registration,the epa found,as required by c c,that nspw contained a new active ingredient and would not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.the epa also made two findings relevant to petitioners arguments in the present case.the epa,first,found that granting conditional registration was in the public interest.specifically,it found that nspw had a lower application rate,it uses less silver and a lower mobility rate,it is less likely to release silver into the environment in detectable quantities when compared to pesticides.therefore,the epa reasoned,using nspw has the potential to reduce environmental loading and risk caused by silver release.second,the epa found that nanosilva llc had insufficient time to generate the data required for unconditional registration.
petitioners,who had opposed the conditional registration of nspw during public notice and comment,filed a timely petition for review in this court.they argue the epa failed to support its and findings 
the following principles guide our review of the epa conditional registration of nspw.first,we must sustain the conditional registration if it is supported by substantial evidence when considered on the record as a whole.b.substantial evidence means more than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.nrdc,at quoting vasquez astrue,cir.under the substantial evidence standard,we must affirm the epa finding where there is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion even if it is possible to draw two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence.id.quoting nw.food processors ass reilly,cir.when,as in this case,the agency is making predictions,within its area of special expertise,at the frontiers of science a reviewing court must generally be at its most deferential.id.alteration in original quoting balt.gas nrdc.but,a lthough we must give due deference to epa findings,i t is that an agency action must be upheld,if at all,on the basis articulated by the agency itself.id.quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the,state farm mut.auto.ins.
second,w hen interpreting a statute,we are guided by the fundamental canons of statutory construction and begin with the statutory text.united states neal,cir.the words of a statute should be accorded their plain meaning,as considered in light of the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.preap johnson,cir.quoting k mart cartier.and,where a statute is ambiguous,we may turn to legislative history for guidance.united states thomsen,cir.
we are unaware of any prior decision considering the requirement under c c.accordingly,to illuminate the requirement role in fifra regulatory scheme,we begin with the statutory background.we then turn to whether the epa supported its finding in the present case with substantial evidence.
generally,no person may distribute or sell to any person any pesticide that is not registered with the epa.a.in order for the epa to evaluate an application for pesticide registration,an application must describ e how the pesticide will be used,the claims made of its benefits,the ingredients,and a description of all tests and studies done and the results thereof,concerning the product health,safety,and environmental effects.pollinator stewardship council,at.the epa shall publish guidelines specifying the kinds of information which will be required to support the registration of a pesticide and shall revise such guidelines from time to time.c a.
after an applicant submits sufficient data for pesticide registration,the epa may grant unconditional registration under c.unconditional registration necessarily requires sufficient data to evaluate the environmental risks.pollinator stewardship council,at see also c listing the findings required for unconditional registration.if an applicant has not submitted sufficient data to support unconditional registration,however,the epa may conditionally register the pesticide under limited circumstances.see c.as relevant here,
t he epa may conditionally register a pesticide containing an active ingredient not contained in any currently registered pesticide for a period reasonably sufficient for the generation and submission of required data which are lacking because a period reasonably sufficient for generation of the data has not elapsed since the epa first imposed the data requirement on the condition that by the end of such period the epa receives such data and the data do not meet or exceed risk criteria enumerated in regulations issued under this subchapter,and on such other conditions as the epa may prescribe.a conditional registration under this subparagraph shall be granted only if the epa determines that use of the pesticide during such period will not cause any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment,and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest.
id.c c emphasis added.
the requirement reflects an important distinction between conditional registration and unconditional registration.conditional registration under c c does not require all the risk data that unconditional registration requires.c.instead,c c allows the epa to temporarily register a pesticide with risk data so long as the epa,among other additional requirements,determines that use of the pesticide is in the public interest.
the statute does not further define the requirement,but the legislative history of conditional registration provides some insight.for example,a report by the senate committee on agriculture,nutrition,and forestry,stated 
no conditional registration under c c could be issued unless the epa determined that use of the pesticide during the period required to complete the testing would not cause any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment,and that use of the pesticide was required in the public interest,as for example,in a situation in which there is a significant pest control problem which can not satisfactorily be handled by use of products which have been fully registered.
on the senate floor,senator leahy,who sponsored the bill that created the conditional registration provision,stated that the senate committee carefully considered the statutory requirements so conditional registration would be reserved to the truly exceptional case.cong.rec.the requirement,he stated,was a more stringent test than that required for unconditional registration.id.a s with all other registrations,the epa has to find the pesticide would not have an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment.finally,a more stringent test also applies.the epa must be shown evidence sufficient to find that this confidential sic registration is in the public interest.emphasis added.senator leahy continued 
suppose we have a serious pest problem for which this new pesticide would be an alternative to other chemicals.the epa is sure that this pesticide is as safe as any pesticide already registered for that use.
however,in the best case there may be gaps in the safety data which supports the registration.clearly the objectives of the act are best served with the added flexibility to permit a new product to be used which will meet the stringent test of being in the public interest.
the epa administrator,while testifying before the senate committee,made statements to similar effect.see,at statement of douglas costle,adm r,environmental protection agency t here may be a real need for use of the pesticide to avoid pest outbreaks.it is our opinion that in some of these cases it would be proper to allow conditional registration if the public interest would be served by issuance of a conditional registration,bearing in mind the benefits as well as the likely scope of the risk.although we think that the exercise of this conditional registration authority for new chemicals would be rare,we feel that it should be available in appropriate cases.
in the present case,the epa found that use of nspw is in the public interest because it has the potential to reduce the amount of silver released into the environment.petitioners do not dispute that reducing the amount of silver in the environment is in the public interest.rather,petitioners dispute the factual premises underlying the epa finding that nspw has a lower application rate,it uses less silver than pesticides that nspw has a lower mobility rate,it is less likely to release silver into the environment in detectable quantities and that current users of pesticides will switch to nspw that nspw will not be incorporated into new products.although we conclude that the first two premises are supported by substantial evidence,we hold that the third premise impermissibly relies on unsubstantiated assumptions 
the epa found that nspw has a lower application rate than pesticides.petitioners make several arguments as to why this finding is not supported by substantial evidence.first,petitioners argue that the inc
