renewable energy projects,although critical to the effort to combat climate change,can have significant adverse environmental impacts,just as other developments do.here,the oregon natural desert association and the audubon society of portland collectively,onda challenge a development on the ground that the bureau of land management blm environmental review of the project did not adequately address impacts to the greater sage grouse,a relatively large bird once abundant in the western united states.greater sage grouse depend on sagebrush habitat for their survival.the challenged project entails the construction of wind turbines and a across a sagebrush landscape in southeastern oregon harney county.
we conclude that the blm review did not adequately assess baseline sage grouse numbers during winter at the echanis site,where the wind turbines are to be installed.as to that point,we reverse the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of the blm,harney county,and columbia energy partners,the project developer.we also conclude,however,that onda did not exhaust its argument regarding genetic connectivity,and so we affirm as to that issue.
a.the project 
the echanis wind energy project is a mw wind energy facility that would be constructed on a tract on steens mountain in harney county,oregon.blm,north steens transmission line project final environmental impact statement feis.between and wind turbines would be built on the echanis site.feis,see feis.the north steens transmission line,which involves the construction,operation,and maintenance of a new overhead electric transmission line and associated facilities on land,would transport energy from the turbines to the electrical grid.feis.the entire undertaking that is,both the transmission line and the turbine complex the project,was approved in the blm feis and record of decision rod here challenged.
columbia energy partners received a conditional use permit from harney county to develop the project,commissioned several studies of the project,and secured a agreement to sell energy generated by the wind facility feis.because the for the transmission line crosses public lands administered by the blm,and the construction of the turbines is a connected action,a,the entire project is subject to environmental review under the national environmental policy act nepa,et.see feis.
the echanis site was chosen because i nitial site reconnaissance revealed areas well exposed to prevailing west winds and where present significant flagging of vegetation,indicating a robust westerly wind resource.feis app.f at.this preliminary assessment was confirmed after a meteorological tower was erected at the site.id.after considering three alternatives,the blm chose a route for the transmission line and associated infrastructure that would cut across,in part,the steens mountain cooperative management and protection area steens protection area.see,feis.
steens mountain 
steens mountain is many miles long and nearly feet in elevation at its highest point.in,congress enacted the steens mountain cooperative management and protection act steens act,which,among other things,established the steens protection area and the steens mountain wilderness area.feis see,et the purpose of the steens protection area is to conserve,protect,and manage the ecological integrity of steens mountain for future and present generations.a.under the steens act,the ecological integrity that must be conserved,protected,and managed includes the maintenance of genetic interchange.b.steens mountain,home to many sagebrush communities,lies near the center of one of the last remaining strongholds of contiguous sagebrush habitat essential for the persistence of greater.
greater sage grouse 
the greater sage grouse is a bird,meaning that it relies on sagebrush for its survival.feis oregon department of fish wildlife,greater conservation assessment and strategy for oregon a plan to maintain and enhance populations and habitat,draft,march,sage grouse strategy at.sage grouse use different aspects of sagebrush habitats for various purposes.feis.for instance,at leks,open areas surrounded by sagebrush,male sage grouse strut and compete for female mates,displaying their elaborate plumage.feis sage grouse strategy at.in addition,sage grouse use sagebrush habitats for nesting and brood rearing.feis.
sagebrush habitat is also essential for winter survival of sage grouse.during the winter months,the greater diet consists almost entirely of sagebrush leaves and buds.feis.to facilitate sagebrush consumption,sage grouse in the winter months tend toward areas with high canopy and taller sagebrush plants sagebrush must be exposed at least to inches to cm above the snow level to provide adequate forage and cover.feis.i f sagebrush is covered with snow,greater will move to areas where the sagebrush is exposed the availability of sagebrush above the snowpack is critical to the survival of greater through the winter.feis see also sage grouse strategy at.
once abundant across much of the western united states and canada,the greater sage grouse now lives in continually declining and increasingly separate populations.feis.since the,the overall population of sage grouse has declined by somewhere between and.id.habitat loss and fragmentation are the primary cause s for changes in sage grouse population abundance and distribution.sage grouse strategy at.as a consequence,m aintenance of connectivity and reduction of fragmentation of sagebrush habitats is key to the welfare of all sagebrush associated species.id.at.oregon is unique in that,c ompared to other states within the range of,it has large expanses of contiguous habitat with minimal threats of fossil fuel exploration or development.id.at oregon populations and sagebrush habitats likely comprise nearly of the north american range wide distribution.id.at.
environmental review 
the impacts of the project on sage grouse were by far the most significant concern during the environmental review process at issue here.in the draft environmental impact statement deis,feis,and rod,the blm adopted information,guidance,and mitigation measures concerning the sage grouse from the oregon department of fish wildlife mitigation framework and sage grouse strategy documents.feis,see hagen,mitigation framework for habitats,mitigation framework.
in response to the deis,onda submitted to the blm numerous comments on a variety of issues,supporting the comments with scientific studies,wildlife management materials,and other documents.after the comment period ended,the blm issued the feis and rod,selecting the north route transmission line as the preferred alternative to be implemented feis.the north route line would be approximately miles long,connecting an electric substation at the echanis site with an interconnection station near crane,oregon.feis.
of relevance here,the feis acknowledged the potential conflict between wind energy development and greater winter foraging habitats,because the windswept ridges that keep sagebrush exposed during winter months could also be ideal locations for wind energy development.feis.despite this concern,no surveys were conducted to determine if sage grouse are present at the echanis site during the winter months of november through april.instead,the blm assumed,based on surveys done at the nearby east ridge and west ridge sites,that no grouse use the echanis site during winter feis.the feis stated that no greater were found at the east and west ridge sites between late december and april,during the period of snow accumulation.feis.it explained 
the east ridge and west ridge projects are similar but potentially at even lower elevations than is the echanis site.because the echanis project area is generally covered with snow earlier and later in the season because of it sic relatively higher elevation,it is reasonable to extrapolate winter use from the surveys at the east ridge and west ridge sites.therefore,based upon these data,greater are assumed not to utilize the echanis project area for winter habitat from the time that the vegetation is covered with snow until snowmelt,roughly december through april.
as to connectivity concerns,the transmission lines and associated access and maintenance roads would physically divide sage grouse habitat,and the lines would provide perches for predatory raptors such as hawks and eagles and corvids such as ravens,crows,and jays.see sage grouse strategy at.accordingly,the feis assumed that grouse would avoid and be displaced from areas near transmission lines and poles.feis.this displacement,combined with possible avoidance of some areas due to noise or other disturbances,would result in habitat fragmentation,as the lines transect otherwise contiguous grouse habitat.feis.
e.this litigation 
after the feis and rod issued,onda filed a complaint in the district court for the district of oregon,challenging environmental review of the project under nepa.harney county and columbia energy partners intervened.the parties then filed for summary judgment ultimately,the court granted the defendants motions for summary judgment and denied onda.
we reverse the district court ruling.
onda asserts that the blm review of the project did not comply with nepa,our basic national charter for protection of the environment.a.the centerpiece of environmental review under nepa is the environmental impact statement eis,in which the responsible federal agency describes the proposed project and its impacts,alternatives to the project,and possible mitigation for any impacts.see.nepa imposes procedural requirements on federal agencies undertaking review it does not mandate outcomes.wildearth guardians.snowmobile ass n,cir.
nepa challenges are reviewed under the administrative procedure act apa.id.under the apa,we ask whether the agency action was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.an agency action can be set aside 
as arbitrary and capricious only if the agency relied on factors congress did not intend it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,or offered an explanation that runs counter to the evidence before the agency or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.

baseline winter conditions 
onda first contends that the blm erred in failing directly to assess baseline conditions at the echanis site,instead relying on an extrapolation from nearby sites to conclude that there is no greater sage grouse winter habitat at echanis.
the establishment of a baseline is not an independent legal requirement,but rather,a practical requirement in environmental analysis often employed to identify the environmental consequences of a proposed agency action.am.rivers ferc,cir.an eis must succinctly describe the environment of the area s to be affected by the alternatives under consideration,and insure that environmental information is available to public officials and citizens before decisions are made and before actions are taken,id.b emphases added.accurate scientific analysis is essential to implementing nepa.id.
applying these principles,several cases have found environmental analyses insufficient for failing to establish an environmental baseline.indeed,as to another project planned for sage grouse territory,the blm submitted comments to the department of transportation dot urging dot to assess baseline winter populations along a rail line.see plains res.council surface transp,cir.specifically,with regard to dot eis,the blm commented that w ith the increasing importance of sage grouse,more discussion on sage grouse is needed,including discussion on wintering areas sage grouse inventories need to be conducted at least two miles from any proposed disturbance.id.northern plains resource council agreed with the blm that dot did not adequately assess baseline conditions for the challenged project.id.at.similarly,half moon bay ruled that analysis in an eis was inadequate because it failed to assess baseline underwater conditions at a site where it was proposed dredged materials would be dumped.half moon bay fisherman marketing ass carlucci,cir.
under northern plains resource council and half moon bay,the blm had a duty to assess,in some reasonable way,the actual baseline conditions at the echanis site.baseline conditions were particularly important here because impacts to sage grouse were by far the most significant concern during environmental review,and the unique features of winter habitat are essential to survival.see,sage grouse strategy at.baseline conditions at the echanis site thus warranted comprehensive study in the feis.
the feis did not report on any observations of the echanis site surveying winter sage grouse use of the area.instead,the feis assumed that sage grouse are absent from the site during winter.feis.to justify this assumption,the feis relied on data from the east and west ridge sites,located near the echanis site but at generally lower elevations.id.in doing so,the feis asserted that,although sage grouse were found at the east ridge site on december,and nine birds were found on the west ridge site on december,no greater were found later in december,or in january,february,march,or april,during the time that snow had accumulated.id.the feis then explained that its extrapolation from surveys at these sites was reasonable because the potentially lower elevation of the sites,as compared to the echanis site,indicated that it is more likely that snow would accumulate at echanis earlier and dissipate later in winter.it is less likely,the feis asserted,that sage grouse use the echanis site than the east and west ridge sites in winter.id.a fundamental flaw infects this reasoning.
contrary to what the feis stated,four sage grouse were found at the east ridge site the surveyed site closer to echanis during february,indicating that some sage grouse do spend the winter there.the feis thus did not comply with the requirement to provide a ccurate scientific analysis,which is essential to implementing nepa,b,or with the agency obligation to insure the professional integrity,including scientific integrity,of the discussions and analyses in eiss,id.
further,that some grouse were found at the east ridge site in greatly undermines the validity of the blm assumed absence of sage grouse at the echanis site.given that grouse do use the east ridge site during the winter,the blm own extrapolation method should have resulted in assuming the birds presence,not their absence.
the record as a whole confirms the validity of this contrary assumption.christian hagen,the oregon department of fish wildlife scientist who prepared the mitigation framework,suggested that,if grouse were still present at the east and west ridge sites in december,the conditions were probably right to spend the entire winter there in fact,as noted,grouse were present in february.further,several sources on which the feis relied,and the feis itself,acknowledge that the character of the echanis site the aspect of the site that makes it ideal for generation suggests it could be good winter habitat for sage grouse,despite its potentially higher elevation,as snow there may be blown off sagebrush and exposed for grouse to eat.see,feis,app.f at sage grouse strategy at.and scientists and cooperating agencies recommended to the blm either that actual winter surveys of sage grouse be conducted or,if not,that the blm assume sage grouse were present at the echanis site during the entire winter.see,sage grouse strategy at.
in short,the feis inaccurate data concerning the closer east ridge site that was surveyed rendered its assumption concerning the winter presence of sage grouse at the echanis site arbitrary and capricious.see lands council,at.
the defendants maintain that the blm is owed special deference when undertaking scientific or technical analysis within its purview,which it is.see lands council,at.but deference does not excuse the blm from ensuring the accuracy and scientific integrity of its analysis,a nepa requirement.see b.the defendants also posit that invalidating the blm assessment of winter conditions at echanis,and therefore requiring the blm to gather better information,would essentially impose a procedural requirement not derived from nepa.but we do not hold that habitat extrapolations from one site to another are impermissible.instead,our holding is that any such extrapolation must be based on accurate information and defensible reasoning.
the errors in the blm analysis were not harmless.see tucson herpetological soc y salazar,cir.the inaccurate information and unsupported assumption materially impeded informed decisionmaking and public participation.see montana snowmobile,at.without appropriate data regarding sage grouse use of the echanis site during the winter,whether direct or via a supportable extrapolation,it was not possible to begin to assess whether sage grouse would be impacted with regard to access to viable sagebrush habitat in the winter months.
in addition,had the blm assumed the echanis site provides winter sage grouse habitat,rather than that it does not,the site would be deemed habitat pursuant to the sage grouse strategy and mitigation framework.under that designation and the mitigation measures adopted in the feis and rod,the project would not go forward there feis rod see sage grouse strategy at,mitigation framework at.in that respect,the blm analysis materially affected the outcome of environmental review.see idaho wool growers ass vilsack,cir.
the defendants urge that the mitigation measures adopted in the feis cured any potential prejudice resulting from a faulty baseline analysis mitigation measures,however,while relevant to the adequacy of an environmental analysis,see city of sausalito,cir,are not a panacea for inadequate data collection and analysis.more specifically,they do not address the concerns relevant to the prejudice analysis the error effect on informed decisionmaking and public participation,and on the outcome of the decision.see,cal.wilderness coal.dep t of energy,cir.here,with baseline conditions inadequately established,the public was not able to tailor its comments to address concerns regarding the potential winter presence of sage grouse at the echanis site.nor was the blm explanation of the impacts to winter grouse habitat adequately informed.having no reasonable assessment as to whether sage grouse are present at the echanis site in winter,the blm could not assess the project impacts to them,qualitatively or quantitatively.and with the impacts on sage grouse not properly established,the blm did not know what impacts to mitigate,or whether the mitigation proposed would be adequate to offset damage to wintering sage grouse.most importantly,had the blm assumed the presence of sage grouse,rather than their absence,the echanis site would be deemed habitat,and the mitigation measures adopted in the feis and rod would not allow development to go forward there.
given the blm prejudicial error,the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants must be reversed.
genetic connectivity 
onda next asserts that the feis erroneously failed to address genetic connectivity between sage grouse populations.genetic connectivity means the extent to which separate populations of a species are able to share genes and thereby to maintain a healthy genetic diversity within each population.the defendants argue that onda failed to exhaust this argument during environmental review.they also point out that the feis and rod adequately addressed the more general issue of habitat connectivity and fragmentation.we agree with the defendants.
judicial review is available for nepa challenges under the apa only if the nepa plaintiffs exhaust their administrative remedies.great basin mine watch hankins,cir.see.onda did not use the term genetic connectivity in its comments on the draft eis,nor did it make specific arguments about that issue,separately from the more general issues of habitat connectivity and fragmentation.
the closest onda came to raising the genetic connectivity argument as a distinct issue was the following comment to the blm 
according to the fish wildlife service candidate species listing decision,leks within km miles of each other have common features,such as genetic characteristic s genetic evidence proves that exchange between different leks by individual birds has not been restricted,compared to leks farther away.the fish wildlife service used this distance to determine connectivity between lek sites.because echanis and the transmission line alternatives fall within the parameters of connectivity,there will likely be impacts on the ability for to move across the landscape to lek sites for breeding and courtship.
comment letter from onda to blm september,at onda comment letter footnote omitted.notably,the foregoing statement mentions the issue of genetic exchange only as a premise to assert that the project will affect connectivity in general.this statement,although related to genetic connectivity concerns,is not sufficient particularly in light of onda otherwise extremely comprehensive comments to alert the blm that onda was asking for a genetic connectivity analysis regarding separate sage grouse populations.
in one of its comment letters onda,quoted a blm instruction memorandum,which articulated blm policy regarding the designation of priority habitat for various wildlife species,as stating that p riority habitat will be areas of high quality habitat supporting important populations,including those populations that are vulnerable to localized extirpation but necessary to maintain connectivity and genetic diversity.onda comment letter at emphasis added quoting blm,im,gunnison and greater management considerations for energy development.in context,this statement was insufficient to put the blm on notice that onda sought discussion of the genetic connectivity issue as such.the overall comment of which the statement was a part asserted that the deis did not demonstrate that the blm properly followed its own statutory,regulatory,and guidance mandates.the comment referred to connectivity and genetic diversity only as a subpremise of its insistence that the blm should follow mandates regarding the designation of priority habitat for many species,including sage grouse.this opaque comment was not adequately specific to alert the blm that it should analyze the substantively distinct issue of genetic connectivity.
elsewhere,onda comments address connectivity and fragmentation at length,but only in a general sense,not specifically with regard to genetic connectivity.see onda comment letter at noting that the project will riddle core sage grouse habitat in the steens protection area with turbines,transmission lines,roads,and other infrastructure,noting the blm policy that it is imperative that fragmentation and degradation of greater habitat not continue to the point that sustainable populations can no longer be supported,habitat fragmentation and disturbance across much of the range has contributed to significant population declines over the past century.if current trends persist,many local populations may disappear in the next several decades,with the remaining fragmented population vulnerable to extinction,referring to habitat fragmentation,referring to connectivity corridors,referring to new habitat loss and fragmentation,noting habitat loss,fragmentation,or degradation concerns,referring to the need for excluding activities from core habitat,referring to habitat fragmentation,referring to habitat fragmentation and degradation letter from onda to secretary,dep t of interior november,at referring to habitat fragmentation and a fragmented population letter from onda to secretary,dep t of interior july,at,fragment vital habitat,loss of irreplaceable habitat due to fragmentation,wildlife habitat connectivity supplemental comment letter from onda to blm january,at h arm to on steens would be exacerbated by habitat fragmentation.because onda comments refer only to overall habitat connectivity and fragmentation,they were too vague to raise the specific genetic connectivity issue regarding separate populations as a distinct concern.great basin mine watch,at.
barnes department of transportation confirms that onda comme
