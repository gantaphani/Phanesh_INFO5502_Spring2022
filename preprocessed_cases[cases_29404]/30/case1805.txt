in this case we uphold the constitutionality of fish and game code section,subdivision c,which is an important adjunct to the california,oregon,and washington agreement to regulate dungeness crab fishing 
plaintiffs robert eder,bryan randall,and justin yager are oregon dungeness crab fishermen.defendant california fish and game commission commission revoked their california dungeness crab vessel permits because they violated section,subdivision c by fishing for crab in san francisco waters and then fishing for crab in oregon sooner than the time designated by the regulatory statute.plaintiffs sought writ and declaratory relief,which the trial court denied.
plaintiffs contend they are entitled to relief because section,subdivision c extraterritorially regulates conduct which was lawful in oregon,and violates the dormant commerce clause and privileges and immunities clause of the united states constitution.we reject plaintiffs contentions and uphold the constitutionality of the statute.accordingly,we affirm.
i.the regulatory 
the pacific coast dungeness crab fishery is regulated by state laws in washington,oregon,and california these laws impose a system commercial dungeness crab fishing is restricted by sex male only,size over inches,and season usually opening december.
a memorandum of understanding mou commits the washington department of fish and wildlife,the oregon department of fish and wildlife,and defendant california department of fish and game to take mutually supportive actions to implement sound management of the dungeness crab resource.the three states regulations governing the crab fishery are generally consistent.there is general agreement that the regulations adequately protect the dungeness crab resource 
the fishery subject to the mou is divided into two zones the northern zone,which runs from north to the canadian border and the southern zone,which runs from south to point arena,california,on the mendocino coast.the california portion of the southern zone is comprised of california fish and game districts,and.in its written decisions to revoke plaintiffs dungeness crab vessel permits,defendant commission refers to the california portion of the southern zone,which is essentially the northern coastal area of california,as north coast.we will use that designation.
south of the north coast lies a separate dungeness crab fishery,fish and game district,which is referred to in the record and by the parties as central coast.central coast stretches from the southern boundary of mendocino county to san mateo county,and thus includes san francisco.it is undisputed that central coast is not included in the mou and is regulated entirely by california.
central coast opens on november,approximately two weeks earlier than the mou fishery zones,to accommodate the thanksgiving market for dungeness crab in the san francisco bay area 
the record shows that historically there has been a potential problem of an early season race for crabs that can result in glutted markets,fishing in unsafe conditions,and the overwhelming of crab processors leading to waste of harvested crab this is apparently the reason why the crab seasons of the northern zone and the southern zone including north coast are coordinated to begin simultaneously on december.
the december opening in either zone can be delayed if conditions are not appropriate for crab harvest.if the opening is delayed in one zone and not the other,fishermen who take crab from the open zone must not take crab from the delayed zone until days after the delay is lifted and the closed zone opens.
this rule is enforced in california by section.in addition to imposing the rule on the north coast fishery,the statute also imposes the rule on central coast,with the apparent purpose of discouraging an influx of boats taking advantage of the earlier,november opening of crab season 
section,subdivision a provides no person shall take,possess onboard,or land dungeness crab for commercial purposes from any vessel in ocean waters in north coast for days after the opening of the dungeness crab fishing season in california,if both of the following events have occurred 
the opening of the season has been delayed pursuant to state law in california.
the person has taken,possessed onboard,or landed dungeness crab for commercial purposes,from ocean waters outside of north coast,prior to the opening of the season in north coast.
if the crab season in north coast is delayed,no one may fish for crab in north coast for days after the season opens if they have previously fished for crab for commercial purposes from ocean waters outside of north would include central coast,which opens two weeks earlier.
section,subdivision b provides no person shall take,possess onboard,or land dungeness crab for commercial purposes from any vessel in ocean waters south of the border between oregon and california for days after the opening of the dungeness crab fishing season in california,if both of the following events have occurred 
the opening of the season has been delayed pursuant to state law in california.
the person has taken,possessed onboard,or landed dungeness crab for commercial purposes in oregon or washington prior to the opening of the season in california.
if the crab season in california is delayed,no one may fish for crab in ocean waters south of the oregon would presumably include central coast as well as north days after the season opens if they have previously fished for crab for commercial purposes in oregon or washington.
as defendants observe,these two subdivisions address the scenarios of delayed seasons in california and prior fishing in california,oregon,or washington.
section,subdivision c,which plaintiffs challenge in this case,addresses delayed seasons in washington and oregon and prior fishing in california.it provides no person shall take,possess onboard,or land dungeness crab for commercial purposes from any vessel in ocean waters north of the border between oregon and california for days after the opening of the dungeness crab fishing season in oregon or washington,if both of the following events have occurred 
the opening of the season has been delayed in oregon or washington.
the person has taken,possessed onboard,or landed dungeness crab for commercial purposes in california prior to the opening of the season in ocean waters off oregon or washington.
in other words,if the crab season in oregon or washington is delayed,no one may fish for crab in oregon or washington for days after the season opens if they have previously fished for crab for commercial purposes in plaintiffs did here.
section is not a criminal statute.subdivision e of section provides a violation of this section shall not constitute a misdemeanor.pursuant to section,the commission shall revoke the dungeness crab vessel permit held by any person who violates this section.
the facts are not in dispute.the parties stipulated to the operative facts during the proceedings below.
plaintiffs are residents of oregon.plaintiff eder holds a california dungeness crab vessel permit for the michele ann.plaintiff randall holds a california dungeness crab vessel permit for the eddie rod,which plaintiff yager 
this case involves the dungeness crab season.the dungeness crab fishery in central coast opened on november.the dungeness crab fishery in north coast,as well as the fisheries in oregon and washington,were delayed in opening until december.
on december,the director of the california department of fish and game issued a notification and order of delay which expressly noted that section prohibits anyone who landed crab from ocean waters outside of north coast,from participating in the crab fishery in north coast,or any other delayed opening area,until on january.the notification also expressly noted that the oregon and washington crab fisheries were also delayed in opening until december.
california department of fish and game landing receipts show that plaintiff eder landed dungeness crab from the michele ann in san francisco on november,december,december,december,december,and december.the california department landing receipts show that plaintif
