the federal clean water act prohibits the discharge of pollutants into a waterway without an npdes permit.a.upon certification,a state may administer the npdes permit program.id.b.in oregon,deq administers and enforces oregon environmental quality laws,including the issuance of npdes permits.
on december,deq issued columbia plywood an npdes permit allowing columbia plywood to discharge pollutants into the klamath river.that permit stated that it would expire on november.pursuant to,any renewal request for that permit had to be signed by columbia plywood and received by deq at least days before the permit expiration.
on august,substantially less than days before the permit expiration date,deq received an unsigned and undated application for renewal.on august,deq informed columbia plywood of the application deficiencies and told columbia plywood that,if it completed the missing information,deq would accept the renewal application and extend columbia plywood permit until deq took final action on that application.columbia plywood signed the application,dated it august,and returned it to deq.
at the time this lawsuit was filed in,deq had yet to take final action on columbia plywood august,application.columbia plywood,however,continued to discharge pollutants into the klamath river.it relied upon the continuing shield of,which states 
in the case of any license which must be periodically renewed,where the licensee has made timely application for renewal in accordance with the rules of the agency,such license shall not be deemed to expire,despite any stated expiration date thereon,until the agency concerned has issued a formal order of grant or denial of such renewal.
in july of,before filing this lawsuit,onrc sent columbia plywood a notice of intent to file a federal clean water act citizen suit as required by and.in this notice,onrc asserted that columbia plywood had been discharging pollutants into the klamath river without a valid npdes permit since november,specifically asserting that the permit was invalid because columbia plywood had not applied to renew it within days of its expiration date.onrc summarized its allegation as follows 
attached as exhibit a to this notice is a copy of columbia plywood corporation renewal application,indicating its filing by oregon deq on august.further,the application was signed on august.both dates are not within the days prior to expiration of columbia plywood corporation npdes permit on november,required by oar.therefore,the permit application is not timely filed by state law and not qualified for the ongoing discharge exemption for expired permits.
emphasis added.no other defects in the permit,or related to the permit,were specified.
on november,onrc filed a citizen suit against columbia plywood in the united states district court for the district of oregon.in its complaint,onrc alleged not just that the npdes permit was invalid due to the untimely renewal application,but also that deq lacked authority to renew npdes permits and that,even if deq had such authority,columbia plywood had to reapply for renewal in and it had not done so.
columbia plywood moved for summary judgment.in recommending that the district court grant columbia plywood motion,the magistrate judge recommended that the court hold that it did not have jurisdiction over onrc second and third claims.these claims alleged that deq could not extend the permit beyond its original term,and that,in any case,columbia plywood had to renew the extension of its permit in.the magistrate judge considered onrc first claim on the merits,and recommended that the district court hold that deq acted within its authority in waiving the time limit of as a result,the untimely filing did not invalidate columbia plywood permit.the district court reviewed de novo the magistrate judge recommendations,accepted them,and granted summary judgment in favor of columbia plywood.the district court also denied columbia plywood request for attorney fees.this appeal followed.
the two questions we certified to the supreme court of oregon,and which it accepted,were 
can the oregon department of environment quality waive oregon administrative rule,which requires that an applicant file a renewal application days before its national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit expires,by accepting a renewal application filed less than days before the npdes permit expiration date if not,then 
is the oregon department of environmental quality extension of the npdes permit beyond its original term,pursuant to oregon administrative rule,invalid because the waiver is invalid,or must the waiver have prejudiced the plaintiffs before the waiver can be held invalid 
the court answered the first question in onrc action columbia plywood,or,holding that the answer to the first certified question is that deq has the legal authority to accept and process permit renewal applications that do not meet the filing requirement in oar.onrc action,at.because of its answer to the first question,the court did not reach the second question.id.
subsequently,at our request,the parties provided supplementary briefs on what issues in this case still required resolution in light of the oregon supreme court holding.onrc argued that three issues remained before this court whether deq waiver of was valid to the degree it caused the untimely permit extension application to act as an indefinite shield whether onrc notice covered its claims that deq can not renew npdes permits and that,even if it can,any renewal had to be accomplished in and whether the district court abused its discretion by refusing to award attorney fees.columbia plywood
