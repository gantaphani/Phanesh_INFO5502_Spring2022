rancher john goodrich appeals the judgment of the united states court of federal claims dismissing as time barred his claim alleging a fifth amendment taking of his water rights on grazing land in montana.goodrich united states.the trial court held that goodrich failed to file his claim within the six year statute of limitations prescribed by.id.at.because the trial court correctly determined that the issuance of the forest service record of decision rod and final environmental impact statement eis marked the accrual of goodrich claim,we affirm.
goodrich owns checkerboard cattle ccc.since,ccc cattle have grazed and watered in an area of what is now the whitetail allotment of the lewis and clark national forest lewis and clark forest.when the lewis and clark forest was created,the ccc ranch became a federal lands ranch,for which the federal government grants permits,assigned in terms of animal unit months aums to regulate grazing and foraging on public lands.see pub.lands council babbitt,d.first preference for permits is given to ranchers who,like goodrich,own adjacent base property sufficient to support their herds,and who had regularly grazed on the public land in question.id.although the land in the lewis and clark forest is owned by the federal government,goodrich alleges that he owns the right to exclusive use of the water flowing through the whitetail allotment under montana state law and has filed notices of water rights with the state to record those rights.
the forest service generally develops an allotment management plan amp to govern livestock operations on forest service lands.k,d.any changes to an amp must abide by the national environmental policy act of,et,which requires federal agencies to prepare an eis for every major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.
in,the forest service undertook a range analysis to determine whether any changes were needed to its amp for the lewis and clark forest.the forest service published a draft eis in august outlining the environmental impact of each of the various proposals it was considering.each of the alternatives involved moving cattle belonging to joseph kennedy from the checkerboard allotment of the castle mountains to the whitetail allotment of the little belt mountains.goodrich submitted comments opposing the proposal and pointed out that the current amp for the whitetail allotment specified that the current permittee,goodrich,would receive any additional grazing use on the allotment.goodrich argued that,because ccc cattle also grazed in the checkerboard allotment,the forest service could both meet its environmental goals and maintain compliance with the current amp by moving additional ccc cattle to the whitetail allotment.after considering goodrich and other public comments,the forest service on february,issued a final eis and a rod adopting alternative the rod section discussing alternative stated that one permittee with aums will be moved to the whitetail allotment.it does not mention kennedy by name.the final eis,however,confirmed that the permittee to be moved was kennedy 
alternative insofar as it concerned kennedy cattle was not implemented for several years.in may,the forest service sent goodrich a letter stating that kennedy cattle would not be run in the whitetail allotment until,at the earliest.then,on april,goodrich received official notice from the forest service that the portion of the rod assigning grazing permits on the whitetail allotment to kennedy would be implemented that grazing season,and on july,kennedy cattle physically entered the whitetail allotment.goodrich lost aums in the whitetail allotment corresponding to the aums issued to kennedy down from the original aums transferred by the rod.
on june,goodrich filed suit in the united states court of federal claims alleging that,by allowing another permittee to graze on the whitetail allotment,the united states effected a taking of his exclusive water rights in violation of the takings clause of the fifth amendment.the united states moved to dismiss goodrich complaint as barred by the statute of limitations provided by,and the united states court of federal claims granted the motion.the trial court categorized the alleged taking as regulatory and held that the february,issuance of the rod and final eis signaled the accrual of goodrich takings claim.goodrich.at.goodrich appealed to this court,which has jurisdiction under a.
a claim brought in the united states court of federal claims must be filed within six years of its accrual date.hopland band of pomo indians united states.a claim accrues when all the events have occurred which fix the liability of the government and entitle the claimant to institute an action.hopland,at.therefore,a claim under the fifth amendment accrues when that taking action occurs.alliance of descendants of.land grants united states.however,the claim only accrues if the claimant knew or should have known that the claim existed.kinsey united states.here,there is no question that goodrich was aware of the claim.thus,because goodrich complaint was filed on june,it is timely only if the claim accrued on or after june.
goodrich alleges a physical taking that accrued on july,when kennedy cattle first entered the whitetail allotment for the grazing season.in the alternative,goodrich asserts that the taking did not stabilize until april,when he received official notice from the forest service that the portion of alternative transferring the kennedy livestock to the whitetail allotment would be implemented on july.either date would bring him within the statute.in support of the latter assertion,goodrich points to a january grazing proposal in which the forest service stated that kennedy cattle would be moved from the castle mountains to the upper spring creek allotment.in light of this subsequent document,goodrich argues,it is clear that the rod did not constitute a final decision.goodrich further argues that an attempt to file a takings claim prior to the implementation of alternative would have been rejected as unripe because he had not yet suffered any harm.we address each of these arguments in turn.
goodrich argues that the taking alleged is physical,a government appropriation of his water for the use of government agents,the kennedy cattle.although there is no controlling precedent in this case,we find this court earlier holding in fallini united states,to be the closest analogue.the plaintiffs in fallini,as in the present case,were cattle ranchers who argued that the government effected a taking by authorizing other animals to use water to which they enjoyed proprietary rights.id.at.the government action at issue in fallini was the enactment of the wild horses and burros act,intended by congress to protect wild horses and burros on public lands.id.at.as this court stated in fallini,the proper focus for statute of limitations purposes is upon the time of the defendant acts,not upon the time at which the consequences of the acts became most painful.id.at quoting.state coll.ricks,d emphasis added.in other words,w hat the fallinis may challenge is what the government has done,not what the horses have done.id.the fallini court determined that the statute of limitations was triggered upon the enactment of the wild horses and burros act.id.similarly,then,the statute of limitations period here commenced upon the forest service adoption of alternative in the rod.
goodrich urges this court to distinguish fallini because,unlike wild horses,kennedy cattle were permittees of the government,government agents or instrumentalities,and thus fall expressly into a possible exception to the rule articulated in fallini.see at if the horses were agents or instrumentalities of the united states government,the analysis of what governmental action constituted the alleged taking might well be different.this argument is not without some merit.however,it would stretch the definition of agent too far to include a mere permittee.whereas an agent is acting on behalf of,and usually at the direction of,his principal,a permittee is granted the option,but not the obligation,to enga
