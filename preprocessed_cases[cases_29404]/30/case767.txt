grand canyon trust appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the united states bureau of reclamation reclamation and the united states fish and wildlife service fws rejecting the trust claims alleging that reclamation and fws violated the endangered species act,the national environmental policy act and the administrative procedure act in the operation of the glen canyon dam.we have jurisdiction under.we dismiss as moot in part and affirm in part.
grand canyon trust the trust is an organization devoted to the protection and restoration of the canyon country of the colorado plateau.reclamation and fws are agencies within the department of the interior.reclamation is responsible for the operation of the glen canyon dam the dam situated on the colorado river,and fws is responsible for the protection of the humpback chub,a fish that exists primarily in the relatively inaccessible canyons of the colorado river and that is listed as endangered under the endangered species act esa.intervenor appellees are the seven colorado river basin states of arizona,california,colorado,nevada,new mexico,utah,and wyoming the colorado river commission of nevada the southern nevada water authority the colorado river energy distributors association the central arizona water conservation district the imperial irrigation district and the metropolitan water district of southern california collectively,intervenors.
we first review the statutory framework relevant to this appeal.the esa reflects a conscious decision by congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies.watersheds project kraayenbrink,cir.quoting.valley auth.hill,internal quotations marks omitted cert.denied.under the esa,a federal agency must ensure that an agency action is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species or destroy or adversely modify the critical habitat of any listed species.a see kraayenbrink,at the heart of the esa is section a,a.if the agency action may affect any listed species,the acting agency must formally consult with the federal agency responsible for the protection of the species in question the consulting agency.a,b a natural res.def.council houston,cir

the colorado river storage project act of authorized the construction of the dam.see et.finished in,the dam is located on the colorado river in northern arizona,and it creates lake powell,the second largest reservoir in the united states,which provides drinking water for more than million people.also,the dam each year produces more than million megawatt hours of electricity.
the colorado river basin project act of crbpa required the secretary of the interior the secretary to adopt criteria for the operation of all reservoirs and dams constructed and operated under the crbpa,including the dam.see a.the secretary adopted the long range operating criteria in,which established a minimum annual water release from lake powell of million acre feet see colorado river reservoirs coordinated long range operation.june.the crbpa also required the secretary to transmit annual operating plans aops to congress and the governors of the colorado river basin states.see b.aops must describe the actual operation under the adopted criteria for the preceding compact water year and the projected operation for the current year.id.
the placement and management of the dam have changed the historical flow and characteristics of the colorado river below the dam.the dam traps a large majority of the sediment that would otherwise flow down the colorado river,impairing critical habitat of the humpback chub below the dam also,the average temperature of the river below the dam is cooler because the dam releases waters from the deeper and colder reaches of lake powell.this harms the humpback chub,which thrives in warmer waters.
in part to address this and other negative environmental consequences of the dam,congress passed the grand canyon protection act of gcpa.the gcpa requires the secretary generally to operate the dam in such a manner as to protect and mitigate adverse impacts on the environment and specifically required the secretary,by,to complete a final glen canyon dam eis,in accordance with nepa,a,a,c a.the gcpa also codified reclamation obligation to complete and to transmit to congress and the governors of the colorado river basin states an aop describing the operation of the dam for the preceding year and the projected year operations undertaken pursuant to the gcpa.id.at c.in preparing that aop,reclamation is required to consult with members of the general public,including academics and scientists,environmental organizations,the recreation industry,and purchasers of federal power generated by the dam.id.at c.
reclamation completed its final eis in,in which it evaluated several alternatives for managing the dam,including operation under a modified low fluctuating flow mlff regime and operation under a steady flow sasf regime.mlff implements fluctuating water releases from the dam which vary depending on demand for electricity with this approach,water releases would tend to be higher in summer and winter,corresponding with greater electricity demand,and lower in the spring and fall,corresponding with decreased electricity demand.sasf,on the other hand,mimics the natural flow of the river,by implementing high,steady flows in the spring and low,steady flows in the summer and fall.in,the secretary selected mlff as the dam specific operating criteria in a record of decision.operating criteria and annual plan of operations for glen canyon dam.march.
reclamation formally consulted with fws regarding the operation of the dam under mlff.fws then issued a biop the biop concluding that mlff jeopardized the humpback chub and adversely modified its critical habitat.fws suggested reasonable and prudent alternatives to address the adverse environmental effects of mlff.they included the development of an adaptive management program amp to study the impact of flows and to implement recommendations necessary for survival and recovery of listed species and the implementation of a program of experimental flows and associated studies designed to address the negative impact of the dam on listed species.
through the amp process,reclamation adopted a experimental plan the plan that continued the mlff system as the operating criteria and also called for a high water release in march,intended to replenish sediment in the river below the dam,and steady flows in september and october of through.per nepa requirements,reclamation completed an ea with respect to the plan and concluded that the environmental impact would not be significant.
reclamation also formally consulted with fws regarding the plan,and fws issued a new biop the biop that expressly superseded the biop.fws concluded that the plan,implemented in accordance with mlff operation,did not jeopardize the humpback chub or adversely modify or destroy its critical habitat and that operation of the dam under mlff generally no longer jeopardized the humpback chub or adversely modified or destroyed its critical habitat.thus,the biop reversed fws jeopardy position,as previously expressed in the biop.
the trust then filed suit in the district of arizona,alleging that reclamation violates the esa by not consulting with fws on the development of each of the dam aops that reclamation violates nepa by not preparing an ea or eis for each aop and that fws biop violates the esa the district court granted summary judgment to reclamation,concluding that aops are not agency action s subject to esa consultation requirements and that aops are not major federal action s triggering compliance with nepa procedural requirements.as to whether the biop violated the esa,the district court granted summary judgment to the trust.the district court found that the portions of the biop approving the plan were valid,but invalidated fws reversal of its position that mlff jeopardized the humpback chub and adversely modified or destroyed its critical habitat.the district court decided that the biop lacked a reasoned basis,under the best available science,for fws new conclusion that mlff does not destroy or adversely modify chub critical habitat and lacked a discussion on the effects of mlff on chub recovery.the district court remanded the biop to fws for reconsideration in light of the district court decision.
in response to the district court remand,fws issued a supplement to the biop which together with the biop constituted the biop.in the biop,fws explained its conclusion that the operation of the dam under mlff no longer jeopardized the humpback chub or adversely modified or destroyed its critical habitat,and,consistent with esa requirements,included an incidental take statement its that specified the level of humpback chub take permissible under mlff operations.the trust then filed a second supplemental complaint asserting that the biop and the its violate the esa that the its violates nepa and that fws draft recovery goals,on which fws relied to address humpback chub recovery in the biop,violate the esa.
as to whether fws violated nepa with respect to the its,the district court gave summary judgment to fws,concluding that the issuance of the its was not a major federal action requiring nepa compliance.with respect to the draft recovery goals,the district court granted summary judgment to fws,concluding that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the apa to consider the recovery goals because they are in draft form and are not a final agency action subject to apa review.the district court also concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to review the draft recovery goals under the citizen suit provision of the esa because fws had yet to violate the esa mandate that recovery goals be submitted for public notice and comment and peer review before final approval.
the district court granted summary judgment to fws as to the biop,and summary judgment to the trust as to the its.the district court concluded that fws fulfilled its duty under the apa to explain its new position regarding mlff,but concluded that the its was insufficient under the esa because fws did not sufficiently explain why the take of young chub could not be quantified,did not provide a causal link between the surrogate used and the take of young chub,and did not provide a rational explanation why no additional reasonable and prudent measures were necessary.the district court remanded the its to fws for reconsideration in light of the district court decision.
in response to the district court ruling,fws issued a its that replaced the its,and the trust again supplemented its complaint alleging that the its violates the esa and nepa.the district court granted summary judgment to fws,concluding that the its had cured the problems that the district court previously identified in the its,and that the its was not a major federal action subject to nepa compliance.
the trust then filed this appeal raising issues whether the biop is unlawful under the esa whether the court has jurisdiction to review the recovery goals whether reclamation violates the esa by relying on the biop whether fws its is unlawful whether reclamation violates the esa by relying on the its and whether reclamation must comply with the esa and with nepa procedures before issuing an aop.

after the trust filed its notice of appeal and pursuant to reclamation january request to initiate formal consultation on reclamation proposed year continued operation of the dam under mlff along with high flow experimental releases and fish controls,fws issued a new biop and its,which cover the operation of the dam through the biop and its have supplanted the biop and the its,the documents at issue in this appeal.we first address the issue of mootness in light of these intervening developments.
the doctrine of mootness,which is embedded in article iii case or controversy requirement,requires that an actual,ongoing controversy exist at all stages of federal court proceedings.pitts terrible herbst,cir.a claim is moot if it has lost its character as a present,live controversy.am.rivers marine fisheries,cir.if an event occurs that prevents the court from granting effective relief,the claim is moot and must be dismissed.id.
we have held that the issuance of a superseding biop moots issues on appeal relating to the preceding biop.see id.at idaho dep t of fish game marine fisheries,f d cir see also rio grande silvery minnow bureau of reclamation,cir concluding that a superseding biop mooted issues related to the validity of previous biops.here,there is no dispute that the biop and the its have been replaced by the biop and the its.defendants appellees argue,and the trust concedes,that the trust claims related to the biop and the biop are now moot.we agree.the trust claims that the biop is unlawful under the esa that reclamation violates the esa by relying on the biop that the its is unlawful and that reclamation violates the esa by relying on the its are moot.we turn to the remaining issues.
the trust contends that reclamation violates the esa by not consulting with fws before issuing each aop.the district court concluded that reclamation decision not to consult with fws under the esa does not violate apa standards.the district court reasoned that aops are not the kind of affirmative agency action requiring formal consultation under the esa and its implementing regulations because in issuing each aop,reclamation does not exercise discretion that could inure to the benefit of the humpback chub.we agree.
the esa requires formal consultation when a federal agency authorize s,fund s,or carrie s out any action that may affect a listed species.a a karuk tribe,at.federal regulation limits this consultation requirement to all actions in which there is discretionary federal involvement or control.emphasis added.in national association of home builders defenders of wildlife,the supreme court acknowledged this regulatory limitation,stating that the esa requirements would come into play only when an action results from the exercise of agency discretion.id.at.esa consultation requirements do not apply to an action that an agency is required by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.id.at emphasis in original see karuk tribe,at t his limitation harmonizes the esa consultation requirement with other statutory mandates that leave an agency no discretion to consider the protection of listed species.
we have further held that the esa consultation requirement applies only if the agency has the discretionary control to inure to the benefit of a protected species.toxics coal.epa,cir quoting turtle island restoration network marine fisheries,cir the parties here primarily dispute whether the issuance of an aop is a discretionary act that triggers the esa consultation requirement,and we determine that this issue controls our rejection of an esa consultation requirement concerning production of each aop.
the supreme court has said that not every action authorized,funded,or carried out by a federal agency is a product of that agency exercise of discretion.home builders,at.in home builders,the court considered whether the united states environmental protection agency epa exercised the requisite discretion for the purposes of the esa consultation requirement when,under the clean water act cwa,epa transferred pollution discharge permitting authority to a state requesting the transfer.the court noted that the cwa mandated the transfer after nine specified criteria were met,without reference to additional compliance with esa consultation requirements.id.at.the court concluded that although epa exercised some discretion in determining whether a state had met the specified criteria,once epa decided that the state satisfied all nine criteria,epa did not have discretion,under the cwa,to deny the transfer.id.
here,reclamation is required by statute to prepare and submit an aop each year to congress and the governors of the colorado river basin states.b,c.the trust argues that because the specific content of each aop is not dictated by statute,reclamation is left with the discretion to decide,through the aop process,to operate the dam in a manner that would benefit the humpback chub by choosing to implement sasf,or some other similar flow regime.
the plain language of the crbpa,however,belies that reclamation,through the aop process,exercises that sort of discretion.the crbpa provides that aops must describ e the actual operation of the dam under the adopted criteria for the preceding compact water year and the projected operation for the current year.b emphasis added.as stated above,the adopted operating criteria for the dam is mlff which was selected by the secretary in in the record of decision,and reclamation does not have the discretion,through its promulgation of an aop,to deviate from the implementation of mlff.the statute underscores that reality by limiting the content of each aop to a mere description of how reclamation in the past year has,and in the upcoming year will,operate the dam under the adopted criteria.in this light,we conclude that the statute requires reclamation to perform a specific act rather than achieve broad goals namely,reclamation does not have the discretion to select different operating criteria for the dam by saying so in an aop.karuk tribe,at.in other words,reclamation does not exercise discretion signifying agency action requiring esa consultation compliance.
that the statute does not dictate with specificity the precise content of each aop does not detract from this conclusion.the operation of the dam is subject to some uncertainty,which stems from variances in hydrologic conditions,such as snowpack,and in yearly electricity and water demand,based on obligations established by the law of the river that are necessarily unknowable before their occurrence but affect the operation of the dam.for example,a year with extreme temperatures might increase the demand for electricity necessary to run heating and cooling systems.reclamation exercises some discretion in preparing each aop insofar as reclamation must make projections about how it will operate the dam for the upcoming year based on forecasts.that discretion,however,does not affect reclamation specific,obligation to implement mlff in its operation of the dam,which the trust identifies as the primary harm to the humpback chub.
the crux of reclamation process on water flows and other features of the dam operation is in its establishment of operating criteria for the dam,such as use of mlff rather than sasf,and interested parties had opportunity to challenge agency decisions on the dam operating criteria.it is neither practical nor required by law to permit challenges to each operating plan that is necessarily fashioned reflecting the operating criteria in its current setting.
the aop,which the trust challenges,suggests limitations on discretion imposed on reclamation in its preparation and issuance of an aop.in it,reclamation describes its statutory mandate as follows 
this annual operating plan aop was developed in accordance with section of the colorado river basin project act and the criteria for coordinated long range operation of colorado river reservoirs pursuant to the colorado river basin project act of september,operating criteria,as amended,promulgated by the secretary of the interior secretary.this aop implements the requirement of section b of the colorado river basin project act that the secretary annually prepare a report describing the actual operation under the adopted critera,the operating criteria for the preceding compact water year,from october to september and the projected operation of the current year.
in accordance with the crbpa and the operating criteria,the aop must be developed and administered consistent with applicable federal laws and other documents relating to the use of the waters of the colorado river,which are commonly and collectively known as the law of the river.
reclamation further describes the aop purpose as follows 
the purposes of the aop are to determine or address the projected operation of the colorado river reservoirs to satisfy project purposes under varying hydrologic and climatic conditions the quantity of water considered necessary to be in storage in the upper basin reservoirs pursuant to section a of the colorado river basin project act water available for delivery pursuant to the united states mexico water treaty and minutes and of the international boundary and water commission whether the reasonable consumptive use requirements of mainstream users in the lower division states will be met under a normal,surplus,or shortage condition as outlined in the operating criteria and as implemented by the interim guidelines and whether water apportioned to,but unused by one or more lower division states exists and can be used to satisfy beneficial consumptive use requests of mainstream users in other lower division states as provided in the consolidated decree of the supreme court of the united states in arizona california.
this description supports the conclusion that the aop is merely a descriptive tool by which congress and the governors of the colorado river basin states may be kept apprised of how reclamation is meeting its multiple preexisting obligations while implementing mlff at the dam.
the gcpa reinforces that it was not congress intention to subject aops to esa consultation requirements.the act explicitly requires reclamation,in preparing each aop,to consult with the governors of the colorado river basin states and with members of the general public,including academics and scientists,environmental organizations,the recreation industry,and those who buy power that the dam produces,c.this list indicates that congress knew how to mandate consultation in the preparation of each aop,yet chose not to include in that list formal consultation under the esa.we read that exclusion to mean that congress did not intend that reclamation comply with the esa before issuing an aop.see home builders,at concluding that the addition of implicit esa compliance to the explicitly enumerated criteria for transfer would impermissibly alter the cwa statutory mandate.
because we conclude that reclamation,in preparing each aop describing the operation of the dam,does not exercise discretion that inures to the benefit of the chub,we hold that reclamation does not violate the esa by issuing each aop without formally consulting with fws.
our decision in california sportfishing protection alliance federal energy and regulatory commission,cir,is also instructive with respect to our agency action inquiry here.in that case we considered a petition for review of the federal energy and regulatory commission ferc decision not to formally consult with the national marine fisheries service nmfs about the continued operation of the desabla centerville hydroelectric project,a system of dams,reservoirs,canals,and powerhouses in butte county,california.in,ferc issued a year operating permit to pacific gas and electric pg e to operate the desabla centerville hydroelectric project.id.at.petitioners challenged ferc decision not to consult formally with nmfs about the continued operation of the hydroelectric project after the chinook salmon was declared a threatened species under the esa in.id.we decided that the relevant agency action was the granting of the permit in.id.at.since ferc consulted with nmfs before issuing the permit to pg e,and because that agency action was complete,we held that pg e continued operation of the hydroelectric project pursuant to that permit,notwithstanding the subsequent listing of the chinook salmon,was merely an ongoing activity that is not agency action for the purpose of esa consultation.id.at.
in substance,by challenging the aops and urging each one requires separate esa consultation,the trust is continuously challenging reclamation implementation of mlff on an annual basis and its purported effects on the humpback chub.it is truly the selection of mlff as the operating criteria which creates the environmental effects of concern to the trust,and so the agency action,for the purposes of the esa,with which the trust truly takes issue was the selection of mlff as one of the operating criteria,rather than the agency routine reporting in each aop.reclamation,however,fully complied with esa consultation requirements before the secretary chose mlff consistent with our decision in california sportfishing,reclamation yearly issuance of an aop is part of reclamation ongoing operation of the dam under mlff and does not trigger formal consultation under the esa.id.at.
our decision on this is also pragmatically required.it is called for and legally required to permit environmental challenge under the esa for want of consultation about an endangered or threatened species whenever the agency establishes material operating criteria for a dam,and when it embarks on a significant new direction in its operations.but to allow esa challenge on an annual basis for each aop would be unduly cumbersome and unproductive in addressing the substance of environmental issues.annual challenges could not likely be resolved fully before the next aop came along,and there is no benefit to endangered species in having an unending judicial process concerning annual reporting requirements that congress mandated.
the trust next contends that reclamation violates nepa by not preparing either an ea or eis for each aop.the district court concluded that aops are not major federal actions for which nepa requires that an ea eis be prepared.c.we agree.
in upper snake river chapter of trout unlimited hodel,cir,we considered whether reclamation was required to comply with nepa before making changes to the flow of water from the palisades dam and reservoir located on the south fork of the snake river in idaho.reclamation had previously adopted a standard operating procedure in which it maintained the flow of water from the dam in the south fork at a level above cubic feet per second cfs.id.at.in response to drought conditions,however,reclamation reduced the flow to below cfs without first preparing an eis.id.at.we noted that if an ongoing project undergoes changes which themselves amount to major federal actions,the operating agency must prepare an eis however,we said that where a proposed federal action would not change the status quo,an eis is not necessary.id.at.we characterized the fluctuations in flow as routine managerial actions that reclamation had continuously implemented while operating the facility in the manner intended.id.at.in that light,we concluded that reclamation was not required to comply with nepa when it made changes to the volume of water it released from the dam based on changes in weather conditions.id.at.
here,reclamation is not making material changes to the operating criteria for the dam when it prepares and issues an aop.as in upper snake river chapter of trout unlimited,reclamation does not change the status quo through the aop process.reclamation is not authorized to operate the dam under another flow regime by simply declaring such a change in an aop.instead,as stated above,an aop merely chronicles reclamation ongoing operation of the dam under the existing operating criteria,mlff,during the preceding year and projects how reclamation will do the same in the upcoming year.
in addition,we have said that t he standards for major federal action under nepa and agency action under the esa are much the same.if there is any difference,case law indicates major federal action is the more exclusive standard.marbled murrelet babbitt,cir see also karuk tribe,at although the major federal action standard under nepa is similar to the more liberal agency action standard under the esa,marbled murrelet,at,the terms are not interchangeable.because we conclude above that aop promulgation is not an agency action subject to consultation,it follows that aop promulgation does not trigger compliance with nepa procedural requirements.marbled murrelet,at where,as here,there is no agency action under what is probably the more liberal standard of the esa,there is no major federal action under the more exclusive standard of nepa.
our conclusion above that producing an aop is not a major federal action requiring compliance with nepa procedures is also reinforced by the same pragmatic and realistic concerns that supported our decision that aops do not routinely require esa consultation.similarly,we hold that reclamation is not required to comply with nepa procedural requirements before preparing each aop for the dam.the time for an agency to give a hard look at environmental consequences,and the opportunity for serious nepa litigation on whether alternatives were adequately considered,should come in this context at the points where an agency establishes operating criteria for a dam,or embarks on some significant shift of direction in operating policy,not merely when there is routine and required annual reporting.
the trust next challenges the district court conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to review the draft recovery goals for the humpback chub.fws issued recovery goals for the chub in recovery goals.the district court invalidated them,however,because they did not include time and cost estimates as required by the esa.because the district court did not find fault with the science of the recovery goals,fws restyled them as the draft recovery goals and relied on them as the best available science regarding humpback chub recovery in the biop.see a requiring use of the best scientific and commercial data available.taking into account the science of the draft recovery goals,the district court concluded that fws,in the biop,cured the deficiency that the district court identified in the biop.
the trust challenged the draft recovery goals,contending that they violated the esa because they had not been offered for public notice and comment or
