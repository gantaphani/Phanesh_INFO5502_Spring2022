the secretary of commerce appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of earth island the district court held that the secretary initial finding,triggering a change in the label standard,was not in accordance with the law and constituted an abuse of discretion because the secretary failed to obtain and consider preliminary data from the congressionally mandated stress studies and apply the proper legal standard to the available scientific information.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
this case concerns congressional efforts to protect dolphins in the eastern tropical pacific ocean etp,which covers between five and seven million square miles and extends from the southern californian to the south american coastlines.in the etp,yellowfin tuna schools swim below dolphin groups,which are visible as they break the surface to breathe and leap into the air.since,fishermen in the etp have pursued and chased the air breathing dolphin groups in order to catch the yellowfin tuna below.in this process,referred to as setting on dolphins,the fishermen use explosives,chase boats,and helicopters to drive the dolphins and tuna into the center of purse seine nets.floats and weights support the nets,which close like a purse around all trapped inside.from to,millions of dolphins were killed in the nets.public outrage over the etp dolphin deaths led to a variety of legislation and ultimately a labeling standard.a review of the legislation leading to the standard and the potential easing of that standard is necessary for an understanding of the present controversy.
in,public outcry over the etp dolphin deaths led congress to enact the marine mammal protection act mmpa,et,which had the reduction of etp dolphin deaths as one of its goals.the mmpa directed the secretary of the treasury to ban the importation of commercial fish or products from fish which have been caught with commercial fishing technology which results in the incidental kill or incidental serious injury of ocean mammals in excess of united states standards.id.a.having conducted research required by the mmpa,the national marine fisheries service found that three etp dolphin stocks were coastal dolphin fed.reg,northeastern offshore spotted dolphin fed.reg,and the eastern spinner dolphin fed.reg.in,and,congress amended the mmpa to ban importation of tuna that failed to meet certain conditions regarding dolphin mortality.a b et.in,responding to consumer concern and american tuna processors labeling changes,congress enacted the dolphin protection consumer information act dpcia under which tuna sold in the united states could not have a dolphin safe label if the tuna had been caught using purse seine nets intentionally deployed on or to encircle dolphins.
the american legislation and corresponding standards caused the loss of a large market for those countries that continued to set on etp dolphins with purse seine nets.in,the united states and other nations with purse seine fishing vessels in the etp negotiated the international dolphin conservation program la jolla agreement,in which they agreed to maintain dolphin kill levels at or below a dolphin mortality limit assigned to each vessel,and to work toward reducing dolphin mortality to levels approaching zero.brower daley,d.three years later,the la jolla agreement was formalized into a binding agreement,the panama declaration,under which the united states agreed to seek changes in united states laws pertaining to tuna embargoes,market access,and the dolphin safe label,congr.rec.the panama declaration sought legislation to change immediately the dolphin safe labeling standard and to allow tuna caught with purse seine nets to be labeled dolphin safe as long as no dolphins were observed to be killed or seriously injured during the set.
in part to implement the panama declaration and eliminate the ban on tuna imports from countries complying with the la jolla agreement,on august,congress enacted the international dolphin conservation program act idcpa,pub,stat.while there had been success in lowering dolphin mortality rates congress remained concerned that,even if dolphins were not killed or seriously injured in the purse seine nets,the physiological stress they suffered during the chase and encirclement would impede the dolphin populations recovery.accordingly,congress rejected panama declaration language which sought an immediate change in the label.pt,reprinted in.congress included in the idcpa a requirement of specified research projects directed toward assessing the prevalence and magnitude of stress in the etp dolphins.
through the idcpa,congress amended the dpcia and required the secretary to make initial and final findings as to whether the intentional deployment on or encirclement of dolphins with purse seine nets is having a significant adverse impact on any depleted dolphin stock in the etp.g g.the secretary was to make the initial finding on the basis of research conducted before march,information obtained under the international dolphin conservation program,and any other relevant information the idcpa also amended the mmpa to provide details of the required research 
a required research 
in secretary shall,in consultation with the marine mammal commission and the tropical tuna commission,conduct a study of the effect of intentional encirclement including chase on dolphins and dolphin stocks incidentally taken in the course of purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna in the etp.the study,which shall commence on october,shall consist of abundance surveys as described in paragraph and stress studies as described in paragraph,and shall address the question of whether such encirclement is having a significant adverse impact on any depleted dolphin stock in the etp.
population abundance abundance surveys under this subsection shall survey the abundance of such depleted stocks and shall be conducted during each of the calendar years,and.
stress stress studies under this subsection shall include 
a a review of relevant research and a series of necropsy samples from dolphins obtained by commercial vessels 
b a review of relevant historical demographic and biological data related to dolphins and dolphin stocks referred to in paragraph and 
c an experiment involving the repeated chasing and capturing of dolphins by means of intentional encirclement.
a.the secretary delegated the research to the national marine fisheries service.a change in the labeling standard from the existing,more restrictive standard to the less protective standard depended on nmfs answer as to whether the intentional deployment on or encirclement of dolphins with purse seine nets is having a significant adverse impact on any depleted dolphin stock in the etp.
on march,nmfs submitted its report to congress.nmfs found that the currently depleted populations of both northeastern offshore spotted dolphins and eastern spinner were not increasing at the rate expected based on the low rate of reported mortalities from the fishery since and the reproductive potential for these populations.report at vi.nmfs noted the difficulty in attributing the cause of the low or declining growth rates.id.at viii.nmfs identified only one possible related explanation for the slow or declining growth large scale environmental variability in the ocean habitat.however,nmfs discounted that explanation the review of environmental conditions did not disclose any oceanographic regime shifts during recent decades and therefore it is unlikely that the dolphin populations failure to grow can be explained by environmental variability.id.at.
turning to explanations for the slow or declining population growth rates,nmfs identified stress,separation of cows and calves with subsequent death of calves,as well as of direct kills.nmfs noted that none of these potential explanations is necessarily exclusive of the others.id.however,nmfs reported that it did not have data from any of the three mandated stress research projects.id.at.therefore,regarding stress concerns,nmfs included only the physiological and behavioral stress in mammals literature review.after reviewing the literature,nmfs concluded that 
although this review of existing literature regarding stress in mammals can not provide a quantitative or definitive answer to the question of whether the tuna fishery is causing stress to affected dolphin populations,the available information and evidence point to the likelihood that physiological stress is induced by fisheries activities.it is therefore plausible that stress resulting from chase and capture in the etp tuna fishery could have a population level effect on one or more dolphin stocks.
nmfs then reported that it did not have evidence to determine whether there was physiological evidence of stress in individual dolphins from the affected dolphin populations,and that the answer probably would be available at the completion of the necropsy sampling program.id.at.therefore,nmfs concluded that 
given the information available from research vessel abundance estimates,tuna vessel abundance indices and observed fishery mortality,the quantitative answers to the question,in the period since,has there been for any depleted stock a failure to grow at the expected rate are yes for both northeastern offshore spotted and eastern spinner dolphins.the probabilities associated with these answers are quite high,well above the suggested thresholds when considered with the qualitative answer from oceanographic studies that it is unlikely that such a failure to grow can be explained by environmental variability and the qualitative answer from the literature review that it is plausible that stress resulting from chase and encirclement could have population level effects the information suggests but by no means conclusively that the fishery has been the source of significant adverse impact on these two populations.
id.at emphasis added 
on may,the secretary issued his initial finding fed.reg.concluding that there is insufficient evidence that chase and encirclement by the tuna purse seine fishery is having a significant adverse impact on depleted dolphin stocks in the etp.pursuant to the initial finding,the dolphin safe label standard changed effective february,to permit the use of dolphin safe labeling when purse seine nets are used,as long as no dolphins were killed or seriously injured during the particular set in which the tuna were caught.
earth island challenged the validity of the secretary initial finding under the administrative procedures act,et as arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,and contrary to law earth island claimed that the secretary failed to obtain and consider preliminary data from the congressionally mandated stress research projects,and failed to determine whether,on the basis of the best available scientific evidence,the use of purse seine nets is having a significant adverse impact on the depleted dolphin populations.earth island also asserted that the secretary failed to apply the proper legal standard to the scientific information available,abused his discretion,and acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to find significant adverse impact given the best available evidence.
the district court found that the secretary initial finding was not in accordance with the law and an abuse of discretion because the secretary failed to obtain and consider preliminary data from the congressionally mandated stress studies and apply the proper legal standard to the available scientific information.the district court concluded that 
i t would flout the statutory scheme to permit the secretary to fail to conduct mandated research,and then invoke a lack of evidence as a justification for removing a form of protection for a depleted species,particularly given that the evidence presently available to the secretary is all suggestive of a significant adverse impact.
brower,d at.the district court granted plaintiff motion for summary judgment and set aside the secretary initial finding until such time as the secretary has an opportunity to consider preliminary results from the congressionally mandated stress research studies.id.the secretary appealed.

iii.analysis 
the starting point in statutory interpretation is the language of the statute itself.group life health ins.royal drug,d.in construing federal statutes,we presume that the ordinary meaning of the words chosen by congress accurately express its legislative intent.mills music,snyder,d.the meaning of statutory language,plain or not,depends on context.holloway united states,d internal citations omitted.context in this regard relates to the design of the statute as a whole and to its object and policy.united states,d quoting crandon united states,d.in determining a statutory provision meaning,we may consider the purpose of the statute in its entirety,and whether the proposed interpretation would frustrate or advance that purpose.united states mohrbacher,cir citations omitted.
in urging this court to reverse the district court,the secretary and amici stress that this case involves international concerns and competing policies for protecting dolphins.that it does,but it is not our role to make policy decisions about etp dolphin conservation.such decisions are within congress bailiwick,and both the secretary and this court must defer to congressional intent as reflected in the idcpa.
the required secretarial findings 
in the section entitled secretarial findings,the idcpa mandates the secretary course of action t he secretary shall make an initial finding regarding whether the intentional deployment on or encirclement of dolphins with purse seine nets is having a significant adverse impact on any depleted dolphin stock in the etp.g emphasis added see also id.g final finding.the common meaning of whether is whichever of the two,merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed,and should be read to mean whether or not.therefore,the idcpa mandatory language required the secretary to make an initial finding whether or not the purse seine net fishery was having a significant adverse impact on any depleted etp dolphin stock.
however,urging us to read h as establishing a default to the less protective label standard,the secretary argues that he is not required to find affirmatively that there is not a significant adverse impact.the secretary contends that if he fails to find evidence of significant adverse impact,then the less protective dolphin labeling standard will go into effect.we reject this interpretation for several reasons.
first,the secretary interpretation is at odds with the statute structure.under g,secretarial findings,the idcpa required the secretary to make a finding whether or not the activities were adversely impacting the dolphins.this finding requires a yes or no answer yes,there was a significant adverse impact or no,there was no significant adverse impact.section h,certification by captain and observer,does not determine the parameters or scope of the initial finding.nor does it change the secretary burden of proof as written in g,secretarial findings.
second,congress rejected panama declaration language which sought an immediate change in the dolphin safe label.it would be inconsistent with that history and congressional concern to interpret the statute as establishing the new labeling standard as the default just as we may not substitute our judgment for the agency,overton park,at,the agency may not ignore congress,conner burford,cir.
finally,this default construction should be avoided because it would lead to absurd results.griffin oceanic contractors,d statutory interpretations which would produce absurd results are to be avoided if alternative interpretations consistent with the legislative purpose are available.such a default construction would render the required stress studies irrelevant.the use of a default does not encourage active,aggressive and research or conclusive answers.for example,the secretary could deliberately drag his feet in commencing studies or while conducting studies and then conclude there was insufficient evidence to warrant finding a significant adverse impact on the etp dolphin stocks.similarly,the secretary could limit the studies breadth and then discover that there was insufficient evidence to warrant finding a significant adverse impact on the etp dolphin stocks.following the secretary interpretation,under the above scenarios,the dolphin labeling standard would default to the less protective standard for the initial finding,because the secretary failed to find evidence of significant adverse impact,and the less protective standard would be in place during the interim period between the initial and final findings.a practical consequence of this default would be increased pressure on the secretary to keep the same dolphin labeling standard,that is,to have the same result for the final finding.
we reject the secretary default construction and hold,as congress required,that the secretary must affirmatively find whether or not there is a significant adverse impact before the dolphin safe labeling standards can be relaxed.
commencement of the stress studies 
the deference accorded an agency scientific or technical expertise is not unlimited.defenders of wildlife babbitt.the presumption of agency expertise can be rebutted when its decisions,while relying on scientific expertise,are not reasoned.id.we defer to agency expertise on methodology issues,unless the agency has completely failed to address some factor consideration of which was essential to making an informed decision.inland empire pub.lands council schultz,cir internal citations omitted.
the idcpa statutory language clearly and unambiguously required the secretary to commence a study,consisting of abundance surveys and stress studies,on october,a.the idcpa provided explicit,detailed instructions for the stress studies.additionally,the idcpa required that 
between march,and march,the secretary shall,on the basis of the research conducted before march,under section of this title,information obtained under the international dolphin conservation program,and any other relevant information,make an initial finding regarding whether the intentional deployment on or encirclement of dolphins with purse seine nets is having a significant adverse impact on any depleted dolphin stock in the etp.
g emphasis added.
trying to support his initial finding,which did not incorporate any stress study evidence,the secretary asserts that the legislative history indicates that initial finding would be made on the basis of limited evidence.this contention is without merit.issuing the initial finding using limited evidence is very different from issuing the initial finding without obtaining or considering any data from stress studies that are specifically required.given the mandatory,detailed,and explicit language regarding the stress studies,the secretary was required to conduct stress tests and consider some preliminary results prior to issuing the initial finding see,nrdc epa,cir this court must uphold adherence to the law,and can not condone the failure of an executive agency to conform to express statutory requirements.
the stress studies 
the secretary contends that the district court erroneously found that nmfs failed to comport with the spirit and the letter of the law by unreasonably delaying the stress studies and failing to collect,analyze,and report on any stress study data.we reject this contention.
in determining whether nmfs unreasonably delayed the stress studies,we balance the following trac factors 
the time agencies take to make decisions must be governed by a rule of reason where congress has provided a timetable or other indication of the speed with which it expects the agency to proceed in the enabling statute,that statutory scheme may supply content for this rule of reason delays that might be reasonable in the sphere of economic regulation are less tolerable when human health and welfare are at stake the court should consider the effect of expediting delayed action on agency activities of a higher or competing priority the court should also take into account the nature and extent of the interests prejudiced by the delay and the court need not find any impropriety lurking behind agency lassitude in order to hold that agency action is unreasonably delayed.

the idcpa required a literature review of relevant research,a series of dolphin necropsy samples obtained by commercial vessels,a review of relevant historical demographic and biological data,and an experiment involving the repeated chasing and capturing of dolphins by means of intentional encirclement.a.at the time of the initial finding,nmfs had commenced and completed only the literature review.nmfs,which had not conducted any research on the three required studies,provided brief overviews on and updates of the three studies necropsy study,historical study,and chase and recapture project in the report.
necropsy study the necropsy study involves placing trained necropsy technicians onboard commercial tuna vessels to collect tissue samples from dolphins killed in the etp fishery.report at.collection of these tissue samples requires that technicians be placed onboard tuna vessels fishing on dolphins because vessels currently do not fish on dolphins in the etp.id.mexico had agreed to participate in the necropsy sampling program,and work with nmfs to conduct a pilot necropsy study.id.at vi.in a december,necropsy meeting,mexican representatives repeatedly express ed strong commitment to facilitating the necropsy program to the full extent possible and identified four appropriate fishing vessels,along with reporting that additional vessels would be available in the future.by the time of the initial finding,the only activity related to the necropsy study that had taken place was a training session for technicians in january.
the secretary argues unconvincingly that nmfs could not obtain necropsy samples due to a lack of cooperation.nmfs did not request cooperation in a timely fashion,waiting until may,seven months after the idcpa directed nmfs to begin the study,to first request assistance.thereafter,the record and report to congress indicate mexico continued enthusiasm and willingness to cooperate.moreover,the lack of cooperation argument does not explain why nmfs could begin necropsy sampling only after,ra
