the united states of america appeals from two orders of the united states district court for the southern district of new york kaplan,denying its applications for a restitution award in favor of the republic of south africa pursuant to,first,the mandatory victims restitution act of mvra,and second,the victim and witness protection act of vwpa.in its first order,the district court denied the government application for a restitution award under the mvra,adopting the magistrate judge report and recommendation,and holding that south africa had no property interest in either the lobsters that the defendants took from south african waters or in any tax or other form of revenue as a result of the defendants breach of south africa conservation regulatory laws.in its second order,the district court denied the government application for a restitution award under the vwpa,again adopting the magistrate judge report and recommendation.the district court held that in addition to its failure to prove that the illegally harvested lobsters were the property of south africa,the government failed to demonstrate that south africa was a victim,how it suffered any direct or proximate harm as a result of the defendants conduct.the district court further held that,even if restitution was permissible as a matter of law,the complication and prolonging of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of the order of restitution under this section would outweigh the need to provide restitution to the republic of south africa.for the reasons that follow,we hold that south africa has a property interest in rock lobsters unlawfully harvested from its waters,is a victim for restitution purposes,as defined by the mvra and vwpa,and whatever the complexity in fashioning a restitution order in this case,it is insufficient to preclude entry of such an order under the mvra.accordingly,the judgments of the district court are vacated and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
from to,arnold bengis,jeffrey noll and david bengis jointly,defendants engaged in an elaborate scheme to illegally harvest large quantities of south coast and west coast rock lobsters in south african waters for export to the united states in violation of both south african and law.arnold bengis was the managing director and chairman of hout bay fishing industries,hout bay,a fishing and operation in capetown,south africa,through which defendants principally organized their conspiracy to capture,process and export lobster to the united states.jeffrey noll and david bengis were presidents of two corporations that imported,processed,packed,and distributed the fish within the united states on behalf of hout bay.at all relevant times,the harvesting,processing and exporting of south coast and west coast rock lobsters from south africa was governed under south african law principally by the marine living resources act of mlra,the regulations promulgated under the mlra,and the convention on the conservation of marine living resources.the south african department of marine and coastal management regulated the harvesting,processing and exporting of fish from south africa waters by,inter alia,establishing fishing season quotas and issuing harvesting and exporting permits.defendants caused hout bay to harvest south coast and west coast rock lobsters in amounts exceeding authorized quotas and to export those lobsters to the united states.
in may,south african authorities seized and opened a container of unlawfully harvested fish and alerted authorities that another container was scheduled to arrive in the united states soon thereafter.following the may seizure,the defendants continued to attempt to avoid detection and to perpetuate their scheme.
although south african authorities obtained arrest warrants for defendants,after concluding that defendants financial resources and presence outside of south africa rendered them beyond the reach of south african authorities,morrison,app,south africa declined to charge,much less prosecute,them.instead,south africa focused its prosecution on the south entities involved in the scheme,including hout bay,its operational manager,collin van schalkwyk,several west coast lobster fisherman with whom hout bay had contracted,and fourteen fisheries inspectors who had taken bribes during the course of the scheme.id.at.in april,arnold bengis returned to south africa to enter a plea of guilty on behalf of hout bay for,inter alia,of south and west coast rock lobster in violation of the mlra.according to its plea agreement with the south african government,hout bay paid a fine of million rand approximately million in april and forfeited two fishing boats and the contents of the container seized by the government.the south african government also cooperated with the united states in its investigation and prosecution of the bengises and noll for their violation of law.
following their indictments in the united states,arnold bengis and jeffrey noll pleaded guilty to i conspiracy to violate the lacey act and to commit smuggling in violation of and ii violations of the lacey act,a a david bengis pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge only.in,the defendants were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment and supervised release and together forfeited a total of to the united states.although the defendants plea agreements acknowledged that restitution might be ordered,with the parties consent,the district court deferred the restitution hearing to a later date.
following the court decision to hold a restitution hearing,the united states submitted a report prepared by the ocean and land resource assessment consultants olrac,a group of experts commissioned by the south african department of marine and coastal management,setting out two different methods for calculating restitution.olrac method i focused on the cost of remediation,what it would cost south africa to restore the rock lobster fishery to the level it would have been had the defendants not engaged in overharvesting the catch forfeit amount olrac estimated restitution using the catch forfeit amount to be.olrac method ii focused on the market value of the overharvested fish and was calculated by multiplying the quantity of overharvested fish by the prevailing market price.olrac estimated restitution using olrac method ii to be.
the government recommended that the district court adopt olrac method i restitution lower of the two totaled after deducting the value of the fine and vessels previously forfeited by hout bay to south africa.alternatively,the government recommended adopting the olrac method ii calculation totaling after those same deductions.the district court held its decision on a restitution award in abeyance pending the outcome of settlement discussions,which ended unsuccessfully.consequently,on june,the district court referred the restitution issues to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendations.
