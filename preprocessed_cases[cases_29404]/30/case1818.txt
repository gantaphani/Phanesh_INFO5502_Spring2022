in this opinion,we hold that rule,promulgated by the san joaquin valley unified air pollution control district district,as mandated by health and safety code section,was adopted without conducting an adequate assessment of its impact on public health.we also conclude that section is intended to address the district failure to meet federal and state ambient air quality standards for ozone and does not regulate ammonia emissions produced by large confined animal facilities.finally,we determine that the district findings were not arbitrary and capricious.
procedural and factual summaries 
this appeal is from the denial of a writ of mandate sought by petitioner association of irritated residents association to compel the district to comply with section.section initially was passed in as part of senate bill.stats,ch,sb.the statute mandates that those state air pollution control districts designated federal nonattainment areas for ozone as of january,adopt and implement a rule requiring confined animal facilities facilities to reduce emissions of air contaminants.the rule is to apply to existing facilities and does not apply to expanded or new facilities.prior to the passage of section,agricultural sources of air contaminants were exempted from air pollution control district regulation.assem.com.on appropriations,on bill reg.sess.as amended.the legislature declared its intent when enacting sb the purpose of the act adding this section is to establish a new set of programs at the state and regional levels to reduce air emissions from agricultural sources in order to protect public health and the environment.stats,ch,subd.the agricultural industry,including the many facilities located in the san joaquin valley valley,contribute large quantities of emissions and particulates and that significantly contribute to the air pollution impacting the valley and its residents.stats,ch.the valley air basin,home to one of the largest agricultural industries in the world,is a nonattainment area according to federal and state standards for three pollutants ozone,and.stats,ch,subds.
the district,in compliance with section,and after a series of public hearings and studies,adopted its rule.rule establishes a permit process for large confined animal facilities and is intended to control volatile organic compounds voc by controlling animal enteric,feed,and waste emissions with improved management practices.voc combine with nitrogen oxides,heat,and sunlight to form ozone.rule requires that facilities choose from a variety of mitigation feed and waste management the goal of reducing voc emissions.the rule also provides for compliance testing,sets up a compliance schedule,and establishes recordkeeping requirements for all facilities.
according to the association,the district did not comply with the statutory mandates when it passed rule because the district failed to perform a analysis before adopting rule failed to adopt a rule that reduces all air contaminants failed to regulate ammonia as an air contaminant failed to adopt a rule that actually reduces voc emissions and acted arbitrarily and capriciously by claiming emission reductions that lack evidentiary support.the community alliance for responsible environmental stewardship,the california dairy campaign,the milk producers counsel,and the western united dairymen have intervened on behalf of the district and in support of rule.
the trial court denied the petition deciding that the district did consider the public health impact of rule and that all issues related to public health raised by the association were addressed the intent and language of section do not require rule to include within its parameters air contaminants other than those directly related to the district nonattainment of federal and state ozone standards there is no requirement that rule address ammonia emissions and the claimed emission reductions are not lacking in evidentiary support.

ii.public health impacts 
the association contends that the district failed to consider the public health impacts of rule prior to its adoption.according to the association,the district final staff report staff report and the appendices prepared in connection with rule do not adequately assess public health issues as required by the statute.although the association acknowledges that information concerning public health was submitted during the process,it claims the district must do more than abstractly consider information in the record it must actively perform an assessment equivalent to the assessment provided for the other eight factors listed in section,subdivision e.
section,subdivision e,reads 
e prior to adopting a rule or regulation pursuant to subdivision b,a district shall,to the extent data are available,perform an assessment of the impact of the rule or regulation.the district shall consider the impact of the rule or regulation in a public hearing,and make a good faith effort to minimize any adverse impacts.the assessment shall include all of the following 
the category of sources affected,including,but not limited to,the approximate number of affected sources,and the size of those sources.
the nature and quantity of emissions from the category,and the significance of those emissions in adversely affecting public health and the environment and in causing or contributing to the violation of a state or federal ambient air quality standard.
the emission reduction potential.
the impact on employment in,and the economy of,the region affected.
the range of probable costs to affected sources and businesses.
the availability and of alternatives.
the technical and practical feasibility.
any additional information on impacts that is submitted to the district board for consideration.
the language of the statute unambiguously requires that,prior to adopting the rule,the district must perform an assessment of the rule impacts and that assessment must include the impact of the regulated emissions on the public health,subd.e.the association claims that a public health assessment should have been done in the same manner as was done in other assessments provided by the district as attachments to the staff report.these include an analysis of emission reductions,cost effectiveness,socioeconomic impacts,ammonia reduction,environmental,and rule consistency.these are independent analyses done by experts that provide more than conclusory or summary information.we agree with the district,however,that the statute does not require that the assessment take any particular form or be performed by independent experts.the statute requires only that an assessment be done prior to the adoption of the rule and that it include an analysis of the identified factors,subd.e.the question here is whether the district staff report is sufficient to meet the statutory requirements.on this point,we agree with the association and conclude that the staff report is insufficient because it does not assess the rule impact on public health.
the staff report acknowledges the statutory requirement that certain items be assessed in the process.the report provides a table identifying each required assessment and states where in the report the required analysis appears.according to the report,the impact of the regulated emissions on public health is done in section ib and section ii of the staff report.however,these sections do not speak to the impact of the regulated emissions on public health.section ii begins at page and ends at page of the staff report.it provides general background information on the agricultural animal industry,without any reference to public health.section ib is a general overview of the purpose of rule and offers no analysis of the rule impact on public health.the staff report does contain section viii,which is labeled health effects.the section consists of one paragraph and reads in its entirety as follows 
respiratory diseases associated with agriculture were one of the occupational hazards.according to the institute for agriculture and trade policy wallinga,studies at beef,swine,and poultry facilities show increased occurrences of asthma,sinusitis,bronchitis,decreased lung function,and depression among workers at concentrated animal feeding operations.of the voc and gaseous compounds found in odorous samples from north carolina swine facilities,are known airway irritants chronic irritation can permanently scar lungs and lead to respiratory problems.wallinga 
this single paragraph is inadequate and does not comply with the statutory directive.the district conceded at argument that this single paragraph was not intended to comply with section,subdivision e,although it argued it does not matter.the paragraph addresses occupational health,not general public health concerns,and does not touch upon the required analysis,the impact of the rule on public health.the district suggests that there is no need to discuss the impact of public health during the process because the rule is intended to assure compliance with federal ambient air quality standards.if this were true,there would be no need for the legislature to mandate such an assessment.to the contrary,an assessment is an evaluation,a determination of significance.webster new world dict.college ed.we decline to construe a statute in a way that makes meaningless the words chosen by the legislature.people western air lines,cal d.
the statute requires that the rule be assessed in light of the identified problem and that the actual words of the statute be given their plain and commonsense meaning.mercer department of motor vehicles cal d.it is not enough to say that voc emissions from large confined animal facilities add to poor air quality,which in turn impacts public health.this fact was acknowledged in the legislative history for sb.stats,ch,subd.a.in addition,it is insufficient to discuss the adverse health impact of ozone generally,for example,the general discussion in the district extreme ozone attainment demonstration plan included in the district materials.section,subdivision e,expressly requires that the district undertake an assessment of the impact of rule on public health.rules,off.of floor analyses,bill reg.sess.as amended,bill requires district to perform assessment of rule impact prior to adoption.the statute requires that t he nature and quantity of emissions from the category,and the significance of those emissions in adversely affecting public health and the environment,be assessed in connection with the impact of the rule or regulation,subd.e e.
there is nothing in the administrative record that provides this analysis.without this information,important competing policy issues can not adequately be addressed or weighed.when adopting rule,the district governing board stated that voc emission reductions would benefit the valley public health by reducing unhealthful concentrations of ambient ozone.this,however,is a conclusory statement offered at the end of the process and is unsupported by any analysis of the true impact of the rule on public health.it is not an adequate assessment of the issue.
we conclude that the subject was not adequately covered by comments raised or reports submitted during the public hearing process.during the public hearing process,the association provided an analysis of the cost impact the ill health effects of poor air quality has on the valley.this report,however,did not address the impact of rule on public health and is insufficient to meet the district duty to assess the impact of its rule on public health before its adoption,subd.e.likewise,the air report prepared by the american lung association,which was provided during the public comment period and which addresses the impact of air pollution including ozone on public health nationally,does not address the impact of rule on public health in the valley.
at the public hearing,the district executive officer told those present that the district was all about public health.however,he offered no insight regarding what the district expected to achieve concerning public health benefits with the adoption of rule.he simply stated that the district had reduced emissions significantly in the recent past,even though he acknowledged that asthma rates continue to climb.this explanation misses the point.section,subdivision e,requires an assessment that answers the question of how this rule will impact human health or,at the very least,why the rule will have no impact.
similarly,the district claims that the statutory assessment requirement is a proportionality requirement,and requires that the district be mindful of imposing large economic burdens for de minimis air quality benefits.the district is correct and this consideration is a part of the required assessment.subdivision e of section expressly requires assessment of the cost of implementing rule to the affected sources and businesses that are regulated.by the same token,an equal part of the required assessment is whether the controls imposed are sufficient to move the valley toward cleaner air.
sb was enacted in recognition that valley air must be improved to protect public health and that the past practice of exempting agricultural sources of air pollutants was not justified by potential adverse economic impacts on the agricultural industry.see stats,ch,subds.if,as the district claims,the rule is intended to assist in meeting federal ambient air quality standards,it is not surprising that the legislature has required the district to evaluate how its rule will impact the health concerns which led to the clean air act in the first place.wooley morss,clean air act handbook,supra,clean air act requires identification of air pollutants believed to to air pollution levels that may endanger public health national ambient air quality standards set at levels adequate to protect public health.after all,the clean air act primary consideration is the public welfare of the nation.see,a b whitman american trucking,supra,at.air quality standards set to protect public health cost not a factor to be considered in setting standards.
from this record,we can not tell whether rule planned reduction in voc emissions will have any impact on public health at all.the association suggests there will be no significant impact,claiming that the district has simply required the status quo.whether the association is correct is something the district should have considered in its public health analysis and that should have been contained in the record.to the contrary,the district obviously knows how to provide an appropriate assessment.when faced with other assessment requirements,like those found in section,subdivision a requires analysis and section requires retrofit control technology,it responded with a independent assessment of the identified factor.
the district provides no insight into how it balanced public health concerns against other interests during the process.the statute requires that the rule be assessed prior to adoption and submitted to a process,subd.e.as with any environmental regulation,a delicate balancing of competing policies and interests must occur.for example,the need for jobs,economic viability in the valley,a consistent food source,plentiful clean water,and many other interests must compete with each other when government seeks to regulate human activity to protect the environment.see san francisco ecology center city and county of san francisco d.court recognizes agency must balance competing interests key is whether agency mode of analysis is exposed.
in addition,the purpose of requiring that proposed regulations be submitted to a process is to ensure that every interest is represented,that the rule makers are well informed,and that an equally public is able to persuade and monitor government through the democratic process.in re et cal th,d,purpose of california environmental impact report is to give public and government agencies information needed to make informed decisions,protecting not only environment but also providing informed schoen department of forestry fire protection th,d purpose of requiring public review is to demonstrate to an apprehensive citizenry that agency has analyzed and considered ecological implications of its action public review permits accountability and informed salmon river concerned citizens robertson cir,informed decisionmaking and informed public participation are purpose of required process.it is for this reason that the interveners argument that for the association to be successful on appeal,it must prove that the rule would not have been adopted had the assessment been provided fails.the prejudice is not that the rule was adopted,but that it was adopted without informed and transparent decisionmaking.
for example,the district claims that rule will reduce voc by tons per year however,it makes no statement about how this will impact public health concerns.the report discusses how much the changes in feed and waste management will cost facilities and identifies a number of possible controls which have been rejected because of their high cost.if costs are going to justify mandating lesser controls instead of tougher ones,the public is entitled to know what the cost of this decision will be to public health.if the available science is insufficient to justify more expensive,tougher environmental controls,the public is entitled to know this as well.
we have no quarrel with the district legislatively granted authority to apply its expertise to these questions.san francisco fire fighters local city and county of san francisco,supra,cal th at,d,court gives deference to presumed expertise of agency within its scope of authority.however,although an agency is free to make this policy call,it can do so only when the balancing process is exposed to public view.schoen department of forestry fire protection,supra,th at,d,subd.e.neither the staff report nor the district representatives during the review process addressed rule impact on public health,despite the expressed concern for public health.will this rule make a significant measurable difference in air quality ozone levels and bring improvement to public health concerns related to poor air quality if not,are higher costs justified based on the cost of public health issues that are tied to air pollution these are questions that remain unanswered because the required assessment was never done.if the goal is healthier air,the district has not shown whether it has taken steps toward reaching that goal.
as with any environmental regulation,there are difficult choices to be made.on this record,it was impossible for the public or the district governing body to know how the acknowledged public health interest fared when balanced against the other competing interests.for this reason,the trial court erred when it denied the petition for writ of mandate.
iii.air contaminants besides ozone 
the association claims the district decision to address only voc emissions in rule violates the statutory requirement that the rule reduce emissions of air contaminants from facilities,subd.a.according to the association,the statutory reference to ozone nonattainment in section,subdivision b,is simply a trigger for application of the statute.air pollution control districts that are designated as federal nonattainment areas of ozone as of january,are those districts that must comply with this statute,but no other district.ibid.the association also contends that the remaining language of the statute suggests an intent to address all air contaminants,including ammonia emissions.the district,on the other hand,claims section applies only to ozone and ozone precursors.it argues that ammonia is not an ozone precursor and,as a result,regulation of ammonia is not mandated or permitted under the statute.
a complete reading of the statutory changes accomplished by sb,and the statement of legislative intent provided in sb,compel the conclusion that the legislative intent is to control agricultural emission sources as they impact state and federal ambient air quality standards,particularly those for which the state is classified as being in nonattainment.this means that section is,as the district contends,an statute.
the legislative preamble for sb begins,a gricultural operations necessary for growing crops or raising animals are a significant source of directly emitted particulates,and precursors of ozone and fine particulate matter.these emissions have a significant adverse effect on the ability of areas of the state,including,but not limited to,the san joaquin valley,to achieve state and federal ambient air quality standards.stats,ch,subd.a italics added.the very next statement refers to nitrogen oxides,particulate matter,and voc,which are expressly identified as contributing percent of the emissions in the san joaquin valley.id.at,subd.a.ozone is the prime ingredient of smog.epa greenbook,as of.these statements unquestionably link the ambient air quality standards to the pollutants identified,particulate matter,nitrogen oxides,and voc.the latter two are ozone precursors.along with particulate matter,these are the pollutants with which california struggles to reach attainment with national ambient air quality standards.ibid.
sb,consistent with its statement of intent,includes provisions addressing both ozone and particulate matter in sections,and.these sections address the two identified problems,ozone and particulate matter,depending on whether the district has achieved attainment of state and federal ambient air quality standards related to these pollutants.section,using language similar to section,applies to districts designated as serious federal nonattainment areas for the applicable ambient air quality standard for particulate matter.similar to section,the statute requires that the district adopt a rule regulating agricultural sources of particulate matter including large confined animal facilities using the retrofit control technology.section applies to districts designated as moderate federal nonattainment areas for applicable ambient air quality standard for particulate matter.it requires the adoption of control measures unless the district determines that agricultural practices do not significantly cause or contribute to a violation of state or federal standards.section parallels section in that it requires a rule regulating large confined animal facilities where the district is classified as severe or extreme nonattainment for ozone.section parallels section in that it requires a rule controlling large confined animal facilities unless the district finds that the facilities will not contribute to a violation of state or federal standards.
all four of these sections contain triggering language related to attainment or nonattainment of either ozone or particulate matter.the trigger is not capricious it relates directly to the level of attainment or nonattainment achieved by the district related to the triggering pollutant.the legislature has determined that if a district has attained federal and state ambient air quality standards for either particulate matter or ozone,it will be given greater deference in addressing the problem pollutant.if not,the statute mandates more stringent controls of sources for the identified pollutant.we appreciate the fact that the words chosen in these four sections are not identical,but they must be read in harmony with one another,fair employment housing com.cal d,mannheim superior court cal d.
we reach the same conclusion when we apply the statutory construction canons ejusdem generis and noscitur a socilis.under the rule of noscitur a socilis,the meaning of a word may be enlarged or restrained by reference to the intent of the whole clause in which it is used.people stout d.under the rule of ejusdem generis,the general term or category is restricted to those things that are similar to the more specific term or category enumerated.kraus trinity management services,cal th,d.the legislative use of the general term air contaminants is restricted by the more specific references to the ambient air quality standards for ozone in sections and and for particulate matter in sections and,subd.a.as the district argues,the express references in section,subdivision d b,to severe and extreme nonattainment areas can only be read as a reference to ozone,for only nonattainment to ozone ambient air quality standards is classified as severe or extreme.see.these classifications do not exist for other pollutants regulated by national ambient air quality standards.see epa greenbook,as of,epa air quality maps,attainment designations,as of.
the language used in section is not as broad as the association contends.although only the trigger language is limited specifically to ozone,the statutory language also generally refers to applicable emissions threshold s,emissions of air pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of a state or federal ambient air quality standard,all regulated air pollutants,and pollutants that contribute to the nonattainment of any ambient air quality standard this language consistently refers to pollutants regulated by ambient air quality standards,such as ozone and particulate matter.even if we were to read section as applying to all or any ambient air quality standard s,a term of art under the federal clean air act,ammonia is not a pollutant that is subject to a national ambient air quality standard.national standards have been set for only six pollutants particulate matter,sulfur dioxide,ozone,nitrogen dioxide,carbon monoxide,and lead.other hazardous air pollutants are not regulated through ambient air quality standards.wooley morss,clean air act handbook,supra.in any event,the district has determined that,when adopting its rule pursuant to section,the regulation of ammonia is not necessary for attainment of any air quality standard,and the association has not shown otherwise.
the primary role of the court when interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers to effectuate the purpose of the law.people carron th,d.we believe a fair reading of sb and section is consistent with the district interpretation that section addresses ozone and ozone precursors.there is nothing in the statute or the legislative history to suggest that the rule was intended to address all other air pollutants.
iv.arbitrary,capricious,and lack of evidentiary support 
the association last contention is that the district findings are arbitrary,capricious,and lack evidentiary support.we have a limited standard of review in mandamus actions and may reverse only where the action taken is so palpably unreasonable and arbitrary as to show an abuse of discretion as a matter of law.carrancho california air resources board th,d.we grant deference to the agency decision and may not substitute our judgment for that of the public agency granted authority over a particular area of subject matter expertise.see neighbors in support of appropriate land use county of tuolumne,supra,th at,d.
the association claims that the district relied upon unsupported reduction assumptions reduction estimates assumed a control efficiency for all liquid mitigation options based on the control efficiency of only phototropic lagoons relied on estimates for applying manure to croplands without evidentiary support and failed to analyze more expensive mitigation measures based on an assumption that facilities would choose the cheapest mitigation measure.we reject each of these contentions because the district applied its expertise to the scientific and policy considerations before it and reached a conclusion that was neither arbitrary nor capricious given the record evidence.further,we agree with the district that section does not require that the rule result in any specific numeric reduction of voc it simply mandates that the district adopt a rule to control voc emissions generated by large confined animal facilities based on the available science and,to the extent feasible,balance all statutory concerns.as a result,any numerical error in the assumptions used by the district fails to undermine the validity of its rule.
reduction assumptions 
the association claims that the district arbitrarily relied on default assumptions to reach its conclusion that rule will reduce voc emissions by pounds per year,a reduction in voc.according to the association,this assumption was arrived at by assigning a reduction for of the mitigation measures offered to facilities although there is no scientific data to support a conclusion that a reduction would occur upon implementation of any of these mitigation measures.the district acknowledged that many of its assumptions were based on studies and data showing that these practices would result in some reduction,but that there was insufficient science to know exactly what the reductions would be.the district assigned a conservative percentage to the anticipated reduction to be achieved and stated that,as science becomes available,a more exact percentage will be attached to each of these measures.as the district repeatedly stated in the process,this is a newly regulated industry and the supporting science is still developing.in the absence of more specific science,the district relied on the available studies and industry expertise to assign its numbers.it was not overly optimistic,assigning conservative numbers to estimated reductions.the association has not provided any science to refute the estimates assigned by the district.
double counting 
the association also claims that the district acted arbitrarily when it double counted reduction estimates.rule allows facilities to feed their animals according to national research council council guidelines as a chosen mitigation measure.it is estimated that this option will reduce valley voc emissions by percent.however,the association argues that this assumption is based on scientific studies in which the animals already were being fed according to the guidelines.as a result,the district estimated reduction of percent arbitrarily double counts the benefits of feeding according to the guidelines and is unlikely to bring an actual reduction in voc emissions.we disagree with the association position.a number of studies considered by the district suggested that dietary manipulations cause a reduction in animal voc emissions.according to one study,changing diet from dry corn to corn potentially reduces voc emissions by percent.other studies suggest reductions to a lesser extent,but there appears to be agreement that the type of feed an animal receives impacts its enteric emissions.the district chose the lowest reduction reported as a conservative estimate of what might be accomplished if a facility chose to feed according to council guidelines.although there is a conflict in the record regarding whether the studies being done involved animals fed according to council guidelines,any dispute must be resolved in favor of the district.gantt sentry insurance cal th,d,on appeal,we view record most strongly in favor of judgment,overruled on other grounds in green ralee engineering cal th,fn,d.
additionally,the district staff has determined that a significant number of facili
