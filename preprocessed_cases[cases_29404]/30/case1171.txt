the united states appeals the district court decision to abstain from deciding whether the nevada state engineer denial of the united states water permit applications is preempted by federal law.we hold that abstention was improper and remand for adjudication on the merits.
facts and district court proceedings 
congress passed the nuclear waste policy act nwpa or the act in in order to establish a schedule for the siting,construction,and operation of a national nuclear waste repository.although the act originally contemplated that the secretary of energy would recommend to the president three potential sites for site characterization congress amended it in to designate yucca mountain,nevada,as the sole site characterization location since that time,substantial amounts of money and effort have been expended to evaluate yucca mountain suitability and to prepare it for use as a repository in the event that the president and congress ultimately designate it for that purpose.
the yucca mountain site characterization activities require water.realizing that the current water permits expire in april and that obtaining new permits would take time,the department of energy doe filed five permit applications with nevada state engineer in.these five applications,which differ only in their points of diversion,attest that doe uses of the water will include,but are not limited to,road construction,facility construction,drilling,dust suppression,tunnel and pad construction,testing,culinary,domestic and other related site uses.
several parties protested the doe permit applications.in november,the state engineer conducted an administrative hearing to consider these protests.at that hearing,a doe witness testified that,if congress ultimately designated yucca mountain as a nuclear waste repository,the requested water would be used to construct and operate such a facility in addition to the purposes listed on the applications.
the epa witness testimony featured prominently in the state engineer decision to deny the doe permit applications.nevada law allows the state engineer to deny a permit application for only three reasons there is no unappropriated water at the proposed source the proposed use conflicts with existing rights or the proposed use threatens to prove detrimental to the public interest because the parties stipulated that sufficient water was available and no one claimed to have conflicting rights,the state engineer focused his inquiry on the third reason,the potential threat to the public interest citing the epa witness testimony,the state engineer concluded that the requested water was not for site characterization rather,he explained,t he applicant is requesting the use of water for actual use in the receiving,transfer,and processes for the storage of nuclear waste in nevada.
this determination greatly simplified the state engineer task.the purposes the state engineer ascribed to the doe permit applications directly conflicted with nevada law.the state engineer noted that,by enacting nevada revised statute,which makes it unlawful for any person or governmental entity to store radioactive waste in nevada,the nevada legislature has already determined that the use applied for threatens to prove detrimental to the public interest.significantly,the state engineer expressly disavowed any obligation to conduct his own public interest assessment he denied the doe applications,stating that since nrs prohibits the operation of a nuclear waste repository to be sited in nevada,the use of water in conjunction with said facility threatens to prove detrimental to the public interest.
on march,the united states filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the united states district court for the district of nevada.the complaint alleged that nevada revised statute,as applied by the state engineer,stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the purposes of the nwpa and is therefore preempted under the supremacy clause.the next day,the united states filed a protective notice of appeal from the state engineer decision in state court and then moved to stay that action pending resolution of the federal case.at the time of oral argument in this case,the state court had not ruled on the united states motion and no substantive briefing or other proceedings had occurred in nevada court.
in september,the federal district court dismissed the united states complaint the court held that,the united states pleadings notwithstanding,the court lacked jurisdiction under the court found that it had jurisdiction under but opted to abstain based on the pullman burford and colorado river doctrines the united states appeals the district court dismissal.
federal question jurisdiction 
in its complaint,the united states sought both declaratory and injunctive relief,including a declaration that,under the supremacy clause,the nwpa preempts nevada revised statute and the state engineer ruling that relied upon it an order enjoining the state engineer to evaluate the united states permit applications without relying on section and enjoining all defendants from unlawfully interfering with doe performance of its obligations under nwpa and a declaration that the state engineer ruling was arbitrary and capricious.these pleadings suffice to confer federal question jurisdiction the district court erred in arriving at the contrary conclusion.
as the supreme court explained in bell hood the plaintiff controls the complaint,and the complaint controls whether a suit arises under federal law for the purposes of where the complaint seek s recovery directly under the constitution or laws of the united states,the federal court must entertain the suit.
more recently,the supreme court explained that 
the district court has jurisdiction if the right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the constitution and laws of the united states are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another,unless the claim clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous 
the united states plainly sought recovery directly under the constitution or the laws of the united states.the gravamen of its complaint was that the state engineer ruling contravened the nwpa and thus violated the supremacy clause.
if the nwpa is interpreted to contemplate,either explicitly or implicitly,that only the federal government shall be entitled to determine whether siting a nuclear waste repository at yucca mountain is in the public interest,then the united states will prevail.if nwpa is not so interpreted,or if it is interpreted to allow state participation over and above the notice of disapproval process explicitly provided for in then the united states will lose.
despite the fact that interpretation of the nwpa will control the outcome of this suit,the district court was not convinced that the united states action arose under federal law.at defendants urging,the court held that the supremacy clause was not an essential element of the relief the united states seeks.the court arrived at this conclusion by delving into the merits of the action,and,in particular,into the substance of the state engineer decision.it held that the united states constitutional claim that the nwpa preempts nevada revised statute was improvidently asserted because the state engineer denial of the government permit applications was not predicated on a straightforward application of nevada state law.according to the court,the state engineer did not find that nrs prohibited the requested use of the water.rather,he found that the state statute was factual evidence of the expression of the public interest as determined by legislative action.based on this determination,the court held that the viability of the conclusions drawn from the passage of the statute,rather than the constitutionality of the statute itself,was what was really at issue this,in turn,led to the court conclusion that,because the united states action was nothing more than a request for judicial review of the state engineer ruling,it really arises under nevada water law and procedures.in essence,the court held that whether the nwpa preempted nevada revised statute was immaterial because the state engineer decision was not based on nevada revised statute in any constitutionally significant way.
in ultramar america dwelle we held that w hether the complaint states a claim arising under federal law must be ascertained by the legal construction of the plaintiff allegations,and not by the effect attributed to those allegations by the adverse party.here,the district court erred in allowing defendants to repackage the plaintiffs complaint to fit their interpretation of the evidence.it is the plaintiffs prerogative to make violation of a constitutional provision the basis of the suit.
the united states decision to challenge nevada revised statute as preempted leaves the court with only two options exercise jurisdiction or dismiss the suit because the federal claim is insubstantial dismissal for lack of jurisdiction because of the inadequacy of the federal claim is proper only when the claim is so insubstantial,implausible,foreclosed by prior decisions of this court,or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.the united states federal preemption claim is none of the above.
the state engineer candidly admitted that he was not required by statute to conduct the political and economic decisionmaking as to whether a repository should be located in nevada because the nevada legislature had announced,through nevada revised statute,that construction and operation of a nuclear waste repository would be detrimental to the state public interest,and he had neither the duty n or authority to independently review that decision.given this express invocation of the state statute and the state engineer disavowal of any independent inquiry,the united states assertion that the state engineer employed nevada revised statute to thwart federal objectives can not be described as insubstantial,implausible,or completely devoid of merit.
the united states claim that the nwpa preempts nevada revised statute can not be characterized as insubstantial either.the nwpa purpose was to establish the federal responsibility and definite federal policy for the disposal of radioactive waste and to define the relationship between the federal government and the state governments with respect to this problem these purposes lend strength and plausibility to the united states assertion that nevada law is preempted,particularly when coupled with.as noted above,prescribes a very limited mode of state participation not including preemptive legislative vetoes like the one at issue here.
our decision in state of nevada watkins further confirms the substantiality of the government preemption claim.in watkins,we held that because congress clearly directed the doe to continue site characterization activities at yucca mountain in the amendments to the nwpa,nevada attempted legislative veto of the secretary site characterization activities was preempted by the nwpa.we held that nevada revised statute stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of congress.
although the president and congress have not designated yucca mountain as a nuclear waste repository,nevada invocation of nevada revised statute to deny the united states permit applications may still stand as an obstacle to the act accomplishment for two reasons.first,congress may have preempted the field of nuclear waste disposal.the supreme court has not yet decided this issue but,as we noted in watkins,the nwpa clearly says that there will be a national nuclear waste repository and that the site of this repository will be recommended by the president and approved by congress second,even if congress has not occupied the field of nuclear waste disposal,state law is still to the extent it actually conflicts with federal law.nevada revised statute may conflict with federal law by purporting to make a decision on a state level that the nwpa contemplates will be made by the national government.the fact that the nwpa contemplates state participation through the notice of disapproval strengthens this argument thus,we hold that the united states preemption argument is substantial and that therefore supplies jurisdiction in this case.
in addition to jurisdiction pursuant to,the federal court has jurisdiction to hear this case under.that statute provides the district courts with original jurisdiction of all civil actions commenced by the united states.the nevada district court recognized that the statute granted it jurisdiction by virtue of the fact that the united states was the plaintiff in the case.therefore,regardless of the outcome of federal question jurisdiction,the district court has independent subject matter jurisdiction under.
abstention 
after concluding that,but not,conferred subject matter jurisdiction,the district court abstained from ruling on the merits based on pullman,burford,and colorado river the court further held that younger abstention did not apply 
because the federal courts obligation to adjudicate claims within their jurisdiction is virtually unflagging,abstention is permissible only in a few carefully defined situations with set requirements.we review de novo whether the facts of the instant case conform to these requirements if they do,we review the district court decision to abstain for an abuse of discretion 
pullman abstention 
pullman abstention is the oldest of the abstention doctrines and perhaps the easiest to understand.in pullman,railroads and their porters brought an equal protection challenge to a texas railroad commission regulation.the regulation required that all sleeper cars on texas trains had to be attended by pullman conductors rather than porters during an era when pullman conductors were white and porters were black in the supreme court estimation,this race relations controversy raised more than a substantial constitutional issue it touched upon a sensitive area of social policy upon which the federal courts ought not to enter unless no alternative to its adjudication is open.
in pullman,an alternative to federal adjudication was open under state law,the railroad commission statutory authority for issuing the controversial regulation was doubtful.in light of this state law vulnerability,the supreme court instructed the district court to restrain its authority.it observed that if the railroad commission had no authority to promulgate the regulation in the first place,there is no need to decide whether or not it is constitutional 
our test to determine whether pullman abstention is warranted in this case closely follows the supreme court case.pullman abstention is appropriate only when three concurrent criteria are satisfied the federal plaintiff complaint must require resolution of a sensitive question of federal constitutional law that question must be susceptible to being mooted or narrowed by a definitive ruling on state law issues and the possibly determinative state law must be unclear 
none of these criteria is satisfied here.although the location of a nuclear waste repository is plainly a sensitive social issue,it is not the issue in this case.the issue in this case is whether the nwpa preempts nevada revised statute.this preemption question is not a sensitive constitutional question like the one at issue in pullman.as we explained in knudsen nevada state dairy comm n a lthough preemption has its doctrinal base in the constitution,the question is largely one of determining the compat i bility of a state and a federal statutory scheme.no constitutional issues of substance are presented.because the compatibility of state and federal law is precisely the issue here,pullman abstention is not appropriate 
even if preemption were deemed to be a sensitive constitutional question,pullman abstention would still be inappropriate because there is no unclear state law issue that would moot the preemption question if resolved by a state court unlike the action in pullman,the state action at issue here does not rest on shaky statutory ground.there is no viable claim that the state engineer decision is invalid under nevada law on the contrary,it is clear that the state engineer decision not only comports with nevada law,but is in fact dictated by it.moreover,nevada law makes it abundantly clear that the state does not want a nuclear waste repository on its soil.far from suffering from a lack of clarity,nevada law has an overabundance of it.accordingly,pullman abstention is inappropriate here.
burford abstention 
burford abstention also arose from a case involving the texas railroad commission.in burford,an oil company filed suit in federal court to attack the validity of a permit that the commission had granted to burford.the permit allowed burford to drill four wells in an east texas oilfield the supreme court held that although the federal court had diversity jurisdiction over this thorny regulatory controversy,it properly declined to rule on the merits.after a long exegesis on the complexities of texas oil law,the court concluded that a s a practical matter,the federal courts can make small contribution to the well organized system of regulation and review which the texas statutes provide and that d elay,misunderstanding of local law,and needless federal conflict with the state policy are the inevitable product of this double system of review.
burford allows courts to decline to rule on an essentially local issue arising out of a complicated state regulatory scheme.its application requires 
first,that the state has chosen to concentrate suits challenging the actions of the agency involved in a particular court second,that federal issues could not be separated easily from complex state law issues with respect to which state courts might have special competence and third,that federal review might disrupt state efforts to establish a coherent policy 
none of these criteria is met in this case.there is no evidence,as there was in burford with respect to the texas courts,that nevada courts are working partners with the state engineer in the business of creating a regulatory system for the issuance of water permits.even if there were such a symbiotic relationship between the state courts and the state engineer,it would hardly be relevant because this case does not revolve around complex state law issues,such as who is entitled to how much water.rather,it revolves around whether state law conflicts with federal law,which is plainly not an issue with respect to which state courts might have special competence.this is a preemption case,and,as we stated in knudsen,burford abstention is particularly inappropriate when the plaintiff claim is based on preemption,because abstaining under burford would be an implicit ruling on the merits.
colorado river abstention 
although the district court invoked pullman and burford abstention as alternate grounds,it based its decision to abstain primarily on colorado river water conservation district united states the facts of colorado river,however,could not be more dissimilar from this case.
in colorado river,the government filed suit in federal district court against more than a thousand water users to establish its own water rights and those of its trustee tribes in one of colorado seven water divisions,division the government had previously pursued adjudication of reserved water rights in colorado state courts cognizant of the previous state adjudications and the mccarran amendment expressed preference for state,rather than federal,adjudication of complex water appropriations issues,one enterprising federal defendant joined the united states as a party to the state action adjudicating water rights in division and then proceeded to move the federal district court to dismiss in favor of the state proceedings the district court granted the motion to dismiss 
on review,the supreme court first order of business was to destroy the notion that,by consenting to state adjudication of the united states water rights,the mccarran amendment divested district courts of their jurisdiction over this type of claim the court held that the amendment did nothing to alter the jurisdiction conferred by the court next examined whether any of the traditional abstention doctrines justified the district court refusal to rule on the merits.after holding that they did not the court announced what has become known as the colorado river doctrine 
although this case falls within none of the abstention categories,there are principles unrelated to considerations of proper constitutional adjudication and regard for relations which govern in situations involving the contemporaneous exercise of concurrent jurisdictions these principles rest on considerations of wise judicial administration,giving regard to conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of the litigation 
in colorado river,the court chief concern was with avoiding piecemeal litigation 
turning to the present case,a number of factors clearly counsel against concurrent federal proceedings.the most important of these is the mccarran amendment itself.the clear federal policy evinced by that legislation is the avoidance of piecemeal adjudication of water rights in a river system.this policy is akin to that underlying the rule requiring that jurisdiction be yielded to the court first acquiring control of property,for the concern in such instances is with avoiding the generation of additional litigation through permitting inconsistent dispositions of property the consent to jurisdiction given by the mccarran amendment bespeaks a policy that recognizes the availability of comprehensive state systems for adjudication of water rights as the means for achieving these goals 
the district court concluded that the same concern for avoidance of piecemeal litigation counsels abstaining here.we disagree.colorado river does not say that every time it is possible for a state court to obviate the need for federal review by deciding factual issues in a particular way,the federal court should abstain.as the supreme court has observed,such a holding would make a mockery of the rule that only exceptional circumstances justify a federal court refusal to decide a case in deference to the states.rather,colorado river stands for the proposition that when congress has passed a law expressing a preference for unified state adjudication,courts should respect that preference.as the third circuit astutely observed,it is evident that the avoidance of piecemeal litigation factor is met,as it was in colorado river itself,only when there is evidence of a strong federal policy that all claims should be tried in the state courts.
there is no such expressed preference here.this is not a comprehensive stream adjudication case to which the mccarran amendment applies.the preemption issue that the united states seeks to have federally adjudicated bears scant resemblance to the complex water ownership issues involved in colorado river.in this case,allocation of limited water rights is not an issue because there is an adequate water supply to fulfill the government request.moreover,colorado river was a state law case that the government sought to have federally adjudicated.this case is the converse a federal law case that the state seeks to have adjudicated in state court.it would be surprising indeed if congress had passed a law expressing a preference for state adjudication of federal preemption issues.because congress has not done so,we hold that colorado river abstention has no applicability here.
younger abstention 
younger abstention is the one abstention doctrine the district court did not invoke to justify its decision to abstain in this case.the court reasoned that younger dealt with attempts to restrain state criminal prosecutions and that t hough there have been attempts to expand the effect of that decision,there is no need to attempt to do so here.accordingly,the court found that younger abstention was inapplicable.
we hold that younger is inapplicable here for an even more basic reason whether it is labeled comity,federalism,or some other term,the policy objective behind younger abstention is to avoid unnecessary conflict between state and federal governments.like the third,fifth,and eleventh circuits,we believe this policy lacks force where the united states is a litigant 
i n a case in which the united states seeks relief against a state or its agency,the state and federal governments are in direct conflict before they arrive at the federal courthouse.by the time the united states brings suit in federal court against a state,any attempt to avoid a conflict would be futile 
since it is impossible to avoid conflict when the united states is a party,the determination of forum depends upon choosing the proper forum for resolution of the conflict when asserting a superior federal interest against a state,the forum of choice for the federal government is the federal court 
conflict inheres in situations like that at issue here.not only is the united states acting as the plaintiff in the case,asserting its rights against those of the state,but the united states and nevada have been at loggerheads over the potential siting of a nuclear waste repository in that state since at least.in that year,nevada brought suit against the united states alleging that the nwpa amendments designating yucca mountain as the sole site to be characterized arose out of a political conspiracy between the bureau of land management,the doe and congress designed to isolate nevada and render it the unwilling host of the nuclear waste repository.we have held that the united states wrongfully denied nevada funds for studies related to yucca mountain suitability as a site and that nevada wrongfully attempted to block site characterization activities authorized by federal law history strongly suggests that the resolution of this controversy will involve substantial conflict and friction.abstaining now,based on younger,would thus be disingenuous.it makes little sense to invoke a doctrine that aims to avoid conflict in a case where such conflict has been raging for over ten years 
because conflict is inevitable in this case,the choice of forum must be influenced by the fact that the federal government is asserting its rights against a state and has a great interest in having the federal court conduct the preemption analysis.the dissent does not recognize the interest of the federal government in choosing the forum when it itself is a party.only one of the abstention cases cited by the dissent involved the united states as a party and the court only allowed for abstention in that case because the state tax appeal board own interpretation of state tax law could avoid the constitutional question there is no way to avoid the preemption issue in this case,so younger abstention should not apply,allowing the federal government access to its forum of choice.
conclusion 
as plaintiff,the united states controls its complaint.it alleged that the nwpa preempts nevada revised statute.because this federal preemption claim is not insubstantial,it confers federal question jurisdiction.in addition,the substantiality of the united states claim,coupled with the absence of the requirements for the various forms of abstention,makes abstaining improper.accordingly,we vacate the district court dismissal of this action and remand the case for adjudication on the merits.
vacated and remanded.
i respectfully dissent.the majority opinion concludes that younger abstention is inappropriate here because that doctrine aims to avoid conflict and such conflict has been raging for over ten years in this case.this broad characterization of younger overlooks the heart of the doctrine and that the circumstances here fall squarely under the concerns warranting such abstention.
while the majority correctly recognizes that the united states and the state of nevada have litigated issues involving the yucca mountain site for years,this does not render abstention under younger disingenuous.younger stresses respect for comity and federalism,not just generally,but specifically in the form of proper deference to a state interest in ongoing proceedings in its own forums,and deference to a state judiciary power to consider constitutional claims.united states ohio,cir citing ohio bureau of employment services hodory,d.accordingly,an ongoing controversy here between the federal and state governments does not render younger inapplicable where a federal court would disrupt the integrity of the state judicial system by intervening in.see middlesex county ethics committee garden state bar association,d.younger and its progeny espouse a strong federal policy against federal court interference with pending state judicial proceedings absent extraordinary circumstances.id.such an intrusion involves more than just a conflict between a state and the federal government as federal intervention in such proceedings would demonstrate a lack of respect for the state as sovereign.new orleans public service council of the city of new orleans,d.see also moore sims,d describing the basic concern addressed under younger as the threat to our federal system posed by displacement of state courts by those of the national government.
having concluded that younger policy concerns are implicated,the next question to address is whether younger applies here.younger principles apply to pending state administrative proceedings that are judicial in nature and involve important state interests.see fresh international agricultural labor relations board,cir middlesex,at.concluding that being judicial in nature a state bar disciplinary proceedings are of a character to warrant deference.the proceeding before the state engineer was undoubtably judicial in nature,complete with hearings,testimony,motions and a decision written like that of a judicial opinion.the agency proceeding investigates,declares and enforces liabilities as they stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist.nopsi,at.quoting prentis atlantic coast line.internal quotations and citations omitted.
under the test established by the supreme court,younger abstention is appropriate in favor of a state court proceeding if the state proceedings are ongoing the proceedings implicate important state interests and the state proceedings provide an adequate opportunity to raise federal questions.fresh international,at citing middlesex,at.accordingly,we should first determine whether the state proceedings had been initiated before any proceedings of substance on the merits have taken place in federal court.id.at.
the administrative hearing here was initiated,a decision rendered by the agency and an appeal to a state court filed prior to the initiation of the federal action.for younger purposes,the state process is treated as a unitary system and,as noted above,for a federal court to intervene in would demonstrate a lack of respect for the state as a sovereign.nopsi,at.for the same reason,a party may not seek federal review by terminating the state judicial process the state appeal to attack a trial court judgment in federal court.id.a necessary concomitant of younger is that a party must exhaust his state appellate remedies before seeking relief in federal court from the judgment of a state judicial tribunal.id.
our court has applied the same principle to processes started in an administrative agency viewing the litigation from agency through courts as a unitary process that should not be disrupted by premature federal intervention.see fresh international,concluding that state proceedings were ongoing for younger purposes where agency decision was issued and appeal was taken to the state appellate court as provided by state law accordingly,federal intervention seems no more permissible at the conclusion of the administrative stage than during it and,thus,the state proceedings here are ongoing as the united states sought relief from the state engineer decision by appeal to state court as required under nevada law.see.
next,we must consider whether there is a sufficiently important state interest that would be affected by the federal action so as to warrant younger abstention.id.at.the supreme court has cited with approval other courts decisions that have held important state interests to exist in a broad range of circumstances includ
