the center for biological diversity and the turtle island restoration network collectively,the center appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the national marine fisheries service fisheries service.this case presents the question of whether the issuance of fishing permits by the fisheries service pursuant to the high seas fishing compliance act compliance act,invokes the consultation requirements of the endangered species act esa.the center brought this action pursuant to the citizen suit provision of the esa alleging that the fisheries service was violating the consultation and take provisions of the esa through the issuance of fishing permits to longline fishing vessels in california.the center asserts that longline fishing results in harm to several endangered and protected species including several varieties of sea turtles and sea birds that become entangled in the longlines.the district court found that the issuance of permits under the compliance act does not invoke the consultation requirements of the esa because the fisheries service did not have sufficient discretion to condition permits for the benefit of a protected species.however,we conclude that the plain language of the compliance act does contain ample discretion to allow the conditioning of permits for the benefit of protected species,and we reverse the judgment of the district court.
procedural and factual background 
this case concerns united vessels that engage in longline fishing practices on the high seas of the pacific ocean and land their catch in california.longline fishing involves the use of a line that stretches several miles from a vessel and is anchored to appropriate depths.attached to the longline are many additional lines to which weights and baited hooks are fastened.a single longline may deploy several thousand hooks at one time.longline fishing vessels mainly target swordfish but also fish for other migratory species,such as varieties of tuna and shark.
until recently,most vessels that engaged in longline fishing were based in hawaii.in november,a district court in hawaii issued a preliminary injunction restricting longline fishing under the hawaii fishery management plan throughout much of the north pacific.center for marine conservation national marine fisheries service,civ.dae pursuant to the requirements of the esa,the fisheries service issued a biological opinion concluding that the operation of the hawaii fishery management plan would jeopardize the continued existence of the several protected species of sea turtles.subsequent revisions to the hawaii fisheries management plan eliminated the longline swordfish fishing industry.consequently,numerous boats from hawaii relocated to california ports 
on july,the center sent a letter to the secretary of commerce,giving a notice of intent to sue for violations by the fisheries service of sections and of the endangered species act the center first contended that the fisheries service is violating section of the esa by failing to initiate and complete consultations concerning the effects on threatened and endangered species of longline fishing by vessels,under permits issued by the fisheries service.the protected species designated included the leatherback loggerhead olive ridley and green sea turtles,as well as the albatross second,the center contended that the fisheries service failed to comply with section of the esa by granting permits to private parties that result in the take of threatened or endangered species.it contended that a governmental body under whose authority an actor exacts a taking of an endangered or threatened species can also be held responsible for the taking under section.
on september,the fisheries service regional administrator sent a letter in response,stating that under the fisheries service interpretation of the compliance act,the agency lacked discretion in issuing the fishing permits to impose conditions that further the conservation of protected species therefore,the consultation provisions of the esa were not implicated.further,the agency was developing a fishery management plan for high seas migratory species and that an esa consultation would be conducted during that administrative process to consider the impact of california longline fleet on threatened and endangered species.the fisheries service stated that it would investigate any take of protected species by fisherman engaged in the high seas fishery.the center then filed suit against the fisheries service asserting the three claims outlined in its notice letter.
the district court resolved the case on for summary judgment.the court rejected the center claims that the fisheries service was in violation of esa section by not consulting prior to the issuance of the permits.it held that the agency lacked discretion in issuing the permits to impose conditions furthering the conservation of protected species and that nothing in the compliance act provides the secretary with the authority to place such conditions on permits.center for biological diversity marine fisheries,wl,at,dist.lexis.the court concluded that because the agency had no discretion to condition permits for the benefit of listed species,it could not be held liable under esa section for any take of such species by individual fishing vessels.id.

in,the united nation food and agriculture organization addressed the problem of reflagging by negotiating the agreement to promote compliance with international conservation and management measures by fishing vessels on the high seas the agreement.the agreement required each party to take such measures as may be necessary to ensure that fishing vessels entitled to fly its flag do not engage in any activity that undermines the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures.
