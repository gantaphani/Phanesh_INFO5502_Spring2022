twenty years after the merced river,which lies in the heart of the yosemite national park,was designated a wild and scenic river,and seventeen years after the national park service nps was statutorily required to prepare a comprehensive management plan cmp for the merced wild and scenic river,the question whether nps has developed a valid cmp is again before us.in,we found certain deficiencies in an earlier remanded to the district court.see friends of yosemite valley norton,cir yosemite i.we clarified our opinion in friends of yosemite valley norton,cir yosemite ii.on july,the district court ruled on for summary judgment.it concluded that nps continues to violate certain provisions of the wild and scenic rivers act wsra,and the national environmental policy act nepa,as well as our instructions in yosemite i and yosemite ii.friends of yosemite valley scarlett,d.
appellants dirk kempthorne,in his official capacity as secretary of the interior the national park service jonathan jarvis,in his official capacity as nps regional director of the pacific west region and michael tollefson,in his official capacity as superintendent of yosemite national park collectively,nps argue that the district court erred in finding that the merced wild and scenic comprehensive management plan and supplemental environmental impact statement revised plan fails sufficiently to address user capacities as required by d of the wsra the revised plan is deficient because it is not a wholly plan and the supplemental environmental impact statement seis prepared for the revised plan violates nepa.
we have jurisdiction under and affirm the district court.we hold that the revised plan does not describe an actual level of visitor use that will not adversely impact the merced outstanding remarkable values orvs as required by yosemite i and the wsra,because the visitor experience and resource protection verp framework is reactionary and requires a response only after degradation has already occurred.moreover,the interim limits are based on current capacity limits and nps has not shown that such limits protect and enhance the merced orvs.and,as we made clear in yosemite ii,we again conclude that the wsra requires that the cmp be in the form of a single,comprehensive document,which addresses all the required elements,including both the kinds and amounts of use,and thus the revised plan is deficient because it addressed only the two components struck down in yosemite i and was not a single,plan.finally,we conclude that the seis violates nepa because the alternative assumed the existence of the very plan being proposed the three action are each primarily based on the verp unreasonably narrow and for the first five years,the interim limits proposed by the three alternatives are essentially identical.
a.the wild and scenic rivers act 
the wild and scenic rivers act wsra,was enacted in out of concern for the preservation of united states rivers,many of which had been subjected to overdevelopment and damming.see kenny seale,note,the effect of the wild and scenic rivers act on proposed bridge construction.envtl.in its opening section,the wsra explains that it is intended to codify congress policy determination 
that certain selected rivers of the nation which,with their immediate environments,possess outstandingly remarkable scenic,recreational,geologic,fish and wildlife,historic,cultural,or other similar values,shall be preserved in condition,and that they and their immediate environments shall be protected for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations.
as originally enacted,the wsra named specific rivers or segments of rivers for inclusion in the wild and scenic river system wsrs.see id.a a.the wsra also sets forth a procedure for future designations to the wsrs.see id.a.wsrs components are administered by the secretary of the interior including any component administered by the secretary of the interior through nps or the fish and wildlife service or,if the river falls within a national forest,the secretary of agriculture.see id.c d.
the wsra framework designates rivers based on specific outstandingly remarkable values orvs which both justify the initial designation of a river as a wsrs component,see id,and provide the benchmark for evaluating a proposed project affecting a designated river.while,under the wsra,protecting and enhancing the designated orvs is paramount,this goal may be compatible with other uses 
e ach component of the wsrs shall be administered in such manner as to protect and enhance those orvs that caused it to be included in the wsrs without,insofar as is consistent therewith,limiting other uses that do not substantially interfere with public use and enjoyment of these values,with primary emphasis given to protecting its esthetic,scenic,historic,archeologic,and scientific features.
id.a.the wsra further recognizes that m anagement plans for any such component may establish varying degrees of intensity for its protection and development,based on the special attributes of the area.id.to the extent that the wsra conflicts with the wilderness act,id,or statutes administering the national park system and national wildlife system,the wsra instructs that the more restrictive provisions shall apply.id.b c.the wsra requires the administering agency to take such action respecting management policies,regulations,contracts,and plans as may be necessary to protect such rivers in accordance with the wsra,and cooperate with the environmental protection agency and with the appropriate state water pollution control agencies for the purpose of eliminating or diminishing the pollution of waters of the river.id.a,c.
once a river is designated as part of the wsrs,the following statutory timetable applies within one year,the administering agency is required to establish detailed boundaries for the river and classify it generally or by its various segments as wild,scenic,or recreational,see id.b b and within three full fiscal years,the administering agency must prepare a comprehensive management plan cmp to provide for the protection of the river values,id.d.the cmp shall address resource protection,development of lands and facilities,user capacities,and other management practices necessary or desirable to achieve the wsra purposes,id.emphasis added.
b.the secretaries joint guidelines 
because of inconsistencies caused by the wsra provision for administration by agencies under both the department of agriculture and the department of the interior,the president asked both secretaries to jointly issue guidelines interpreting the wsra.see national wild and scenic rivers system final revised guidelines for eligibility,classification and management of river areas,the secretarial guidelines.the secretarial guidelines interpret the management principles of a as stating a nondegradation and enhancement policy for all designated river areas,regardless of classification.id.at.the secretarial guidelines further explain that the wsra requires the administering agency to manage each component so as to protect and enhance its orvs,while providing for public recreation and resource uses which do not adversely impact or degrade those values.id.at.the secretarial guidelines also envision the use of varying strategies and implementations,depending on the segment classification and ownership.id.at.
notably,the secretarial guidelines discuss carrying capacity,a term that does not appear in the wsra itself and is defined as t he quantity of recreation use which an area can sustain without adverse impact on the orvs and character of the river area,the quality of recreation experience,and public health and safety.id.at.the secretarial guidelines contemplate that 
s tudies will be made during preparation of the management plan and periodically thereafter to determine the quantity and mixture of recreation and other public use which can be permitted without adverse impact on the resource values of the river area.management of the river area can then be planned accordingly.
id.at emphasis added.the secretarial guidelines also require that a component management plan state 
the kinds and amounts of public use which the river area can sustain without impact to the values for which it was designated,and specific management measures which will be used to implement the management objectives for each of the various river segments and protect esthetic,scenic,historic,archeologic and scientific features.
id.at emphasis added.
wsra designation of the merced 
in,congress designated segments of the merced river as wsrs components,including sections flowing through the very popular yosemite national park,and its administrative site,el portal.see,stat,codified at a a.in designating the merced as wild and scenic,congress instructed that the establishment of wsra boundaries for and classification of those parts of the merced falling within yosemite or el portal would be accomplished through amendment of the general management plan gmp for yosemite national park,and that such amendment shall assure that no development or use of park lands shall be undertaken that is inconsistent with the designation of such river segments.a a.
despite congress directive,nps failed to issue the required cmp for the merced in a timely manner,and was ordered to do so in earlier litigation.see sierra club babbitt,d,ordering nps to prepare and adopt a valid cmp pursuant to d in regard to the merced river as designated under the wsra no later than twelve months after the entry of this decision.the timetable was based on nps representation that it could complete a cmp in that amount of time.after obtaining a extension,nps finally issued a cmp in the cmp,well past the statutory deadline.
yosemite i and ii 
we have twice previously addressed the issues presented by this action.in,we affirmed in part the eastern district of california findings of specific deficiencies in the cmp,and remanded for a correction of those deficiencies.yosemite i.we clarified our opinion in,and remanded for reconsideration of the motion for injunctive relief filed by friends of yosemite valley and mariposans for environmentally responsible growth collectively,friends in light of the clarification.yosemite ii.
looking to the wsra requirement that the administering agency prepare a cmp that shall address user capacities within three full fiscal years of a wsrs segment designation,d,we concluded,in yosemite i,that nps method of addressing user capacities was problematic.at.the cmp primary method of addressing user capacities was through a framework called visitor experience and resource protection verp.id.at.t he verp framework focuses on the prescription and maintenance of selected desired conditions.id.to maintain these desired conditions,the verp framework provides for selecting and monitoring indicators and standards that reflect these desired conditions,and taking management action when the desired conditions are not being realized.id.internal citations omitted.
analyzing the plain meaning of the terms within the phrase address user capacities as well the secretarial guidelines,we interpreted the requirement to address user capacities to mean that the cmp must include specific measurable limits on use.id.at emphasis added.t he plain meaning of the phrase address user capacities,is simply that the cmp must deal with or discuss the maximum number of people that can be received at a wsrs.id.at emphasis added.however,the plain meaning does not mandate one particular approach to visitor capacity.id.
furthermore,the secretarial guidelines interpret ed the wsra to require the preparation of river m anagement plans that state the kinds and amounts of public use which the river area can sustain without impact to the orvs,and to mandate ongoing studies to determine the quantity and mixture of recreation and other public use which can be permitted without adverse impact on the resource values of the river area.id.at quoting.the secretarial guidelines,however,do not require one particular method of limiting user capacity.id.they do not mandate,for example,a numerical cap on visitors.id.t he secretarial guidelines do not specify that this obligation can be satisfied only by capping the number of visitors.
we concluded that the verp framework,as set out in the cmp,failed sufficiently to address user capacities because it did not adopt quantitative measures sufficient to ensure its effectiveness as a current measure of user capacities.id.rather than establish specific indicators or standards to implement the verp,the cmp provided examples of indicators and standards.id.at.by only providing illustrative standards,the cmp fail ed to yield any actual measure of user capacities,whether by setting limits on the specific number of visitors,by monitoring and maintaining environmental and experiential criteria under the verp framework,or through some other method.id.this fail ure to provide any concrete measure of use,we found,was inconsistent with our interpretation of the phrase address user capacities.id.at.
we instructed that o n remand,the nps shall adopt specific limits on user capacity consistent with both the wsra and the instruction of the secretarial guidelines that such limits describe an actual level of visitor use that will not adversely impact the merced orvs.id.emphasis added.given that nps was supposed to have completed a cmp for the merced river some twelve years ago,we indicated that we would expect temporary measures to be implemented as soon as practicable in order to avoid environmental degradation pending the completion of the task.id.at.in particular,we recognized that i f the nps is correct in projecting that it will need five years fully to implement the verp,it may be able to comply with the user capacity mandate in the interim by implementing preliminary or temporary limits of some kind.id.at.
as elucidated in yosemite ii,in yosemite i,we held that the entire merced wild and scenic river cmp is invalid due to two deficiencies a failure to adequately address user capacities and the improper drawing of the merced river boundaries at el portal.yosemite ii,at.because the district court had,on remand,misconstrued our holding in yosemite i,we explained that w hile we remanded to the district court to enter an appropriate order requiring the nps to remedy these deficiencies in the cmp in a timely manner,we did not otherwise uphold the cmp.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted emphasis added.we concluded that,p ursuant to our original opinion in yosemite i,the nps must prepare a new or revised cmp that adequately addresses user capacities and properly draws the river boundaries at el portal.id.in yosemite ii,we also grant ed a temporary stay of proceedings and an injunction prohibiting nps from implementing any and all projects developed in reliance upon the invalid cmp pending the district court consideration of the matter.id.
district court decisions on remand 
on remand,on july,the district court ordered nps to develop a new or revised cmp and to comply with nepa by issuing a supplemental eis.the district court also enjoined certain projects pending completion of the new or revised cmp.after a series of public scoping meetings,a draft of a revised cmp and seis was released for public review in january.after approximately three months of public review,in june,nps issued its revised plan,a publication entitled,merced wild and scenic comprehensive management plan and supplemental environmental impact statement revised plan.the record of decision rod for the revised cmp was signed on july,adopting alternative from the seis.the revised plan states,as follows 
t his revised plan will amend the existing merced river plan to address the two deficiencies identified by the court this revised merced river plan does not replace the merced river plan adopted in,but corrects the deficiencies in its management elements.
on november,friends filed their complaint with the eastern district of california,alleging five causes of actions against nps.friends challenged the revised plan under wsra,nepa,the administrative procedure act apa,and our prior orders.the district court,on july,granted in part and denied in part the parties for summary judgment.friends of yosemite valley scarlett,d.
the district court held that nps failed to comply with our order that o n remand,the nps shall adopt specific limits on user capacity that describe an actual level of visitor use that will not adversely impact the merced orvs.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.according to the district court,some sixteen years after nps was required to create a cmp for the merced river,it decide d that for approximately five years,it would like to experiment with implementing the verp program as its primary means of addressing user capacity.id.nps also failed to commit to the use of the verp program for the long run,stating that whether verp will become permanent after five years is not known at this time.id.internal quotation marks omitted.rather,w hat nps has created in the verp portion of the user capacity program in the revised plan is a tentative plan of uncertain duration which adopts temporary limits,which will apply for an unknown length of time.id.at.as stated by the district court,the agency has left itself the option of deciding in five years to abandon its currently proposed method and proceed in an entirely different,as yet unidentified,manner.under this scenario,there is no indication when,if ever,nps will finally adopt a permanent primary method for addressing user capacity id.at.furthermore,despite providing for interim limits while nps conducts field testing of the verp indicators and standards,nps interim limits,which are set to apply for a period of years,are simply the current physical capacity of the facilities in yosemite valley.id.the court also criticized verp for being reactive in that it calls for management action only after environmental degradation has already occurred.id.at.
the district court further found that the revised plan was deficient because nps has violated the wsra by failing to adopt a single,cmp for the merced river.id.at.it found that language from the ninth circuit indicates an intention that a single document be produced,covering everything.id.the court stated that although nps is free to us e parts,even very large parts,of the cmp in developing a whole new or revised plan,it has proceeded from the incorrect assumption that the cmp still exists.id.at.
the district court also held that the seis prepared in conjunction with the revised plan did not comply with the nepa,because it provided no true alternative and because it lacked the required reasonable range of alternatives.friends of yosemite valley,d at see d requiring the alternative of no action id.a requiring that the eis r igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives,and for alternatives which were eliminated from detailed study,briefly discuss the reasons for their having been eliminated.according to the district court,the seis improperly relied on elements of the cmp to describe the environmental baseline.friends of yosemite valley,d at.the range of action alternatives was insufficient because each alternative is based on verp,which the court had found inadequate to constitute the primary feature of a user capacity program as required by wsra.id.at.
next,on november,the district court issued an opinion and order enjoining significant aspects of nine projects in the merced river corridor until nps develops a valid cmp.friends of yosemite valley kempthorne,d.nps appealed the district court november decision on december.a stay pending the appeal of its injunction was granted on march,with respect to two of these projects.friends of yosemite valley kempthorne,no.cv f awi dlb,wl.on march,the district court issued an order approving the parties stipulation regarding a completion date for a new cmp and or before september.the district court also entered final judgment,which nps appealed on april.nps appeals from the district court decisions are consolidated in the present case.

addressing user 
the revised plan,pursuant to the rod,adopts verp as its primary method of addressing user capacity.nps argues that the district court erred in finding that the revised plan did not remedy the deficiency we found in the user capacity component of the cmp.according to nps,sufficiently specific measurable limits on use can be found in the wilderness trailhead quota system the superintendent compendium limits the new verp indicators and standards and the interim limits imposed by the user capacity management program.
wilderness trailhead quota system and superintendent compendium 
the district court properly concluded that neither the wilderness trailhead quota system nor the superintendent compendium are persuasive as to whether the revised plan adequately addresses user capacities.friends of yosemite,d at.although they are steps in the right direction,both these methods for addressing user capacity predate the cmp and were relied upon by nps in support of that plan to no avail.id.
the district court correctly found that verp does not properly address user capacities because,by not requiring a response to environmental degradation until after it already occurs,it is reactive and thereby violates a and the secretarial guidelines.at,interpreting the management principles of a.
nps argues that the district court based its holding on a legally incorrect view that the wsra does not allow reliance on a program that monitors particular indicators,such as verp,because such a program is,by definition,reactive.according to nps,that ruling is contrary to our holding in yosemite i,where we held that nps could address user capacities with a verp framework that monitors and maintains environmental and experiential criteria.see yosemite i,at.nps further contends that the district court ruling incorrectly requires nps to set specific limits on the number of visitors,even though we stated in yosemite i that a numerical cap is not required.nps misreads the district court analysis,and its argument is therefore flawed.the reason the district court found that the revised verp was reactionary was not because a framework that monitors and maintains is inherently reactive and thus can never be proactive.rather,the revised verp at issue was found to be reactionary,and thus responsive to already occurring degradation,because it does not describe an actual level of visitor use that will not adversely impact the merced orvs.see friends of yosemite,d at quoting yosemite i,at.
nps next argues the district court incorrectly stated that the verp as set out in the revised plan is not oriented towards preventing degradation.it contends that the indicators and standards established in verp trigger action prior to degradation of orvs.in support,nps asserts that the indicators and standards are set conservatively so that,although management may not act before the indicators and standards are exceeded,action will be taken before there is degradation the text of the revised plan provides that i ndicators,which are measurable variables,are determined first standards quantifiably define the acceptable conditions,measured values for each indicator which are set at a level that will protect and enhance the merced river orvs emphasis added nps does not choose a particular indicator unless that indicator is a ble to provide an early warning for resource degradation management action may occur before a standard is exceeded because t he process of monitoring and its relationship to management actions can be likened to a traffic signal a condition occurs when monitoring shows that conditions are approaching the standard.this early warning sign may call for implementing proactive management actions to protect and enhance the orvs and the district court conclusion is at odds with this panel decision in yosemite 
that an indicator may be able to provide an early warning,does not mean that it does in practice.a standard must be chosen that does in fact trigger management action before degradation occurs.also,that an early warning sign may call for the implementation of proactive management does not provide much assurance that such implementation will occur.despite nps statements to the contrary,in yosemite i,we did not foreclose a later finding by the district court that the verp system remains problematic even if verp does not rely on examples instead of actual indicators and standards.currently,verp requires management action only when degradation has already occurred,and it is therefore legally deficient 
interim limits 
the district court properly concluded that the interim limits do not describe an actual level of visitor use that will not adversely impact the merced orvs.friends of yosemite,d at.the revised plan adopted interim limits for a period to restrict the kinds and amounts of visitor use in the merced river corridor while the verp program is being tested.these interim limits include caps on overnight lodging,campsites,parking,bus parking spaces and employee housing units.buses are limited to per day in the yosemite valley segment,which according to nps,is consistent with the number of buses that entered the yosemite valley at peak periods such as in the.parking spaces,bus parking spaces,and overnight lodging facilities are set at existing levels.the number of campsites in yosemite valley would be allowed to increase slightly during the interim period by sites for an interim limit of sites,a level which,as nps states,falls below both the number of campsites in the yosemite valley prior to the flood and when the merced river was designated wild and scenic in.some of the limits,while at existing capacity limits,are below facility levels that existed in,before the merced river was designated under the wsra.
according to nps,its choice of interim limits is not arbitrary or capricious.nps argues that i f the status of the merced river orvs was sufficient for eligibility in when yosemite valley had more parking spaces,rooms and campsites than at present,it would be improper to simply assume that the lower facility levels permitted under the revised plan will degrade the orvs.furthermore,nps argues that its decision is consistent with a of the wsra because it does not limit other uses that do not substantially interfere with public use and enjoyment of the merced orvs.a.
there is no authority for a presumption that holding facility levels to those in existence in,when the merced was designated under the wsra,is protective of orvs or satisfies the user capacity component of the required cmp.see friends of yosemite,d at.nps has a responsibility under the protect and enhance requirement of the wsra to address both past and ongoing degradation.setting interim limits to current capacity limits does not address the problem of past degradation moreover,nowhere has nps shown how its interim limits place primary emphasis on the protection of the merced river esthetic,scenic,historic,archeologic,and scientific features as required by a.and although the wsra does not preclude basing user capacity limits on current capacity limits,nps decision to base many of its interim limits on current capacity limits was not founded on a reasoned evaluation of the relevant factors.see yosemite i,at internal quotation marks omitted.nor has nps articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.see id 
requirement of a single,plan 
the district court did not err by faulting nps for assuming that the cmp still existed and finding that the revised plan was deficient because,focusing only on the elements that were explicitly struck down in yosemite i,it was not a single,plan.see friends of yosemite,d at.the wsra requires a single,comprehensive plan that collectively addresses all the elements of the the kinds and amounts of permitted an integrated manner.as friends argue,nps has simply tacked onto the cmp ten indicators and standards for the purposes of limiting the amounts of use,but has failed simultaneously to address the appropriate kinds of use.moreover,before the district court,nps,in a futile effort to correct this problem,attempted to rely on a december presentation plan which,according to nps,combines all elements from the cmp and the revised plan that comprise the management plan for the merced as administered by nps.the district court properly rejected any such reliance because it was created after the approval of the revised plan,was not presented for public review as the revised plan and contradicted the revised plan which states that it is the final revised cmp.see id.at.
in yosemite ii,we clarified that in yosemite i,we held the entire merced wild and scenic river cmp invalid and that we did not otherwise uphold the cmp.yosemite ii,at internal quotation marks omitted.we thus concluded that,nps must prepare a new or revised cmp.id.contrary to nps assertion,in yosemite ii,we indicated that a single document covering all required elements must be produced.this does not mean that nps is required to start from scratch with respect to each element of the cmp that was not explicitly found deficient or that it can not incorporate parts of the cmp in preparing its new or revised plan.but,it is required to prepare a single plan,not issue supplemental volumes that simply thousands of pages of material from the cmp.
the secretarial guidelines mandate such an interpretation of the wsra,stating that the wsra requires that a river comprehensive management plan state both the kinds and amounts of public use which the river area can sustain without impact to the values for which it was designated.at.nps can not,thus,address the amounts of use without also addressing the kinds of use.the two are inseparable.further support comes from the plain meaning of comprehensive,which,according to the oxford english dictionary,is having the attribute of comprising or including much of large content or scope.
nps cites to federal power commission idaho power,for the proposition that the district court holding conflicts with principles of judicial review.in idaho power,the supreme court stated that the function of the reviewing court ends when an error of law is laid bare.at that point the matter once more goes to the agency for reconsideration.id.there,the
