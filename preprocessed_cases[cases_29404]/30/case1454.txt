the wild horses and burros act,directs the secretary of the interior to protect and manage wild horses and burros as components of the public lands.id.a.the fund for animals and others challenge the bureau of land management strategy for achieving this statutory goal.
the bureau of land management blm or the bureau manage s the public lands under principles of multiple use and sustained yield.a.since,this responsibility has included oversight and management of wild horses and burros on public lands.congress passed the wild horses and burros act,stat.the act or the wild horses and burros act,to protect those animals from capture,branding,harassment,or death.see also kleppe new mexico,d citing legislative history.the act grants the secretary of the interior jurisdiction over all wild horses and burros on federal lands and directs the secretary to manage wild horses and burros in a manner that is designed to achieve and maintain a thriving natural ecological balance on the public lands.a.the bureau as the secretary delegate carries out this function in localized herd management areas hmas,c,established in accordance with broader land use plans.id.there are currently herd management areas in ten western states.responsibility for a particular herd management area rests with the bureau local field and state offices.
in each herd management area,the bureau determines an appropriate management level aml for the wild horse and burro populations.b.the bureau describes the appropriate management level as the median number of adult wild horses or burros determined through blm planning process to be consistent with the objective of achieving and maintaining a thriving ecological balance and relationship in a particular herd area.local bureau offices have significant discretion to determine their own methods of computing aml for the herds they manage.some treat it as the midpoint of a sustainable range,while others treat it as a single number.
when the bureau determines that an overpopulation exists on a given area of the public lands and that action is necessary to remove excess animals,the wild horses and burros act requires it immediately to remove excess animals from the range so as to achieve appropriate management levels.b before taking such action,the bureau prepares a detailed gather plan,including an environmental assessment in compliance with the national environmental policy act.gather decisions are subject to administrative appeal.id.pt.
in early,the bureau recognized that a population explosion among wild horses and burros had rendered it incapable of achieving its statutory goals at funding levels.the nationwide wild horse and burro population was at least animals or approximately animals above nationwide aml.in the face of mounting distrust and discontent with the blm management of the wild horse and burro program,the bureau developed a strategy to achieve nationwide aml and justify increased funding for the program.after soliciting advice from state bureau offices about their specific needs and reviewing several options,the national office settled on a plan that would,if implemented,achieve nationwide aml in five years at a cost of an additional million per fiscal year from through.
this plan was presented to congress in february as a presidential budget initiative.entitled the restoration of threatened watersheds initiative and subtitled living legends in balance with the land a strategy to achieve healthy rangelands and viable herds,the document informed congress that o ne of the major threats to watershed health is an overabundance of wild horses and burros on rangelands and that at current funding capability and adoption demand the populations of these animals will increase at a rate faster than our ability to remove excess animals.the bureau explained that the additional appropriation would enable the field offices to meet removal targets based on an initial gather schedule.this would result in a large number of removals in the early years of implementation and a gradual decline to maintenance levels.the plan also contemplated eliminating age restrictions on removals enhanced marketing of animals and adoption events,and an expanded program of training and gelding for animals.
congress approved the needed funding for the program and the various field offices began implementing individual gathers on a basis.the field offices used a common population model to determine how many animals to remove based on an initial gather schedule.this number was just a starting point.the final determinations concerning the number of animals to remove and the timing of such removals was left to the field offices to determine based on the particular characteristics of each herd and geography.
in september,the fund for animals,the animal legal defense fund,and others collectively the fund for animals or the fund filed suit in the district court to enjoin the bureau from continuing to implement the strategy.the complaint alleged that the bureau violated the national environmental policy act nepa,by implementing the strategy without first preparing an environmental impact statement,am.compl,and that the bureau violated the wild horses and burros act by adopting a strategy that would reduce herd populations to below their appropriate management levels.id.the complaint also objected to seven specific gathers of wild horses and burros carried out after congress appropriated the funds.id.
in february,while the complaint was pending,an assistant director of the bureau issued an instruction memorandum to the field offices to communicate guidance and policy regarding how the bureau would achieve aml in herd management areas by.the memorandum included a chart containing an estimate for each state of the number of horses to be removed stated that horses five years and younger would be removed first,those ten years and older next,followed by horses six to nine years of age and outlined the data field offices must collect on each herd in order to prepare population management plans,which will detail the population objectives for the herd s and the rationale for those objectives.the instruction memorandum stated that it would be effective for all gathers beginning upon receipt and will expire on september.the bureau manual specifies that instruction memoranda are of a,temporary nature and are in effect for a short period of time.the february memorandum explained that the bureau policy regarding the removal of wild horses is reviewed and revised each year in an effort to balance the need to achieve aml,minimize the time excess animals are held in blm facilities awaiting adoption and enhance our ability to place those animals into private maintenance and care.
after the instruction memorandum issued,the fund filed a supplemental complaint alleging that before the memorandum became effective the bureau was bound to issue an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment.the supplemental complaint sought a preliminary and permanent injunction ordering the bureau not to take any steps to implement the memorandum and directing it to prepare an environmental impact statement pursuant to nepa.
insofar as the action dealt with the strategy,the district court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,finding that the strategy was not a reviewable final agency action.fund for animals bureau of land,d.as to the specific removal actions,the district court found that the fund challenges were moot.id.at.
the fund takes exception to several of the bureau policies for carrying out its wild horse and burro management duties.the federal courts are not authorized to review agency policy choices in the abstract.in the absence of a specific statutory review the wild horses and burros act nor nepa contains administrative procedure act provides a generic cause of action to a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action.emphasis added.review under the apa is further limited to final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.id.emphasis added.whether there has been agency action or final agency action within the meaning of the apa are threshold questions if these requirements are not met,the action is not reviewable see ass of home builders norton,drg funding sec y of housing urban.
the fund cites two documents that it claims are final agency action.one of these documents is the instruction memorandum issued by the bureau assistant director for renewable resources and planning.this memorandum communicate s guidance and policy on how blm will achieve aml on all hma sic by.by its terms,the,temporary document according to the bureau on september,in its supplemental complaint,the fund claims only that the memo was issued in violation of nepa.because the memo has expired,this claim is moot.see in re bluewater network,petitioners do not here challenge the temporary regulations,either for what they did or did not do those regulations have expired.whatever issues could have been raised regarding their legality are moot.see also worth jackson.the government concession that the general national planning approach set forth in the february memorandum continues to serve as guidance to the field for the conduct of specific gather and removal decisions,br.of appellees,can not support the weight the fund would place on it the general national planning approach is the same approach put forward in the budget document,which we discuss next.
this leaves the fund with the fy presidential budget initiative.on its surface,the document was a budget request to congress.the record confirms that it was intended as such.in the face of mounting pressure to fix systemic problems in the wild horse and burro program,the bureau determined that it could do so only with additional funding.the budget initiative explains why the current funding amount is insufficient for the bureau to achieve appropriate management levels.to justify its request for an additional per year over current funding levels sustained through,the budget initiative lays out the key elements of the bureau strategy a four year gather schedule for all hmas,removal of animals without age restrictions,a removal target of animals in the first year and then a significant,enhanced marketing of animals and adoption events,training and gelding animals,and pasturing for unadoptable animals.congress approved this request by appropriating the needed funds in and see dep t of the interior and related agencies appropriations act of,tit.i,stat,dep t of the interior and related agencies appropriations act of,tit.i,stat.
the bureau approved budget request is not agency action within the meaning of,much less final agency action within the meaning of.the apa defines an agency action as the whole or a part of an agency rule,order,license,sanction,relief,or the equivalent or denial thereof.this list is expansive.it is meant to cover comprehensively every manner in which an agency may exercise its power.whitman am.trucking ass ns,d.but we have long recognized that the term agency action is not so as to authorize us to exercise judicial review over everything done by an administrative agency.indep.equip.dealers ass epa,internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.much of what an agency does is in anticipation of agency action.agencies prepare proposals,conduct studies,meet with members of congress and interested groups,and engage in a wide variety of activities that comprise the common business of managing government programs.id.
budget requests seek funding for an agency to exercise its power.once congress appropriates the funds,the agency must determine how to use the money consistent with the appropriation.the agency proposal to congress,developed to secure the funds,may serve as a useful planning document,but it is not a rule that is,an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement,interpret,or prescribe law or policy.it does not implement,interpret,or prescribe any law or policy.see indep.equip.dealers ass n,at see also indus.safety equip.ass epa.and it is not an order,or a license,or a sanction,or relief.the most that can be said is that it outlines the goals and methods of an administrative program.the wild horses and burros program,according to the presidential budget initiative,proposed rounding up animals in its first year,trying to market those animals through adoption events,and so on.judicial review of such budget initiatives would wreak havoc with the normal operations of agencies and the executive branch.agencies propose all kinds of programs in the budget process,and they are not the only actors in that process.the president decides which agency budget requests to forward to congress.see judicial watch dep t of energy.this is doubtless why the bureau proposal was called a presidential budget initiative.it is impossible to believe that the apa opened this process to judicial scrutiny as a reviewable agency action.
to rule otherwise would be contrary to lujan national wildlife federation,d.courts may intervene in the administration of the laws only when,and to the extent that,a specific final agency action has an actual or immediately threatened effect.at.the individual roundups might qualify the bureau budget proposal does not.when the bureau sought funding from congress,it did not harm or affect the plaintiffs in this case and they were not harmed or affected when congress appropriated the million.this is very unlike a substantive rule that,as a practical matter,requires the parties affected to adjust their conduct as soon as the rule is issued.the budget request is a broad programmatic statement that lujan keeps from our review.id.at.
unlike circumscribed,discrete agency actions that are the ordinary subjects of judicial review,norton utah wilderness alliance,d,the bureau strategy represents the sum of many individual actions,including some yet to be taken.lujan,at.see also cobell norton,indep.petroleum ass of am.babbitt.the fund identifies four elements of the budget initiative that it claims require specific agency conduct removing animals to achieve aml in all hmas,implementing a gather schedule,removing animals regardless of age,and reducing populations to forty percent below aml.even if the bureau budget request were somehow considered to be a bureau disputes that these elements of the strategy are binding upon the field offices actually making gather must still be some concrete action applying the regulation to the claimant situation in a fashion that harms or threatens to harm him.lujan,at.as we have said,the cited elements had no such consequence 
the budget proposal represents the bureau latest plan to comply with its broad statutory mandate.the supreme court addressed an analogous situation in norton southern utah wilderness alliance,at.the court reiterated the point that before there may be judicial review there must be a discrete agency action.id.at.in a portion of the opinion that almost seems to anticipate this case,the court hypothesized a plaintiff who alleged that the secretary had failed to manage wild horses and burros in a manner that is designed to achieve and maintain a thriving natural ecological balance.id.at.quoting a.the prospect of pervasive oversight by federal courts over the manner and pace of agency compliance with such congressional directives,the court stated,is not contemplated by the apa.id.yet that is precisely the step that the fund asks us to take in this case.
both lujan and southern utah were suits challenging land use plans formulated pursuant to the federal land policy and management act of,and the act mandate to manage the public lands under principles of multiple use and sustained yield.a.the court held that the plans themselves are generally unreviewable it is only specific actions implementing the plans that are subject to judicial scrutiny.a land use plan is generally a statement of priorities it guides and constrains actions,but does not prescribe them.southern utah,at.the wild horses and burros act thus directs the secretary to manage the animals as an integral part of the natural system of the public lands,to achieve and maintain a thriving natural ecological balance on the public lands,id.a,and to preserve and maintain a relationship with the land,id.f.the bureau carries out its wild horse and burro management duties as part of the broader land use planning process.see the objectives of the program are management of wild horses and burros under the principle of multiple use id.b wild horses and burros shall be considered comparably with other resource values in the formulation of land use plans.id.management activities affecting wild horses and burros shall be in accordance with approved land use plans.the budget initiative reflects land use planning.it contains the outlines of a reinvigorated wild horses and burros program and sets broad goals and strategies.like the land use plans in lujan and southern utah,it is a statement by blm about what it plans to do,at some point,provided it has the funds and there are not more pressing priorities.southern utah,at.as such,it can not be plucked out of context and made a basis for suit under the apa.id.
our conclusion that the bureau budget request is not reviewable under the apa is of a piece with this court consistent refusal to review agency orders that do not themselves adversely affect complainant but only affect his rights adversely on the contingency of future administrative action.drg funding,at internal quotation marks omitted see,reliable automatic sprinkler consumer prod.safety comm n,at t eeoc.as is the case with more formal land use plans,there is considerable legal distance between the appropriation of funds to implement a gather strategy and the actual removal of wild horses and burros.ohio forestry ass n,sierra club,d.the field office responsible for a particular herd management area must conduct its own surveying and land use planning it must propose a gather and provide notice to interested parties if those parties object,it must consider their objections and render a decision.although the strategy likely guides this process,it does not carry the legal significance the fund assigns to it.the elements of the strategy to which the fund objects do not command anyone to do anything or to refrain from doing anything they do not grant,withhold,or modify any formal legal license,power,or authority they do not subject anyone to any civil or criminal liability they create no legal rights or obligations.id.at.our practice in circumstances like this is to require the complaining party to challenge the specific implementation of the broader agency policy.
the fund complaint did object to seven specific gathers allegedly carried out in accordance with the restoration strategy.am.compl.the fund requested relief permanently enjoining the bureau from taking any further steps to implement its restoration strategy,id.at can fairly be read to include an injunction against carrying out the specified removal actions.but those gathers have been completed.it is impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever with respect to the challenged gathers.llc librarian of,internal quotation marks omitted.they can not be undone.
this aspect of the case can not be saved from mootness on the ground that it raises issues or wrongs capable of repetition yet evading review.people for the ethical treatment of animals,gittens,peta internal quotation marks omitted.particular decisions to remove wild horses and burros are highly.how a herd will be managed in the future after the initial culling is anyone guess,as the bureau makes clear.it may depend on climate,on how many new births occur,on the mortality rate of the horses,on whether fertility control is used as a management tool,and on many other factors specific to a herd and to the area in which it is located.once appropriate management levels have been achieved,the schedule for maintaining those amls will be developed based on the individual needs of each herd.if there are to be more roundups in the an open remains to be seen whether they will be of the same magnitude as those which have come before,and whether the same criteria are applied.as in peta,the essential point is that the case before us is highly dependent upon a series of facts unlikely to be duplicated in the future,id.at,particularly since the budget request proposed only a gather program.
because the fund does not challenge any justiciable agency action,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
so ordered.
the majority devotes almost all of its analysis,see op.at,to deciding whether an agency budget request to congress constitutes final agency action under the administrative procedure act apa,see.i agree fully with the majority that a budget request made by a federal agency to congress,in and of itself,is not subject to judicial review under the apa.
the majority gives short shrift,however,to what happened after congress appropriated the funds requested by the bureau of land management blm.through the wild free roaming horses and burros act whba or the act,et,congress has given the blm a broad mandate manage wild horses and burros in a manner that is designed to achieve and maintain a thriving natural ecological balance on the public lands,a.after completing an extensive review of its management of wild horses and burros throughout the american west,and receiving funds to pursue a new course,the blm central leadership in washington,issued instruction memorandum the instruction memorandum or memorandum,which sets out the agency final plan for the restoration strategy and the specific standards field employees are to use in managing wild horses through the year.specifically,the memorandum sets forth the particular types and quantities of horses that agency employees are to remove under the blm current interpretation of the whba.
the majority never squarely addresses whether the instruction memorandum constitutes final agency action,see op.at,and instead devotes its analysis to the agency earlier budget request,see id.at.but at base,this case is nothing more than a rather ordinary request for review of regulatory criteria promulgated by an agency in carrying out a congressional mandate.a preliminary budget request sent to congress surely does not constitute final agency action,but that request does not immunize from judicial review an agency later,final order implementing its statutory authority.
to resolve the fund claim predicated upon the memorandum,the majority raises a mootness issue sua sponte,but without providing the parties an opportunity to respond.the majority concludes that,as a matter of law,an expiration date printed on the memorandum makes it doubtless that the m emorandum was only in effect for a short period of time,op.at,despite the blm acknowledgment in its brief that it does not dispute that the general national planning approach set forth in the m emorandum continues to serve as guidance to the field for the conduct of specific gather and removal decisions,appellees br.at.in the majority view,it is doubtless that the fund claim is moot even where other terms of the memorandum purport to provide the agency governing interpretation of the act through the year.
as the government notes in its brief,no party has developed a record on the majority expiration argument,see appellees br.at,because no party has made that argument.as we have said before the premise of our adversarial system is that appellate courts do not sit as boards of legal inquiry and research,but essentially as arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties before them.united states west,quoting carducci regan.the majority runs afoul of that maxim by dismissing the fund claim on mootness grounds absent any development of that issue by the parties.
undoubtedly,even where no party asserts that the case is moot,we are obliged to address the issue sua sponte because mootness goes to the jurisdiction of this court.mine reclamation ferc,citing iron arrow honor soc y heckler,d per curiam.with respect to jurisdictional issues,however,it is our general practice to allow full development and presentation in the district court of matters that surface initially on appeal and w e therefore remand to the district court for a current ruling on whether threshold article iii requirements are satisfied.women equity action league bell,citing dandridge williams,d internal citation omitted.
by not following that general practice of allowing the parties to fairly join this issue,the majority ends this case on mootness grounds despite the blm concession that the general national planning approach set forth in the february m emorandum continues to serve as guidance to the field,appellees br.at,and that the restoration strategy,which the instruction memorandum by its terms implements,see joint appendix ja at,is intended to provide guidance for the national wild horse and burro program for some unspecified period of time,appellees br.at emphasis added.the instruction memorandum was doubtless in effect when the parties briefed summary judgment in the district court.the blm represents in its brief,however,that its instruction memoranda are reviewed annually.id.at.that annual reviewing process,combined with the fact that the agency acknowledges that it still follows the approach set forth in the memorandum,suggests that either this memorandum is still in effect or the agency has issued another memorandum setting forth the same,continuing legal interpretation of the whba.the parties will have no chance to develop that issue,however,because the majority has declined to allow the parties an opportunity to develop a record on mootness.
the majority,citing to the summary judgment standard,concludes that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the memorandum is moot.see op.at.at summary judgment,however,we are to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.mastro potomac power,citing reeves sanderson plumbing,d.there appears to be evidence that the expiration date does not mean what is says,op.at quotation marks omitted,where,as discussed below,the memorandum by its terms provides instructions to blm field employees for the years,and that are hardly where the blm acknowledges that the strategy,which the memorandum sets forth,was intended to provide guidance for the national wild horse and burro program for some unspecified period of time.appellees br.at.
but the majority no evidence argument is a red herring.even if the majority were correct on that score,it would hardly be surprising that a record would be incomplete on an issue never raised or challenged by any party.although it is true that the plaintiff must present affirmative evidence in order to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment,that is only so as long as the plaintiff has had a full opportunity to conduct discovery.anderson liberty lobby,d see,khan parsons global,this court has long recognized that a party opposing summary judgment needs a reasonable opportunity to complete discovery before responding to a summary judgment motion and that insufficient time or opportunity to engage in discovery is cause to defer decision on the motion quoting martin malhoyt.the majority sua sponte grant of summary judgment for t he absence of record evidence,op.at,is particularly problematic because it comes on appeal,with the fund having had no notice of the majority argument or possibility of seeking discovery or introducing evidence in response.see ramirez de arellano weinberger,en banc unless the new issue uncovered by the appellate court was one which was clearly framed by the proceedings below so that the parties had a legitimate chance to submit all relevant materials and argue their implications,it is clearly unjust for the appellate court to direct the issuance of summary judgment on a new issue raised sua sponte on appeal.collecting citations,vacated on other grounds,d.
the very legal authority relied upon by the majority shows where the majority errs.contrary to the majority suggestion,it is the not the bears the burden,at this stage,of demonstrating that the agency has abandoned the course set forth in the memorandum.see op.at relying upon worth jackson,in re bluewater network.as we recently noted in worth 
it is well settled that a defendant voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice except when the defendant meets its heavy burden of persuading the court that the challenged conduct can not reasonably be expected to start up again.
at quoting friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d alterations omitted quotation marks and alteration omitted.true,as the majority suggests,an agency can abandon its own guidance and no longer follow a memorandum with an expiration date.but the record does not establish,at this stage,that the instruction memorandum has been withdrawn.the blm has not attempted to meet its heavy burden,see laidlaw,at,of persuading this court that it will not continue to follow the instruction it concedes,contrary to the majority suggestion,that it does continue to follow the general national planning approach set forth in the m emorandum.appellees br.at.if given a chance to develop the majority mootness issue in the district court,the blm would be able to advise on which parts of the instruction memorandum it follows,and the fund would be able to address,and develop a record on,whether any recent blm instruction memoranda evidence that the blm continues to follow the same approach the fund challenges.but despite the substantial resources invested in this litigation,and despite our general approach of remanding such article iii issues that have gone previously unchallenged,this case ends today without any of the parties having been given a chance to address mootness.instead,the parties are left with one paragraph from the majority asserting mootness,see op.at,and the blm is not held to meeting its heavy burden,see laidlaw,at,of demonstrating that the fund claim is moot.
given the blm acknowledgment that it still follows the general national planning approach set forth in the memorandum,appellees br.at,it is clear,however,that this distributed to field employees through the instruction memorandum or a version of the memorandum with a new expiration final agency action under the precedent of both the supreme court and this circuit,see.as the supreme court has reminded us,t he particular label placed upon an agency order by an agency is not necessarily conclusive,for it is the substance of what the agency has purported to do and has done which is decisive.columbia broad.united states.see also,croplife am.epa,same general epa,same envtl.def.fund gorsuch,same chamber of commerce of osha,same.
our cases make clear that an agency pronouncement will be considered binding as a practical matter if it either appears on its face to be binding,or is applied by the agency in a way that indicates it is binding.general,at internal citations omitted citing appalachian power epa,mclouth steel prods.thomas.as the blm concession indicates,the latter is certainly present here blm employees in the field still must follow this agency directive.even with respect to the first category,the instruction memorandum the majority holds has been withdrawn appears on its face to still be binding,or there is at least a question of fact to be resolved on that score.although given scant attention by the majority opinion,the text of the memorandum provides
