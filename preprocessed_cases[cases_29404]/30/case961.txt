amended opinion 
this is a government appeal from a district court judgment enjoining forest service regulations that govern review of decisions implementing forest plans,on the ground that the regulations were manifestly contrary to the governing statute.the forest service promulgated the challenged regulations pursuant to the forest service decisionmaking and appeals reform act ara,tit,stat.codified at note.in a,the environmentalist plaintiffs earth island institute et challenge the four regulations the district court held were valid.the statute pertains to procedures relating to public comment,notice,and administrative appeal of proposed forest management actions.the government raises standing and ripeness issues.we agree with the district court that plaintiffs have established standing.but because only two aspects of the regulations,f and a have actually been applied to a proposed project,we hold that only those regulations are ripe for review.we affirm the district court judgment that f and a conflict with the appeals reform act and affirm the nationwide injunction barring their application.we remand the judgment and injunction with respect to the remaining regulations to the district court with instructions to vacate for lack of a controversy ripe for review.
ii.background 
plaintiffs,earth island institute,sequoia forestkeeper,heartwood,center for biological diversity,and the sierra club collectively earth island are environmental organizations.to establish their standing,plaintiffs rely on the declaration of jim bensman,an employee and member of heartwood.according to his affidavit,bensman has been using the national forests for over years,and has visited national forests in california,including klamath,shasta,six rivers and trinity.bensman declared that he planned to return to california in august and oregon in october.he asserted that his interest in the biological health of the forest,as well as his recreational interest,is harmed when development occurs in violation of law or policy.bensman specifically stated that if an appeal option were available to him on projects that are categorically excluded from appeal,he would exercise that right of appeal.he also alleged personal and procedural injuries under each challenged regulation.
the defendant,the united states forest service,prior to,provided a administrative appeals process,pt,for agency decisions documented in a decision memo,decision notice,or record of decision.see,heartwood,forest,cir.in march,the forest service proposed a new regulation that would have eliminated administrative appeals for all decisions except those approving forest plans or amendments or revisions to forest plans.see.the proposal would have replaced administrative appeals with notice and comment procedures for proposed projects on which the forest service had completed an environmental assessment ea and a finding of no significant impact fonsi,in accordance with applicable provisions of the national environmental policy act of nepa.essentially,the proposal provided a categorical exclusion from notice,comment and appeal for projects the forest service deemed environmentally insignificant.
the proposal was greeted with considerable protest,and environmental groups decried the loss of administrative review.congress,in response,enacted the ara,tit.iii,codified at note.among other things,the ara required the forest service to establish an administrative appeals process with opportunity for notice and comment.the ara provides in material part 
a in accordance with this section,the secretary of agriculture,acting through the chief of the forest service,shall establish a notice and comment process for proposed actions of the forest service concerning projects and activities implementing land and resource management plans developed under the forest and rangeland renewable resources planning act of et and shall modify the procedure for appeals of decisions concerning such projects.
after a series of challenges to regulations promulgated pursuant to the ara,see heartwood,the forest service reinstated the notice,comment and administrative appeal procedure as an interim measure until the forest service issued a final regulation implementing the ara.see.on june,the forest service published a final rule revising the notice,comment,and appeal procedures for projects and activities implementing land and resource management plans on national forest system lands.at june,rule.
on june,the forest service published the final implementing procedures for national environmental policy act documentation needed for fire management activities fire ce.codified at forest service handbook,ch.this action created a new category of projects,fire rehabilitation activities on less than acres,which could be excluded from ea and environmental impact statement eis analysis,and exempted from notice,comment and appeal under the challenged regulations.salvage timber sales of acres or less timber sale ce were also designated as categorical exclusions on july.codified at forest service handbook,ch.
on september,the forest service issued its burnt ridge project decision memo approving the timber sale and treatment of acres of forest area.the burnt ridge project timber sale proposal was prepared pursuant to the sierra nevada forest plan amendment record of decision,stemming from the mcnally fire.the burnt ridge project area is located on the hot springs ranger district of sequoia national forest,approximately air miles from california hot springs,california.in the summer of,a fire known as the mcnally fire burned approximately acres of forest and chaparral primarily within the sequoia national forest.between january and march,the sequoia national forest sent out three scoping notices pursuant to nepa,for three separate salvage logging projects.each of the adjacent projects was planned as a result of the mcnally fire,and proposed identical or highly similar logging prescriptions.the burnt ridge project,as approved by the forest service decision memo,would have resulted in the logging of approximately acres of burned forest for sale as timber.the decision memo applied the categorical exclusion provisions of f and a.the decision expressly states that this project is not subject to appeal because it involves projects or activities which are categorically excluded from documentation in an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment.eventually,after this litigation was instituted,the parties settled that challenge and the forest service withdrew the burnt ridge project.
on december,earth island filed a complaint against the forest service,challenging the rule as applied to the burnt ridge project,and bringing facial challenges to nine provisions of the rule.the burnt ridge project decision memo was issued under provisions which the forest service claim categorically exclude the project under the challenged regulations in this case from documentation in an ea or eis,and thereby from administrative notice,comment,and appeal.the district court invalidated five challenged regulations and upheld four regulations,earth island pengilly,d,and issued a nationwide injunction against the application of the invalid regulations.this appeal and followed.
iii.standing 
earth island argues that plaintiffs in this case had standing on the basis of the personal and procedural injuries documented in the bensman affidavit because their aesthetic interests in the national forests are harmed by the regulations and,more specifically,they contend that their procedural interests in participating in the administrative notice,comment,and appeal process are harmed.the government argues that plaintiffs have suffered no cognizable injury in fact with respect to the challenged regulations,because the regulations have not yet been applied.
to satisfy article iii standing requirements,a plaintiff must show that plaintiff has suffered injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
the parties do not dispute that an organizational plaintiff has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right,the interests at stake are germane to the organization purpose,and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.id.at.
aesthetic and environmental interests generally are cognizable injuries in fact,b ut the injury in fact test requires more than an injury to a cognizable interest.it requires that the party seeking review be himself among the injured.sierra club morton,d.an affiant some day intentions to return to an area that will be affected by a project do not support a finding of actual or imminent injury unless the affiant has specific plans to return to the area.lujan defenders of wildlife,at.
in this case,plaintiffs persuasively argue,and the district court properly concluded,that bensman preclusion from participation in the appeals process may yield diminished recreational enjoyment of the national forests.
earth island has also alleged sufficient procedural injury to support standing,relying on the argument that the ara is a procedural statute giving rise to a procedural injury within the zone of interests congress intended to protect.these are procedural regulations governing the opportunity for public comment.the ara does not address any substantive forest service program and governs only the process.procedural and informational injuries may be the basis for injury in fact for standing purposes.see city of davis coleman,cir the procedural injury implicit in agency failure to prepare an eis is the creation of a risk that serious environmental impacts will be overlooked is itself a sufficient injury in fact to support standing.because nepa is essentially a procedural statute designed to ensure that environmental issues are given proper consideration in the decisionmaking process,injury alleged to have occurred as a result of violating this procedural right confers standing.idaho conservation league mumma,cir quoting trustees for alaska hodel,cir see also united states students challenging regulatory agency procedures scrap,d friends of the earth navy,cir noting that t his court has long recognized that failure to follow procedures designed to ensure that the environmental consequences of a project are adequately evaluated is a sufficient injury in fact to support standing.
earth island was unable to appeal the burnt ridge project because the forest service applied f the loss of that right of administrative appeal is sufficient procedural injury in fact to support a challenge to the regulation.plaintiffs in this case are injure d in the sense contemplated by congress,mumma,at because plaintiffs are precluded from appealing decisions like the burnt ridge project,and that project itself,under the rule.the ara is entirely procedural,and congress contemplated public involvement in the administrative notice,comment,and appeal process.
plaintiffs have satisfied the remaining standing requirements.the deprivation of the procedural right of administrative notice,comment,and appeal is fairly traceable to the forest service regulations.a favorable decision invalidating the regulation would redress earth island injury.accordingly,earth island has established standing on the basis of both personal and procedural injury.
iv.ripeness 
the forest service argues that the challenges to the regulations are unripe because they have not yet been applied in a specific context and that this court should decline to decide the challenge where the record is incomplete.earth island argues that no further record development is needed because the challenged regulations are final agency action and present purely legal questions.
the jurisdiction of federal courts is defined and limited by article iii of the constitution.in terms relevant to the question for decision in this case,the judicial power of federal courts is constitutionally restricted to cases and controversies.flast cohen,d.courts must refrain from deciding abstract or hypothetical controversies and from rendering impermissible advisory opinions with respect to such controversies.see id.at.a federal court has neither the power to render advisory opinions nor to decide questions that can not affect the rights of litigants in the case before them.its judgments must resolve a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.preiser newkirk,d internal quotation marks omitted.an advisory opinion results if the court resolves a question of law that is not presented by the facts of the case.see,in re michaelson,cir i t would be constitutionally improper for us to reach this question since the issue lacks the necessary facts to make it concrete.
ripeness is a prudential doctrine intended,in part,to prevent judicial review of legal issues outside the limits of article iii cases and controversies.plaintiffs rely on a selective reading of abbott laboratories gardner,in which the supreme court established a presumption in favor of ripeness for regulations that constitute final agency action,d overruled on other grounds by califano sanders,d.in that challenge to fda regulations,the supreme court held the regulations were ripe for review because the challenge presented a purely legal question whether the fda commissioner had exceeded his rulemaking authority.the legal issue could be resolved on the record as it stood,without reference to more specific facts.abbott laboratories also established a ripeness test first,a reviewing court must ask if the issues are fit for judicial decision and second,a reviewing court considers the hardship to the parties of withholding review.id.at.
we are persuaded by the forest service reliance on toilet goods association,gardner,d,where the supreme court held that a challenge to fda regulations was premature.in that case,the petitioners challenged regulations authorized by the color additive amendments that would allow the fda commissioner to revoke product certifications if the agency was not given free access to color additive formulas and manufacturing facilities and processes.in toilet goods,the regulations were final agency action and the question presented was purely legal.id.at.nonetheless,the supreme court held that the issues failed the first part of the abbott laboratories test.the issues were not fit for judicial decision because the regulations effects were speculative and the record was incomplete.id.at.the court also held under the second abbott laboratories inquiry that the challenge was unripe because the situation was not one in which primary conduct was affected.id.at.
the supreme court also emphasized the need for factual context in lujan national wildlife federation,in which the supreme court emphasized the ripeness doctrine,stating that a regulation is ordinarily not ripe for review until the scope of the controversy has been reduced to more manageable proportions,and its factual components fleshed out,by some concrete action applying the regulation to the claimant situation in a fashion that harms or threat
