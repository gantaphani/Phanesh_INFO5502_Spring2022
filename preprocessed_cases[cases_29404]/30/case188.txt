new york state sued national service industries,nsi under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla,et,to recover the costs of closure and remediation of the blydenburg landfill in islip,new york.in granting summary judgment for new york,the district court for the eastern district of new york jacob mishler,district judge applied the substantial continuity test for successor liability articulated in goodrich betkoski,cir,and held that nsi,which had purchased all of uniform rental corporation,assets,was the successor to and was therefore responsible for cercla liability.see new york servs,d.nsi appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of new york on the basis that,among other reasons,betkoski is no longer good law after the supreme court decision in united states bestfoods,d.we agree that,after bestfoods,the substantial continuity test can not be applied to determine successor liability under cercla.
background 
because our resolution of this appeal does not involve analysis of most of the underlying facts of this case,we provide only a sketch of the events which led to the present suit and direct those who may be interested in greater detail to the opinion below.see servs,d at.
from to,operated an industrial garment rental service.id.at.as part of its business,it dry cleaned garments at a facility that was owned separately by two principals.in june,arranged for the disposal of several drums of liquid waste that contained perchloroethylene pce,a solvent used in the process.the drums were deposited at the blydenburgh landfill in islip,new york.in the landfill was listed in the new york registry of hazardous waste sites and in it was added to the federal national priority list of contaminated sites.as of september,new york had spent at least to clean up the landfill.the parties agree that because arranged for disposal of wastes at the landfill,it is potentially responsible for the cost of cleaning up the landfill.
in,nsi then known as initial service investments entered into an asset sale agreement,whereby it agreed to purchase customer contracts,customer lists,service inventory,accounts receivable,trucks,insulated jackets bearing the name and the right to use or retire name.id.at.warranted that the asset transfer would be sufficient to meet the needs of customers.the sale price was based on revenues as an ongoing operation,as determined by the weekly revenues for the six weeks preceding and following the purchase.the purchase price was approximately.the owners of covenanted that they would not compete with nsi for seven years.
on the date of the purchase,adopted a plan of liquidation,which it carried out shortly thereafter.id.at.nsi tried to make the transition from to nsi as seamless as possible by employing the drivers,using trucks which still bore the name,using on its letterhead and taking over the telephone number.id.
the district court held that nsi operations were a substantial continuation of business,and thus,nsi is subject to successor liability for environmental infractions.id.at.in particular,the district court held that nsi was liable under cercla for the cost at the blydenburgh landfill.id.
discussion 
we are faced with the question of whether,in the context of cercla,the substantial continuity rule for successor liability that we adopted in betkoski remains good law after the supreme court decision in bestfoods.we hold that it does not.
cercla makes any person who is the present or past owner or operator of a contaminated facility or a generator or transporter of the hazardous substances that pollute a facility,liable for the cost of cleaning up the facility.a.person is defined by cercla to include corporations and other business organizations.see id.however,cercla does not provide rules for when corporations that are related to the responsible corporation should be held liable.
in the instant case,as it was in betkoski,the question is whether a corporation that purchased the assets of a company liable for environmental response costs under cercla should be held liable for those same costs as a successor corporation.in bestfoods,the question was somewhat different it asked when a parent corporation should be held responsible for the cercla liabilities of its subsidiary.bestfoods,at.because the analysis of liability in bestfoods bears on our analysis of successor liability here,we consider whether the rule of successor liability we adopted in betkoski is consistent with the supreme court analysis in bestfoods.
bestfoods involved an effort by the united states to recover under cercla the cost of remediating a facility near muskegon,michigan.id.at.in,ott chemical company had begun to manufacture chemicals at the facility.id.at.in,the bestfoods corporation then known as cpc international,created a subsidiary corporation that purchased ott chemical.the subsidiary corporation also called ott chemical continued to manufacture chemicals until,when bestfoods sold it to an unrelated company.id.the district court held that bestfoods was liable under cercla because it had operated the facility through its subsidiary.cpc int l.in particular,the district court reasoned that bestfoods had operated the facility through its subsidiary because it had selected the subsidiary board and populated its executive ranks with bestfoods officials.id.at.the sixth circuit reversed en banc.united states cordova chem.it held,seven judges to six,that a parent corporation could only be liable for the actions of its subsidiary if the state common law rules for piercing the corporate veil were met or if the parent had directly participated in the operation of the facility.id.at.
the supreme court vacated the circuit en banc opinion and remanded.the court held that cercla is like many another congressional enactments in giving no indication that the entire corpus of state corporation law is to be replaced simply because a plaintiff cause of action is based upon a federal statute.bestfoods,at.quoting burks lasker,d.the failure of cercla to speak to a matter as fundamental as the liability implications of corporate ownership demands application of the rule that in order to abrogate a principle,the statute must speak directly to the question addressed by the common law.id.quoting united states texas,d.the supreme court rejected the district court test for a parent corporation derivative liability because that test disregard ed entirely common law rule s.id.at.
betkoski and the substantial continuity test 
in considering the substantial continuity test,we take from bestfoods the principle that when determining whether liability under cercla passes from one corporation to another,we must apply common law rules and not create rules.because the substantial continuity test adopted in betkoski departs from the common law rules of successor liability,betkoski is no longer good law.
as we described in betkoski,the traditional common law rule states that a corporation acquiring the assets of another corporation only takes on its liabilities if any of the following apply the successor expressly or impliedly agrees to assume them the transaction may be viewed as a de facto merger or consolidation the successor is the mere continuation of the predecessor or the transaction is fraudulent.at quoting united states carolina transformer,cir see also fletcher,cyclopedia of the law of private corporations.the exception at issue here is the mere continuation exception.see betkoski,at.betkoski described the mere continuation test as the common law test sometimes referred to as the identity test,which requires the existence of a single corporation after the transfer of assets,with an identity of stock,stockholders,and directors between the successor and predecessor corporations.id.at citing carolina transformer,at.
noting that the substantial continuity test sometimes referred to as the continuity of enterprise approach had been followed by the supreme court in the labor law context,in betkoski we contrasted that doctrine with the mere continuation rule.rather than considering ownership,the substantial continuity test focuses on the continuity of the business whether the successor maintains the same business,with the same employees doing the same jobs,under the same supervisors,working conditions,and production processes,and produces the same products for the same customers.id.
we adopted the substantial continuity test because cercla is entitled to a construction that advances its primary goals and the substantial continuity test is more consistent with those goals and is thus superior to the older and more inflexible identity rule.id.accordingly,we held the substantial continuity test to be the appropriate legal test for successor liability under cercla.id.in betkoski we were not applying general common law principles of corporate law but rather adopting a special rule for use in cercla cases that departed from those principles.
new york argues that the substantial continuity test is simply a refined version of the traditional mere continuation exception.new york is correct that,unlike the novel rule adopted by the district court in bestfoods,there is some prior precedent for the substantial continuity rule and the rule is generally presented as a variant of the mere continuation exception.however,the substantial continuity test is not a sufficiently well established part of the common law of corporate liability to satisfy bestfoods dictate that common law must govern.we briefly describe the current state of the substantial continuity doctrine.
within federal law,the substantial continuity doctrine is well established in the area of labor law.see,fall river dyeing finishing nlrb,d.however,the labor law cases are particular to the labor law context and therefore have not been and can not easily be extended to other areas of federal common law.in textile workers union lincoln mills,the supreme court held that section of the labor management relations act authorizes federal courts to fashion a body of federal law for the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements,d.thus,the rules that federal courts and the supreme court have adopted in the labor law context do not necessarily reflect general federal common law but rather represent law fashioned for the purpose of enforcing section.see golden state bottling nlrb,d contrasting the perimeters of the doctrine of successorship with the general rules governing asset purchase agreements.
furthermore,some of the labor law substantial continuity cases have not involved asset purchases.see john wiley sons,livingston,d using substantial continuity in the case of a merger to assess whether labor agreement should apply after the merger.thus,in the labor law context the doctrine is not part of the common law mere continuation exception.finally,even where the labor cases did involve an asset purchase,the focus was not on whether the successor corporation should be responsible for general corporate liabilities but whether the successor had a duty to bargain with the same workforce which had previously voted to bargain collectively with the predecessor corporation.thus,in fall river dyeing finishing corp nlrb,the test was employed to determine whether those employees who have been retained will understandably view their job situations as essentially unaltered.at.quoting golden state bottling,at.
the substantial continuity doctrine has also been applied in a few product liability cases.in betkoski,we pointed to mozingo correct,where the fifth circuit applied the doctrine to hold an asset purchaser liable for an injury that occurred before the purchase,cir.the fifth circuit characterized the doctrine as in the nature of an expansion of the mere continuance exception to the rule of for asset purchasers.id.but the mozingo court was applying mississippi law and in betkoski we were relying on federal common law see also cyr offen,cir adopting substantial continuity doctrine where new hampshire law applied to hold asset purchaser liable for product injuries of predecessor.perhaps if the substantial continuity doctrine were widely adopted among the states,it might be considered absorbed into federal common law and thus applied under cercla pursuant to the reasoning in bestfoods in whatever states had not adopted it.however,at present the doctrine has been adopted by only a handful of states.see fletcher,cyclopedia of the law of private corporations a few states have loosened the traditional mere continuation exception in strict liability cases to focus on continuity of the business or enterprise but m ost courts that have considered the continuation of enterprise exception have refused to adopt it.
we thus find that the substantial continuity doctrine is not a part of general federal common law and,following bestfoods,should not be used to determine whether a corporation takes on cercla liability as the result of an asset purchase.our holding is consistent with dicta by the only other court of appeals that has considered whether the substantial continuity doctrine survives bestfoods.see united states davis,cir noting that bestfoods left little room for the creation of a federal rule of liability under the statute.
because we find that the substantial continuity doctrine of betkoski is no longer good law and reject the argument that the doctrine is part of the federal common law for cercla purposes,we must vacate the district court grant of summary judgment for plaintiff new york state.
conclusion 
for the forgoing reasons,we vacate the grant of summary judgment for plaintiff and remand for further proceedings.
i agree completely with my colleagues that,after the supreme court ruling in united states bestfoods,d,the cercla liability of a seller of assets may no longer be imposed on the purchaser of those assets on the basis of the substantial continuity test several federal courts have adopted for such situations.see goodrich betkoski,cir united states mexico feed seed,cir united states carolina transformer,cir.the supreme court made clear in bestfoods that in the absence of a statutory authorization,courts are not free to impose federal statutory liability under standards that depart from the well established principles of common law.under common law rules,a purchaser of assets does not succeed to the liabilities of the seller,except in narrow circumstances.the substantial continuity test fashioned by the federal courts for cercla liability is unquestionably a significant deviation from the common law rules.nor is authority for it to be found in the terms of the cercla statute.the judgment of the district court therefore must be set aside.i agree with my colleagues that the bestfoods principle is altogether adequate to dispose of this case.
i write separately to note my belief that,even if the cercla substantial continuity test could survive bestfoods,the judgment of the district court nonetheless could not stand because the court misunderstood the requirements of the test.i believe it is worthwhile noting this alternative basis for overturning the district court ruling,for three reasons.first,notwithstanding our judgment that the test has been dispatched by bestfoods,it could remain with us.in bestfoods,the supreme court did not address the issue of successor liability it ruled on a question of subsidiary liability.although the principles of bestfoods appear to us fully applicable to our question,there is as yet no holding of the supreme court that speaks directly to it.second,and perhaps more important,even assuming that bestfoods has laid this test to rest,the test might be resuscitated by legislative action.courts developed the test because they believed it advanced the goals of cercla.if congress shares that view,congress might wish to give express statutory authorization for the test.third,a substantial continuity test for successor liability might be devised by courts for use in connection with another federal statute that does confer proper authorization.in any of these circumstances,the test may be employed once again after bestfoods.the test has caused substantial confusion.in view of the possibility of its return,it seems worth the trouble to explore how the test should be understood.
in a small number of contexts,courts have fashioned rules,notwithstanding the contrary principles of common law,to impose a liability incurred by a previous operator of a business on a successor in the operation of that business.courts have described these rules in terms of a substantial continuity test for successor liability.the objective was in each case to further the policies of the particular statute under consideration,or prevent its circumvention.it would be quite mistaken to view these instances as involving the use of a test of clear,contours,which courts have plugged into first one,then another statutory scheme.to the contrary,in the case of each statutory scheme,the courts,perceiving the inadequacy of the common law rules to support the objectives of the particular statute,have groped case by case toward a new standard,sometimes following the lead of the administrative agency charged with administration of the statute.the test developed for use with each statute reflects considerations peculiar to that statute.as a result,the test developed for one statute differs from the test developed for another.although courts have often identified these as tests of substantial continuity,substantial continuity is not the entirety of any such test,but merely an element.nor is the concept of substantial continuity satisfied in the same way in each circumstance,regardless of the statute whose objectives are being advanced.notwithstanding some common ground,it is a different test,designed to achieve different purposes,depending on the statute for which it was developed.
for example,over a period of years,in the interpretation of the national labor relations act nlra,et,the supreme court,generally following the lead of the national labor relations board nlrb,developed a doctrine shaping the bargaining obligations of an employer who takes over a business formerly conducted by another employer,together with a significant part of the predecessor workforce.where the predecessor had been obligated to bargain with the union certified as the representative of its workforce,the court imposed on the successor the predecessor duty to bargain with that union.the facts and reasoning of these cases clearly indicate that they are responsive to the specific concerns of a of the nlra,and are not intended to fashion a general principle of successor liability applicable in other contexts see nlrb burns int l sec,d fall river dyeing finishing nlrb,d in burns international,burns had won a competitive bid to oust another company,wackenhut,as provider of security services to a lockheed plant.within the previous few months,the wackenhut employees had selected the united plant guard workers union upg as their bargaining representative,and the upg had been certified by the nlrb as their exclusive bargaining agent.at.to perform the job it had won,burns hired many of the workers wackenhut was laying off,enough to make up a majority of its workforce assigned to that job.burns regarded the newly hired workers as covered by its collective bargaining agreement with a different union,which encompassed workers in similar employment at other sites.it refused to bargain with upg.the nlrb found that this refusal violated a and a of the nlra,a and a,and ordered that burns bargain with upg with respect to the former wackenhut employees.the supreme court upheld the order.the court focused on whether the wackenhut bargaining unit,which the nlrb had certified for representation by upg,remained intact after the change in employer,and found that it did because the same employees were performing the same tasks under the same conditions.id.at.the court explained,the source of burns duty to bargain with the union is the fact that it voluntarily took over a bargaining unit that was largely intact and that had been certified within the past year.id.at.the court noted furthermore,it would be a wholly different case if the nlrb had determined that because burns operational structure and practice differed from those of wackenhut,the lockheed bargaining unit was no longer the appropriate one.id.at.
just as the considerations guiding the test are distinct in the context of duty to bargain under the nlra,so the remedy is also particular to that context.the court explicitly ruled that burns was not bound to the substantive terms of the collective bargaining agreement the upg had negotiated with wackenhut.its sole successor obligation was to bargain with upg.it remained free to fashion its own demands over such substantive terms as changes in corporate structure,composition of the labor force,work location,task assignment,and nature of supervision.id.at.it is quite clear that the considerations that guided the court in fashioning both the test and the remedies under the test were uniquely tailored to the particular labor law context and are of little relevance to a cercla dispute over succession to cleanup liabilities.
fifteen years later,the supreme court refined the test in fall river dyeing,making even more clear its intent to rest the analysis of successor duties on the specific concerns of the nlra.fall river,a newly formed company,had purchased a portion of the assets of a recently shutdown dyeing works,and hired enough of the former company unionized employees to make up a majority of its workforce.the nlrb ordered fall river to bargain with the union that had the workers had chosen while employed by the predecessor company.the supreme court affirmed the nlrb order.while employing what it called a substantial continuity test and noting that the duty to bargain was inherited when the successor company acquired substantial assets of its predecessor and continued,without interruption or substantial change,the predecessor business operations,at,the court focused on the fact that where the successor company retained the same employees in the same positions,those employees who have been retained will understandably view their job situations as essentially unaltered.id.the court explained that the viewpoint of the workers provided the touchstone for application of the test,because 
emphasis on the employees perspective furthers the act policy of industrial peace.if the employees find themselves in essentially the same jobs after the employer transition and if their legitimate expectations in continued representation by their union are thwarted,their dissatisfaction may lead to labor unrest.
id.at.as in burns,the application of a substantial continuity test focused on the composition of the workforce,and the employees legitimate expectations of being represented by the union they had selected under the terms of the nlra,while employed together in the same positions and in the same location,although under a different employer.
in golden state bottling nlrb,d,the supreme court considered a different question also arising under the national labor relations act whether the bona fide purchaser of a business,who acquires and continues the business with knowledge that the predecessor had committed an unfair labor practice in the discharge of an employee,may be ordered by the nlrb to reinstate the employee with backpay.id.at.all american beverages,had purchased the assets of golden state soft drink bottling and distribution business with knowledge of the nlrb prior order to golden state to remedy an unfair labor practice it had committed in discharging an employee.all american had continued golden state operations without interruption and employed its labor force.the board ordered all american to reinstate with back pay the employee wrongfully dismissed by golden state.the supreme court affirmed the board order.the judgment was based on considerations particular to the labor context.first was the primary interpretive role of the nlrb,which had issued the reinstatement order,and enjoyed broad discretion to fashion relief adequate to achieve the ends,and effectuate the policies,of the nlra.id.at.second,the objectives of national labor policy,which include protection to the employees from a sudden change in the employment relationship,appropriately balanced the prerogative of owners independently to rearrange their businesses.id.at.third,as in fall ri
