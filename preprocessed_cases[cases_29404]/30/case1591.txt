on summary judgment,the united states court of federal claims determined that the united states forest service did not breach scott timber company timber sales contracts.see scott timber united states,fed.cl.scott i scott timber united states.scott ii scott timber united states,slip op.at fed.cl.filed july,scott iii.this dispute arose when the forest service suspended scott performance on the timber contracts to protect the marbled murrelet,a tiny bird indigenous to the forest areas covered by the contracts.because five of the contracts at issue do not grant the forest service suspension authority,this court reverses the trial court summary judgment that those contracts granted suspension authority.because the evidence does not justify the disposition of the reasonableness issue on summary judgment,an issue of fact,this court also reverses the holding that the suspensions were reasonable as a matter of law.this court affirms the rest of the issues on appeal and remands for further proceedings.
on january,the national audubon society and of its chapters along the western coast filed a petition with the united states fish and wildlife service fws requesting a listing of the marbled murrelet as a threatened species.on january,fws proposed that a listing of the murrelet as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate.this notice also encourage d federal agencies and other appropriate parties to take the murrelet into account in environmental planning.id.the forest service listed the murrelet as a sensitive species within oregon and washington in march.
in,the forest service solicited competitive bids for the sale and harvest of timber in the siskiyou and siuslaw national forests in oregon under section of the department of the interior appropriations act of,stat.section,also known as the northwest timber compromise,mandated that the forest service shall offer an aggregate timber sale level of seven billion seven hundred million board feet of net merchantable timber from the national forests of oregon and washington for fiscal years and,stat.at.this provision responded to a timber shortage in the pacific northwest resulting from competing interests of environmentalists and the timber industry.see scott ii,fed.cl.at citing robertson seattle audubon soc y,d.scott won eleven of those contracts hereinafter the contracts.the forest service awarded the contracts to scott between april,and october.
the court of federal claims determined,in an articulate and opinion,that the forest service compliance with satisfied its obligations under the national forest management act of nfma and the national environment policy act of nepa to provide protection for sensitive species in offering timber sales contracts.scott ii,fed.cl.at.in other words,the trial court determined that contracts under by definition complied with nfma and nepa,as well as the forest service sensitive species program.id.at robertson,at.
in april,the audubon society filed suit to compel fws to list the murrelet as threatened or endangered.see marbled murrelet lujan,no.filed april,the listing action.the plaintiffs in the listing action added the forest service as a defendant in september,seeking to require the forest service to protect the murrelet under nfma.the district court in the listing action issued a temporary restraining order on september,to prohibit the logging of any marbled murrelet habitat.
on september,the forest service orally informed scott that it was suspending operations under the contracts.the temporary restraining order expired ten days later.however,the forest service informed the district court that it would continue the suspension of logging operations until fws made a final decision on listing the murrelet.consistent with that representation,the forest service notified scott that the suspensions would remain in effect indefinitely.by order of the district court,fws listed the murrelet as a threatened species,effective september.see.
section of the endangered species act esa and its implementing regulations require every federal agency to participate in a detailed consultation process to determine what impact,if any,that agency operations will have on any newly listed species.see a,b pt.accordingly,the forest service initiated a formal consultation with the fws to analyze the impact of the timber sales contracts in the siskiyou and siuslaw national forests.by letter dated october,scott informed the forest service that it intended to participate in the consultation as an applicant under the esa,specifically a.the forest service notified scott on november,that it was entitled to participate in the consultation process.the formal consultation began on december.the esa requires completion of the formal consultation within days with a potential for extension up to days upon written notice.b.the consultation may extend beyond days only with the applicant consent.id.
fws issued a draft biological opinion on july,which the forest service reviewed.after considering the forest service comments on the draft biological opinion,fws issued a second draft biological opinion on september.the second draft biological opinion concluded that the contracts jeopardize the murrelet.further,the opinion foresaw no reasonable or prudent alternatives to terminating the contracts in murrelet habitat.
scott attended two applicant meetings on the draft biological opinion in september and october.on october,the siuslaw timber operations association,including scott,submitted comments disagreeing with the finding of jeopardy and the lack of reasonable and prudent alternatives to the contracts.in a letter to the forest service dated november,scott expressed its preference for continued consultations rather than cancellation of the contracts.scott further proposed reasonable and prudent to permit operations under the contracts without harming the murrelet habitat.
on may,fws issued its final biological opinion,which effectively prohibited timber harvesting on all eleven of scott contracts.the final biological opinion found no reasonable and prudent alternatives to canceling timber sales in any areas of marbled murrelet habitat.eventually,surveys found murrelet habitat in each of scott eleven contracts.
scott and other timber companies filed suit in the united states district court for the district of oregon to challenge the final biological opinion as not complying with the esa.see clr timber holdings,babbitt.due to a settlement,the district court dismissed this action without prejudice in the summer of.
in an attempt to reconfigure the timber contracts to permit some harvesting without disturbing the murrelet,the forest service sought technical assistance from fws through the latter part of and the early part of.fws issued a final amended biological opinion on june.this amended biological opinion did not permit any operations under the contracts at issue in this case.
on june,scott submitted formal claims to the contracting officer co under the contract disputes act cda.scott alleged that the forest service prolonged suspensions of the contracts constituted a breach of contract.scott contended that the forest service lacked authority to suspend operations under the contracts for an indefinite and extended period of time.scott sought damages equal to the cost of obtaining replacement timber in the open market.the co denied all of scott breach of contract claims.scott began filing breach of contract actions for each of the contracts in the court of federal claims on october.those individual actions were consolidated into this case.
contract clauses,and are at issue in this appeal.six contracts contain clause cat track,raspberry,formader,maria skyline,skywalker,and wapiti collectively the contracts.the remaining five contracts contain clauses and,but do not contain clause toastberry,father oak,beamer,formader,and indian hook collectively the contracts.
clause reads 
contract clause 
or delay of operations.purchaser agrees to interrupt or delay operations under this contract,in whole or in part,upon the written request of contracting officer 
a to prevent serious environmental degradation or resource damage that may require contract modification under or termination pursuant to 
b to comply with a court order,issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or 
c upon determination of the appropriate regional forester,forest service,that conditions existing on this sale are the same as,or nearly the same as,conditions existing on sale s named in such an order as described in b.
purchaser agrees that in event of interruption or delay of operations under this provision,that its sole and exclusive remedy shall be contract term adjustment pursuant to,or when such an interruption or delay exceeds days during normal operating season,contract term adjustment pursuant to,plus expenses incurred as a direct result of interruption or delay of operations under this provision.expenses do not include lost profits,replacement cost of timber,or any other anticipatory losses suffered by purchaser.
clause reads 
contract clause 
protection of habitat or endangered,threatened,and sensitive species.location of areas needing special measures for protection of plants or animals listed as threatened or endangered or as sensitive are shown on sale area map and identified on the ground.measures needed to protect such areas have been included elsewhere in this contract or are as follows 
none are listed in scott contracts 
if protection measures prove inadequate,if other such areas are discovered,or if new species are listed as federally threatened or endangered or as sensitive by the regional forester,forest service may either cancel the contract under or unilaterally modify this contract to provide additional protection regardless of when such facts become known.in the event of modification under this subsection,purchaser shall be reimbursed for any additional protection required by the modification amount of reimbursement shall be in the form of a reduction in current contract rates unless agreed otherwise in writing.
finally,clause reads 
contract clause 
contract term adjustment.contract term adjustment means adjustment only as provided immediately above and for the three circumstances described in this subsection.under said circumstances,the contract term shall be adjusted in writing to include additional calendar days in one or more normal operating seasons equal to the actual time lost,except as limited by b below.
the three circumstances qualifying for a contract term adjustment are 
a purchaser experiences delay in starting scheduled operations or interruption in active operations either of which stops removal of included timber from sale area for or more consecutive calendar days during a normal operating season due to causes beyond the purchaser control,including but not limited to acts of god,acts of the public enemy,acts of government,labor disputes,fires,insurrections or floods.
scott moved for summary judgment on the contracts,arguing that the forest service lacked authority to suspend operations under those contracts.the government for summary judgment on all eleven contracts.the court of federal claims,in its initial opinion on march,reached the following conclusions 
scott claims in this case are not jurisdictionally barred as new claims that were not originally presented to the contracting officer.
contract clause expressly authorized the government to suspend operations under the contracts.
contract clause implicitly authorized the government to suspend operations under the contracts.
contract clause did not authorize the government to suspend operations under the contracts.
contract clauses and did not grant unlimited authority to suspend operations,but only authority to suspend for a reasonable duration.
the forest service actions surrounding the creation of the contracts and contract clause represented and warranted that the forest service had taken adequate measures to protect sensitive species like the murrelet in designing the contracts,which created a triable issue of fact as to whether the suspensions were unreasonable in light of this warranty and representation.
section did not discharge the forest service duty to protect sensitive species,like the murrelet,in designing timber contracts.
scott i,fed.cl.at.
due to the remaining factual issue of reasonableness,the court of federal claims denied both parties summary judgment motions.the united states then filed a motion to reconsider the holding that did not discharge the forest service duties under nfma and nepa.on june,the court of federal claims granted the motion for reconsideration and vacated its initial decision in part,holding as follows 
section relieved the forest service of its duties under nfma and nepa to protect sensitive species,including the marbled murrelet,in designing timber contracts.
contract clause did not create a warranty or representation that adequate measures had been taken to protect sensitive species in designing the contracts.
the duration of the suspensions was not unreasonable.
scott ii,fed.cl.at.by vacating the decision in scott i to the extent it was inconsistent with scott ii,the court of federal claims essentially granted summary judgment to the united states that the suspensions did not breach any of the contracts.
in an amended complaint,scott sought expenses under the terms of the contracts,namely clauses and,even if no breach was found.on june,the court of federal claims issued an opinion regarding scott additional claims and held as follows 
the suspensions did not constitute a contract modification to provide additional protection for the murrelet giving rise to reimbursement of costs under contract clause.
scott is not entitled to recover sawmill overhead expenses as costs under contract clause.
a triable issue of fact exists as to whether scott can recover attorney fees and overhead for its own staff under contract clause.
scott iii,slip op.at.the parties entered a stipulation regarding attorney fees and overhead costs for scott own staff,thereby extinguishing the only triable issue of fact remaining.scott timely filed this appeal.this court has jurisdiction under a.

thus,in summary,this case presents for appeal six determinations by the court of federal claims,namely,that scott claims,which differ in form from those expressly made to the co,are not jurisdictionally barred,each of the eleven contracts provided the forest service with authority to suspend scott performance either expressly or impliedly,the duration of the suspensions was not unreasonable,the forest service did not warrant that no measures would be required to protect the marbled murrelet in the forest areas covered by the contracts,the suspensions did not constitute a modification giving rise to reimbursement under the contract provisions,and scott can not recover sawmill expenses because they are too remote and speculative.
jurisdiction 
as a preliminary issue,the united states contends that scott has raised new claims in this action that were not previously presented to the co under the requirements of the cda.specifically,the united states argues that scott original cda claims questioned broadly the authority of the forest service to suspend the contracts and the reasonableness of the duration of those suspensions.according to the united states,scott can not raise new claims,such as the clause warranty issue,the objections to forest service preparation and administration of the contracts,and the claims for reimbursement provided under contract terms.the united states asserts that those claims were not clearly and unequivocally presented to the.see reliance ins.united states.
an action brought before the court of federal claims under the cda must be based on the same claim previously presented to and denied by the contracting officer.cerberonics,united states,a.this standard,however,does not require ridged adherence to the exact language or structure of the original administrative cda claim.the court of federal claims correctly found that it had jurisdiction over scott claims in this case,because they arise from the same operative facts,claim essentially the same relief,and merely assert differing legal theories for that recovery.see scott i,fed.cl.at scott iii,slip op.at.this court know s of no requirement in the cda that a claim must be submitted in any particular form or use any particular wording.all that is required is that the contractor submit in writing to the contracting officer a clear and unequivocal statement that gives the contracting officer adequate notice of the basis and amount of the claim.contract cleaning,united states.in this case,scott gave the co clear notice of a purported breach of contract based on the prolonged and allegedly unauthorized suspensions.moreover scott sought from the co the same remedy sought from the trial court,namely consequential damages for the alleged breach.scott may have posed slightly different legal theories for the breach,but scott claim is essentially the same as presented to the.thus,scott claims in this case would not subvert the statutory purpose of requiring contractors first to submit their claims to the co to allow the co to receive and pass judgment on the contractor entire claim.croman united states,fed.cl.accordingly,this court affirms the court of federal claims finding of jurisdiction.
authority to suspend the contracts 
this court applies general rules of contract interpretation in cases where the united states is a party to the contract.see lockheed martin ir imaging,west.where,as in this case,the contract does not include ambiguous provisions,this court accords the contract terms their customary and accepted meaning.see alaska lumber pulp madigan.
the central issue in this case is whether the forest service had contractual authority to suspend operations under the contracts.the court of federal claims found express suspension authority in clause.both parties agree that clause supplies express authority.thus,the forest service had authority to unilaterally suspend operations under any contracts with the clause.this case focuses primarily on clauses and.the court of federal claims concluded that grants an implied authority to suspend operations,but does not.this court agrees that clause does not grant authority to suspend the contracts.however,this court disagrees that creates authority to suspend the contracts by implication.
clause permits contract term adjustments in three circumstances,one of which encompasses delays caused by acts of government.in a broad sense,the listing of the murrelet as a threatened species was an act of government.consequently,the forest service claims authority under this clause to delay scott operations.the language of clause,however,is contrary to the united states position.
in the first place,clause extends the contract performance when the purchaser experiences delay due to causes beyond the purchaser control.thus,this provision applies to situations,such as acts of god,floods,fires,and the like,that prevent the purchaser from performing.by its terms,this clause does not authorize the forest service to suspend the purchaser performance.
as the court of federal claims correctly noted,clause merely contemplate s the possibility that the government might delay scott performance of the contracts but does not provide authority for the forest service to unilaterally suspend the contracts.scott i,fed.cl.at.subsection a of clause refers to events that directly prevent the contractor from performing the contract,rather than events that induce the forest service to choose to suspend the contractor performance.clause a refers to acts of god,acts of the public enemy,acts of government,labor disputes,fires,insurrections or floods.the listing of the murrelet was not an intervening act that itself directly prevented scott from performing under the contracts,such as a volcanic eruption that destroyed all the timber act of god,or a labor dispute,or a flood or other events referenced in this section.rather,when the listing action occurred,scott continued to perform.the only act of government beyond the purchaser control that caused scott to experience delay was the forest service order to suspend.the forest service can not argue that its own suspension order was an act of government that authorized itself.thus clause,by its terms,does not apply to the forest service decision to suspend operations under the contracts.
in short,clause expresses a clear purpose in clear language.it operates to give the contractor a right to a contract term adjustment in certain circumstances identified in subsection a.it does not grant authority to the forest service to unilaterally suspend operations in order to create one of those circumstances.
with respect to clause,the court of federal claims held 
c lause implicitly granted the forest service authority to suspend the contracts for some reasonable amount of time to determine whether to cancel,modify,or go forward with the sale.any other interpretation would essentially render the forest service authority to modify or cancel a sale under clause meaningless,particularly in light of the forest service obligations under section of the esa to consult with fws.
scott i,fed.cl.at.to the contrary,by its express terms,does not grant authority to suspend operations under the contracts.the clause does not mention suspension at all.instead it provides authority to cancel or modify the contracts when required to protect threatened or endangered species.without any suspension authority,the authority to modify or cancel is not meaningless,as suggested by the court of federal claims.instead the forest service must cancel or modify the contracts to protect threatened species,which in turn,under the clause triggers a right to reimbursement.
the contract itself in clause expressly authorizes the forest service to suspend operations in the event of fire.thus the contract expressly authorizes suspension for some circumstances.interpreting this contract as an organic whole,according reasonable meaning to all of the contract terms,lockheed,at,the absence of suspension authority in clause must be read as the intent of the parties.this court must not presume to supply remedies the parties did not provide each other by contract,particularly where the contract shows that the remedies were within the contemplation of both parties at the time of contracting.
even if clause is ambiguous with regard to suspension authority,the evidence in this case clearly shows that clause does not grant the forest service authority to unilaterally suspend operations under the contract.a principal objective in deciding what contractual language means is to discern the parties intent at the time the contract was signed.winstar,at citing arizona united states.this court notes record evidence that shows the forest service in the past had always sought mutual consent for suspensions of timber sales contracts without ever referring to clause.
the addition of clause is further evidence that the parties did not consider clause to provide authority to suspend operations.in timber sales contracts began to include clause.a former contract administration specialist for the forest service,the individual who initially drafted clause,testified that prior to the addition of clause,it was at best vague whether or not the contracts provided authority to suspend operations for environmental concerns.clause provided such authority,because the forest service believed unilaterally suspending operations prior to could create some liability for the government.in relying on clause as one of many indications that does not include suspension authority,this court is aware of mason united states,which
