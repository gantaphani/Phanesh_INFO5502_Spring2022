order withdrawing opinion and opinion 
this court opinion filed on august,and published at cir,is withdrawn and replaced by the attached opinion.
no further petitions for rehearing or petitions for rehearing en banc may be filed.
in,collectively,the hales purchased acres of land near mccarthy,alaska.their property is completely surrounded by the.elias national park and preserve the park,which was created in.the hales gain access to their property over what used to be the butte road the mgb road.in,the alaska road commission listed the mgb road as abandoned.all of its bridges have washed away,and the effects of vegetation and erosion have reduced it to little more than a trail.whatever qualities the route presently has is due to the hales clearing activities.the primary use of the trail by the plaintiffs has,until recently,been on.
the house on the hales property burned down in the spring of.during the course of rebuilding,the hales used a bulldozer to bring in supplies over the mgb road without first seeking authorization from the national park service nps.shortly thereafter,the nps posted a public notice stating that no motorized vehicles except snow machines could use the mgb road.in july,the hales contacted the nps superintendent to request a permanent permit to traverse the mgb road with a or bulldozer towing a sixteen foot trailer.the bulldozer used would weigh between and pounds,and would be between and feet wide.the trailer used would weigh,with supplies,between and pounds,and would be feet wide.the superintendent responded promptly,offering to assist the hales in preparing the necessary applications for a permit.two months later,in september,the hales submitted an emergency application for a temporary permit,asserting that they needed to transfer supplies before freeze up.
the nps promptly responded by letter,requesting more information about the nature of the emergency and the proposed bulldozer use.in particular,the letter articulated the nps concern that the hales were planning to run the bulldozer over the route before freeze up.the nps noted that other inholders in the park had been able to adapt to the winter schedule for freighting supplies and building materials,using bulldozers for access in the winter months that is,after freeze up when the frozen ground and snow cover protected the earth from extensive damage.the nps explained that t ravel over unfrozen ground causes significantly more damage,and that because such travel falls outside of any environmental assessment previously undertaken by the park,the hales permit request will required sic a more extensive review under the national environmental policy act nepa 
the hales responded in writing,but did not provide all of the requested information.the nps then informed the hales in a letter that an environmental assessment ea would be required before the agency could grant a permit for bulldozer use.the nps explained that it did not regard the situation as falling within the emergency exception to the requirements of the national environmental policy act nepa,as set out in.in the same letter,the nps expressed concern that the hales requested trips would entail a total of about crossings of mccarthy creek,a stream with a native dolly varden trout population.the hales own expert later acknowledged that there could be damage to the environment,including having to scrape down to the mineral soil in one section of the road and using blade engagement to redistribute some of the sloughed material on the existing road surface in another section.
in a series of contacts in september and october,the nps offered to prepare an ea and make a decision in approximately nine weeks.it also offered to waive the expense of conducting the ea.however,the hales did not provide the information the nps requested in order to conduct the ea.instead,in november,they filed this suit.they sought an injunction requiring the nps to provide what they deemed adequate and feasible access to their property,and a declaratory judgment that the nps was violating their over the mgb road by requiring a permit.they also sought a declaratory judgment that issuing a permit for use of the mgb road did not constitute a major federal action subject to the requirements of nepa.the hales moved for a temporary restraining order tro and a preliminary injunction.
the district court denied the motion for the tro and dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the court held that even if the hales had a valid over the mgb road,their use of the road was subject to reasonable regulation by the nps.consequently,the hales were required to apply for a permit,regardless of any they might possess.since the nps had not acted on the hales permit application,the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction under the administrative procedure act,because there was no final agency action to review.
the hales timely appealed.
jurisdiction 
we review de novo dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.kaiser blue cross of,cir.
the administrative procedure act provides for judicial review only of a gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.the supreme court has explained that 
a s a general matter,two conditions must be satisfied for agency action to be final first,the action must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.and second,the action must be one by which rights and obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow.

even if a particular agency action does not,on its own,satisfy the principle of finality,the collateral order doctrine may nevertheless preserve jurisdiction.under the collateral order doctrine,a small class of orders that do not end the proceedings below is treated as final and immediately appealable.cohen beneficial indus.loan.to come within this small class,the order must conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,d.
the collateral order doctrine arose as a practical construction of,which requires that appellate courts review only final decisions of district courts.see digital equip.desktop direct,d.however,the doctrine also applies to judicial review of administrative proceedings.see,ftc standard oil,d applying the doctrine to determine the reviewability of an agency order rhode island epa,cir discussing the circuit consensus that the collateral order doctrine applies to administrative determinations.
the alaska national interest lands conservation act anilca provides limited access rights for inholders such as the hales.the statute provides,
notwithstanding any other provisions of this act or other law the state or private owner or occupier shall be given by the secretary such rights as may be necessary to assure adequate and feasible access for economic and other purposes to the concerned land such rights shall be subject to reasonable regulations issued by the secretary to protect the natural and other values of such lands.
b.the hales contend that the guarantee of adequate and feasible access under anilca supersedes other laws,including nepa,and thus it is unreasonable for the nps,acting on behalf of the secretary of the department of the interior,to subject their permit request to any nepa analysis.framed this way,the hales complaint does not challenge
