san luis obispo county 
consistent with the laudable goal of safeguarding the public health,the trial court stretched to find a dictionary definition of the word contrivance to describe a state park.as justice oliver wendall holmes said a word is not a crystal,transparent and unchanged it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.see almar limited county of ventura th.this appeal turns on the meaning of the word contrivance,at.neither the trial court nor an appellate court is at liberty to pick a dictionary definition to reach a desired result see people arno d,fn.as we shall explain,the rule of ejusdem generis requires that in the context of construing health and safety code section subdivision a a state park is not a contrivance.thus,the trial court erroneously ruled that a local air pollution control district has the power to regulate air emissions emanating from a state park by a permit requirement.
friends of oceano dunes,a california corporation and voluntary association,appeals the dismissal of its writ of mandate petition code civ,and complaint for relief.appellant contends that the san luis obispo county air pollution control district district exceeded its authority in adopting rule of regulation x,fugitive dust emission standards limitation and prohibitions rule,which requires that the california department of parks and recreation obtain an air emissions permit to operate the oceano dunes states vehicular recreation area.the trial court found that health and safety code section subdivision a authorized district to impose a permit system to regulate sand and dust emissions caused by recreational vehicles using the state park 
air pollution regulation 
two statutory schemes regulate air quality in california the federal clean air act et and the california clean air act et.see california.industry san joaquin valley air pollution control dist.th.under the federal clean air act,the environmental protection agency epa sets national air quality standards for the maximum allowable concentration of a given pollutant.ibid.each state has the primary responsibility for assuring air quality within its geographic area.ibid.
under the california clean air act,the california air resources board carb is charged with developing a state implementation plan to ensure compliance with federal air quality standards.carb is solely responsible for vehicular sources of air pollution.local and regional air pollution control districts have the primary responsibility of controlling air pollution from all sources other than vehicular sources.ibid.section subdivision a provides every district board may establish by regulation,a permit system that requires that before any person builds,erects,alters,replaces,operates,or uses any article,machine,equipment,or other contrivance which may cause the issuance of air contaminants,the person obtain a permit to do so from the air pollution control officer of the district.
at issue is whether district is statutorily authorized to regulate the operation of the oceano dunes state vehicular recreational area svra,a acre recreational park consisting of natural beach and sand dunes.svra,formerly known as the pismo dunes state vehicular area,was created in for dune buggies and recreational vehicles.sierra club department of parks recreation th.approximately acres of the park are closed to motorized recreation and managed as native habitat.the svra hosts million visitors a year who camp,walk,fish,surf,and operate vehicles on the beach and sand dunes.operation of the svra is important to the state park system,to recreational vehicle communities,and to the local coastal economy.
rule regulation of dune vehicle activity areas 
after research groups determined that the svra was a contributing factor to elevated emissions,district conducted its own study and found that recreational vehicles and disturb the surface crust of sand dunes this disturbance increases the ability of winds to blow sand and dust inland to nipomo mesa.levels at nipomo mesa exceed state health standards approximately days a year,exposing residents to serious health risks.in response to the air emissions problem,district adopted rule entitled coastal dunes dust control requirements which applies to any operator of a coastal dune vehicle activity area greater than acres in size.rule provides all facilities subject to this rule shall obtain a permit to operate from the air pollution control district paragraph c.
trial court ruling 
appellant filed a petition for traditional writ of mandate and complaint for relief alleging that rule exceeds district statutory authority.california department of parks and recreation state parks was named as a real party in interest.denying the writ petition,the trial court concluded that section granted district authority to treat the svra as a direct source of air pollution.the trial court found that a managed recreational facility is reasonably viewed as a contrivance devised by man,not something that occurs naturally,which causes the emissions of airborne particulate matter sand and dust from the dunes.
district argues that appellant lacks standing to prosecute the appeal because it is not prejudicially affected by the judgment.as a general rule,a party must be beneficially interested to seek a writ of mandate.code civ.save the plastic bag coalition city of manhattan beach cal th.the beneficial interest must be direct and substantial,at.the trial court found that appellant has a beneficial interest in the operation of the svra and standing to bring the action.we concur.the continued operation of the svra directly affects appellant and its members who have an interest in ensuring that district does not eliminate or restrict vehicle recreation.
the public interest exception also confers standing where the question is one of an important public right and the object of the action is to enforce a public duty.save the plastic bag coalition v city of manhattan beach,supra,cal th at corporate plaintiff can have both public interest and beneficial interest standing where the challenged rule has a severe and immediate effect on member activities.the interpretation and scope of section is a matter of general public interest that affects a broad swath of recreational park users and air pollution control districts.see,watershed enforcers v,department of water resources th.santa barbara county air pollution control district,in its amicus brief,concedes that the appeal presents an important issue of statutory interpretation affecting the permit authority of all california air pollution co
