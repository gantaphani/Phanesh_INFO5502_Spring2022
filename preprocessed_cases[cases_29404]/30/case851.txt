we must decide whether the decisions of two federal agencies approving the construction of a business park on protected wetlands in california were arbitrary and capricious.
we begin by setting forth the relevant framework of the two federal statutes at the center of this appeal the clean water act cwa,et,and the endangered species act esa,et.
congress enacted the cwa to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.a.under and of the act,and,any discharge of dredged or fill materials into navigable waters defined as the waters of the united states is forbidden unless authorized by a permit issued by the army corps of engineers pursuant to.united states riverside bayview homes.the supreme court has upheld as reasonable the corps interpretation of the cwa to require permits for the discharge of fill material into wetlands adjacent to the waters of the united states.id.at see also rapanos united states,plurality opinion o nly those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are waters of the united states in their own right,so that there is no clear demarcation between waters and wetlands,are adjacent to such waters and covered by the act.
the corps may issue a permit pursuant to section of the cwa only if conditions set forth in regulations developed by the corps and the environmental protection agency epa are met.see b.these implementing regulations provide that no discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if there is a practicable alternative to the proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem,so long as the alternative does not have other significant adverse environmental consequences.a.under the regulations,a n alternative is practicable if it is available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost,existing technology,and logistics in light of overall project purposes.id.a.if a proposed activity does not require access or proximity to or siting within the special aquatic site in question to fulfill its basic purpose,is not water dependent,practicable alternatives that do not involve special aquatic sites are presumed to be available,unless clearly demonstrated otherwise.id.a.
the esa directs the secretaries of commerce and the interior to determine whether any species is endangered or threatened,a,and to designate any habitat of such species which is considered to be critical habitat,id.a a i.under the esa,a species critical habitat includes areas occupied by the species that are essential to the conservation of the species and that may require special management considerations or protection.id.a i.it also includes areas not occupied by the species that are nonetheless essential to the species conservation.id.a ii.
section of the esa prescribes the steps that federal agencies must take to ensure that their actions do not jeopardize endangered wildlife and flora.ass of home builders defenders of wildlife.section a provides specifically that 
each federal agency shall,in consultation with and with the assistance of the secretary of commerce or the interior,insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the secretary to be critical 
a.the esa requires the secretary to provide at the conclusion of consultation a written statement setting forth the secretary opinion,and a summary of the information on which the opinion is based,detailing how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.id.b a see h.
with the relevant statutory and regulatory framework in mind,we turn now to the facts of this case.
after years of researching potential sites for economic development,the city of redding,california,decided to construct a business park on a site located on wetlands along stillwater creek,and started to draft an environmental impact statement eis.the proposed site contains critical habitat for several species under the jurisdiction of the secretary of the interior,including the threatened vernal pool fairy shrimp,the endangered vernal pool tadpole shrimp,and the threatened slender orcutt grass.these species occupy the site vernal depressions that fill with rainwater in the fall and winter and then dry up in the spring.final designation of critical habitat for four vernal pool crustaceans and eleven vernal pool plants in california and southern oregon.their critical habitat also consists of unoccupied upland areas that serve as important sources of nutrients in the vernal pool ecosystem.id.
with an eye to satisfying the conditions of both the cwa and the esa,the city issued a draft eis regarding the proposed development of the stillwater business park in february.the draft eis served as a precursor to the city eventual application for a section permit,which the city was required to obtain because the proposed development would entail the discharge of dredged or fill material into protected wetlands.the document also served to address the effects of the proposed development on species,which the city was required to protect because the project would involve the expenditure of federal grant money.
based on a comparison of over a dozen potential sites,the draft eis concluded that the stillwater site was the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative.in support of this conclusion,the draft eis explained that the proposed stillwater site was responsive to the basic purpose of the city project to increase the activity of contributory economic sectors by constructing a business park within the city sphere of influence capable of attracting and accommodating diverse business and industrial users.according to the draft eis,accomplishing this purpose required a site large enough to accommodate at least one parcel,and the proposed stillwater site satisfied this requirement.
the draft eis further explained that the proposed stillwater site met various cost,technological,and logistical feasibility criteria.it stated,for example,that the proposed site was available for acquisition that it did not result in adverse social or economic effects on existing development that it was capable of being served by city utilities and that it did not entail unreasonable development costs.
finally,the draft eis concluded that the proposed stillwater site was the least environmentally damaging of the potential sites that satisfied both the project purpose and the feasibility criteria.the draft eis acknowledged that development of the proposed site would entail the construction of various buildings,bridges,roads,and paths,as well as the extension of water,sewer,electrical,and other utility lines.it maintained,however,that the proposed site would have less direct effects on the wetlands and the endangered and threatened species living there than the other leading sites under consideration.accordingly,the draft eis announced that the stillwater site was the city preferred location for a new business park.
the army corps of engineers reviewed and commented on the city draft eis.in a letter dated may,the corps stated that the city proposed stillwater site does not appear to be the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative,as there may be less environmentally damaging alternatives for this project alternatives that have fewer impacts to waters while still meeting the project purpose and need appear to exist.the corps argued that the screening criteria used for selecting practicable alternatives were too restrictive to determine a least environmentally damaging practicable alternative and eliminate reasonable alternatives such as alternative a site the city had rejected because a parcel could not be developed there without filling or altering an tributary.finally,the corps noted that f urther efforts to address and reduce direct,indirect,secondary and cumulative impacts within the preferred and alternative project sites appear to be practicable.
the epa made similar comments in april and june.like the corps,the epa questioned the city rejection of alternative,arguing that the city had not articulated a compelling need for a contiguous parcel as a centerpiece of the project.skeptical that a business park would be impracticable unless conceived as a single geographic entity,the epa urged the city to consider developing several smaller,disaggregated parcels instead of a single large one.
in september,the city issued a supplemental draft eis,which responded to comments on the original draft.in particular,the supplemental draft eis defended the city decision to reject potential sites that would be unable to support at least one parcel.it identified various potential users that required parcels of at least acres for their manufacturing and distribution needs,and clarified that the purpose of the project was to construct not just any business park,but a medium to large parcel business park.emphasis added.furthermore,the supplemental draft eis maintained that a park spread across several disaggregated parcels would not be desirable or conducive to the users expressing interest in the area,because such a park would lack the synergy made possible by a single,contiguous site.according to the supplemental draft eis,such synergy would result from c lose product availability,sharing of resources,and streamlining of business practices.
in addition,the supplemental draft eis reported that discussions with the resource agencies over the past several months resulted in modifications to the proposed stillwater site that reduced potential impacts to sensitive environmental resources.the city agreed,for instance,to modify the footprint of the proposed site to reduce impacts to waters of the to us e stormwater best management practices to minimize impacts to receiving waters and to designate acres of the site as permanent open space,where n o ground disturbance,bike paths,roads,will be allowed.according to the supplemental draft eis,these and other modifications reduced the direct wetland impacts of the proposed stillwater project from acres as reported in the draft eis to acres.they likewise reduced the direct impacts of the project on plants and crustaceans.
in november,the epa issued further comments in light of the supplemental draft eis.one of the epa remaining concerns was that the city analysis of the other alternative sites was not as detailed as its analysis of the preferred stillwater site.the epa was also concerned that the city had not developed an mitigation plan for unavoidable impacts to waters of the and endangered species.the epa thus urged the city to include such a plan in its final eis.
in february,the city published its final eis.in addition to compiling the city earlier responses to comments,the final eis devoted a section to addressing the epa most recent concerns.the city maintained that its discussion of alternative sites was sufficiently detailed,and directed the epa to specific portions of the draft and supplemental eiss.the city also highlighted its proposed compensatory mitigation to offset unavoidable adverse impacts to wetlands,streams,and other aquatic resources.compensatory mitigation for losses of aquatic resources.according to the final eis,compensatory mitigation would be achieved through and preservation of habitat in the open space area and other suitable areas,and would involve creation,restoration,and enhancement of wetland features.the final eis included a mitigation monitoring program to ensure the effective implementation and enforcement of adopted mitigation measures and permit conditions.
the city formally applied for a section permit in march,and the corps completed its evaluation of the city application in august.accepting that the overall project purpose was to construct a medium to large sized regional business park,the corps agreed that the city needed a single,contiguous site that could be divided into one acre parcel and numerous parcels ranging from to acres.the corps reviewed the alternative sites considered by the city,as well as one additional as the mitchell site,located directly north of the stillwater the city had not considered.based on its review,the corps determined that the proposed stillwater site would have acres of direct impact,and acres of indirect impact,on waters of the united states.nevertheless,the corps concluded that the proposed stillwater site was the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative in the corps view,the city had clearly demonstrated that there are no practicable alternative sites available,including no practicable alternatives having less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem.the corps further concluded that issuance of a section permit would not be contrary to the public interest.accordingly,the corps granted the city application.
the corps was not the only federal agency whose approval the city required.section of the esa required consultation with the fish and wildlife service fws,which administers the esa with respect to species under the jurisdiction of the secretary of the interior.home builders,at.the city initiated formal consultation with the fws in october.
in december,the fws issued a written biological opinion on the city proposed development of the stillwater site.in the opinion,the fws reviewed the current status of the species and their critical habitat.it then evaluated the direct and indirect effects of the proposed action against an environmental baseline of all other past and present human activities in the area.for purposes of the opinion,the fws presumed that indirect effects would occur as the result of any proposed development within feet of the species known populations.the fws further evaluated what it called cumulative effects the effects of future state,tribal,local or private actions that are reasonably certain to occur in the action area.
based on its review,the fws determined that the proposed stillwater site contained acres of critical habitat shared by the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp.according to the fws,the proposed development would destroy acres of this critical habitat amounting to of the fairy shrimp acres of total critical habitat nationwide and of the tadpole shrimp acres of total critical habitat nationwide.the fws also determined that the proposed development would directly affect acres,and indirectly affect acres,of the crustaceans aquatic habitat.the fws noted,however,that the city proposed to offset these effects by creating or restoring acres of aquatic habitat,and preserving another acres,at other locations.
as for the threatened slender orcutt grass,the fws reported that the proposed site contained acres of the plant critical habitat,of which acres amounting to of the plant acres of total critical habitat nationwide would be destroyed.according to the fws,the proposed development would also directly affect acres,and indirectly affect acres,of suitable grass habitat itself.the fws again noted,however,that the city promised to compensate for these losses by creating or restoring acres of suitable grass habitat and preserving another acres.
the fws acknowledged that the proposed project would contribute to a local and trend of habitat loss and degradation,and to the fragmentation and reduction of the acreage of the remaining listed vernal pool species habitat.nonetheless,the fws concluded that the stillwater business park project,as proposed,is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the vernal pool fairy shrimp,vernal pool tadpole shrimp,and slender orcutt grass.the fws further concluded that the proposed project would not result in the adverse modification or destruction of critical habitat for those species.
in june,butte environmental council,a nonprofit environmental organization,filed suit against the corps and the fws in federal district court.the council sought judicial review under the administrative procedure act apa,of the corps decision to issue a permit for the city proposed project and the fws biological opinion that the project would not adversely modify the critical habitat for endangered and threatened species.after the council amended its
