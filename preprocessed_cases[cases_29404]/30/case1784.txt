this case arises out of approval by the city of berkeley and berkeley city council collectively,city of use permits and zoning variances for a development project consisting of residential units and retail commercial space.appellants stephen wollmer and neighbors for a livable berkeley way wollmer appeal from a judgment denying their petition for writ of mandate seeking to overturn these approvals.they urge that the city approvals violated the state density bonus law,berkeley municipal code,and california environmental quality act pub.resources code,et ceqa.while we affirm in all respects,the published portion of this opinion addresses the interpretation and application of the density bonus law.
background 
the development project project at issue here,as approved,is a development that includes ground floor retail uses,including a proposed trader joe grocery store and residential units,located on approximately one acre at the northwest corner of university avenue and martin luther king.way in berkeley.of the residential units are reserved for low income households,and half of those units must be reserved for very low income households under certain circumstances.the project site is zoned,general commercial.
in,the project was proposed in its initial iteration.that year,real party in interest mlk,llc mlk submitted a development application to city for a commercial and residential project.in response to city comments and objections,various changes were made.in,mlk submitted a consolidated application for a development with residential units,as well as parking spaces and square feet of commercial floor area in the larger of the two buildings the city of berkeley zoning adjustments board zab reviewed the proposal and directed mlk to submit an alternative design addressing certain city and neighbor concerns,including parking,building height and massing,and useable open space.
in december,mlk submitted an alternative design which reduced the number of housing units to.the new design included square feet of commercial floor area and a total of residential and commercial parking spaces.during the hearing process before the zab in,mlk further revised its application,reducing the number of residential units to on december,the zab held a final hearing and on january,approved the project subject to certain conditions.wollmer appealed the zab decision to the berkeley city council.
following a public hearing on july,the berkeley city council denied wollmer appeal,made findings from the evidentiary record,and approved the use permit for the project,again subject to certain conditions.city of berkeley res.as relevant here,the project as approved included adoption of a mitigated negative declaration mnd under ceqa an award of mandatory density bonus residential units under government code section,subdivisions b and g an additional discretionary authorization of density bonus residential units under government code section,subdivision n and berkeley municipal code section and provision for zoning variances from height and floor area ratio limitations berkeley,and from front yard setbacks requirements,along the abutting residential areas on the berkeley way boundary of the project.the mitigation conditions of the mnd included a requirement for full payment by mlk for a new traffic signal at the intersection of berkeley way and martin luther king.way,a traffic diverter,and a landscaped traffic barrier.
wollmer then filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the city approval of the project.the superior court denied the petition and entered judgment against wollmer on june.this timely appeal followed.wollmer did not seek interim injunctive relief,and the city and mlk represent that construction of the project is underway.
ii.discussion 
wollmer challenge focuses on three aspects of city approval of the project density bonus calculations,zoning variances granted,and adoption of an mnd rather than requiring a full environmental impact report eir under ceqa.

a city decision to rely on an mnd under ceqa is reviewed for abuse of discretion under the fair argument standard.ceqa requires preparation of an eir whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact.citations.thus,if substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument significant impacts or effects may occur,an eir is required and a negative declaration can not be certified.citation.citation.porterville citizens for responsible hillside development city of porterville th,d see also guidelines,subd.f if a lead agency is presented with a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the environment,the lead agency shall prepare an eir even though it may also be presented with other substantial evidence that the project will not have a significant effect.the fair argument standard is a low threshold test for requiring the preparation of an eir.citations.it is a question of law,not fact,whether a fair argument exists,and the courts owe no deference to the lead agency determination.review is de novo,with a preference for resolving doubts in favor of environmental review.citizens for responsible open government city of grand terrace th,d grand terrace quoting pocket protectors city of sacramento th,d pocket protectors.when a challenge is brought to an agency determination an eir is not required,the reviewing court function is to determine whether substantial evidence supported the agency conclusion as to whether the prescribed fair argument could be made.citation.stanislaus audubon society,county of stanislaus th,d.if such evidence exists,the reviewing court must set aside the agency decision to adopt a negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration as an abuse of discretion in failing to proceed in a manner as required by law.citation.grand terrace,supra,th at,d.

with these standards of review in mind,we address wollmer contentions.
b.the mandatory density bonus calculations under government code section 
wollmer first argues that the city improperly authorized additional bonus units to the project,in excess of what its own zoning ordinances and general plan would allow,by misapplying the density bonus law,in his view,the actual number of additional units mandated by the statute would be only units.he maintains that this purported miscalculation arose from an erroneous determination of the actual number of units in the base project.we disagree.
the purpose of the density bonus law is to encourage and provide incentives to developers to include low and moderate income housing units in their developments.in,the legislature added several provisions to the planning and zoning law et to address the shortage of affordable housing in california,subd.a citations.one of these statutes,section,offers incentives to developers to include low income housing in new construction projects.although application of the statute can be complicated,its aim is fairly simple when a developer agrees to construct a certain percentage of the units in a housing development for low or households,the city or county must grant the developer one or more itemized concessions and a density bonus,which allows the developer to increase the density of the development by a certain percentage above the maximum allowable limit under local zoning law.citation.in other words,the density bonus law reward s a developer who agrees to build a certain percentage of housing with the opportunity to build more residences than would otherwise be permitted by the applicable local regulations.shea homes limited partnership county of alameda th,d.lagoon valley,supra,th at,d see barclay,curtin california land use and planning law ed ch.
section provides for mandatory and discretionary density bonuses and set forth the requirements for each.when an applicant seeks a density bonus for a housing development that local government shall provide the applicant incentives or concessions for the production of housing units as prescribed in this section b a city shall grant one density bonus,the amount of which shall be as specified in subdivision g,and incentives or concessions,as described in subdivision d,when an applicant for a housing development seeks and agrees to construct a housing development,excluding any units permitted by the density bonus awarded pursuant to this section,that will contain at least any one of the following a ten percent of the total units of a housing development for lower income households,subds.a b a,italics added.the density bonus provided under the statute increases with the percentage and type of low income housing units to be built,with the bonus ranging from a low of percent to a maximum of percent,subd.g.where percent of the base project consists of low income housing units a developer must receive a percent density bonus.ibid.
the base number of units in the project is obviously critical to calculation of the density bonus mandated by the statute.the city defined the base project as consisting of the retail space with residential units on the second and third floors.the low income units provided by the developer would equal percent of that number,requiring the city to grant at least a percent density bonus under section,subdivision g,and accordingly provide for a minimum density bonus of units.wollmer claims the base project actually consisted of units the original plus units allowed by the city as an additional discretionary density bonus under section,subdivision n,and that the low income units included in the project therefore comprised only percent of the actual base project so calculated,failing to meet the percent statutory threshold for the maximum allowance.wollmer calculation would entitle mlk to a mandatory density bonus of only percent rather than percent,and consequently bonus units rather than awarded by the city.
there are a number of difficulties with wollmer argument.the first and most apparent is the inconsistency in application of his arithmetic calculations.although he insists that the base project must be considered as units,he nevertheless arrives at his purported maximum number of required bonus units by first measuring the low income units against this larger total to arrive at the percent figure then applying the resulting percent entitlement against base units,not.using his percent assumption against the units that he argues must be considered as the base project,the resulting density bonus would be more than the city awarded.
wollmer position also is inconsistent with provisions of the density bonus law.the statute specifically excludes from the base development any units permitted by the density bonus awarded pursuant to this section,subd.b.in addition to mandating density bonuses based on the percentage of housing units,section also provides that nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a city from granting a density bonus greater than what is described in this section for a development that meets the requirements of this section,subd.n.
while wollmer acknowledges this provision,he claims that it applies only to mandated bonus units,and that extra units such as the involved here granted locally without an ordinance emphasis omitted are not excluded from the base project.this,he asserts,is because the extra units were only authorized by,not awarded pursuant to,section,and were not awarded pursuant to any local ordinance but granted on an ad hoc basis.he provides no authority for his position,and recently our colleagues in division three of this district in lagoon valley,supra,th,d,found arguments similar to those wollmer advances here to be contrary to the intent and spirit of the density bonus law,which is designed to encourage,even require,incentives to developers that construct affordable housing.id.at,d.
i n our view the language of section is clear and unambiguous.if a developer agrees to dedicate a certain percentage of the overall units in a development to affordable or senior housing,the density bonus law requires the municipality to grant the developer a density bonus of at least a certain percentage,ranging from a low of percent for housing or percent for senior and all other affordable housing to a maximum of percent,depending on the number of units provided over the minimum number necessary to qualify for a bonus,subd.g.because the statute imposes a mandatory duty on local governments,and provides a means for developers to enforce this duty through civil proceedings,subd.d,it is clear that percent represents the maximum amount of bonus a city is required to provide,not the maximum amount a developer can ever obtain.the entire aim of section is to provide incentives to developers to construct housing for seniors and families.see stats,ch,legislative findings and declarations supporting enactment of.it would undermine this policy to interpret subdivision g as imposing an absolute cap 
the plain language of subdivision n also supports our interpretation because it clearly states that section may not be construed to prohibit a local government from granting a larger density bonus than is provided for in the density bonus law.nevertheless,appellant argues subdivision n applies only when a municipality enacts an ordinance to provide a higher density bonus.thus,appellant insists,the density bonus awarded here violated section because the city did not grant it by way of an ordinance.nothing in the density bonus law suggests that a municipality must enact an ordinance any time it wishes to provide more of a densi
