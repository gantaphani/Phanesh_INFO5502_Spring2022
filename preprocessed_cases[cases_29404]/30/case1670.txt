in,the city of santa cruz city sought to protect its urban forest by adopting the heritage tree ordinance,which governs the protection of large trees and trees having other significance.the city later adopted the heritage tree removal resolution,which governs the removal of heritage trees.in,the city amended its heritage tree ordinance and heritage tree removal resolution.the city concluded that these amendments the project were categorically exempt from the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et because they assured the maintenance,restoration,enhancement,and protection of natural resources and the environment.
plaintiff save our big trees contends the amendments weakened existing heritage tree protections such that the project is not exempt from ceqa.plaintiff sought a writ of mandate directing the city to set aside its amendments for failure to comply with ceqa.plaintiff appeals from a judgment denying its writ petition.
we find the city had the burden to demonstrate with substantial evidence that the project falls within a categorical exemption to ceqa.the city failed to meet that burden.therefore,we reverse and direct the trial court to issue a writ of mandate requiring the city to set aside the amendments to the heritage tree ordinance and heritage tree removal resolution.
factual and procedural background 
a.the heritage tree ordinance 
protection of heritage trees in the city began with the adoption of the heritage tree ordinance,which established a permit process governing the preservation of heritage trees.in,the heritage tree ordinance defined heritage tree to mean a tree which has a trunk with a circumference of fifty inches or more measured at inches above natural grade or a tree or grove of trees designated by resolution of the city council to be of special historical value or of significant community benefit.
in,the heritage tree ordinance protections were extended to heritage shrub,and heritage tree was redefined to include those trees with horticultural significance and those providing a valuable habitat.later,heritage tree was again redefined as a tree growing on public or private property within the city limits if its trunk had a circumference of at least inches it had historical significance for reasons including but not limited to the fact that it was commemorative,planted during a particularly significant historical era,or marked the spot of a historical event or it had horticultural significance for reasons including but not limited to the fact that it was u nusually beautiful or distinctive,relatively old,of distinctive size or structure,a rare or unusual species for the area,provided a valuable habitat,or had been i dentified by the city council as having significant arboricultural value to the citizens of the city.
b.the heritage tree removal resolution 
in,the city adopted the heritage tree removal resolution resolution no.ns,which established the only circumstances in which a heritage tree or shrub could be altered or removed.those circumstances were the heritage tree or heritage shrub has,or is likely to have,an adverse effect upon the structural integrity of a building,utility,or public or private right of way the physical condition or health of the tree or shrub,such as disease or infestation,warrants alteration or removal or a construction project design can not be altered to accommodate existing heritage trees or shrubs.
c.the project 
on october,the city council approved amendments to the heritage tree ordinance ordinance.the city council also adopted amendments to the heritage tree removal resolution resolution no.ns we refer to these actions collectively as the project,as the parties agree the revisions constitute a project to which ceqa applies unless it is exempt.see san lorenzo valley community advocates for responsible education san lorenzo valley unified school dist.th,san lorenzo.
the heritage tree ordinance amendments 
the city amended the heritage tree ordinance in various ways,including the addition of a purpose section.among other things,that section states that the purpose of the heritage tree ordinance is to recognize,protect,optimize and responsibly manage the community urban forest.it also identifies ways in which trees contribute beneficially to the urban environment and to the state climate action goals,including by reduc ing heat buildup,noise and air pollutants improv ing air quality,reduc ing particulates,provid ing oxygen and providing erosion control.
as amended,the heritage tree ordinance section requires the establishment of replanting requirements and deadlines for heritage tree alterations and removals.the prior version of the heritage tree ordinance required the establishment of more general mitigation requirements and did not mention deadlines.
the heritage tree ordinance amendments revised the definition of heritage tree in a number of ways,three of which are relevant here.first,the amendments eliminated references to and protection of shrubs.second,the amendments provided trees can acquire the heritage designation because of their historical significance only if designated by city council resolution as having historical significance,or listed on an approved city area planning document or designated for protection through an approved zoning entitlement.third,the amendments provided trees can acquire the heritage designation because of their horticultural significance only if designated by city council resolution as having horticultural significance.
the prior heritage tree ordinance section prohibited property owners from allowing specified conditions to exist because they may be harmful to heritage trees.the amendments added a new prohibited condition p hysically damaging any heritage tree by way of topping,girdling,root loss,or poisoning of the heritage tree,or any action which may cause death,destruction or injury to the heritage tree or which places the heritage tree in a hazardous condition or in an irreversible state of decline.
the amendments also enacted various revisions to the heritage tree ordinance penalty provisions section,including the addition of a provision allowing the city to deny a property owner who has violated the heritage tree ordinance any development approval or permit until all penalty fines and damages related to the violation are paid and replanting requirements are fulfilled.
the heritage tree removal resolution amendments 
the city amended the heritage tree removal resolution standards for the alteration or removal of heritage trees in two relevant ways.
first,it removed the provision allowing for removal of a heritage tree that has,or is likely to have,an adverse effect upon the structural integrity of a building,utility,or public or private right of way and replaced it with a provision allowing for removal of a heritage tree that has created or is likely to create an unreasonable and substantial hardship for a public or private property owner,such as excessive degradation or damage to real property,an unreasonable financial or economic burden,or an adverse effect on personal health such as allergies or physical mobility.
second,the city introduced additional circumstances under which heritage invasive trees may be removed.the amended hertiage tree ordinance defines invasive species as any blue gum eucalyptus or acacia species growing within the city limits of santa cruz.under the amended heritage tree removal resolution,two or more invasive heritage trees growing on a single parcel outside of a biotic resource area may be removed if i removal is required for defensible space clearance ii the trees are poorly structured or overcrowded iii the tree s are likely to cause personal injury or an unreasonable and substantial hardship for a public or private property owner or iv the trees are likely to be invasive and outcompete native vegetation.two or more invasive heritage trees growing on a single parcel inside of a biotic resource area may be removed if one of those four circumstances is satisfied and a qualified biologist confirms that removal or significant alteration will not adversely impact or degrade existing habit.
administrative proceedings 
the city parks and recreation commission the commission began considering changes to the heritage tree ordinance after the position of urban forester was reduced from a position to a position in early.with the goal of reducing the urban forester workload,the parks and recreation staff staff recommended excluding from the heritage tree ordinance heritage shrubs and invasive species blue gum eucalyptus and acacia living outside the biotic resource area.the commission created a subcommittee to consider amendments to the heritage tree ordinance.
in addition to excluding invasive species living outside the biotic resource areas from the heritage tree ordinance,the subcommittee recommended eliminating or revising the provisions designating trees with historical or horticultural significance as heritage trees.the latter recommendation was based on the subcommittee view that those subdivisions were subjective.staff opposed the latter recommendation and opined that t he change would trigger a need for further review and approvals including ceqa and an environmental determination.the subcommittee proposed revisions were discussed at a may commission meeting.at that meeting,the city fire chief spoke in support of excluding invasive species from the heritage tree ordinance due to the fire hazard those species pose.
the commission considered revising the heritage tree ordinance at two additional meetings in it next addressed the issue in november.at that time,staff opined that the proposed exclusion of invasive species living outside biotic resource areas from the heritage tree ordinance would trigger significant environmental review and possibly an eir environmental impact report.
in june,staff informed the commission it would cost to perform a defensible environmental review of the proposal to exclude invasive trees from the heritage tree ordinance because the city would need to determine the number of trees that could hypothetically be removed.staff recommended the commission not move forward with the proposed exclusion of invasive species from the heritage tree ordinance.the commission disagreed,electing to retain the proposed provision excluding invasive species from the heritage tree ordinance definition of heritage tree.
accordingly,staff devised what it described as an alternative approach to include the removal of heritage size invasive species that satisfies environmental review requirements.rather than excluding invasive trees from the definition of heritage trees in the heritage tree ordinance,staff proposed amending the heritage tree removal resolution to allow for the removal of invasive heritage trees growing outside biotic resource areas and those growing inside biotic resource areas with confirmation from a qualified biologist that removal would not adversely impact or degrade existing habitats.staff also proposed amending the heritage tree removal resolution to permit the removal of a heritage tree that has created or is likely to create an unreasonable and substantial hardship for a private property owner such as,excessive degradation or damage to real property,an unreasonable financial or economic burden,or an adverse effect on personal health such as allergies or physical mobility.staff characterized the later proposed revision as giving commissions and city council increased discretion.
staff concluded that,as modified,the project was exempt from ceqa under the categorical exemptions set forth in sections and of the ceqa guidelines guidelines those exemptions apply to actions taken to assure the maintenance,restoration,or enhancement of a natural resource or the environment.ceqa guidelines.in support of that conclusion,staff noted that while the proposed revisions to the heritage tree removal resolution may allow for the removal of additional trees,they would not necessarily have the potential for causing a cumulative impact or significant effect on the environment because t he city is not requiring the removal of invasive tree species,and removing large trees is frequently financially limiting such that it is unlikely that the probability of large numbers of trees being removed would increase.
on january,the commission voted to recommend the proposed heritage tree ordinance amendments and the heritage tree removal resolution amendments to the city council.
the city council considered the project at its september,meeting.at that meeting,the city urban forester explained that blue gum eucalyptus and acacia trees are considered invasive because t hey can out compete native habitats,and they are very prolific about propagating.she also noted that those species can contribute to dangerous fire conditions because of the fuel load that produced by these trees,the rate of growth,the fact that the embers can smolder on the leaves and start new fires.members of the public spoke at the meeting,including an individual representing plaintiff,who argued ceqa review was necessary.those who opposed the project largely expressed the view that it would be too easy to cut down heritage trees under the proposed revised scheme.they said blue gum eucalyptus trees benefit the environment by serving as wind breaks providing habitats for butterflies,birds,and other wildlife and removing carbon dioxide from the air.those who spoke in favor of the project addressed their desire to remove blue gum eucalyptus trees because they crowd out native plants and trees and generate a significant amount of debris,making them difficult to maintain and a fire hazard.the fire chief spoke about the fire danger associated with eucalyptus trees.he explained that t he big issues with the eucalyptus are the litter and the volume of litter beneath the tree that does get cleaned up.and when that catches fire,it burns very hot,and it very oily.with respect to defensible space,the fire chief explained that the concern generally is not with removing trees but with cleaning out the undergrowth.
also on september,counsel representing plaintiff sent the city council a letter arguing the project was not exempt from ceqa and a letter from travis longcore,a geographer,ecologist,and professor of bioresource management,environmental impact analysis,field ecology,and environmental science.in his letter to the city council,longcore opined that the project would result in the removal of trees and shrubs,which could lead to the destruction of bird nests and could impact storm water runoff,carbon sequestration,and energy consumption.he also noted that eucalyptus trees provide a habitat for butterflies and birds.
at an october,meeting,the city council again considered the project.staff presented three options for amending the heritage tree removal resolution.option was staff original proposal.it included changing the restrictions for invasive trees and a damage or a hardship clause permitting the removal of a heritage tree that has created,or is likely to create an unreasonable and substantial hardship for private property owners such as excessive damage or degradation of property,unreasonable financial or economic burden,or an adverse effect on personal health such as allergies and physical mobility.option was almost identical to the existing policy,but was a little bit broader,according to the urban forester.it did not include the additional criteria allowing for the removal of invasive trees,so blue gum and acacia would be treated as any other heritage tree,and it did not allow for the removal of a heritage tree based on unreasonable financial or economic burden.option,described as a compromise between options and,included the additional criteria allowing for the removal of invasive trees,but did not allow for heritage tree removal due to unreasonable financial or economic burden.
with respect to the ceqa issue,one councilmember,who ultimately voted against the project,stated i guess what i thinking about this is that it a weird sort of circular thing because for me,the only reason to change the ordinance is to allow people to cut down trees more,you know,if we want to prioritize human uses,whether it allergies,or protecting property,or whatever.and i think that a reasonable thing to do.i mean,you know,that a reasonable judgment call on the part of the council and the community.but then i understand that if we allowing more people to cut down more trees,that we in trouble with the environmental quality act.so,you know,i feel kind of stuck.
the city council approved the heritage tree ordinance amendments and option for amending the heritage tree removal resolution.the city council adopted and approved staff determination that the project was exempt from ceqa.
the city filed a notice of exemption from ceqa on october.
judicial proceedings 
plaintiff filed a petition for writ of mandate on november.the trial court denied the petition,ruling that substantial evidence supported the city council determination that the project was exempt under ceqa guidelines sections and,and entered judgment in favor of the city.plaintiff timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
overview of ceqa 
t he overriding purpose of ceqa is to ensure that agencies regulating activities that may affect the quality of the environment give primary consideration to preventing environmental damage.save our carmel river monterey peninsula water management dist.th.the statute and its implementing regulations,the ceqa guidelines,prescribe review procedures a public agency must follow before approving or carrying out certain projects.berkeley hillside preservation city of berkeley cal th,berkeley.
ceqa review procedures can be viewed as a process.san lorenzo,supra,th at.the first tier requires an agency to conduct a preliminary review to determine whether ceqa applies to a proposed project.ibid.if ceqa applies,the agency must proceed to the second tier of the process by conducting an initial study of the project.id.at.among the purposes of the initial study is to help to inform the choice between a negative declaration and an environmental impact report eir.ibid.if there is no substantial evidence that the project or any of its aspects may cause a significant effect on the environment,the agency prepares a negative declaration.guidelines,subd.b.alternatively,if the initial study identifies potential significant effects on the environment but revisions in the project plans would avoid the effects or mitigate the effects to a point where clearly no significant effect on the environment would occur and there is no substantial evidence that the project as revised may have a significant effect on the environment,a mitigated negative declaration may be used.architectural heritage county of monterey th.finally,if the initial study uncovers substantial evidence that any aspect of the project,either individually or cumulatively,may cause a significant effect on the environment ceqa guidelines,subd.b,the agency must proceed to the third tier of the review process and prepare a full eir.san lorenzo,supra,at.
this case concerns the first tier of review whether the project is subject to ceqa review.several categories of projects are statutorily exempt from ceqa review for policy reasons.berkeley,supra,cal th at,citing,subd.b.other classes of projects are categorically exempt from ceqa review because the secretary of the natural resources agency has found they do not have a significant effect on the environment.berkeley,supra,cal th at ceqa guidelines,subd.a.
among the categorical exemptions is the class exemption for actions taken by regulatory agencies as authorized by state law or local ordinance to assure the maintenance,restoration,or enhancement of a natural resource where the regulatory process involves procedures for protection of the environment.ceqa guidelines.another categorical exemption,the class exemption,is very similar it exempts actions taken by regulatory agencies,as authorized by state or local ordinance,to assure the maintenance,restoration,enhancement,or protection of the environment where the regulatory process involves procedures for protection of the environment.
a categorical exemption can be relied on only if a factual evaluation of the agency proposed activity reveals that it applies.muzzy ranch solano county airport land use com.cal th.t he agency invoking the categorical exemption has the burden of demonstrating that substantial evidence supports its factual finding that the project fell within the exemption.ibid.
standard of review 
when faced with a challenge to an agency exemption determination,the court considers whether the agency proceeded in the manner required by law and whether its determination is supported by substantial evidence.san lorenzo,supra,th at.the interpretation of an exemption presents a question of law subject to our independent review.id.at.but the substantial evidence test governs our review of the agency factual determination that a project falls within a categorical exemption.id.at.
in the ceqa context,substantial evidence means enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion,even though other conclusions might also be reached.ceqa guidelines,subd.a.substantial evidence includes facts,reasonable assumptions predicated upon facts,and expert opinion supported by facts,subd.b,but not a rgument,speculation,unsubstantiated opinion or narrative,evidence which is clearly erroneous or inaccurate,or evidence of social or economic impacts which do not contribute to or are not caused by physical impacts on the environment,subd.a.
c.the scope of the class and class exemptions 
our first task is to independently interpret the class and class exemptions specifically,at issue here is the meaning of the phrase actions to assure the maintenance,restoration,or enhancement as it is used in those exemptions.
case law is instructive as to which actions fall within these exemptions,and which do not.the prohibition of an activity that evidence shows is associated with environmental problems,such as the contamination of farmland,constitutes an action to assure protection of the environment.magan county of kings th,ordinance phasing out the land application of sewage sludge fell within class exemption.by contrast,actions that remove existing wildlife protections,authorize and regulate hunting,or relax existing environmental safeguards do not assure the maintenance,restoration,or enhancement of the environment.see mountain lion foundation fish game com.cal th,mountain lion action that removes rather than secures protections of animal species does not fall within class or class exemption wildlife alive chickering cal d,chickering setting of hunting seasons does not fall within class exemption because such an action can not fairly or readily be characterized as a preservation activity in a strict sense international longshoremen warehousemen union board of supervisors d,international longshoremen amendment doubling the allowable emissions of gases the legislature has determined are dangerous substances did not fall within class or class exemption.
these legal guideposts indicate that,consistent with its plain language,the phrase actions to assure the maintenance,restoration,or enhancement embraces projects that combat environmental harm,but not those that diminish existing environmental protections.the parties acknowledge as much,recognizing that the project is exempt only if it does not weaken existing heritage tree protections.however,as discussed below,they dispute how this court should determine the project impact.
substantial evidence does not support the city determination that the project is categorically exempt from ceqa 
according to the city,we must look at the project as a whole to determine whether it will strengthen or weaken existing heritage tree protections.by contrast,plaintiff argues that if the project will have any unfavorable impact on a natural resource or the environment then it is not exempt,regardless of whether it will also have other,favorable impacts.
the ceqa guidelines definition of project as meaning the whole of an action appears to provide at least some support for the city view that only the project overall impact matters.ceqa guidelines.however,the city does not cite to that provision,nor to any other autho
