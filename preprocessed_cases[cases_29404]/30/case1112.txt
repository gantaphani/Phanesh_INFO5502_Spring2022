this appeal requires us to decide whether the secretary of commerce,acting through the national marine fisheries service nmfs,must provide notice and the opportunity for public comment before issuing specifications and management measures for the pacific coast groundfish fishery.
the natural resources defense council,nrdc and the center for marine conservation,challenged nmfs specifications and management measures for on the footing that they are subject to the notice and comment requirements of the fishery conservation and management act magnuson act,and the administrative procedure act apa,b c,but that no such opportunity was given.the district court ruled that notice and comment was required by the magnuson act,and prospectively by the apa because nmfs had not properly invoked the statutory exception allowing agencies to forgo this requirement upon a showing of good cause.the secretary of commerce,nmfs,and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration appeal.
we conclude that nmfs recitation of good cause in was inadequate to excuse compliance with the apa notice and comment requirement.as we have previously indicated,good cause requires some showing of exigency beyond generic complexity of data collection and time constraints notice and comment must interfere with the agency ability to fulfill its statutory mandate to manage the fishery.see riverbend farms,madigan,cir,united states dep t of agriculture,cir.given our determination that notice and comment was required under the apa for,we do not need to decide whether it was also required under the magnuson act.accordingly,we affirm the judgment in part and vacate in part.
in,congress enacted the magnuson act as a response to overfishing and inadequate conservation measures that were threatening future commercial and recreational fishing,as well as the survival of a number of species of fish.see a.among the purposes of the magnuson act are providing for fishery management plans which will achieve and maintain,on a continuing basis,the optimum yield from each fishery,b,and establishing regional fishery management councils to prepar e,monitor,and revis e such plans.b.the secretary of commerce secretary,acting through nmfs is responsible for reviewing fishery management plans fmps and amendments to the plans for consistency with ten national standards set forth in a and any other applicable law.a a.if approved,the secretary publishes notice of the fmp or amendment in the federal register and promulgates regulations implementing the plan after a statutory comment period.a.
likewise,the secretary is responsible for evaluating proposed regulations submitted by the regional councils for consistency with the accompanying fmp and any other applicable law,and must publish approved regulations in the federal register for a public comment period of to days before promulgating final regulations.b.the proposed regulations subject to this notice and comment provision are those which the council deems necessary or appropriate for the purposes of implementing a fishery management plan or plan amendment and making modifications to regulations implementing a fishery management plan or plan amendment.c.in addition,actions taken by nmfs constituting rulemaking under the apa are also subject to that statute notice and comment provision,unless they qualify for one of the exceptions contained in that provision.see defining rulemaking under the apa as agency process for formulating,amending,or repealing a rule.final regulations promulgated by the secretary,as well as actions that are taken by the secretary under regulations which implement a fishery management plan,are subject to judicial review.f.
in,nmfs issued informal guidelines for preparing framework fishery management plans and amendments framework fmps,claiming that the review and implementation process provided by the magnuson act and other requirements of law was often too slow for effective fishery management.as proposed by nmfs,framework fmps would contain instructions to enable the secretary to make such changes as are needed from time to time to manage the fishery in accordance with the fmp,while still providing for participation by the regional councils.
the pacific fishery management council pacific council is authorized to prepare plans for the fisheries off the coasts of washington,oregon,california,and idaho.a f.in,the pacific council proposed an amendment to the pacific coast groundfish fmp groundfish fmp adopting framework procedures amendment.nmfs subsequently approved the amendment,published it as a proposed rule,and,following the period for public comment,published the implementing regulations as a final rule in the federal register in january.see fed.reg,proposed rule fed.reg,final rule see also fed.reg.july,reorganizing these regulations.
the annual management cycle described by the groundfish fmp as modified by amendment consists of several steps taken in preparation for the next calendar year which begins on january.see.the pacific council first gathers information about the state of the fishery throughout the year,then holds a public meeting in september at which,based upon the best available stock assessment information and public comment,it develops preliminary recommendations applicable to the following year.after the first meeting,the pacific council provides a summary of its preliminary recommendations and their basis to the public,and notifies the public of its intent to develop final recommendations at its second meeting,usually in november.at the second meeting the pacific council considers public testimony and adopts final recommendations for nmfs regarding harvest levels for each major fish species,as well as management measures such as gear regulations and trip frequency the secretary then reviews the submission and,if approved,publishes a notice in the federal register making the council recommendations effective january of the upcoming fishing year.the groundfish fmp anticipates that the secretary will waive for good cause the requirement for prior notice and public comment in the federal register,as the council process will adequately satisfy that requirement.
the pacific council and followed these procedures in recommending and issuing the specifications and management measures for.that is,after holding two public meetings in september and october,the pacific council submitted to nmfs its recommended specifications and management measures on december.nmfs approved the recommendations and published them in the federal register on january,stating that they were effective as of january,but inviting public comment through february.see groundfish fishery specifications and management measures,fed.reg.nmfs asserted there was good cause to waive prior notice and the opportunity for public comment under the apa on the grounds that delay in implementing management measures could be harmful to stock,that much of the data comes from the current year,and that these timing issues,together with the need to have the specifications and management measures in place by the beginning of the fishing year,were accommodated by the scheme adopted in amendment nmfs further represented that prior notice and comment were not required by any other law.nmfs has employed the same rationale for invoking the good cause exception since the adoption of framework procedures in 
on february,nrdc submitted a comment to nmfs that challenged the specifications and management measures as failing to take adequate account of bycatch mortality for the severely overfished bocaccio and lingcod fish populations,which resulted in setting inflated fishing harvest levels for these two species nrdc also claimed that nmfs violated the notice and comment provision of the magnuson act.on may,nmfs published corrections to lingcod and bocaccio specifications,which adopted discard rate assumptions for lingcod and bocaccio and lowered the fishing harvest levels for these species.see correction to the specifications,fed.reg,may.
on january and february,the nrdc and other plaintiffs filed two suits challenging,among other things,the validity of the groundfish specifications and management measures based on nmfs failure to comply with the notice and comment requirements of both the magnuson act and the apa the two suits subsequently were consolidated,and the parties filed for summary judgment after consenting to proceed before a magistrate judge.on august,the court granted summary judgment in part to nrdc and in part to nmfs.on the claims at issue in this appeal,the magistrate judge ruled that the specifications were proposed regulations prepared under c and,thus,were procedurally invalid for failing to comply with the notice and comment requirement of the magnuson act,b.the court further ruled that nmfs failed to establish good cause to depart from the apa notice and comment requirement.it granted nrdc a declaratory judgment that nmfs violated the magnuson act and the apa by not providing prior public notice and allowing for comment on the specifications after their publication by the secretary,and a n order that,in accordance with the magnuson act and the apa,nmfs provide prior public notice and allow comment on future pacific groundfish specifications.this appeal followed 
the parties dispute whether the specifications and management measures recommended to nmfs by the pacific council constitute proposed regulations subject to the magnuson act notice and comment requirement.however,both parties agree that independent of the magnuson act,the notice and comment requirement of the apa rulemaking provision applies to the specifications and management measures.the dispute turns on whether nmfs properly invoked b b,the good cause exception to that statute notice and comment provision.we review de novo the district court determinations on issues of statutory interpretation,including the scope of the notice and comment,and publication,requirements imposed by the apa.see fitzpatrick,cir.as we conclude that nmfs failed to establish good cause excusing the failure to provide notice and comment under the apa,we do not reach the magnuson act challenge.
we must first address nmfs contention that the question whether it validly invoked the good cause exception for the rules is moot,as the specifications and management measures have been supplanted by subsequent rules.nrdc contends that jurisdiction exists under the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness.nmfs burden of demonstrating mootness is a heavy one.see greenpeace action franklin,cir.
government actions fall within the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception when the duration of the challenged action is too short to allow full litigation before it ceases,and there is a reasonable expectation that the plaintiffs will be subjected to it again.id.at see also bernhardt county of los angeles,cir.in greenpeace,which involved an analogous situation,we held that although total allowable catch specifications for pollock issued by nmfs for the fishing season had expired,an action challenging the specifications as failing to take into account adverse effects on other sea life was one of those extraordinary cases in which the complained of activity may be repeated and yet evade review.greenpeace action,at internal quotation marks omitted.there,we found persuasive the fact that the challenged specifications were in effect for less than a year,making it difficult to obtain effective judicial review,as well as the fact that the same issue was likely to recur given the secretary pattern of reliance on the same disputed biological opinion.id.at.similarly here,the one year time span for any given set of specifications and management measures renders it unlikely that any challenge to the rules will be fully litigated before they are replaced by a new set.moreover,as the groundfish fmp anticipates invocation of the good cause exception for every set of specifications and management measures,and because nmfs has repeated the same rationale for invoking the exception year after year,there is a reasonable expectation that the same issue will recur in future years.accordingly,we conclude that this action is not moot.
on the merits,nmfs argues that the district court erred by requiring all future groundfish specifications and management measures to undergo notice and comment under the apa.it points out that nrdc did not request relief regarding future agency actions that nmfs has yet to take.furthermore,nmfs contends,the district court improperly assumed that future invocations of the good cause exception will be exactly the same as this,it submits,is not necessarily so given that fishery conditions as well as the administrative record change from year to year.finally,nmfs maintains that its showing of good cause was in fact sufficient.
nrdc notes that we construe apa exceptions narrowly,see independent guard ass of nevada,local,cir,amended on other grounds,cir,and that we refused in riverbend farms to approve an agency invocation of the good cause exception where it was required to issue regulations on a weekly basis.riverbend farms,at.logically,in nrdc view,the same result should obtain here,as it did in where this court applied riverbend farms to an annual cycle,at.in addition,relying on hawaii helicopter operators ass faa,cir,nrdc posits that the good cause exception should be restricted to rare cases of genuine emergency.although nrdc questions the factual basis for nmfs position that notice and comment would cause delay,nrdc suggests that even if nmfs is right,alternatives exist that would make time for notice and example,beginning the annual regulatory process earlier in the year or moving to a longer regulatory cycle.lastly,it argues that notice and comment improves agency,as demonstrated by the agency error in adopting assumptions for bocaccio and lingcod in the specifications.
the apa provides that notice and comment may be waived by an agency when it for good cause finds and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable,unnecessary,or contrary to the public interest.b b our inquiry into whether nmfs properly invoked good cause proceeds,sensitive to the totality of the factors at play,and we have observed that notice and comment procedures should be waived only when delay would do real harm.hawaii helicopter operators ass n,at internal quotation marks omitted.emergencies,though not the only situations constituting good cause,are the most common.riverbend farms,at.under the apa,notice and comment is not impracticable unless the agency can not both follow section and execute its statutory duties.id.quoting levesque block,cir.thus,as we held in riverbend,the good cause exception goes only as far as its name implies it authorizes departures from the apa requirements only when compliance would interfere with the agency ability to carry out its mission.id.at.
nmfs has invoked the apa good cause exception on the same basis for each set of annual specifications and management measures since the adoption of amendment.on the one hand,this is understandable given that the public knows about pacific council hearings and prospective recommendations,and interested parties may attend those meetings and provide input the procedure that has been followed for a decade was adopted after notice and comment and has never been challenged and amendment itself anticipates the waiver of notice and comment.on the other hand,under the process that has been in place there is no notice or formal opportunity to comment to nmfs,which is the final.in any event,nmfs failed to engage in any analysis of the circumstances giving rise to good cause in when it issued the specifications and management measures without notice and comment.rather,it repeated the same generic timeliness concerns upon which it has relied each year,namely,that prior notice and comment would cause delay in the implementation of the rules given the data utilized in preparing them.
nmfs emphasizes the complexity of managing the pacific coast fishery,given the nature of the data upon which it relies to issue annual specifications and management measures.although the intricacy of the rules may have some
