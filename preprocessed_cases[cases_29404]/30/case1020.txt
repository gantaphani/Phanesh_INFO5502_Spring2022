appellee national marine fisheries service the agency set fishing limits for four species of pacific groundfish that are commonly sold as red snapper.appellant natural resources defense council nrdc,an environmental organization,brought suit in federal district court challenging the four limits as violating the fishery conservation and management act the magnuson act or the act,et,which directs that the agency prevent overfishing the administrative procedure act apa,et,which directs agencies to consider relevant factors in setting such limits and the national environmental policy act nepa,et,which directs agencies to prepare adequate environmental analyses when undertaking such actions.the district court granted summary judgment to the agency and fishermen marketing association and west coast seafood processors association intervenors.because we conclude that the darkblotched rockfish limit was based on an impermissible construction of the act,we reverse and remand we affirm the limits as to the other three species.
background 
a.the national marine fisheries service,the magnuson act,section and the national standards guidelines 
congress enacted the magnuson act to conserve and manage the fishery resources found off the coasts of the united states.b the agency is charged with developing and implementing rebuilding plans for overfished fish species.in,congress amended the act by passing the sustainable fisheries act sfa,stat.the sfa added new requirements to the act to accelerate the rebuilding of overfished species.
the act,as amended by the sfa,contains a provision the proper interpretation of which is the main subject of this appeal.section of the act provides in part that when any species is found to be overfished,the agency must approve a rebuilding plan that 
a specif ies a time period for ending overfishing and rebuilding the fishery that shall 
i be as short as possible,taking into account the status and biology of any overfished stock of fish,the needs of fishing communities,and the interaction of the overfished stock of fish within the marine ecosystem and 
ii not exceed years,except in cases where the biology of the stock of fish,or other environmental conditions dictate otherwise.
the act also sets forth a series of national standards with which any rebuilding plans must be consistent,and provides for the establishment of national standards guidelines nsgs that must be based on the national standards for use in assist ing in the development of fishery management plans.a,b.the act provides that nsgs shall not have the force and effect of law.id.
there is some ambiguity to e.section e i specifies that the rebuilding time period be as short as possible,but also directs that the agency tak e into account the status and biology of the overfished stock and the needs of fishing communities.section e ii in turn plainly mandates that the rebuilding plan be no longer than years,so long as biologically or environmentally possible however,if it is not possible to rebuild within years,the act is not clear as to the exact limits on the length of the rebuilding period.
seeking to clarify the proper interpretation of e,the agency in sought comment on whether or not it is correct in its interpretation that the duration of rebuilding programs should not be unspecified and,if so,what factors should be considered in determining that duration.see.the agency propounded two alternate interpretations for public comment that whenever it would take longer than years to rebuild an overfished species,either all fishing of that species would be banned until the rebuilding was complete or the agency would set a ceiling on the rebuilding duration that would be reached by adding the shortest possible time to rebuild plus one mean generation time based on the species characteristics.id.at.a mean generation time is a scientific term,not mentioned in the act itself,measuring how long it will take for an average mature fish to be replaced by its offspring.after notice and comment,the agency adopted the second interpretation in a nsg the nsg.see e ii b.the agency reasoned that 
f or stocks that will take more than years to rebuild,the guidelines adopted impose an outside limit that is objective,measurable,and linked to the biology of the particular species the guidelines strike a balance between the congressional directive to rebuild stocks as quickly as possible,and the desire to minimize adverse economic effects on fishing communities.for stocks that can not be rebuilt within years,the guideline allows flexibility in setting the rebuilding schedule beyond the mortality period,but places a reasonable,cap on that flexibility by limiting the extension to one mean generation time.
b.the and limits for darkblotched rockfish 
the pacific coast groundfish fishery is one of the fisheries the agency oversees,covering the fish species dwelling in the waters off the coasts of california,oregon and washington.in,the agency assessed the status of one species of pacific groundfish within the rockfish.it found that the species was at of its unfished population level its predicted level absent any fishing,and therefore concluded that the species was overfished within the meaning of the act.the agency further concluded that the species could be rebuilt in years or less,triggering e ii mandatory requirement that the rebuilding take place within years.the agency then set a metric ton fishing harvest level,or quota,a set limit of darkblotched rockfish that could be fished in.
in,the agency updated its assessment of darkblotched rockfish and concluded that it had significantly overestimated the health of the species.the agency now estimated that the species was almost twice as depleted as previously was at only of its unfished population level.in the agency calculations,rebuilding therefore could not be accomplished within years the minimum period for rebuilding was now years.
this increased rebuilding time meant,by necessity,that the rebuilding plan was no longer limited by e ii mandatory cap instead,the only applicable statutory time limit was e i command that the rebuilding period be as short as possible.further,according to the interpretation of the act set forth in the nsg,the revised minimum rebuilding period triggered a new ceiling that was the period plus one mean generation time,which in the case of the darkblotched rockfish was years.the agency,in short,switched from operating under the statutory constraint of years rebuilding time to a new constraint,dictated by the nsg,of years.the agency then set a target rebuilding time of years,and in accordance with this target,raised the fishing level harvest for from the previous year metric tons to metric tons 
nrdc brought suit alleging that the new quota violated the act,the administrative procedure act and the national environmental policy act.the district court concluded that the quota violated none of these statutes and granted summary judgment for the agency.natural res.def.council,marine fisheries,d.
c.the agency specifications for three other groundfish species 
the agency also set quotas for three other overfished groundfish,cowcod and canary were identical to the levels set in,despite evidence that fishing of these overfished species in the prior two years had been significantly higher than that allowed by the previous year quotas.the agency reasoned that because it did not have newly available data as to the status of these species owing to its policy of conducting stock assessments every three years,its response to the evidence of overfishing would be to put in place interim measures such as establishing zones in certain areas,and then to set new quotas once the next assessment was completed.
nrdc charged that the agency failure to adjust the quotas violated the act,apa and nepa.the district court also granted the agency summary judgment on these claims.d at.

iii.discussion 
a.the darkblotched rockfish.chevron deference 
the agency arrived at its increased darkblotched rockfish quota by applying its interpretation of e of the magnuson act as set forth in the nsg.nrdc argues that this interpretation of the act is not entitled to chevron deference for two separate reasons.
first,nrdc argues that congress intent in this section of the act is clear,thereby precluding the need for any deference to the agency interpretation of the statute.we disagree.as we noted above,e ii is explicit that if a species can be rebuilt within years,it must be.but e i,which states that the rebuilding period must be as short as possible,taking into account the status and biology of any overfished stock of fish and the needs of fishing communities,introduces an ambiguity into the calculus.when it is not biologically possible to rebuild within years,may the agency extend the rebuilding period beyond the shortest possible rebuilding time to account for the needs of fishing communities it would be possible to resolve the ambiguity by concluding that the act as a whole makes it clear that the needs of fishing communities are perfectly aligned with the environmental goal of rebuilding fish stocks in as short a time as possible.but if this were the case,the language the needs of fishing communities would be redundant as these needs would be no different than the need to rebuild stocks in as short a time as possible.but see natural res.def.council,daley,w e reject the district court suggestion that there is a conflict between the act expressed commitments to conservation and to mitigating adverse economic impacts.there is therefore an ambiguity in this part of the statute,requiring interpretation.see chevron,at.holding that if congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,it is necessary to move to the second step of the chevron analysis.
nrdc next argues that because the act explicitly provides that nsgs do not have the force of law,chevron deference is not appropriate.see mead,at.holding chevron deference to be appropriate only if congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.the agency responds that although the nsg does not have the force of law,the darkblotched rockfish quota is what is actually being challenged a binding regulation that does have the force of law,requiring chevron deference,and that to hold otherwise would mean punishing the agency for taking the additional step of setting out the interpretation in an nsg.
we need not resolve this question here,because even under the chevron standard of review,the quota was based on an impermissible construction of the act.we therefore will assume that chevron review is appropriate even as to the nsg statutory interpretation that was applied to reach the quota,without deciding the issue.
the quota is based on an impermissible construction of the act 
under chevron,we must determine whether the agency quota is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.chevron review is also described as determining whether the quota reflects a reasonable interpretation of the statute.id.at.
the interpretation of e stated in the nsg,as applied in the quota,is not a permissible or reasonable construction of the statute it is directly at odds with the text and purpose of the act section of the act contains its findings,purposes and policy.the findings section states that the nation fishery resources constitute valuable and renewable natural resources,that many of these species survival is threatened and that others survival will soon be threatened by increased fishing pressure,the inadequacy of fishery resource conservation and management practices and controls.a.the next subsection recognizes commercial and recreational fishing as a major source of employment that contributes significantly to the economy of the nation.a.but even here,the act urges that the economies of many coastal areas have been badly damaged by the overfishing of fishery resources at an rate over the past decade.id.the act goes on to explain that i f placed under sound management before overfishing has caused irreversible effects,the fisheries can be conserved and maintained so as to provide optimum yields on a continuing basis.a.these observations lead to the conclusion that a national program for the conservation and management of the fishery resources of the united states is necessary to prevent overfishing,to rebuild overfished stocks,to insure conservation,to facilitate protection of essential fish habitats,and to realize the full potential of the nation fishery resources.a.the purposes section adds that i t is therefore declared to be the purposes of the congress in this chapter to take immediate action to conserve and manage the fishery resources b.
the purpose of the act is clearly to give conservation of fisheries priority over economic interests.see daley,at u nder the act,the agency must give priority to conservation measures.the act sets this priority in part because the economic interests of fishing communities are aligned with the conservation goals set forth in the act.without immediate efforts at rebuilding depleted fisheries,the very survival of those fishing communities is in doubt.see id.this background provides helpful context for interpreting.however,even if we turn to the plain language of e and,without such context,ask how its two subsections interact,we still must reject the interpretation of the act contained in the nsg as it was applied to this species.
section contains two significant mandates that constrain the agency options in adopting a rebuilding plan for an overfished species.first,the time period must be as short as possible,although the agency may take into account the status and biology of the overfished species and the needs of fishing communities.see e i.subsection i commands apply to all rebuilding periods,whatever their length.second,congress specified a presumptive cap of years on any rebuilding period,subject to exceptional circumstances beyond the agency as an international treaty or,relevant here,the biology of the stock of fish.see e ii.
we have noted some ambiguity in subsection i mandate to rebuild a species in as short a time period as possible while giving consideration to the needs of fishing communities.the natural reading of this language,however,is that congress intended to ensure that overfished species were rebuilt as quickly as possible,but wanted to leave some leeway to avoid disastrous consequences for fishing communities.to
