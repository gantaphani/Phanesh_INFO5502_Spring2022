a developer planned an extensive marina project on a acre site near humboldt bay in the city of eureka city.this case concerns the jurisdiction of the california coastal commission commission over phase of the proposed development project.the city,having issued nuisance abatement orders concerning the site,finally issued a coastal development permit cdp for phase.the cdp has been appealed to the commission.plaintiff citizens for a better eureka cbe is challenging the commission appellate jurisdiction over the cdp.
at issue is public resources code section,subdivision b which states no provision of the california coastal act of et coastal act is a limitation b on the power of any city to declare,prohibit,and abate nuisances.we interpret this statute to authorize developments that are confined to nuisance abatement to proceed without a cdp.where,as here,the development includes,but is not limited to,nuisance abatement,a cdp is required.because a cdp is required,the commission has jurisdiction to determine the cdp appeal.consistent with these conclusions,we affirm the judgment denying cbe petition for writ of mandate that seeks to prevent the appeal from going forward.
background 
coastal act 
a cdp is generally required for a development within the coastal zone as defined in the coastal act,subd.a,subd.a.a local government within the coastal zone is required to prepare a local coastal program lcp for the portion of the coastal zone within its jurisdiction,subd.a.when the commission has certified an lcp and actions to implement the lcp have become effective,authority to issue cdp within the certified area is delegated from the commission to the local government,subject to appeals to the commission,subd.a.
local government actions on cdp applications for certain types of developments,those within feet of any wetland,are appealable to the commission,subd.a,and the commission has appellate jurisdiction to determine whether a cdp is consistent with the lcp and coastal access policies,subd.b.in an appeal,the commission first determines whether a substantial issue as to such consistency has been raised,subd.b.if a substantial issue is presented,the commission reviews the cdp application de novo,subd.a,tit,subd.b.
factual and administrative summary 
the development site consists of parcels,four of which are known as the balloon track because locomotives were formerly brought there on a circular track shaped like a balloon.the balloon track was used as a railroad switching,maintenance,and freight yard from the to the.some structural foundations and railroad tracks remain,but the site has been vacant since the late.
cue vi,llc hereafter cue standing for clean up eureka acquired the property in,and proposes to develop it as a retail,housing,and open space complex that includes square feet of retail space,square feet of office space,square feet of residential housing,square feet of light industrial space,square feet of restaurant space,square feet of museum space,parking spaces,and an acre wetland reserve.the development,called the marina center project,will proceed in phases,with phase limited to site remediation and wetland restoration.the city approved a cdp for phase in november.
the city council resolution approving the cdp stated that soils at the site were contaminated with petroleum,lead,copper,and arsenic,that overgrown vegetation at the site was creating health and fire hazards,and the site was littered with rubbish.these conditions caused the city to issue nuisance abatement orders for the property from to,and continue d to threaten to create a public nuisance under various sections of the eureka municipal code.the north coast regional water quality control board rwqcb approved a supplemental interim remediation action plan sirap that responded to a cleanup and abatement order the rwqcb issued for the property in.the sirap includes a plan for general site clearing and debris removal,a focused soil remediation of areas with contaminated soil,a restoration of the wetlands area,and a grading of the overall site.exercising its power to declare and abate nuisances in keeping with section,the cdp resolution ordered cue to abate the nuisance at the site by implementing the sirap.
findings attached to the resolution state that acres of existing wetlands will be filled in during phase,and cue must ensure that functions and values of replacement wetlands are equal to or greater than the functions and values of the wetlands affected by the project phase will include creation of a permanent wetland reserve surrounding clark slough,which bisects the southwest corner of the property.areas on both sides of clark slough were once marsh wetlands that were filled in,primarily with bay dredge spoils,and subsequently developed restoration plans for the site include the restoration of some of the areas to their former wetlands state.according to the resolution,t he creation of the wetland reserve will improve the ability of clark slough to drain municipal storm water to humboldt bay,and will reduce on and flooding.
the resolution stated the cdp would not become effective until the period for appealing to the commission had expired.on november,the city issued a notice of final action on the cdp to the commission.the notice stated the action of the city of eureka is appealable to the coastal commission pursuant to public resources code,section the final action is not effective until after the coastal commission appeal period has expired and no appeal has been filed.the city wrote a letter to cue dated november,that ordered cue to abate the conditions identified in the cdp resolution as a nuisance by implementation of the sirap within days.the letter advised that,if the abatement could not be completed in days,cue would need to provide a schedule with an estimated completion date for the city approval.
three appeals of the cdp,concerned primarily with phase effects on wetlands at the site,were filed with the commission.cbe members lodged objections to all the appeals with the commission,arguing that any further review of the cdp would obstruct needed pollution remediation and nuisance abatement,and cbe counsel in this case filed a letter on behalf of the pacific legal foundation challenging the commission assertion of appellate jurisdiction over the cdp.in december,the commission found the appeals raised a substantial issue as to whether the cdp was consistent with the city lcp the commission asked cue to submit additional information about the property,and advised that a de novo hearing on the appeals would be scheduled after the information was received.
court proceedings 
cbe filed its petition for writ of administrative mandate code civ,in february,arguing that the commission could not exercise appellate jurisdiction over the cdp because of the section,subdivision b directive that no provision of the coastal act may limit a city power to abate nuisances.cbe maintained that even if the commission were ultimately to affirm the cdp,the commission appellate process would necessarily and unavoidably conflict with the city determination t he commission appellate review,which inevitably entails delay in cleanup,limits the city power to abate present and ongoing threats to the public health and welfare.
cbe case was consolidated with a mandate petition against the commission by cue that raised the same argument.the commission demurred to the petitions,and cbe and cue moved for judgment on the pleadings.the court denied cbe and cue motions for judgment,and sustained the commission demurrers without leave to amend.the court found that the phase development goes far beyond just nuisance abatement,and concluded that section,subdivision b did not preclude the commission from hearing the appeals of the cdp.the court also determined cue had failed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing the action,a conclusion that cbe acknowledges applied equally to its petition.cue has not pursued an appeal,but cbe has appealed from the judgment entered for the commission.

jurisdiction 
in addressing application of the section,subdivision b savings clause in this case,we are writing on a virtually clean slate.the provision appears to have been interpreted only twice in a different setting in city of monterey california coastal com.d monterey,and a opinion letter from the attorney general to the commission,indexed letter,no.il may,hereafter il.
the monterey case involved a reconstruction project on property that was subject to a city nuisance abatement order.at issue in the trial court was whether the work could be done without a cdp under sections,subdivision d and,subdivision b,what the opinion called the repair and nuisance exceptions,respectively,to the permit requirement.monterey,supra,d at.the owner,runyan,obtained two cdp for the project,but was dissatisfied with the conditions to which the permits were subject.the trial court determined that d ue solely to the existence of the nuisance and the order of abatement issued by the city of monterey,runyan may make certain repairs to his buildings without a coastal development permit,as necessary to bring the buildings into code compliance such repairs being made under the repair exemption prc for the purpose of abating the nuisance prc b.monterey,supra,at.
while the commission appeal was pending,the structures to be repaired were destroyed by a fire that mooted the nuisance and repair issues.monterey,supra,d at.however,in dicta,the court of appeal said it assume d that since runyan applied for a coastal permit,his proposed remodeling was in excess of that required simply to abate the nuisance pursuant to section,subdivision d monterey,supra,at,fn,and the court indicated,w ere we called upon to rule on the judgment,we would reverse,as the project exceeds the scope of the repair and nuisance exceptions,subd.d,subd.b monterey,supra,at.
in il,the commission executive director asked the attorney general to opine on whether a cdp was required prior to abatement of a nuisance declared by a local government,where the abatement would otherwise constitute a development under the coastal act.the opinion,citing section,subdivision b,concluded that neither a local government nor a person acting under order of a local government was required to obtain a cdp in that situation.in the case of a nuisance abatement,the commission could not impose conditions to protect coastal resources,because the power to do so would improperly circumscribe the power of a local government to abate nuisances.il,supra,fn.however,the opinion added that i f the owner activity exceeds the amount necessary to abate the nuisance,the owner of course must obtain a coastal permit for that additional work.id.at.
these authorities point to an appropriate and workable rule that has been endorsed by commission staff and which we adopt here w here a local government properly declares a nuisance and requires abatement measures that are narrowly targeted at abating the declared nuisance,those measures do not require a cdp.on the other hand,a cdp is required if the development activity exceeds the amount necessary il,supra,simply to abate the nuisance monterey,supra,at,fn.
this narrow construction of the section,subdivision b nuisance exception to the coastal act is consistent with the directive that the coastal act be liberally construed to accomplish its purposes and objectives.see,capon monopoly game llc th,i n light of the legislative directive to construe the act liberally it is appropriate to construe the exceptions narrowly spencer marshall th.given the breadth of conditions that can be deemed to constitute nuisances,including anything that is injurious to health,offensive to the senses,or interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property,a contrary conclusion that exempted all projects involving some nuisance abatement from coastal act requirements would undo the statutory scheme.
as we have said,the trial court found that the development here goes far beyond just nuisance abatement.this finding was supported by substantial evidence that the development involves wetland restoration,as well as site remediation the resolution approving the cdp states phase consists of supplemental interim remedial measures and proposed wetland reserve,and the resolution repeatedly refers to the development as site remediation and wetland restoration.italics added.findings supporting the resolution acknowledged that phase would have a significant environmental effect because it included the filling of existing palustrine emergent wetlands as delineated under the coastal act.cue was required to provide for replacement wetlands using approaches deemed acceptable to the applicable regulatory agencies the commission.cue was directed to prepare a detailed restoration plan in accordance with the commission procedural guidance for the review of wetland projects in california coastal zone chapter enhancement and restoration.italics omitted.mitigation measures were required to ensure that phase did not substantially conflict with lcp policies against significant habitat disruption,including creation of a wetland buffer and low lighting near the wetland,and p hasing of site remediation and wetland restoration to minimize the amount of time that both the existing degraded wetlands and the wetlands in the southwest corner of the site slated for restoration are.
the resolution thus makes clear that the wetlands aspects of phase involve environmental and regulatory issues significantly beyond those presented in the site remediation portion of the development in which the nuisances identified by the city contaminated soil,rubbish,and overgrown vegetation would be abated.moreover,the wetlands activities in the development implicate fundamental coastal act policies at the core of the commission jurisdiction.t he highest priority must be given to environmental considerations in interpreting the coastal act bolsa chica land trust superior court th,and o f all the environmentally sensitive habitat areas mentioned specifically in the coastal act,wetlands and estuaries are afforded the most stringent protection id.at.see also dunn county of santa barbara th.filling wetlands is considered to be a development project and is thus subject to the coastal act permitting requirements.among the most important of the coastal act provisions is the prohibition on siting developments in wetlands except as allowed by.longtin california land use update other environmental controls,see,subds.a c no feasible,less environmentally damaging alternative is available feasible mitigation measures are taken to minimize adverse environmental effects functional capacity of wetland is maintained or enhanced see also eureka,subds.f,h i detailed environmental resource standards for diking,filling,or dredging of wetlands.
for these reasons,we conclude that a cdp is required in this case.
cbe does not appear to dispute that the section,subdivision b nuisance exception to the coastal act does not apply where a development goes beyond nuisance abatement.in briefing below,cbe by and large agree d with the c
