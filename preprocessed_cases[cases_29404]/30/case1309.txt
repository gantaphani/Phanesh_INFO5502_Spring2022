this case centers around privately and publicly owned lands located in northern utah and the interactions between united states forest service and citizens committee to save our canyons,the wasatch mountain club,william thompson,and gavin noyes collectively soc regarding development plans for the snowbird ski and summer resort.at issue is whether the forest service complied with the national environmental policy act nepa,et,and the national forest management act nfma,et,in carrying out two transactions involving snowbird.in one transaction,the forest service approved,as part of a larger plan,the construction of large resort facility on hidden peak,a mountain owned by the federal government but used by snowbird pursuant to a special use permit.in another transaction,the forest service transferred to snowbird small fractions of land in return for land adjacent to other federal property.both of these transactions occurred while snowbird was undertaking operations to improve its resort capacity.
soc alleges that the forest service handling of these transactions was arbitrary and capricious in several respects.it contends that the forest service authorized the land exchange called the interchange without first giving sufficient public notice,and that the forest service did not receive an equal value of land in exchange.in addition,it argues the forest service did not consider a sufficient number of alternatives before authorizing the hidden peak structure.finally,it claims the forest service improperly amended an existing forest plan to allow for the hidden peak building.
the united states district court for the district of utah rejected soc arguments,and,exercising jurisdiction pursuant to,we affirm.
background 
snowbird owns and operates a ski resort located miles southeast of salt lake city,utah.all parties agree that snowbird is a ski resort of some significance,and during the ski season over people visited the resort.the resort itself is comprised of acres of private land called the mineral basin and acres of public land located within the national forest wcnf.in,the forest service issued a special use permit to snowbird that allowed the resort to establish ski operations on national forest land.because of its special use permit,snowbird is required to submit periodically a master development plan outlining its plans for the resort and the public lands it utilizes.
master development plan 
in,snowbird submitted a master development plan mdp to the forest service.in the mdp,snowbird proposed extensive changes to its resort operations.in addition to calling for a general upgrade in operations,increased snowmaking equipment,additional chair lifts,and improved hiking trails,the mdp proposed the construction of a conference center and resort facility on an area known as hidden peak,which is within the public property snowbird uses pursuant to a special use permit.the facility proposed by snowbird would be considerably larger than the existing ski tram and square foot ski patrol and skier service center currently located on hidden peak.under snowbird proposal,the new structure would essentially replace the two existing structures and would contain space for a restaurant,lounge,meeting rooms,an interpretive area,retail space,ski patrol quarters,restrooms,snowcat garages,and a maintenance area.
in its mdp,snowbird argued that the larger structure was needed because the limited nature of the existing hidden peak facilities adversely affected the resort in a number of ways.ski and equipment rental offices,as well as restaurants,currently sit below hidden peak at the base of the resort,making hidden peak less amenable to skiers.in addition,although considered a world class facility in many regards,in recent years snowbird has been unable to meet all the requests for its services and facilities.in,for example,snowbird turned away percent of conference requests because of space limitations.the limited space on hidden peak also adversely affects activities across the resort,limiting skier circulation and making general use of the resort less efficient.
because hidden peak is located on land owned by the federal government,any substantial structures on the region require forest service approval,which,in turn,implicates nepa.on may,the forest service began the nepa process by announcing its intent to prepare an environmental impact study eis examining snowbird proposal and by sending a scoping document,which outlined snowbird proposal and solicited public comments to over individuals and organizations.in addition,on july and,snowbird held a public open house to discuss its proposal.a year later,in october,the forest service published a draft eis deis that consolidated several possible courses of action,including a alternative,the structure,a considerably smaller,structure,and the preferred alternative,a structure ranging from to.in addition to discussing the proposed alternatives,the forest service outlined,as required by nepa,alternatives that it had analyzed but not considered in detail.these rejected alternatives included a proposal to locate the hidden peak development at a different resort area altogether and a proposal to maintain the current sized structure,though with internal upgrades.the forest service justified not examining these alternatives in detail on the grounds that they would not meet the needs identified in the mdp.
in addition,the deis pointed out that the current hidden peak buildings violated an existing provision of the wcnf forest plan prohibiting structures that might interfere with mountain views from being built on hidden peak an amendment to the existing forest plan,the deis explained,would be necessary to accommodate any hidden peak structure,even the existing structures.
on december,the forest service issued a final eis feis and a record of decision rod authorizing the construction of the forest service preferred alternative,which,among other things,authorized the construction of a building not to exceed square feet and amended the existing forest plan to permit the structure.
mineral interchange 
the proposal for a new structure on hidden peak specifically dealt with snowbird proposed development on federal land.however,the mdp submitted by snowbird also detailed activities it planned to undertake on its private land land known as the mineral basin,regardless of whether the hidden peak structure received forest service approval.
within the mineral basin are relatively small fragments of federally owned land known as mineral survey fractions in,while the forest service studied snowbird mdp and hidden peak proposals,snowbird approached the forest service and asked it to enter a transaction known as an interchange the interchange under snowbird proposed interchange,the forest service would give snowbird the fractions of land it owned in the mineral basin in exchange for acres of land known as the war eagle property.the forest service eventually approved this transaction in december.because the forest service concluded that under existing regulations the transaction did not pose a significant risk of impacting the environment,it categorically excluded the interchange from nepa review.conflicting surveys,however,left the exact size of the land transferred by the government unclear,with government surveys placing the size at acres,but surveys by snowbird suggesting over nine acres may have been transferred by the forest service.
although the forest service was considering the interchange while simultaneously studying the mdp,the deis issued by the forest service in october did not mention the interchange,though the feis,issued a year later,did.
the land received by snowbird as a result of the interchange took on added significance when snowbird pressed forward with plans to develop the property it previously owned in the mineral basin.prior to the interchange,snowbird owned the vast majority of land in the mineral basin.as part of its development plans for this property,snowbird planned to construct two chairlifts mineral lifts a and b,regardless of whether the hidden peak structure was approved or the interchange occurred.following the interchange,however,now owned all relevant land in the mineral an alignment for mineral lifts a and b that passed over land received from the interchange had the interchange not occurred,the chairlifts still could have been constructed,but their alignment would have been different 
soc,a nonprofit environmental group,soon challenged both the interchange and the hidden peak structure.initially,soc filed an administrative appeal before the forest service.but on march,the forest service rejected this appeal,and soc then filed suit in the district court on may,on july,the district court granted snowbird motion to intervene as a defendant.
before the district court,soc alleged that the forest service violated nepa in several respects.first,it contended that the forest service violated nepa by amending the forest plan and approving the interchange without public comment.second,it claimed that the forest service did not consider an appropriate range of alternatives when examining the hidden peak structure.specifically,soc argued that the forest service should have examined in more detail either constructing a facility smaller than feet or not building a structure on hidden peak at all.third,it asserted that the forest service acted arbitrarily and capriciously by not considering the interchange and peak proposal in a single eis.in addition,soc contended that the forest service acted arbitrarily and capriciously in classifying its amendment to the forest plan as nonsignificant.soc also claimed the forest service acted arbitrarily and capriciously when going forward with the interchange because the forest service used inaccurate surveys in assessing the value of the land.
on april,the district court rejected soc arguments.in particular,it concluded that the forest service properly classified the interchange as being categorically excluded from nepa review the interchange and mdp were not connected actions the forest service did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in concluding that the interchanged parcels were of approximately equal value the forest service considered a sufficient range of alternatives when looking at the hidden peak project and the forest plan amendments allowing for the hidden peak structure could be construed as nonsignificant.
following the district court order,soc filed a motion with this court seeking an injunction pending appeal.soc specifically asked that this court enjoin any construction in the mineral basin that might impact land transferred in the interchange and enjoin all construction on hidden peak.as to the mineral basin,this court ruled that construction in the mineral basin area could continue,so long as there was no surface disturbance of the mineral sliver underlying the lift cable.because snowbird stipulated it would not begin construction on the hidden park building during the pendency of this appeal,we enjoined construction on that facility.the court also granted snowbird request for an expedited appeal.

ii.the interchange 
soc challenges the forest service handling of the interchange on a number of grounds.first,soc alleges that the forest service acted arbitrarily and capriciously by concluding that the interchange qualified for a categorical exclusion exempting nepa review.in particular,soc contends that the forest service failed to adequately explain its basis for subjecting the interchange to a categorical exclusion and misapplied the categorical exclusion it invoked.second,soc asserts that the forest service did not adequately notify interested and affected parties before implementing the interchange.finally,soc argues that the interchange was arbitrary and capricious because the land received by the forest service in the exchange was not approximately equal to the land it gave up.the district court rejected all of soc claims,and we affirm.
categorical exclusion 
nepa overview 
before turning to soc categorical exclusion argument,it is important to understand,generally speaking,the role categorical exclusions play in the larger nepa framework.
the supreme court has noted that the national environmental policy act has twin aims.baltimore gas natural resources defense council,d.first,nepa forces government agencies to consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action.id.internal quotation marks omitted.second,nepa mandates that government agencies inform the public of the potential environmental impacts of proposed actions and explain how their decisions address those impacts.see also robertson methow valley citizens council,d observing that nepa guarantees that the relevant information will be made available to the larger audience that may also play a role in both the decisionmaking process and the implementation of that decision.
this circuit and the supreme court have repeatedly emphasized,however,that nepa does not mandate any particular substantive outcome.see robertson,at.custer county action ass garvey,cir comm.to preserve boomer lake park dep t of,cir.as we recently observed,nepa does not require agencies to elevate environmental concerns over other appropriate considerations it requires only that the agency take a hard look at the environmental consequences before taking a major action.utah shared access alliance united states forest,cir see also friends of the bow thompson,cir discussing hard look requirement.
when a government agency prepares to take an action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,this hard look at potential environmental impacts is accomplished through an eis.c.an eis is a detailed document that identifies the potential impacts a proposal may have on the environment.friends of the bow,at.within the eis,the government agency must discuss the purpose and need for the proposed action,environmental impacts resulting from the actions,unavoidable adverse environmental impacts,alternatives to the proposed action,the relationship between uses and productivity,and the amount of resources that must be devoted to the proposed action.c i v.
the preparation of an eis occurs in several stages.initially,an agency announces its intent to study a proposed action through a process called scoping,during which the agency solicits comments and input from the public and other state and federal agencies with the goal of identifying specific issues to be addressed and studied.after assessing the input from the scoping process,the government then prepares a draft environmental impact statement deis,id.a,which is then presented to the public and other government agencies for notice and comment.id.a.after evaluating the feedback received during the notice and comment process,the agency prepares a feis.id.b.if after preparing either a deis or feis,the proposed action substantially changes in a way relevant to environmental concerns,or if new information comes to light about environmental impacts,an agency must prepare a supplemental eis seis.id.c.
prior to deciding to prepare an eis,however,an agency may prepare a less detailed document called an environmental assessment ea.see id.an ea is used by an agency to decide whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact.id.a.if,after completing an ea,an agency properly determines that a proposed project will not significantly impact the human environment,then the government agency issues a finding of no significant impact fonsi and the action may proceed,subject to administrative and judicial review.see friends of the bow,at comm.to preserve boomer lake,at see also presidio golf club park,cir describing the interaction between an eis,ea,and fonsi.
in certain circumstances,however,an agency need not follow the detailed nepa procedures described above.under regulations promulgated by the council on environmental quality ceq,an agency is not required to prepare either an eis or ea if the proposed action does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment.by and large,the federal regulations delegate to individual agencies the responsibility for defining what type of actions may be categorically excluded from nepa review see b ii requiring agencies to set s pecific criteria for what actions normally do not require either an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment west sec of the dep of,cir rhodes johnson,cir.
once an agency establishes categorical exclusions,its decision to classify a proposed action as falling within a particular categorical exclusion will be set aside only if a court determines that the decision was arbitrary and capricious.friends of fed.aviation,cir alaska ctr.for the env united states,cir bicycle trails council of marin babbitt,cir.when reviewing an agency interpretation and application of its categorical exclusions under the arbitrary and capricious standard,courts are deferential alaska,at we agree with the fourth and fifth circuits that an agency interpretation of the meaning of its own categorical exclusion should be given controlling weight unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the terms uses in the regulations.rhodes,at characterizing the forest service interpretation of its own implementing procedures for categorical exclusions as forest service regulations entitled to substantial deference houston air comm.fed.aviation,cir city of alexandria fed.highway,cir so long as no project required to be included under the statute is excluded under the regulations,we should defer to the agency interpretation of its own regulations.
essentially the same categorical exclusion 
in this case,the forest service,pursuant to its authority under b ii,concluded that the interchange fell within a categorical exclusion exempting land exchanges from nepa review where resulting land uses remain essentially the same.forest service handbook fsh b.soc first challenges the forest service decision to invoke this categorical exclusion on the grounds that the agency did not explain its basis for concluding that the interchange fell within the essentially the same category.the record,however,suggests that the forest service did issue a decision memo in this case explaining its actions,and,in any event,the record explains the forest service reasoning in concluding that the interchanged land was essentially the same and thus qualified for the categorical exclusion.we find no merit to soc argument in this regard.
soc also contends that the administrative record fails to support the forest service decision to classify the interchange as falling within the essentially the same categorical exclusion.according to soc,prior to the interchange,the government lands were relatively undeveloped.following the interchange,however,the federal lands were incorporated into a bustling and burgeoning ski resort,soc argues 
in deciding to go forward with the interchange,however,the forest service rejected this development argument,and its reason for doing so is sufficiently supported by the record to prevent reversal under an arbitrary and capricious standard of review.it noted that the existing federal lands were already subject to skiing activity,and,therefore,transferring ownership to snowbird would not alter its essential use or character.indeed,according to the forest service assessment,prior to the interchange,the federal parcels were undeveloped and proposed to remain undeveloped after the interchange backcountry skiers have used mineral basin for years.the forest service also noted that,regardless of whether the interchange occurred,snowbird intended to develop the surrounding mineral basin properties,which constituted the vast majority of land in the basin and which already engulfed the federal tracts subject to the interchange.consequently,irrespective of whether the interchange transpired,the federal lands would be surrounded by development.given these facts,we can not conclude that the forest service acted arbitrarily or capriciously when it concluded that activity on the federal lands exchanged in the interchange would remain essentially the same.
notice of interchange 
soc devotes a substantial portion of its brief to challenging the notice the forest service provided to the public and interested parties once it decided to implement the interchange.soc correctly points out that,under applicable regulations,if a proposed action has been categorically excluded from documentation in an eis or an ea,interested and affected persons must be informed in an appropriate manner of the decision to proceed with the proposed action.fsh.we find soc claim that these guidelines were violated unconvincing.
soc invokes a number of different arguments to challenge the notice provided by the forest service first,soc points out that the forest service and snowbird never revealed the pending interchange,even while soliciting comments on the mdp and preparing the extensive deis.soc further alleges that,according to public statements in the deis,only private land would be impacted by the towers and lines between the towers for mineral lifts a and b,when,in fact,a portion of the lines would span over land transferred to snowbird by the federal government as part of the interchange moreover,by not informing interested parties,soc contends the forest service violated existing fsh guidelines.
to the extent soc claims it did not receive notice of the interchange either before or after it was formally implemented,its argument is undercut by the record,which strongly suggests that soc learned that the forest service was considering the interchange during the july,meeting between snowbird and representatives from the soc and the sierra club.a letter from a snowbird official to a forest service supervisor describing what occurred at the meeting,for example,explains that one of the primary reasons the meeting was held was to inform soc about the land exchange of mineral fractions and notes a considerable amount of time was taken to detail the location and acreage of the mineral fractions in mineral basin.in addition,it is undisputed that once the forest service formally decided to implement the interchange,the forest service mailed a copy of its decision to an officer of soc.although soc now asserts that the officer did not actually receive the copy because he moved,there is no evidence in the record suggesting that soc informed the forest service of the officer new address or that the letter was returned to the forest service.yet even if these steps were not adequate to apprise soc of the action,the record demonstrates that soc learned,in fact,of the interchange and protested the action.see letter from soc to jack craven,united states forest service director of lands,dated.under these circumstances,we do not believe that soc has shown that it has suffered any injury from the alleged lack of notice about the interchange,and we can not conclude that the notice provided to soc was arbitrary or capricious under the fsh guideline,to which we give considerable deference.
having received notice of and protested the interchange,soc argument essentially amounts to a claim that other interested members of the public did not receive notice.soc,for instance,devotes a large portion of its argument to contending that the forest service failed to inform the general public of the land exchange during the deis process and did not make a general public announcement of the interchange after deciding to implement the decision.we have explained,however,that the doctrine of prudential standing requires that even a plaintiff who meets the constitutional requirements for standing must also assert its own rights,rather than those belonging to third parties.sac,fox nation pierce,cir citing warth seldin,d.moreover,a plaintiff can not assert a generalized grievance shared in substantially equal measure by all or a large class of citizens.warth,at.
here,soc generalized claims that the forest service failed to provide adequate notice to the public appear to fall below the prudential standing threshold.see martin occupational safety health review comm n,cir cf i advance notice of the secretary interpretation is fatal to its due process claim because cf i lacks standing to challenge the regulation on behalf of others without notice.even assuming that soc could overcome the constitutional and prudential standing obstacles facing this argument,it would lose on the merits,for the record demonstrates that interested and affected parties,such as adjacent landowners and state and local officials,were notified in advance that the forest service was considering implementing the interchange and asked to comment on the proposal.further,after the forest service decided to implement the interchange,these same individuals received a copy of a decision memo approving the interchange.in light of these actions,we can not conclude that the forest service acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.
value of interchanged lands 
finally,soc claims that,regardless of whether the forest service complied with the categorical exclusion requirements,the forest service acted arbitrarily and capriciously in authorizing the interchange because it relied on inaccurate data when approximating the value of the mineral fractions it transferred to snowbird.specifically,soc alleges that the forest service relied upon inaccurate survey data that estimated the forest service was only exchanging acres of land,when,in reality,soc argues,a survey by snowbird indicated that the forest service was exchanging acres of developable land for acres of land.in addition,soc argues that the land received by the forest service in the interchange was a dump and unsafe for public use.we find soc claims unavailing.
the small tracts act authorizes the federal government to interchange national forest system land with a private party,as long as the interchanged lands are of approximately equal value.as federal regulations explain,one of the purposes of allowing the interchange of mineral type of land at issue in this to allow the government to resolve land disputes and management problems associated with federal lands.when deciding whether mineral fractions may be interchanged,the federal regulations require the forest service to engage in a process.the service must first determine that the mineral fractions have specific characteristics allowing them to be interchanged.in order to qualify for an interchange,the forest service must conclude that the land c annot be efficiently administered because of size,shape,or location,that the land is or could be occupied by adjoining land owners,and that if sold separately or aggregated in one transaction,the land do es not exceed acres.id.a.
once it is established that the mineral fractions may be conveyed,the forest service must examine three criteria to decide if the land should be conveyed.first,the forest service must consider whether the mineral fractions are interspersed among and are more or less an integral part of private land holdings.id.b.second,the forest service must consider whether it would be too costly to survey the property in order to develop an effective management plan.id.b.and third,the forest service must examine how the parcels to be interchanged will affect the land within which they are interspersed.id.b.any land that is interchanged can not exceed in value,and all interchanges must be in the public interest.id.c,e.
federal regulations also offer guidance at to what constitutes approximately equal value in an interchange.id.as defined by the relevant regulation,approximately equal value is a comparative estimate of value of lands involved in an interchange where elements of value,such as physical characteristics and other amenities,are readily apparent and substantially similar.id.the regulations indicate that the forest service should consider the size,shape,location,physical attributes,functional utility,proximity of other similar sites,and amenities in the immediate environs.id.however,because interchanges usually involve land that is relatively small in size,interchanges do not require a formal appraisal.id.considering these regulations in light of the interchange at issue in this case,we can not conclude that the forest service determination that the exchanged lands were of approximately equal value was arbitrary or capricious.
to the extent soc attacks the surveys the forest service relied upon in determining approximately equal value,its argument ignores the general rule that courts defer to the expertise and discretion of the agency to determine proper testing methods.sierra club united states dep of,see also custer county action ass n,at noting that the the mere presence of contradictory evidence does not invalidate an agency determination internal quotation marks omitted inland empire pub.lands council schultz,cir noting that nepa does not require a court to resolve disputes among competing scientific schools.
moreover,the record in this case does not support the claim that the forest service acted arbitrarily or capriciously in conducting the interchange.for instance,the forest service decision memo concerning the interchange recognized that discrepancies existed over the exact size and shape of the parcels at issue.the record also demonstrates that the forest service knew snowbird survey estimated that the federal mineral fractions were substantially larger than surveys conducted by the bureau of land management,but reasoned that the cost of doing a field survey would far exceed the value of the mineral fractions and in some ways defeat the small tracts act with regard to mineral fractions.at the same time,however,it recognized that it could not rely upon snowbird survey,as that survey was not considered official.see setting standards for surveys forest service may use.to remedy this problem,the forest service chose to interchange all the mineral fractions surrounded by snowbird,a process that is apparently relatively common where mineral fractions are involved.the alternative,explained forest service officials,would be too costly,especially because the mineral fractions in dispute were small,mostly located on steep terrain and surrounded by private lands,and largely inaccessible to the public.given that soc does not contest that the mineral fractions at issue were worth less than and difficult to manage,and given that the forest service was aware that it could be interchanging as much as nine acres of land,the forest service actions can not be considered arbitrary or capricious.
soc additional claim that the interchange did not involve land of approximately equal value because the property received by the government was a dump and dangerous simply overstates the record.the documents cited by study reveal that the dangerous condition a mining closing in on itself and would likely be closed within one to two years.the debris referenced by soc likely came,again according to the document snowbird cites,from a mining camp that closed in the early,and this debris was labeled as having potential cultural interest.in addition,the same study suggested that the property was being used for recreational and hunting activities and found no hazardous materials on the site.
when these facts are combined with the forest service conclusion that the land received by the forest service adjoins other public land and is of a size,shape,and location which would facilitate public use of this and surrounding national forest system lands,we do not find that the forest service acted arbitrarily or capriciously.
accordingly,for all the foregoing reasons,we reject soc challenges to the forest service decision to implement the interchange.
iii.interchange and the mdp 
soc contends the forest service violated nepa because the interchange and the proposals outlined in the mdp were connected actions that should have been considered in a common eis.
ceq regulations require that connected or closely related actions be discussed in the same impact statement.a.one of the primary reasons for requiring an agency to evaluate connected actions in a single eis is to prevent agencies from minimizing the potential environmental consequences of a proposed action and thus nepa review by segmenting or isolating an individual action that,by itself,may not have a significant environmental impact see wetlands action network united states army corps of eng rs,cir northwest res.info.marine fisheries,cir see also hirt richardson,d,discussing how the connected action regulation is one part of a larger impermissible segmentation rule david mandelker,nepa law and litigation west discussing how the connected action regulation addresses segmentation problems.
under the applicable regulations,an action will be considered connected or closely related with other actions in three situations the action automatically triggers another action requiring an environmental impact statement the action can not or will not proceed unless other actions are taken previously or simultaneously or the action is an interdependent part of a larger action and depends on that larger action for its justification a i iii see thomas sullivan,ed.emeritus,envt l law handbook,government institutes.
often,courts find two proposed actions connected where one action could not occur but for the occurrence of the other.compare,thomas peterson,cir finding sale of timber and construction of road necessary to access the timber to be connected actions requiring a single eis with northwest res.info,at finding transportation and flow improvement plans could exist without one another.by contrast,we recently explained that,p ut simply,projects that have independent utility are not connected actions under a iii.custer county action ass n,at internal quotation marks omitted see also wetlands action network,at w e have rejected claims that actions were connected when each of the two projects would have taken place with or without the other and thus had independent utility.internal quotation marks omitted south carolina,cir holding that actions are not connected when they are independent and separable.
in this case,the record indicates that the mdp and the interchange were sufficiently independent that they can not be considered connected actions.according to the record,only a negligible portion of the land in the mineral basin is in the national forest system.the record suggests that snowbird,with interest in the overwhelming majority of mineral basin land,would have developed this area regardless of whether the interchange occurred.had the interchange not occurred,for example,snowbird could have simply shifted the alignment of mineral lifts a and b to avoid crossing over the federal lands.
similarly,according to the record,the scattered nature and small size of mineral fractions meant that the alignment of the lifts and roads could avoid any federal parcels.moreover,the record suggests that the need and the appropriateness of the interchange was not dependent on what snowbird plan ned to do with the private property because the scattered mineral fractions were difficult and impractical to manage.indeed,the forest service indicated in the administrative record that it would have entertained other possibilities to interchange these fractions had any been proposed.
consequently,on the record before us,the interchange and the mdp do not satisfy the regulatory definition for connected actions 
iv.consideration of alternatives 
soc also challenges that forest service eis for not considering an appropriate number of alternatives when evaluating snowbird proposal for erecting a new hidden peak facility.soc attacks the forest service actions through a argument.first,soc contends that the forest service inappropriately read the eis statement of purpose as focusing exclusively upon building a structure on hidden peak.second,having made this error,soc alleges,the forest service then failed to evaluate the possibility of building a smaller structure on hidden peak or,alternatively,placing facilities off peak.we disagree.
one of the key provisions of nepa and its corresponding regulations is that government agencies must include in every recommendation or report on proposals detailed statements analyzing alternatives to the proposed action.c iii.according to ceq regulations,considering alternative actions is the heart of the environmental impact statement.see also all indian pueblo council united states,cir.as a result,agencies must r igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives.to comply with the national environmental policy act and its implementing regulations,agencies are required to rigorously explore all reasonable alternatives and give each alternative substantial treatment in the environmental impact statement.custer county action ass n,at see also.envtl.coalition dombeck,cir explaining reasonable alternatives.not only must an agency rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives,agencies must also briefly discuss the reasons for having eliminated other alternatives.a.
as court opinions and the ceq regulations make clear,however,an agency is only required to consider reasonable alternatives.id.in determining whether an agency considered reasonable alternatives,courts look closely at the objectives identified in an eis purpose and needs statement.see.envtl.coalition,at.where the action subject to nepa review is triggered by a proposal or application from a private party,it is appropriate for the agency to give substantial weight to the goals and objectives of that private actor.see city of grapevine dep t of.wildlife fed n,york,cir.nevertheless,courts will not allow an agency to define the objectives so narrowly as to preclude a reasonable consideration of alternatives.davis mineta,cir holding that a statement of objectives would be unreasonably narrow if it would permit only one particular crossing across a river in order to improve traffic flow.
once an agency appropriately defines the objectives of an action,nepa does not require agencies to analyze the environmental consequences of alternatives it has in good faith rejected as too remote,speculative,or impractical or ineffective.all indian pueblo council,at quoting city of aurora hunt,cir.instead,we apply a rule of reason test that asks whether the environmental impact statement contained sufficient discussion of the relevant issues and opposing viewpoints to enable the forest service to take a hard look at the environmental impacts of the proposed expansion and its alternatives.envtl.coalition,at.alternatives that do not accomplish the purpose of an action are not reasonable and need not be studied in detail by the agency.custer county action ass n,at.
alternatives 
in this case,soc does not directly challenge the forest service stated objectives in evaluating snowbird overall master development plan,which included upgrading or replacing outdated facilities,improving circulation throughout the resort,balancing and making more efficient terrain use,and maintaining a vigorous forest and quality recreational experience.
rather,soc argues that the forest service inappropriately restricted the range of alternatives it considered by not fully exploring alternatives that could have accomplished these goals without requiring a large structure on hidden peak.all the forest service proposals,soc contends,contained colossal structure s that would dwarf the existing hidden peak structures and obstruct the view of hidden peak.
the forest service,however,considered alternatives that had differences in size spanning over square feet.besides the alternative,which would have left the smaller existing structures in place with minor alterations,it considered a square foot structure,snowbird proposal for a square foot building,and the preferred alternative,which called for a structure ranging between square feet and square feet.
contrary to soc claim,the forest service did not breach the rule of reason by refusing to study in detail alternatives that would have limited the structure size to between square feet and square feet or moved the structure altogether.see.envtl.coalition,at.as the record illustrates,proposals calling for smaller structures on hidden peak,or removing the hidden peak structure to another location altogether,were impractical and failed to satisfy the objectives of the project,which,again,were to improve the recreational use in the area while balancing environmental interests.see custer county action ass n,at.evidence in the record suggests,for example,that moving the structure to nearby resort areas could have interfered with plans governing those regions,and that developing another resort would have undercut the investment at snowbird already made by the forest service.according to documents in the record,locating skier services at the base of the resort or in the region,as opposed to the mountain peak,would not have improved skier circulation,particularly because hidden peak is at the center of activity on the mountain and feeds snowbird three primary skiing areas,nor would it have met the need to respond to user desires,nor were there available feasible alternative locations.finally,there is some suggestion in the record that placing the structure at the base of the mountain or in the region could create additional negative visual impacts.
likewise,building a structure underground so as to avoid impairing the ridge line altogether,the forest service noted in its analysis,would generate substantially greater adverse environmental effects than any of the proposed alternatives,and was not regarded as technologically or economically feasible.the service also reasoned that by building on a site where structures already exist,it could minimize environmental impacts in other regions.indeed,even in its filings before the district court,soc appeared to recognize that placing a structure on hidden peak was not,per se,objectionable.soc emphasized,for example,that it was fully prepared to accept a square foot structure on the peak.
additionally,the forest service concluded that anything smaller than square foot structure would not meet skier needs,thereby negating the proposal goal of increasing efficiency and recreational balance in the area.having reviewed the record,we can not conclude that the forest service finding on this score was arbitrary or capricious.see hells canyon alliance united states forest,cir.envtl.coalition,at.
nor did the forest service consideration of the various alternative structures ignore,as the soc argument at times implies,the impact that placing a structure on hidden peak would have upon views of the mountain.as maps in the record demonstrate,the service analyzed in detail how the proposed structures,including the alternative,which would have left the existing structures on the mountain,would have affected the views of hidden peak.the forest service concluded that the building proposed in the preferred alternative,even though much larger than the existing structures on hidden peak,could blend in better with hidden peak ridge line and could potentially improve the visual impact of the peak.given that the existing structure,which was constructed in,simply sits atop hidden peak,while the proposed structure,though larger,would be rounded to blend in with the contour of the peak,we can not find the forest service conclusion arbitrary or capricious.custer county action ass n,at.
accordingly,we reject soc claims that forest service considered an impermissible range of alternatives.
amendment to the forest plan 
finally,soc challenges the forest service decision to amend the forest plan to allow for the construction of a structure on hidden peak specifically,soc contends that the forest service did not give adequate notice to the public in amending the forest plan.soc further argues that the forest service ignored or misapplied relevant factors when characterizing its proposed amendment as nonsignificant.we disagree.
procedures 
nfma provides that once enacted,forest plans may be amended in any manner whatsoever.f.if an amendment to a forest plan would be significant,however,then nfma mandates substantial public involvement,planning,and input,requiring,in essence,the forest service to conduct the same complex planning process applicable to promulgation of the original plan.sierra club cargill,cir seymour,dissenting see f.among other things,for significant amendments,nfma requires the forest service to mak e plans or revisions available to the public at convenient locations in the vicinity of the affected unit for a period of at least three months before final adoption.d.
neither nfma,nor its accompanying regulations,specify what constitutes a significant amendment to a forest plan.see cargill,at noting that regulations give little guidance as to when a change is significant.indeed,applicable regulations expressly commend the determination of the significance of an amendment to the forest supervisor judgment.id.according to the regulations,based on an analysis of the objectives,guidelines,and other contents of the forest plan,the forest supervisor shall determine whether a proposed amendment would result in a significant change in the plan.f emphasis added.if the forest supervisor concludes that an amendment is nonsignificant,he may implement the amendment following appropriate public notification and satisfactory completion of nepa procedures.id.emphasis added.
although the forest supervisor has wide discretion in deciding whether an amendment is significant,the fsh outlines factors the supervisor must consider when assessing the significance of a proposed amendment,including the timing of the proposed change relative to the expiration or next scheduled revision of the forest plan the shorter the remaining life of the plan,the less significant the amendment the location and size of the area involved in the change in comparison to the overall planning area the significance of the project relative to the goals and objectives of the forest plan and the impact of the amendment on management prescription whether the change applies only to a specific situation or whether it likely will affect future decisions as well fsh a d.
like the other issues in this case,when reviewing whether an agency properly classified an action as nonsignificant,we will only reverse the agency classification if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.cargill,at.
soc alleges that the forest service breached its duty under nfma to notify the public before instituting the amendment.specifically,soc charges that the forest service only gave notice of the amendment for the first time in the feis and record of decision rod announcing the construction of the hidden peak structure.soc asserts that this announcement violated nepa and nfma because it denied the public an opportunity to comment on the proposed amendment.additionally,soc contends that previous allusions to the possibility of amending the forest plan were merely vague references to a potential future action that gave the public no idea of the scope or nature of the purportedly impending forest plan amendment.we find soc argument unpersuasive.
soc is correct in asserting that nfma requires public notice for any amendment,significant or otherwise.forest guardians thomas.it is debatable,however,how public this notice must be before the service implements a nonsignificant amendment.soc is unable to point to any specific language either in the fsh,nfma,or nepa expressly requiring that the specific language of a nonsignificant amendment be published before the forest service implements the amendment.while nfma speaks in terms of public notice,f,and the regulations speak of public notification,f,these terms do not,in themselves,necessarily mandate public comment,and,as discussed when considering categorical exclusions,public comment is not required to satisfy all nepa procedures.
we need not resolve,however,the precise contours of the forest service notice obligations in this context,for applying the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review,we find that nepa disclosures during the deis process provided sufficient notice and opportunity for public comment.during this process,for instance,the forest service discussed how any structure on hidden peak would violate existing forest pla
