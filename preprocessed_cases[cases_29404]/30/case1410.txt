state authorities submit air pollution emissions data to the environmental protection agency.epa monitors the data in order to evaluate regional compliance with national air pollution standards.in,epa promulgated a regulation governing the exclusion of emissions data during exceptional events such as natural disasters.the natural resources defense council nrdc brought petitions for review,seeking to set aside the rule definition of natural events and to vacate several statements in the preamble to the rule concerning types of events that may qualify as exceptional.
the clean air act commands epa to promulgate national air quality standards for certain air pollutants.states develop and implement plans to comply with epa air quality standards.the states have established a network of air quality monitoring stations to measure regional compliance with epa national standards.based on this data,epa designates areas as being in either attainment or nonattainment and imposes more rigorous pollution control measures in nonattainment areas.see d.
in,congress amended the clean air act to require epa to promulgate regulations governing air quality monitoring during exceptional events.see b.the amended statute defined exceptional event as an event that i affects air quality ii is not reasonably controllable or preventable iii is an event caused by human activity that is unlikely to recur at a particular location or a natural event and iv is determined by the administrator to be an exceptional event.id.b a.epa published a final exceptional events rule,accompanied by a lengthy preamble,in march.treatment of data influenced by exceptional events,codified at.the final rule definition of exceptional events,codified at j,repeated the statutory language.in the next subsection,the rule defined natural event as used in b a iii as an event in which human activity plays little or no direct causal role.k.the rule also provided that states may flag anomalous data caused by exceptional events,and that epa will then review the flagged data and determine whether to exclude it from the set of data used in reviewing compliance with its air quality standards.
nrdc argues against epa definition of natural event,against its description in the rule preamble of a final rule concerning high wind events,and against its list,again in the preamble,of examples of potentially exceptional events.
nrdc complaint is that epa should not have defined natural event in k to include events in which human activities play little causal role.as nrdc sees it,a natural event within the meaning of is something that occurs without the slightest human influence.epa says this objection was never raised during the rulemaking and is therefore barred.
section of the clean air act states only an objection to a rule or procedure which was raised with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment including any public hearing may be raised during judicial review.d b.similar provisions are common with respect to other agencies.see.ass for television children fcc.their purpose is to ensure that the agency and other interested persons have been alerted to the commenter objection to the proposed rule.the agency then may correct or modify the rule it proposed or explain why it disagrees with the objection.see motor equip.mfrs.ass nichols.other parties also may contribute to the agency deliberations by endorsing or opposing the objection and by providing information and arguments in support of their position.
nrdc thinks the following portion of its,single spaced letter to epa constituted an objection to epa proposed definition of natural event 
under no circumstance can the associated with a natural disaster itself be considered a natural event.epa suggestion to the contrary flies in the face of the plain statutory language.the statute clearly and explicitly distinguishes between natural event s events that do not have a human origin and events caused by human activity.a natural event is one that is not the result of human activity while the level of human activity that discharges pollutants may increase in the wake of a natural disaster,emissions from activities such as debris burning,operation of diesel equipment,and demolition activities are clearly events caused by human activity,and may not be classified as exceptional events unless they meet each of the requirements of section for qualifying anthropogenic events.
in short,the activities themselves that are responsible for the emissions and possible violations of the naaqs are of human origin,and by definition not natural events.the fact that a natural event precipitates the need for human activity can not and does not transform the human activity itself into a natural event.thus,the act clearly precludes epa from identifying emissions from activities as natural events that qualify as exceptional events.
nrdc comments,at.
given the context,no epa official would have guessed that nrdc was complaining about the agency proposed definition of natural event.those familiar with the proceedings would have taken nrdc remarks as a criticism of the one sentence in the notice of proposed rulemaking dealing with activities after a natural disaster such as the eruption of helens in or hurricane katrina in.the sentence read for the purpose of flagging,major natural disasters,such as hurricanes and tornadoes for which state,local,or federal relief has been granted,and activities associated with these events may be considered exceptional events.treatment of data influenced by exceptional events.it is not apparent that epa even rested its view about activities on the proposed definition of natural event in k rather than on the clause in another proposed subsection defining exceptional events to include human activities unlikely to recur at a particular location,id.j.
there are additional reasons why nrdc critique,quoted above,would not have alerted the careful reader to the complaint it now makes about k.nrdc comments said that a natural event could not have a human origin and could not be the result of human activity.these comments are not necessarily inconsistent with k definition of natural events as ones in which human activity plays little or no direct causal role.no one would say that the origin of the tornado was human activity because the storm spread air pollutants throughout the countryside.the definition of natural event in proposed k was only a few words long,yet nrdc did not quote the portion it now finds objectionable.nrdc never even identified the rule by section number or placement in the notice of proposed rulemaking.we have held that section of the clean air act bars litigants from arguing against a particular section of a rule on judicial review if they failed to identify the particular section in their comments during the rulemaking.see mossville envtl.action now epa,motor equip,at.a citation to the section of the rule or a description of it may be all that is needed.if a comment lacking even that low level of specificity sufficed,the agency would be subjected to verbal traps.whenever the agency failed to detect an obscure criticism of one aspect of its proposal,the petitioner could claim not only that it had complied with section but also that the agency acted arbitrarily because it never responded to the comment.rulemaking proceedings and the legal doctrines that have grown up around them are intricate and cumbersome enough.agency officials should not have to wade through reams of documents searching for implied challenges.mossville,at.it is not too much to expect interested persons to point to the particular portion of the proposed rule they are arguing against.
it is worth adding that after epa promulgated the final rule containing k and its definition of natural event,nrdc filed a petition for reconsideration.in its petition nrdc spelled out for the first time its complaint about not excluding from natural event those events in which human activity had only a little causal effect.nrdc also explained that the grounds for its objection to k arose after the period for public comment and are of central relevance to the rule.petition
