the indian reorganization act ira authorizes the secretary of the interior to acquire property for the purpose of providing land to indians.petitioner band of pottawatomi indians band,an indian tribe federally recognized in,requested that the secretary take into trust on its behalf a tract of land known as the bradley property,which the band intended to use for gaming purposes.the secretary took title to the bradley property in.respondent david patchak,who lives near the bradley property,filed suit under the administrative procedure act apa,asserting that did not authorize the secretary to acquire the property because the band was not a federally recognized tribe when the ira was enacted in.patchak alleged a variety of economic,environmental,and aesthetic harms as a result of the band proposed use of the property to operate a casino,and requested injunctive and declaratory relief reversing the secretary decision to take title to the land.the band intervened to defend the secretary decision.the district court did not reach the merits of patchak suit,but ruled that he lacked prudential standing to challenge the secretary acquisition of the bradley property.the circuit reversed and also rejected the secretary and the band alternative argument that sovereign immunity barred the suit.
the united states has waived its sovereign immunity from patchak action.the apa general waiver of the federal government immunity from suit does not apply if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought by the plaintiff.the government and band contend that the quiet title act qta is such a statute.the qta authorizes and so waives the government sovereign immunity from a suit by a plaintiff asserting a right,title,or interest in real property that conflicts with a right,title,or interest the united states claims.d.but it contains an exception for trust or restricted indian lands.a.
to determine whether the indian lands exception bars patchak suit,the court considers whether the qta addresses the kind of grievance patchak advances.it does not,because patchak action is not a quiet title action.the qta,from its title to its jurisdictional grant to its venue provision,speaks specifically and repeatedly of quiet title actions,a term universally understood to refer to suits in which a plaintiff not only challenges someone else claim,but also asserts his own right to disputed property.although patchak suit contests the secretary title,it does not claim any competing interest in the bradley property.
contrary to the argument of the band and government,the qta does not more broadly encompass any civil action to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the united states claims an interest.a.rather,includes a host of indications that the civil action at issue is an ordinary quiet title suit.the band and government also contend that the qta specific authorization of adverse claimants suits creates the negative implication that like patchak can not challenge government ownership of land under any statute.that argument is faulty for the reason already given patchak is bringing a different claim,seeking different relief,from the kind the qta addresses.finally,the band and government argue that patchak suit should be treated the same as an adverse claimant because both equally implicate the indian lands exception policies.that argument must be addressed to congress.the indian lands exception reflects congress judgment about how far to allow quiet title suits not all suits challenging the government ownership of property.
patchak has prudential standing to challenge the secretary acquisition.a person suing under the apa must assert an interest that is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute that he says was violated.association of data processing service organizations,camp.the government and band claim that patchak economic,environmental,and aesthetic injuries are not within zone of interests because the statute focuses on land acquisition,while patchak injuries relate to the land use as a casino.however,has far more to do with land use than the government and band acknowledge.section is the capstone of the ira land provisions,and functions as a primary mechanism to foster indian tribes economic development.the secretary thus takes title to properties with an eye toward how tribes will use those lands to support such development.the department regulations make this statutory concern with land use clear,requiring the secretary to acquire land with its eventual use in mind,after assessing potential conflicts that use might create.and because encompasses land use,neighbors to the use like patchak are reasonable indeed,predictable challengers of the secretary decisions their interests,whether economic,environmental,or aesthetic,come within regulatory ambit.

justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
a provision of the indian reorganization act ira,authorizes the secretary of the interior secretary to acquire property for the purpose of providing land for indians.ch,stat.the secretary here acquired land in trust for an indian tribe seeking to open a casino.respondent david patchak lives near that land and challenges the secretary decision in a suit brought under the administrative procedure act apa,et.patchak claims that the secretary lacked authority under to take title to the land,and alleges economic,environmental,and aesthetic harms from the casino operation.
we consider two questions arising from patchak action.the first is whether the united states has sovereign immunity from the suit by virtue of the quiet title act qta,stat.we think it does not.the second is whether patchak has prudential standing to challenge the secretary acquisition.we think he does.we therefore hold that patchak suit may proceed.
the band of pottawatomi indians band is an indian tribe residing in rural michigan.although the band has a long history,the department of the interior doi formally recognized it only in.see fed.reg.two years later,the band petitioned the secretary to exercise her authority under by taking into trust a tract of land in wayland township,michigan,known as the bradley property.the band application explained that the band would use the property for gaming purposes,with the goal of generating the revenue necessary to promote tribal economic development,and a strong tribal government capable of providing its members with sorely needed social and educational programs.app,
in,after a lengthy administrative review,the secretary announced her decision to acquire the bradley property in trust for the band.see fed.reg.in accordance with applicable regulations,the secretary committed to wait days before taking action,so that interested parties could seek judicial review.see cfr b.within that window,an organization called michigan gambling opposition or michgo filed suit alleging that the secretary decision violated environmental and gaming statutes.the secretary held off taking title to the property while that litigation proceeded.within the next few years,a district court and the circuit rejected michgo claims.see michigan gambling opposition kempthorne,cadc michigan gambling opposition norton,supp.dc.
shortly after the circuit ruled against michgo but still before the secretary took title,patchak filed this suit under the apa advancing a different legal theory.he asserted that did not authorize the secretary to acquire property for the band because it was not a federally recognized tribe when the ira was enacted in.see app.to establish his standing to bring suit,patchak contended that he lived in close proximity to the bradley property and that a casino there would destroy the lifestyle he has enjoyed by causing increased traffic,increased crime,decreased property values,an irreversible change in the rural character of the area,and other aesthetic,socioeconomic,and environmental problems.at.notably,patchak did not assert any claim of his own to the bradley property.he requested only a declaration that the decision to acquire the land violated the ira and an injunction to stop the secretary from accepting title.see,at.the band intervened in the suit to defend the secretary decision.
in january,about five months after patchak filed suit,this court denied certiorari in michgo case,and the secretary took the bradley property into trust.that action mooted patchak request for an injunction to prevent the acquisition,and all parties agree that the suit now effectively seeks to divest the federal government of title to the land.see brief for band of pottawatomi indians hereinafter tribal petitioner brief for federal petitioners brief for respondent.the month after the government took title,this court held in carcieri salazar,that authorizes the secretary to take land into trust only for tribes that were under federal jurisdiction in 
the district court dismissed the suit without considering the merits including the relevance of carcieri,ruling that patchak lacked prudential standing to challenge the secretary acquisition of the bradley property.the court reasoned that the injuries patchak alleged fell outside zone of interests.supp,dc.the circuit reversed that determination.see.the court also rejected the secretary and the band alternative argument that by virtue of the qta,sovereign immunity barred the suit.see,at.the latter ruling conflicted with decisions of three circuits holding that the united states has immunity from suits like patchak.see neighbors for rational development,norton,metropolitan water dist.of southern cal.united states,per curiam florida of bus.regulation department of interior.we granted certiorari to review both of the circuit holdings,and we now affirm.
we begin by considering whether the united states sovereign immunity bars patchak suit under the apa.that requires us first to look to the apa itself and then,for reasons we will describe,to the qta.we conclude that the united states has waived its sovereign immunity from patchak action.
the apa generally waives the federal government immunity from a suit seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority.that waiver would appear to cover patchak suit,which objects to official action of the secretary and seeks only relief.but the apa waiver of immunity comes with an important the waiver does not apply if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought by the plaintiff.ibid.that provision prevents plaintiffs from exploiting the apa waiver to evade limitations on suit contained in other statutes.the question thus becomes whether another statute bars patchak demand for relief.
the government and band contend that the qta does so.the qta authorizes and so waives the government sovereign immunity from a particular type of action,known as a quiet title suit a suit by a plaintiff asserting a right,title,or interest in real property that conflicts with a right,title,or interest the united states claims.d.the statute,however,contains an exception the qta authorization of suit does not apply to trust or restricted indian lands.a.according to the government and band,that limitation on quiet title suits satisfies the apa and so forbids patchak suit.in the band words,the qta exception retains the united states full immunity from suits seeking to challenge its title to or impair its legal interest in indian trust lands.brief for tribal petitioner.
two hypothetical examples might help to frame consideration of this argument.first,suppose patchak had sued under the apa claiming that he owned the bradley property and that the secretary therefore could not take it into trust.the qta would bar that suit,for reasons just suggested.true,it fits within the apa general waiver,but the qta specifically authorizes quiet title actions which this hypothetical suit is except when they involve indian lands which this hypothetical suit does.in such a circumstance,a plaintiff can not use the apa to the qta limitations.w hen congress has dealt in particularity with a claim and has intended a specified remedy including its exceptions to be exclusive,that is the end of the matter the apa does not undo the judgment.block north dakota ex rel.board of and school lands,quoting.
but now suppose that patchak had sued under the apa claiming only that use of the bradley property was causing environmental harm,and raising no objection at all to the secretary title.the qta could not bar that suit because even though involving indian lands,it asserts a grievance altogether different from the kind the statute concerns.justice scalia,in a former life as assistant attorney general,made this precise point in a letter to congress about the apa waiver of immunity which we hasten to add,given the author,we use not as legislative history,but only for its persuasive force.when a statute is not addressed to the type of grievance which the plaintiff seeks to assert,then the statute can not prevent an apa suit,at may,letter of assistant scalia 
we think that principle controls patchak case the qta indian lands clause does not render the government immune because the qta addresses a kind of grievance different from the one patchak advances.as we will explain,the qta whose full name,recall,is the quiet title act concerns no great surprise quiet title actions.and patchak suit is not a quiet title action,because although it contests the secretary title,it does not claim any competing interest in the bradley property.that fact makes the qta indian lands limitation simply inapposite to this litigation.
in reaching this conclusion,we need look no further than the qta text.from its title to its jurisdictional grant to its venue provision,the act speaks specifically and repeatedly of quiet title actions.see stat.an act t o permit suits to adjudicate certain real property quiet title actions f giving district courts jurisdiction over civil actions to quiet title to property in which the united states claims an interest d setting forth venue for a ny civil action to quiet title to property in which the united states claims an interest.that term is universally understood to refer to suits in which a plaintiff not only challenges someone else claim,but also asserts his own right to disputed property.see,black law dictionary ed.defining an action to quiet title as a proceeding to establish a plaintiff title to land by compelling the adverse claimant to establish a claim or be forever estopped from asserting it grable sons metal products,darue engineering,t he facts showing the plaintiffs title are essential parts of the plaintiffs quiet title cause of action quoting hopkins walker.
and the qta other provisions make clear that the recurrent statutory term quiet title action carries its ordinary meaning.the qta directs that the complaint in such an action shall set forth with particularity the nature of the right,title,or interest which the plaintiff claims in the real property.d.if the plaintiff does not assert any such right as patchak does not,the statute can not come into play further,the qta provides an option for the united states,if it loses the suit,to pay just compensation,rather than return the property,to the person determined to be entitled to it.b.that provision makes perfect sense in a quiet title action if the plaintiff is found to own the property,the government can satisfy his claim through an award of money while still retaining the land for its operations.but the provision makes no sense in a suit like this one,where patchak does not assert a right to the property.if the united states loses the suit,an award of just compensation to the rightful owner whoever and wherever he might be could do nothing to satisfy patchak claim 
in two prior cases,we likewise described the qta as addressing suits in which the plaintiff asserts an ownership interest in property.in block north dakota ex rel.board of and school lands,we considered north dakota claim to land that the united states viewed as its own.we held that the state could not circumvent the qta statute of limitations by invoking other causes of action,among them the apa.see,at.the crux of our reasoning was that congress had enacted the qta to address exactly the kind of suit north dakota had brought.prior to the qta,we explained,citizens asserting title to or the right to possession of lands claimed by the united states had no recourse by passing the statute,congress sought to rectify this state of affairs.at.our decision reflected that legislative purpose congress,we held,intended the qta to provide the exclusive means by which adverse claimants could challenge the united states title to real property.at.we repeat adverse claimants,meaning plaintiffs who themselves assert a claim to property antagonistic to the federal government.
our decision in united states mottaz,is of a piece.there,we considered whether the qta,or instead the tucker act or general allotment act,governed the plaintiff suit respecting certain allotments of land held by the united states.we thought the qta the relevant statute because the plaintiff herself asserted title to the property.our opinion quoted the plaintiff own description of her suit at no time in this proceeding did the plaintiff drop her claim for title.to the contrary,the claim for title is the essence and bottom line of the plaintiff case.at quoting brief for respondent in mottaz.that fact,we held,brought the suit within the qta scope what the plaintiff seeks is a declaration that she alone possesses valid title.at.so once again,we construed the qta as addressing suits by adverse claimants.
but patchak is not an adverse claimant and so the qta more specifically,its reservation of sovereign immunity from actions respecting indian trust lands can not bar his suit.patchak does not contend that he owns the bradley property,nor does he seek any relief corresponding to such a claim.he wants a court to strip the united states of title to the land,but not on the ground that it is his and not so that he can possess it.patchak lawsuit therefore lacks a defining feature of a qta action.he is not trying to disguise a qta suit as an apa action to circumvent the qta indian lands exception.rather,he is not bringing a qta suit at all.he asserts merely that the secretary decision to take land into trust violates a federal statute a apa claim.see a,c the reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action not in accordance with law or in excess of statutory jurisdiction or authority because that is true because in attorney general scalia words,the qta is not addressed to the type of grievance which patchak seeks to assert,at the qta limitation of remedies has no bearing.the apa general waiver of sovereign immunity instead applies.
the band and government,along with the dissent,object to this conclusion on three basic grounds.first,they contend that the qta speaks more broadly than we have indicated,waiving immunity from suits to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the united states claims an interest.a.that language,the argument goes,encompasses all actions contesting the government legal interest in land,regardless whether the plaintiff claims ownership himself.see brief for federal petitioners reply brief for tribal petitioner post,at sotomayor,dissenting.the qta not the apa thus becomes the relevant statute after all as to both its waiver and its corresponding reservation of immunity from suits involving indian lands.reply brief for tribal petitioner.
but the band and government can reach that result only by neglecting key words in the relevant provision.that sentence,more fully quoted,reads the united states may be named as a party defendant in a civil action under this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the united states claims an interest.a emphasis added.and as we have already noted,this section includes a host of indications that the civil action at issue is an ordinary quiet title suit just recall the section title real property quiet title actions and its pleading requirements the plaintiff shall set forth with particularity the nature of the right,title,or interest which he claims and its permission to the government to remedy an infraction by paying just compensation.read with reference to all these provisions as well as to the qta contemporane ously enacted jurisdictional and venue sections,the waiver clause rebuts,rather than supports,the band and the government argument that clause speaks not to any suit in which a plaintiff challenges the government title,but only to an action in which the plaintiff also claims an interest in the property.
the band and government next invoke cases holding that when a statute provides a detailed mechanism for judicial consideration of particular issues at the behest of particular persons,the statute may impliedly preclude judicial review of those issues at the behest of other persons.block community nutrition institute,see united states fausto.here,the band and government contend,the qta specific authorization of adverse claimants suits creates a negative implication claimants like patchak can not challenge government ownership of land under any other statute.see reply brief for tribal petitoner reply brief for federal petitioners see also post,at.the qta,says the band,thus preempts patchak more general remedies.brief for tribal petitioner internal quotation marks omitted.
but we think that argument faulty,and the cited cases inapposite,for the reason already given patchak is bringing a different claim,seeking different relief,from the kind the qta addresses.see supra,at.to see the point,consider a contrasting example.suppose the qta authorized suit only by adverse claimants who could assert a property interest of at least a decade duration.then suppose an adverse claimant failing to meet that requirement because,say,his claim to title went back only five years brought suit under a general statute like the apa.we would surely bar that suit,citing the cases the government and band rely on in our imaginary statute,congress delineated the class of persons who could bring a quiet title suit,and that judgment would preclude others from doing so.but here,once again,patchak is not bringing a quiet title action at all.he is not claiming to own the property,and he is not demanding that the court transfer the property to him.so to succeed in their argument,the government and band must go much further than the cited cases they must say that in authorizing one person to bring one kind of suit seeking one form of relief,congress barred another person from bringing another kind of suit seeking another form of relief.presumably,that contention would extend only to suits involving similar subject matter,the government ownership of property.but that commonality is not itself sufficient.we have never held,and see no cause to hold here,that some general similarity of subject matter can alone trigger a remedial statute preclusive effect.
last,the band and government argue that we should treat patchak suit as we would an adverse claimant because they equally implicate the indian lands exception policies.according to the government,allowing challenges to the secretary trust acquisitions would pose significant barriers to tribes ability to promote investment and economic development on the lands.brief for federal petitioners.that harm is the same whether or not a plaintiff claims to own the land himself.indeed,the band argues that the sole difference in this suit cuts in its direction,because claimants like patchak have the most remote injuries and indirect interests in the land.brief for tribal petitioner see reply brief for federal petitioners see also post,at,
that argument is not without force,but it must be addressed to congress.in the qta,congress made a judgment about how far to allow quiet title suits to a point,but no further.the no further includes not only the indian lands exception,but one for security interests and water rights,as well as a statute of limitations,a bar on jury trials,jurisdictional and venue constraints,and the just compensation option discussed earlier.perhaps congress would perhaps congress should make the identical judgment for the full range of lawsuits pertaining to the government ownership of land.but that is not our call.the band assumes that plaintiffs like patchak have a lesser interest than those bringing quiet title actions,and so should be precluded a fortiori.but all we can say is that patchak has a different interest.whether it is lesser,as the band argues,because not based on property rights whether it is greater because implicating public interests or whether it is in the end exactly the same that is for congress to tell us,not for us to tell congress.as the matter stands,congress has not assimilated to quiet title actions all other suits challenging the government ownership of property.and so when a plaintiff like patchak brings a suit like this one,it falls within the apa general waiver of sovereign immunity.
we finally consider the band and the government alternative argument that patchak can not bring this action because he lacks prudential standing.this court has long held that a person suing under the apa must satisfy not only article iii standing requirements,but an additional test the interest he asserts must be arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute that he says was violated.association of data processing service organizations,camp.here,patchak asserts that in taking title to the bradley property,the secretary exceeded her authority under,which authorizes the acquisition of property for the purpose of providing land for indians.and he alleges that this statutory violation will cause him economic,environmental,and aesthetic harm as a nearby property owner.see supra,at.the government and band argue that the relationship between and patchak asserted interests is insufficient.that is so,they contend,because the statute focuses on land acquisition,whereas patchak interests relate to the land use as a casino.see brief for tribal petitioner the secretary decision to put land into trust does not turn on any particular use of the land,gaming or otherwise,and thus has no impact on patchak or his asserted interests brief for federal petitioners l and may be taken into trust for a host of purposes that have nothing at all to do with gaming we find this argument unpersuasive.
the prudential standing test patchak must meet is not meant to be especially demanding.clarke securities industry.we apply the test in keeping with congress evident intent when enacting the apa to make agency action presumptively reviewable.ibid.we do not require any indication of congressional purpose to benefit the plaintiff.at and we have always conspicuously included the word arguably in the test to indicate that the benefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff.the test forecloses suit only when a plaintiff interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it can not reasonably be assumed that congress intended to permit the suit.at.
patchak suit satisfies that standard,because has far more to do with land use than the government and band acknowledge.start with what we and others have said about context and purpose.as the leading treatise on federal indian law notes,is the capstone of the ira land provisions.cohen,handbook of federal indian law a,ed.hereinafter cohen.and those provisions play a key role in the ira overall effort to rehabilitate the indian economic life,mescalero apache tribe jones,internal quotation marks omitted.land forms the basis of that economic life,providing the foundation for tourism,manufacturing,mining,logging,and gaming.cohen,at.section thus functions as a primary mechanism to foster indian tribes economic development.as the circuit explained in the michgo litigation,the section provid es lands sufficient to enable indians to achieve.michigan gambling,at internal quotation marks omitted see morton mancari,noting the ira economic aspect.so when the secretary obtains land for indians under,she does not do so in a vacuum.rather,she takes title to properties with at least one eye directed toward how tribes will use those lands to support economic development.
the department regulations make this statutory concern with land use crystal clear.those regulations permit the secretary to acquire land in trust under if the land is necessary to facilitate tribal,economic development,or indian housing.cfr a.and they require the secretary to consider,in evaluating any acquisition,both t he purposes for which the land will be used and the potential conflicts of land use which may arise.c,f see a.for acquisitions made for business purposes like the bradley property the regulations further provide that the tribe must provide a plan which specifies the anticipated economic benefits associated with the proposed use.c.doi regulations thus show that the statute implementation centrally depends on the projected use of a given property.
the secretary acquisition of the bradley property is a case in point.the band application to the secretary highlighted its plan to use the land for gaming purposes.see app.t rust status for this property is requested in order for the tribe to acquire property on which it plans to conduct gaming at the tribe intends to renovate the existing building into a gaming facility.to offer class ii class iii gaming similarly,doi notice of intent to take the land into trust announced that the land would be used for the purpose of construction and operation of a gaming facility,which the department had already determined would meet the indian gaming regulatory act requirements.fed.reg.so from start to finish,the decision whether to acquire the bradley property under involved questions of land use.
and because implementation encompasses these issues,the interests patchak raises at least arguably fall within the zone protected or regulated by the statute.if the government had violated a statute specifically addressing how federal land can be used,no one would doubt that a neighboring landowner would have prudential standing to bring suit to enforce the statute limits.the difference here,as the government and band point out,is that specifically addresses only land acquisition.but for the reasons already given,decisions under the statute are closely enough and often enough entwined with considerations of land use to make that difference immaterial.as in this very case,the secretary will typically acquire land with its eventual use in mind,after assessing potential conflicts that use might create.see cfr c,f,a.and so neighbors to the use like patchak are reasonable indeed,predictable challengers of the secretary decisions their interests,whether economic,environmental,or aesthetic,come within regulatory ambit.
the qta reservation of sovereign immunity does not bar patchak suit.neither does the doctrine of prudential standing.we therefore affirm the judgment of the circuit,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

justice sotomayor,dissenting.
in enacting the quiet title act qta,congress waived the government sovereign immunity in cases seeking to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the united states claims an interest.a.in so doing,congress was careful to retain the government sovereign immunity with respect to particular claimants,particular categories of land,and particular remedies.congress and the executive branch considered these carefully crafted provisions essential to the immunity waiver and necessary for the protection of the national public interest.block north dakota ex rel.board of and school lands.
the court opinion sanctions an around these vital limitations on the government waiver of sovereign immunity.after today,any person may sue under the administrative procedure act apa to divest the federal government of title to and possession of land held in trust for indian tribes relief expressly forbidden by the qta so long as the complaint does not assert a personal interest in the land.that outcome can not be squared with the apa express admonition that it confers no authority to grant relief if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.the court holding not only creates perverse incentives for private litigants,but also exposes the government ownership of land to costly and prolonged challenges.because i believe those results to be inconsistent with the qta and the apa,i respectfully dissent.
congress enacted the qta to provide a comprehensive solution to the problem of disputes between private parties and the united states.the qta strikes a careful balance between private parties desire to adjudicate such disputes,and the government desire to impose appropriate safeguards on any waiver of sovereign immunity to ensure the protection of the public interest.block,at see also.
section a provides expansively that t he united states may be named as a party defendant in a civil action under this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the united states claims an interest.that language mirrors the title proposed by the executive branch for the legislation that congress largely adopted a bill to permit suits to adjudicate disputed titles to lands in which the united states claims an interest.at.
the remainder of the act,however,imposes important conditions upon the government waiver of sovereign immunity.first,the right to sue does not apply to trust or restricted indian lands.a.the indian lands exception reflects the view that a waiver of immunity in this area would not be consistent with specific commitments the government ha s made to the indians through treaties and other agreements.block,at internal quotation marks omitted.by exempting indian lands,congress ensured that the government solemn obligations to tribes would not be abridg ed without the consent of the indians.at.
second,the act preserves the united states power to retain possession or control of any disputed property,even if a court determines that the government property claim is invalid.to that end,b allow s the united states the option of paying money damages instead of surrendering the property if it lost a case on the merits.block,at.this provision was considered essential to addressing the government main objection in the past to waiving sovereign immunity where federal land was concerned that an adverse judgment would make possible decrees ousting the united states from possession and thus interfer e with operations of the government.at.section b eliminate d cause for such apprehension,by ensuring that even under the qta the united states could not be stripped of its possession or control of property without its consent,at.
finally,the act limits the class of individuals permitted to sue the government to those claiming a right,title,or interest in disputed property.d.as we have explained,congress decision to restrict the class entitled to relief indicates that congress precluded relief for the remainder.see,block community nutrition institute,w hen a statute provides a detailed mechanism for judicial consideration of particular issues at the behest of particular persons,judicial review of those issues at the behest of other persons may be found to be impliedly precluded that inference is especially strong here,because the qta was enacted against the backdrop of sovereign immunity.section d thus indicates that congress concluded that those without any right,title,or interest in a given property did not have an interest sufficient to warrant abrogation of the government sovereign immunity.
congress considered these conditions indispensible to its immunity waiver w hen congress attaches conditions to legislation waiving the sovereign immunity of the united states,those conditions must be strictly observed,and exceptions thereto are not to be lightly implied.block,at.congress and the executive branch intended the scheme to be the exclusive procedure for resolving property title disputes involving the united states.see,at describing act as a careful and thorough remedial scheme at provides a complete,thoughtful approach to the problem of disputed titles to federally claimed land emphasis added.
for that reason,we held that congress did not intend to create a new supplemental remedy when it enacted the apa general waiver of sovereign immunity.block,at.it would require the suspension of disbelief,we reasoned,to ascribe to congress the design to allow its careful and thorough remedial scheme to be circumvented by artful pleading.at quoting brown gsa.if a plaintiff could oust the government of title to land by means of an apa action,all of the carefully crafted provisions of the qta deemed necessary for the protection of the national public interest could be averted,and the indian lands exception to the qta would be rendered nugatory.block,at.we therefore had little difficulty concluding that congress did not intend to render the qta limitations obsolete by affording any plaintiff the right to dispute the government title to any lands by way of an apa action and to empower any such plaintiff to disposses s the united states of the disputed property without being afforded the option of paying damages.at.
it is undisputed that patchak does not meet the conditions to sue under the qta.he seeks to challenge the government title to indian trust land strike one he seeks to force the government to relinquish possession and title outright,leaving it no alternative to pay compensation strike two and he does not claim any personal right,title,or interest in the property strike three.thus,by its express terms,the qta forbids the relief patchak seeks.compare ante,at a ll parties agree that the suit now effectively seeks to divest the federal government of title to the indian trust land with united states mottaz,section a indian lands exclusion operates solely to retain the united states immunity from suit by third parties challenging the united states title to land held in trust for indians consequently,patchak may not avoid the qta constraints by suing under the apa,a statute enacted only four years later.see rendering the apa waiver of sovereign immunity inapplicable if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought 
the majority nonetheless permits patchak to circumvent the qta limitations by filing an action under the apa.it primarily argues that the careful limitations congress imposed upon the qta waiver of sovereign immunity are simply inapposite to actions in which the plaintiff advances a different grievance to that underlying a qta suit,cases in which a plaintiff seeks to strip the united states of title to the land not on the ground that it is his,but rather because the secretary decision to take land into trust violates a federal statute.ante,at.this analysis is unmoored from the text of the apa.
section focuses not on a plaintiff motivation for suit,nor the arguments on which he grounds his case,but only on whether another statute expressly or impliedly forbids the relief he seeks.the relief patchak admittedly seeks to oust the government of title to indian trust land is identical to that forbidden by the qta.conversely,the court hypothetical suit,alleging that the bradley property was causing environmental harm,would not be barred by the qta.see ante,at.that is not because such an action asserts a different grievance,but because it seeks different relief abatement of a nuisance rather than the extinguishment of title 
in any event,the grievance patchak asserts is no different from that asserted in block a case in which we unanimously rejected a plaintiff attempt to avoid the qta restrictions by way of an apa action or the similar device of an officer suit that action,like t
