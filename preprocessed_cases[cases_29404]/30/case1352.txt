background 
statutory history 
in,concerned that drinking water across the country contained unsafe levels of a wide variety of contaminants,congress passed the safe drinking water act sdwa.part c of the act addresses the protection of underground sources of drinking water usdw against contamination by underground injection of effluent to.under the sdwa,the epa promulgates regulations setting parameters for state uic programs.b.state requirements must at least meet,but may also exceed epa requirements for protection.in protecting usdws,d of the sdwa states that 
u nderground injection endangers drinking water sources if such injection may result in the presence in underground water which supplies or can reasonably be expected to supply any public water system of any contaminant,and if the presence of such contaminant may result in such system not complying with any national primary drinking water regulation or may otherwise adversely affect the health of persons.
id.d additionally,epa regulations shall permit or provide for consideration of varying geologic,hydrological,or historical conditions in different states and in different areas within a state.id.b a.
regulatory and procedural history 
the epa has implemented part c of the sdwa at parts.in its initial uic regulations,the epa defined five classes of injection wells.see.the county and municipalities own and operate municipal disposal wells,which inject treated domestic wastewater from a variety of facilities.these constitute one type of class i well,and this is the only class of well at issue in this case 
regulatory requirements vary by well class.however,no injection well may cause the movement of fluid containing any contaminant into usdws,if the presence of that contaminant may cause a violation of any primary drinking water regulation or may otherwise adversely affect the health of persons.a.within this limitation,the epa has recognized several approaches for preventing the endangerment of usdws by underground injection.these include bans on certain types of wells and particular practices,waste isolation,and waste treatment.
currently applied to wells in classes i,ii,and iii,the waste isolation approach keeps injected wastewater from coming into contact with usdws.under this no fluid movement or the no migration standard,any evidence indicat ing the unauthorized movement of any contaminant into a usdw requires the director to prescribe such additional requirements as are necessary to prevent such movement.b.this rule has applied even in the absence of evidence that a usdw has actually been endangered.
because this standard is operationally meaningful,it can be measured or otherwise determined and because it can be achieved through the use of available,good engineering practices,the epa has applied it to wells in classes i,ii,and iii since.consolidated permit regulations,may,to be codified at pt.however,epa regulations have also long recognized the viability of alternative approaches.for instance,the regulations give the permitting authority discretion to relieve existing or new class ii wells in existing injection fields of casing and cementing requirements as long as such wells comply with the casing and cementing regulations extant at the time of drilling or when the field was submitted to the state program for approval,and as long as any resulting movement of fluids into an underground source of drinking water will not create a significant risk to the health of persons.c,d.also,under,class v well operators have discretion to employ a wide range of measures to prevent usdw base,they are prohibited only from injection activities that will result in the presence of a contaminant of concern in a usdw.see.as a result,many such wells inject fluids into and above usdws.consolidated permit regulations.at.the epa recognizes that implementing d in this manner is different from employing the approach,but views it as no more stringent or more inclusive.water programs consolidated permit regulations and technical criteria and standards state underground injection control programs,june,to be codified at pts.and.
standard florida class i municipal disposal wells.
for more than years,florida municipalities have injected large quantities of treated domestic effluent into deep underground caverns as an alternative to surface disposal.the florida department of environmental protection fdep has administered the uic program that regulates class i underground injection wells in florida since.when the fdep first began issuing permits to class i wells,it was thought that these cavernous formations would adequately confine the wastewater,isolating it from usdws.revision to the federal underground injection control uic requirements for class wells in florida,july,proposed rules to be codified at pt.since then,however,groundwater monitoring wells have detected unpermitted fluid movement that has,in some cases,reached usdws.additional investigation has shown this fluid movement to have resulted from a failure of the porous rock around the floridan aquifer adequately to confine the effluent 
alternative approach 
proposed rule 
responding to the detection of this fluid movement and having held a meeting with industry representatives,environmental groups,local governments and other stakeholders,the epa issued a proposed revision of its regulations on july.this revision would have allowed existing class i wells in specific areas in florida to continue to inject if the owners or operators of those wells met certain further treatment requirements.more specifically,the epa proposed two options that were to apply to all existing class i municipal disposal wells that had caused or might cause movement of contaminants into usdws.revision to uic requirements.
option would have allowed the continued use of wells as long as the facility in question provided advanced wastewater treatment,disinfection,and a demonstration to show that the injectate would not cause a usdw to exceed any national primary drinking water regulations or other standards.id.at.this demonstration would have focused on any contaminants that still exceeded the relevant levels after the specified level of advanced wastewater treatment.id.at.it would have required a to identify any such contaminants in the injectate and demonstrate that they would not cause similar exceedences in the usdw at issue.id.the proposal explained that this demonstration requirement could have been satisfied by something as simple as reference to existing technical literature describing rates for viruses and other pathogens,or how metals bind in soils compared to the results of ground water sampling and analysis pursuant to.revision to uic requirements.at.
option would have required facilities to conduct an hydrogeological demonstration that the injection operation would not cause fluids that could migrate into a usdw to exceed any national primary drinking water regulation or other health based standard.id.at.the option demonstration,at a minimum,would have required modeling,geochemical analysis,and effluent and monitoring and analysis.id.if the demonstration were unsuccessful,the facility in question would be required to provide advanced treatment as necessary to ensure that injectate would not cause any violation.id.option also included a sunset provision which would have required disinfection and advanced wastewater treatment at those facilities by regardless of any hydrogeological demonstration.id.at.
the area in which the proposed revision applied included the following counties brevard,broward,charlotte,collier,flagler,glades,hendry,highlands,hillsborough,indian river,lee,manatee,martin,monroe,okeechobee,orange,osceola,palm beach,pinellas,johns,lucie,sarasota,and volusia.these counties were included because their underlying geology is predominated by carbonate geologic condition which generally involves fractures,faults,and solution cavities that provide preferential pathways for the movement of underground fluids.at.at.
in connection with this proposed rule,the epa requested public comment as to whether it should select option,option,or a combination of the two,id.at the most appropriate of four proposed levels of wastewater treatment under option,id.at the need to require pretreatment as an additional condition under option to address contaminants that might move through a treatment system and enter into a usdw at concentrations of concern,id.at whether owners and operators were able to provide the kind of hydrogeological and other information necessary for a successful demonstration under option,whether there was a need for any additional monitoring requirements for the final rule,id.at whether the proposed rule should apply to existing wells only,or also to new wells,id.at with regard to the sunset provision in option,which of the four levels of advanced wastewater treatment and nutrient removal proposed under option should be required,id.at the general need to require pretreatment by industrial users as an additional condition of authorization,extending the industrial pretreatment standards presently required by the fdep,id.at and,finally,comparing the various means of domestic wastewater disposal in florida,and considering the effects those methods have on florida fragile environment,whether this proposal may result in the increased or decreased use of reuse or other disposal practices such as ocean or other surface water disposal,id.at the epa received just under comments and also held a series of public meetings during the comment period.
risk assessment 
the same year the proposed options were published,congress directed the epa to study the relative risks of deep well injection,ocean disposal,surface discharge,and aquifer recharge of treated effluent in south florida.in april,the epa published a relative risk assessment risk assessment.therein the epa confirmed that effluent from some florida class i wells had migrated out of the permitted injection zones and,in a few instances,into usdws.at.the study also concluded that each alternative disposal method posed enough risk to human health and the environment that none was clearly preferable to underground injection.at.
the epa issued a notice of data availability noda as to the risk assessment and its underlying data on may and requested public comment as to the potential impact of the risk assessment on the july proposed options.underground injection control of underground injection control requirements for class i municipal wells in florida notice of data availability.may,proposed rules to be codified at pt.specifically,the epa also asked for comments on an alternative option for defining the appropriate level of wastewater treatment required for continued injection the proposed rule had suggested specific levels of biochemical oxygen demand with disinfection,some also involving nutrient removal the practicability and feasibility of option as as it incorporated an hydrogeological any suggestions for viable alternatives to the sunset provision requiring treatment by and the possibility of reclassifying certain class i wells as class v wells,thereby requiring them to meet higher wastewater treatment standards instead of changing the standards for all class i wells.id.at.the epa received a little over additional comments in response to the risk assessment noda.
final rule 
the epa published a final rule revising its uic regulations on november.according to this rule,which took effect on december,owners and operators of existing class i municipal wells have a choice they may continue to operate under the standard,assuming their wells have not been deemed likely to cause fluid movement.if their effluent reaches a usdw,they face the consequences under that standard as originally promulgated.underground injection control to the federal underground injection control requirements for class i municipal disposal wells in florida,to be codified at pt.or,they may continue their operations,despite evidence of fluid movement,as long as,within five years after december,they meet additional treatment requirements.id.in publishing this final rule,the epa explained that these new secondary treatment and disinfection provide usdws a level of protection equivalent to that afforded by the standard at.the final rule further requires that owners and operators with significant industrial users implement a pretreatment program that meets certain florida standards designed to prevent industrial contaminants from endangering the public.finally,the final rule applies to all existing and new class i wells in the specified area.underground injection control.at.the epa observed that the final rule was essentially a modified version of option of the july proposed rule and explained that the demonstration requirement had been eliminated because the final rule had adopted a treatment standard which would necessarily eliminate any concern about microorganisms remaining after treatment.id.at.the epa further explained that uncertainties about the geology of certain counties in florida make demonstrations inadequate to fully characterize or predict movement of pathogens in the subsurface and for this reason,the demonstration option provided in the proposed rule is not an appropriate way of ensuring.at.
petitions for review 
the sierra club,county and palm beach city filed timely petitions for review of this final rule on january,pursuant to a.the next day,city of cooper city,city of miramar,city of sunrise,city of lauderdale and city of margate also filed timely petitions for review.the municipalities petitions were consolidated with the county in february,and sierra club petition was,in turn,consolidated with the all of those in march.
sierra club 
sierra club argues that the final rule is inconsistent with the definition of endangerment set out in the sdwa.more specifically,sierra club reasons,the new regulation fails to protect usdws as the standard did.sierra club also argues that the epa interpretation of the statute as embodied by the final rule is arbitrary and capricious and unsupported by the risk assessment or public comments.sierra club is particularly concerned that secondary treatment and disinfection,while they might take care of biological pathogens,fail to address the potential entry of industrial and other contaminants into usdws.
the county and the municipalities 
the county argues,on the other hand,that the final rule exceeds the regulatory authority given the epa by the sdwa.specifically,the county argues that the rule impermissibly broadens the definition of endangerment.like sierra club,both the county and the municipalities also argue that the rule is arbitrary and capricious and unsupported by the risk assessment and public comments.both argue that the final rule fails to take into account geographically varied geology as mandated by the sdwa.the county is concerned that the final rule improperly assumes pathogens will flow into the biscayne aquifer and that the proper standard is whether there is an impact on public water systems,not aquifers.the municipalities particularly complain that the risk assessment was methodologically flawed in specific ways 
administrative procedure act 
two sets of petitioners also argue that the epa failed to comply with the notice and comment requirements of the apa.the sierra club complains that the final rule abandonment of any demonstration provision is not a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule and its notice and comment process.the municipalities similarly argue that the proposed rule and its comment process left them insufficient notice of the final rule application to all future class i wells.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
a final action by the epa is subject to a highly deferential standard of judicial review under the apa.thereunder we must hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see also sierra club,leavitt,cir.
apa notice requirement 
as an initial matter,we address the complaints by the sierra club and the municipalities that they received insufficient notice of certain components of the final rule.the apa requires that agencies publish notice of their proposed rulemaking and afford the public an opportunity to comment.b c.
the apa notice requirements are designed to ensure that agency regulations are tested via exposure to diverse public comment,to ensure fairness to affected parties,and to give affected parties an opportunity to develop evidence in the record to support their objections to the rule and thereby enhance the quality of judicial review.

abandonment of demonstration requirement 
the sierra club challenges the final rule elimination of any demonstration requirement.first,the epa initially solicited general comments on its proposed approaches for regulating class injection wells in south florida.then,in its notice of data availability,it specifically requested further comment on whether,given the findings of the risk assessment,the type of hydrogeologic demonstrations set out in option of the proposed rule were practicable and feasible.underground injection control.at.all interested parties,including sierra club,had ample opportunity to comment.the commentary provided ample support for the proposition that the technical challenges and factual uncertainties would generally prevent a convincing hydrogeological demonstration of wastewater fate and transport as described in originally proposed option.see at.accordingly,elimination of this demonstration requirement in the promulgation of the final rule constitutes a logical outgrowth of the proposal and comments.see ass of battery recyclers,at horsehead res.dev,at.
however,sierra club is also concerned about notice of elimination of the demonstration which was part of option of the july proposed rule.first,it is true that neither the epa,nor any other party,has pointed to any evidence that the epa specifically put this element of option up for comment,as it did with the demonstration required under proposed option it is also true that no party has pointed to any comment specifically addressing the simplified requirement in such a way as to make it clear that commenters considered it independently at issue.each of these would weigh in favor of our finding the final rule not to be a logical outgrowth.see ne.waste,at first am.discount,at horsehead resource dev,at.however,the record as a whole weighs otherwise.
first,both environmental groups and municipal entities commented on the inherent unreliability of the hydrogeological demonstration proposed for option,and so on its insufficiency as a tool to protect usdws.supp.appx.comment of leaf epa is proposing to rely on a process,involving demonstrations through models and review and by government,that has been proven fundamentally deficient in ensuring compliance with the sdwa,comment of florida chapter,sierra club the epa is repeating reliance on demonstrations that are not,comment of hillsborough county,florida it will not always be possible to perform a detailed analysis to demonstrate whether or not a class i municipal well would cause violation of primary standards in the usdw because of uncertainty about movement of water in subsurface florida.at comment of leaf the hydrogeological demonstration proposed in option is worthless.but see at fwea utility council supporting option demonstration.second,advanced wastewater treatment and disinfection have been shown,by the risk assessment,effectively to eliminate pathogens the contaminants of concern according to the risk assessment.at.therefore,it is only logical to conclude,in the face of the significantly higher treatment levels adopted in the final rule,that the simplified,demonstration has essentially become irrelevant.in other words,the final rule operates on the principle that the only way to demonstrate is to meet the specified higher treatment requirements.for these reasons,we find,as to the elimination of the requirement,that the final rule is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule and its notice and comment period northeast maryland waste,at ass of am,at see also long island care at home.at thomas,at.
even if we had found the final rule not to have been a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule,sierra club would also need to show that it was prejudiced by the lack of opportunity to comment.b efore we may vacate an agency action for procedural failure during the period,we must take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.indep.drivers ass n,fed.motor carrier safety,quoting.to show prejudicial error,a petitioner must indicate with reasonable specificity,the aspect of the rule to which it objects and how it might have responded if given the opportunity.id.at base,the petitioner must demonstrate that on remand,it can mount a credible challenge and was thus prejudiced by the absence of an opportunity to do so before the agency.id.quotations and citations omitted.
in this case,although the sierra club has specified the aspect of the final rule to which it objects,it has failed to address how it would have mounted a credible challenge to the elimination of the simplified demonstration.see id.in its briefs,the sierra club has argued that,had it known the demonstration requirement was at issue,it could have submitted specific scientific evidence,including expert testimony on the full range of dangerous contaminants remaining in wastewater following treatment,the inability of the required treatment to remove those contaminants,and the potential health effects from exposure to such contaminants through drinking water.sierra club br.at.it also stated that w ithout the demonstration,option is but a shell of its former self.sierra club reply br.at.it offers nothing more specific.
further,throughout this process,sierra club has essentially argued that nothing short of enforcement of the standard will satisfy the statutory requirements of the sdwa.additionally,in its initial brief,sierra club conceded that it believed the demonstration of option,as proposed,would be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion and contrary to law in violation of a.sierra club br.at.accordingly,it is not credible for the sierra club also to argue that the simplified demonstration proposed in option would have provided additional value in protecting underground drinking water.finally,in arguing against the adoption of either of the proposed rules,the sierra club has had ample opportunity to make all of its arguments regarding the range of dangerous contaminants remaining in wastewater following treatment and their potential health effects.id.at.the epa,in turn,has considered and responded based on the data gained through its risk assessment and other comments.see underground injection control.accordingly,we conclude that,even if there were inadequate notice,the sierra club has failed to show the necessary prejudicial error as to insufficient notice of elimination of the demonstration requirement.
application of rule to all existing and future wells 
the municipalities argue that the proposed rule would have applied only to existing wells that had demonstrated fluid movement while the final rule,without providing adequate notice,applies to every new injection well.in the preamble to the proposed rule,however,the epa specifically requested comment on whether this proposed rule should apply to existing wells only,or if this proposed rule should also apply to new wells.revision to uic requirements.at.that this was sufficient notice to raise the issue of the scope of the proposed rule is borne out by several comments on the scope of the rule.see at epa summary of comments see also,at reef relief at theresa foley.thus,not only did the epa provide adequate notice,but several concerned parties filed comments related to the proposed scope of the rule,further demonstrating the adequacy of that notice.see ne.waste,at horsehead res.dev,at.because the final rule meets all apa notice requirements,we proceed to examine the rule itself.
endangerment under the sdwa 
the sierra club,the municipalities,and the county argue,from opposing positions,that the concept of endangerment of usdws embodied in the final rule is inconsistent with that outlined by the sdwa.
congressional intent 
when issues of statutory construction are raised,a court must first determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.if congress did not express its intent unambiguously,we defer to the agency interpretation if it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.legal envtl.assistance,epa,cir quoting chevron,at.at.accordingly,we recognize that when an agency is charged with administering a statute,part of the authority it receives is the power to give reasonable content to the statute textual ambiguities in other words,the authority to fill gaps.dep t of treasury,irs fed.labor relations,d see also walther bauknecht,cir unpublished per curiam chevron deference is a tool of statutory construction whereby courts are instructed to defer to the reasonable interpretations of expert agencies charged by congress to fill any gap left,implicitly or explicitly,in the statutes they administer.citation omitted.
under the first level of chevron analysis,we employ the traditional tools of statutory construction to determine congressional intent.see chevron,at.at.these tools include examination of the text of the statute,its structure,and its stated purpose.see ass of state util.consumer advocates fcc,cir,cert.denied,sprint nextel ass of state util.consumer advocates,d.
the relevant statutory text is as follows 
underground injection endangers drinking water sources if such injection may result in the presence in underground water which supplies or can reasonably be expected to supply any public water system of any contaminant,and if the presence of such contaminant may result in such system not complying with any national primary drinking water regulation or may otherwise adversely affect the health of persons.
d.despite this lengthy definition of endangerment,d does not directly speak to precisely how the epa should balance risks in promulgating regulations protecting usdws.see chevron,at.at see also goldstein sec,a definition only clarifies,however,to the extent of its defining terms.instead,congress made the epa responsible for regulating underground injection that may result in the presence of contaminants in underground water,if the presence of such contaminants may result in the violation of drinking water regulations or may otherwise adversely affect public health.d emphasis added.through repeated reference to the possibility that a usdw could be endangered,congress established no particular metric for evaluating endangerment.instead,it explicitly left the epa to give specific meaning to the endangerment standard.see,b providing for the epa publication of minimum requirements for effective state programs to prevent underground injection which endangers drinking water sources within the meaning of subsection d of this section.
this conclusion is consistent with the idea that,in the context of environmental legislation and otherwise,a determination of endangerment to public health is necessarily a question of policy that is to be based on an assessment of risks and that should not be bound by either the procedural or the substantive rigor proper for questions of fact.ethyl epa,en banc addressing the clean air act.recognizing,in this context,that it was not necessarily the best equipped to make such an analysis,congress left determination of the most appropriate standards to the expertise of the agency.thus,we conclude that the sdwa delegated to the epa the type of gapfilling authority entitled to further analysis under chevron.see dep t of treasury,at.at.
the county and the municipalities also argue that the final rule concept of endangerment nevertheless exceeds the authority granted by the sdwa by protecting more than it is authorized to protect.however,although the language in d does frame the epa regulatory authority,it can not be read explicitly to restrict that authority to circumstances where risk of contamination to usdws or public water supplies is all but certain,or even to restrict that authority according to a particular metric the statute precautionary purpose is clear and the actual contamination of drinking water is not a prerequisite either for the establishment of regulations or permit requirements or for the enforcement thereof.see rep,at,reprinted in.
at the other end of the spectrum,the sierra club argument that the final rule is contrary to the authority delegated by the the statute requires a also fail.as the sierra club points out,the legislative history indicates that endangerment is to be liberally construed so as to effectuate the preventative and public health protective purposes of the bill.id.however,despite this evidence that the statutory language was intended for liberal construction,no mention is made of a blanket standard.further,congress has explicitly incorporated or no migration standards into other similar statutes.see,resource,conservation and recovery act rcra,d incorporating a no migration standard for land disposal of hazardous wastes.it could have done so here as well,but has apparently chosen not to do so.we therefore proceed to the second level of chevron analysis.
epa interpretation of the sdwa 
an agency construction of a statute is deemed reasonable if it is not arbitrary,capricious,or clearly contrary to law.power ferc,cir.an agency rule is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto.ins,d rivers coalition kempthorne,cir.
where a statute is precautionary in nature,the evidence difficult to come by,uncertain,or conflicting because it is on the frontiers of scientific knowledge,the regulations designed to protect the public health,and the decision that of an expert administrator,we will not demand rigorous proof of cause and effect.ethyl,at.this standard upholds agency actions as long as there is a rational basis for the agency decision.arango dep t of treasury,cir,thomas,cir.the reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency but must,instead,defer to the agency technical expertise.city of oxford,cir.indeed,courts must be extremely deferential when an agency decision rests on the evaluation of complex scientific data within the agency technical expertise.new york reilly.in such a situation,although a reviewing court may not rubber stamp an agency decision,it must look at the agency decision not as the chemist,biologist,or statistician that it is qualified neither by training nor experience to be,but as a reviewing court exercising certain minimal standards of rationality.chemical mfrs.ass epa,cir quoting am.paper inst.epa,cir quoting ethyl,at.
further,the epa is compelled to exercise its judgment in the face of scientific uncertainty unless that uncertainty is so profound that it precludes any reasoned judgment.see massachusetts epa,d recognizing this obligation in the context of the uncertainty concerning global climate change.even probative preliminary data not yet certifiable as fact may provide an appropriate basis for promulgation of regulations.ethyl,at.generally,it is only when a model bears no rational relationship to the characteristics of the data to which it is applied that we will hold that the use of the model was arbitrary and capricious.appalachian power epa,per curiam.
just than an instant in geologic the epa first promulgated its regulations under the sdwa,it became apparent that the standard was not viable after all for many parts of southern florida.fluid movement resulting from the operation of certain class i wells was violating applicable uic regulations.since that violation was a function of geology,and therefore not amenable to technological correction,the affected wells were unable to comply with the statute and would have had to cease operating.see underground injection control.at.in some instances,closure of the wells would have disrupted municipalities sole method of disposing of millions of gallons of wastewater per day.see at.to address this problem,the epa created a regulatory alternative to the standard allowing facilities unable fully to isolate wastewater injectate instead to apply advanced wastewater treatment and disinfection prior to injection the parties argue from opposing positions that the epa new rule is arbitrary,capricious,and unsupported by the record.
a rule is arbitrary and strict enough 
i failure to consider contaminants 
we first address the sierra club argument that the final rule is inconsistent with a reasonable interpretation of the statutory provision because it does not address the possible presence of contaminants in the treated injectate,such as radioactive,pharmaceutical,industrial and other hazardous wastes,particularly those from industrial users.sierra club asserts that the epa focus on the primary risk associated with pathogenic microorganisms entirely failed to consider the risks of these other pollutants,and thus is arbitrary and capricious.sierra club reply at.
the epa risk assessment models,however,show that representative contaminants will not migrate into usdws,which are located above points of injection,in quantities great enough to exceed maximum acceptable contaminant levels mcls.see at.the sierra club argues that this can not be reconciled with the risk assessment acknowledgment of a lack of precise data regarding the transport of contaminants underground.however,the risk assessment included a risk characterization using a transportation model to predict the potential final concentrations of certain representative contaminants.that model accounted for various risk mitigation factors,such as the variety of natural chemical and physical processes to which injectate is subject after injection,including biodegradation,hydrolysis,sorption,volatization,radioactive decay,transformation,and chemical or biological stabilization,which tend to mitigate the risk of endangerment.see at the model also employed conservative assumptions as to rates of travel through the subsurface formations the study still showed that usdws above points of injection would not exceed mcls for chemical or exceed criteria for ammonia.at.on this basis,the risk assessment concluded that pathogens were the only threat that would not be adequately addressed by the lower treatment requirements in place at the time of the study.at.the epa raised treatment requirements to address this problem.we therefore conclude that the epa model bears a rational relationship to the characteristics of the data to which it was applied and thus is not arbitrary or capricious.see appalachian power,at.
further,the final rule does,in fact,specifically address the potential for contaminants.first,the final rule requires that facilities with significant industrial users implement industrial pretreatment owners and operators must either pretreat or certify that there are no significant industrial users,consistent with the standards set in rule of the florida admin.code.underground injection control.at.thus,any industrial waste rising above this level would necessarily be pretreated to florida reclaimed water standards 
the epa has also generally explained that the final rule does not require all facilities to institute treatment targeting these other specific contaminants for four basic reasons.first,the risk assessment found that the only contaminants that posed a potential threat to usdws were pathogenic microorganisms.second,class i wells are already prohibited from injecting listed or characteristically hazardous waste streams in the first place.third,each such well is allowed to inject only wastewater that has received the level of treatment specified in its individual permit,as deemed necessary to prevent endangerment.finally,many other contaminants are already addressed through the epa existing pretreatment regulations,and any future apparent threat could be addressed on an individual basis.on these and the preceding bases,we conclude that the epa has a reasonable basis for the final rule approach to contaminants.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.at kempthorne,at.
more generally,the sierra club asserts that the final rule fails to address the existence of several potential threats to human health posed by pathogens,nutrients,and other contaminants,arguing from the position that all such risks should be analyzed and eliminated prior to injection.however,the sdwa mandates only that the epa protect against endangerment to usdws,not necessarily against contaminants extant at the point of injection.this distinction allows for the consideration of factors that would mitigate risks between the point of injection and contact with a usdw.in other words,because wastewater is injected below usdws,it must travel upwards to make contact.as discussed,in making that journey,the injectate is subject to a variety of chemical and physical processes that mitigate risk.underground injection control.at.the epa risk assessment modeling employed conservative estimates of the exposure of injectate to these mitigating factors thereby,if anything,overestimating risk.at.the epa risk characterization indicated that although total suspended solids,color,odor,nutrient contamination,byproducts of disinfection,and industrial discharge contamination might remain problematic at the point of injection even after the final rule required treatment,by the time the treated injectate was likely to come into contact with a usdw,that risk would have been sufficiently mitigated.at.accordingly,we conclude that the sierra club objections fail to invalidate the final rule.
ii impermissible consideration of alternative methods 
the sierra club would also have us invalidate the final rule on the ground that the epa impermissibly considered the utility of underground injection of waste in comparison with other disposal options.because congress specifically directed the epa to analyze and compare the relative risks of these options in its risk assessment,consideration of that factor was not only permissible,but mandated.at within available funds,the conferees direct epa to conduct a relative risk assessment of injection,ocean disposal,surface discharge,and aquifer recharge of treated effluent in south florida,in close cooperation with the florida department of environmental protection and south florida municipal water utilities.accordingly,there is no basis for invalidating the final rule on this ground.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.at.

the municipalities and county first complain that the final rule fails to take into account differences in florida geology and hydrology,as required by the sdwa.the record reflects that the subsurface environment in southern florida is characterized by cavernous formations overlain by permeable carbonate rock,which,in places,prevents attainment of the standard.these carbonate the floridan aquifer itself,which underlies most of florida as well as portions of neighboring characterized by significantly variable porosity and permeability resulting from fracturing and other geologic processes that occur after formation.revision to uic requirements.at.because these processes continue to take place due to subsurface fluid movement,the extent to which any given portion of the formation is permeable at any given time is not easily predicted.the epa has restricted application of the final rule to counties characterized by this type of underground geology which may not reliably confine and isolate injected wastewater from usdws.accordingly,we conclude that the epa consideration of variation within the subsurface geology of south florida was sufficient.
the county also argues that the epa improperly failed to consider the presence of the confining hawthorne layer,which likely effectively isolates the biscayne aquifer from the floridan aquifer,when it applied the final rule to county.however,the epa is charged with protecting the floridan aquifer itself because portions of that aquifer are designated a usdw,even though county does not currently draw from it.see underground injection control.see also,reprinted in at.the committee seeks to protect not only sources of drinking water,but also potential drinking water sources for the future.this may include water sources which presently exceed minimum intake water quality requirements or maximum contaminant levels or which are not presently accessible for use as a community drinking water supply source.accordingly,we conclude that neither argument has pointed to evidence of insufficient consideration of geologic variation.
ii flawed methodology 
the municipalities argue that the final rule is not supported by the record due to four alleged flaws in the risk assessment methodology failure to consider the concentration of contaminants already present in the aquifers,failure to employ a quantitative probabilistic risk analysis methodology,failure to consider the results of a university of miami study of practices,and faulty assumptions about contaminant plumes.these criticisms are based on a review of the risk assessment performed by two scholars,a geologist,and a public utilities manager.
the review,however,fails directly to support these criticisms.as an initial matter,it directly states that the risk assessment general approach and methodology were generally appropriate for the problem addressed.at.as for the four specific criticisms,first,the risk assessment did incorporate the limited data available at the time of the study regarding the quality of groundwater prior to construction and operation of injection wells.at.the epa also analyzed current and historic groundwater monitoring for the representative,for example,observing a period of fecal coliform spikes in the which was finally alleviated by well disinfection.at.
second,although it is true that the epa did not perform a quantitative probabilistic risk analysis,even the review,as noted,states that the risk assessment methodology was appropriate for the problem it addressed.at.also,the law does not require selection of the single best methodology in any case,but only a study based on a consideration of the relevant factors and in the construction of which there has been no clear error of judgment.citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d,abrogated on other grounds,califano sanders,d.
the epa concedes that the nature of the available data left it unable to perform a quantitative probabilistic risk analysis of the type suggested in the review,but argues that it performed the most rigorous analysis possible given the available data.according to the risk assessment,microbial pathogens in the aquifer will likely not degrade at as great a rate as they would in surface water.at.the uncertainty as to this rate of degradation was coupled with general uncertainty stemming from the variable carbonate geology.explaining that it is much easier and more efficient to prevent groundwater contamination than to try to decontaminate it later,the epa addressed these uncertainties by making conservative assumptions regarding rates of degradation and travel of effluent through the subsurface environment.the use of this methodology is a legitimate discretionary decision on the part of the epa.see am.iron steel inst.epa,per curiam i t is within epa discretion to decide that in the wake of uncertainty,it would be better to give the values a conservative bent rather than err on the other side.reilly,at.
third,even according to the review,the findings of the risk assessment are not inconsistent with those of the miami study at.whether or not this is the case,even though the epa was obligated to employ the best science,it had no absolute obligation to incorporate the findings of any other particular study because the epa was conducting an independent risk assessment.see.office of pub.util.counsel fcc,cir an agency need not respond to every study,and only has to address significant comments.quotations omitted hughes river watershed conservancy johnson,cir agency need not consider every study as long as it addresses specific concerns raised by comments citing roanoke river basin ass hudson,cir stating that an agency is required only to address specific concerns and explain why it found them unpersuasive.
fourth,the municipalities claim that the risk assessment makes flawed assumptions as to conductivity rates in different risk scenarios and the rate of dilution of contaminant plumes.due to uncertainties resulting from limited availability of data,the epa again chose the most conservative,protective approach in modeling its assumptions as to dilution and conductivity rates.this is permissible.see am.iron steel,at.it applied different conductivity rates in light of both known geologic characteristics of subsurface florida such as porous and more confining material,and the existence of fractures and fissures and the geologic uncertainties about exactly what exists where within the aquife
