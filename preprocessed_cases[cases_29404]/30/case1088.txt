casey ruud petitions for review of a decision of the department of labor dol administrative review board arb approving the settlement of his whistleblower retaliation complaint against westinghouse hanford pursuant to the clean air act,b,and the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla,b.in approving the settlement agreement,the arb acted on behalf of the secretary of labor under the authority of both the clean air act and cercla.the clean air act provides for immediate review in the court of appeals,while cercla does not.this case thus raises a knotty jurisdictional question where an agency issues a decision that has two or more distinct bases of authority providing separate paths of judicial review,does the appellate court have jurisdiction to review the entire proceeding we hold that it does.
as we decide in this opinion only a jurisdictional question,we provide only the briefest of factual summaries 
while employed at a westinghouse hanford nuclear facility,ruud raised concerns about unsafe designs,quality assurance,and environmental and radiological requirements and conditions.in february,ruud filed a dol complaint alleging retaliatory harassment,discrimination,and discharge by westinghouse hanford.ruud initially entered into a settlement of the complaint,but the arb did not initially approve this settlement.ruud later took the position that the settlement should be disapproved and the complaint adjudicated instead on the merits.after many years of administrative unusually prolonged for reasons not here finally obtained a final,albeit negative,administrative determination of his attempt to undo the settlement.ruud now petitions this court for review of the arb decision to enter into a settlement of his complaint although the parties do not contest this court jurisdiction,we must independently satisfy ourselves that jurisdiction exists.see united states,cir.
in entering into the settlement,the arb relied upon the secretary authority under the clean air act,b,as well as her authority under cercla,b.under the clean air act,any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued under the act may obtain review in the court of appeals for the circuit in which the violation originally occurred.see c.cercla,however,provides for original jurisdiction in the district court.see b and b.this court has not yet had occasion to consider whether we may exercise jurisdiction where the agency decision under review was rendered pursuant to both the agency authority under a statute providing for original jurisdiction in the district court and its authority under a statute providing for immediate review in the court of appeals 
several circuits addressing this question have held that where an agency decision has more than one basis of authority,one of which provides for review in the court of appeals,considerations of judicial economy and consistency justify review of the entire proceeding by the court of appeals.see int l of teamsters pe√±a,holding that where a challenged agency rule was issued pursuant to the authority of two statutes providing for separate paths of judicial review,the court of appeals may exercise jurisdiction over the entire petition sutton dep t of,cir holding that the court of appeals had exclusive jurisdiction over an agency determination based in substantial part on a statutory provision providing for exclusive review by a court of appeals suburban comm dole,cir when an agency decision has two distinct bases,one of which provides for exclusive jurisdiction in the courts of appeals,the entire decision is reviewable in the appellate court see also conoco,skinner,cir noting that appellate jurisdiction over the entire matter would be proper as long as the court had exclusive jurisdiction over one of the challenged regulations,citing suburban comm n.as the circuit has reasoned,a bifurcated approach might lead to confusion and unnecessary duplication.shell oil fed l energy regulatory comm n,see also richard pierce,administrative law treatise ed.courts go to considerable lengths to adopt interpretations of jurisdictional statutes that avoid the potential for duplication of effort and conflicts between district courts and circuit courts.
the approach of these courts is consistent with a venerable history of judicially created doctrines acknowledging the need in some cases for the pragmatic application of jurisdictional principles.for example,under the doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction,the courts have long held that a federal district court may decide claims that would otherwise be outside the scope of the judicial power set forth in article iii,of the united states constitution,such as those involving state issues in cases.see,osborn bank of united states,wheat.suggesting that a federal court has the power to decide nonfederal issues arising in case raising federal questions siler louisville nashville railroad.holding that the district court had the right to decide the plaintiff nonfederal claims where a federal question was raised in good faith moore new york cotton exchange.permitting exercise of ancillary jurisdiction over nonfederal counterclaims in a federal case united mine workers of america gibbs,d setting forth common nucleus of operative fact test for exercise of pendent jurisdiction 
the courts have fashioned practical jurisdictional doctrines in the appellate context as well.under the collateral order doctrine,an appellate court may review a decision that would not ordinarily be considered final,as required by,if the decision meets certain other criteria.see cohen beneficial industrial loan.decision is reviewable if it is conclusive,resolves important questions separate from the merits,and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment see also digital equipment desktop direct,d the collateral order doctrine is best understood not as an exception to the final decision rule laid down by congress in,but as a practical construction of it.quoting cohen,at.even where an issue can not independently be reviewed on interlocutory appeal because it does not meet the requirements of or the collateral order doctrine,an appellate court may nonetheless review the issue if it is inextricably intertwined with or necessary to ensure meaningful review of an issue over which it does have jurisdiction.see cunningham gates,cir quoting swint chambers county comm n,d.
the question before us deals not with supplemental district court or pendent appellate jurisdiction,of course,but with the exercise of jurisdiction over a petition for review of a decision for which original jurisdiction is vested in part in the court of appeals and in part in the district court.there is no question that the federal courts have the power to decide this case.there is also no question that the appellate court has jurisdiction over the agency decision insofar as it rests upon a statute providing for original jurisdiction in the courts of appeals.the reasoning that animates the district court supplemental and appellate pendent jurisdiction cases is nonetheless instructive here in some instances,two issues are so closely interrelated that they should be heard in a single forum.see,gibbs,at.if a plaintiff claims are such that he would ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding,then there is power in federal courts to hear the whole cunningham,at two issues are inextricably intertwined if we must decide the pendent issue in order to decide the issue properly on interlocutory appeal,or if resolution of the appealable issue necessarily decides the pendent issue in this case,ruud petition for review is best adjudicated in one proceeding because it challenges a single,indivisible though the decision was based on the agency authority under two different statutes.
permitting consolidated review in the court of appeals makes particularly good sense in light of the relative positions of appellate courts and district courts.first,an appellate court has clear appellate jurisdiction even where the district court has exclusive original jurisdiction,whereas the converse is not true.int l of teams
