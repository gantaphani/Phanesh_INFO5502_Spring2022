a perceptive governor once noted benjamin franklin said there were only two things certain in life death and taxes.but i like to add a third certainty trash.the instant case arises out of the federal government efforts to deal with this third certainty in the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act of cercla.congress enacted cercla to address the risks associated with the improper storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances.to minimize these risks,congress established a fund to finance cleanup of some sites and required certain responsible parties to reimburse either the fund or the parties who paid for the cleanup.midlantic bank dep t of envtl,d.
cercla passage ignited controversy over whether responsible persons could seek contribution for cleanup costs from other responsible parties.to address this uncertainty,congress added an explicit right of contribution,cercla f,in the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of,stat.the supreme court recently clarified,however,that a potentially responsible party may seek contribution under f only if the party has already been sued under cercla.see cooper,aviall,d.
the threshold issue in the instant case is whether a potentially responsible party that may not seek contribution under f may nevertheless recover in indemnity under another section of cercla a and,if so,whether plaintiff william schaefer initiated this action within the applicable statute of limitations.we hold that,while this circuit most recent view of the statute allows schaefer to bring this claim as a cost recovery action under a,schaefer failed to initiate this action for remedial costs within the applicable limitations period.in so holding,we reject schaefer recommendation that we adopt a rule based either on the ultimate approval of a remedial action plan or on the closure of the landfill.we conclude that the limitations period for remedial actions begins,as the plain language of the statute instructs,from the initiation of physical construction of the remedial action.cercla g b.
background 
over four decades ago,william schaefer opened the genesee sand gravel landfill the landfill in ontario county in western new york.in,schaefer contracted with the town of victor the town to operate the landfill.the landfill operated continuously between and april,during which time schaefer accepted waste from several of the defendants.for example,schaefer contracted with the town of victor to provide landfill services for the town between july,and november.the town,in turn,gave permission to defendant hartman material handling systems,hartman material,a now dissolved new york corporation then managed by defendant philip hartman hartman,to dispose of waste at the landfill.schaefer also entered into multiple agreements with the village of victor the village to dispose of solid waste between and.additionally,defendant mendon disposal,mendon disposal,another dissolved new york corporation,which was the predecessor of defendant waste management of new jersey,waste management,allegedly deposited solid waste at the landfill.
schaefer environmental troubles began in the early when he attempted to renew his landfill operating permit with the new york state department of environmental conservation dec.the dec had issued schaefer a permit in allowing him to operate the landfill until october.in september of,schaefer submitted an application for renewal of this permit and,over the next several years,schaefer and the dec negotiated the terms of the pending permit renewal.
the dec later advised schaefer that his renewal application was deficient.specifically,the dec discovered that schaefer landfill was located over a principal aquifer an underground bed of earth,gravel,and porous stone that yields groundwater.concerned over potential groundwater contamination,the dec notified schaefer that the landfill would have to be closed unless it could be conclusively demonstrated that schaefer proposal to continue operating the landfill minimizes or avoids adverse environmental effects to the maximum extent practicable.although the dec recommended closure of the facility in an environmentally sound manner as the most solution,it nevertheless gave schaefer the option of closing the site or undertaking the additional work necessary to develop a complete application.
it was later discovered,however,that the landfill solid waste actually included certain hazardous substances as defined by cercla.see cercla,defining hazardous substances.specifically,hazardous substances were detected in leachate,liquid that has percolated through the soil and in groundwater monitoring wells at the landfill.in addition,hartman material informed the dec that it had generated waste paint,filter dried and flammable liquids,which had been disposed at schaefer landfill between and.as a result,the dec designated the landfill as a suspected site on the new york state registry of inactive hazardous waste disposal sites registry.later in,the dec denied schaefer pending renewal application and directed schaefer to close the landfill no later than october.schaefer did not close the landfill instead,while seeking a permit renewal,he continued to operate the landfill without a permit.
the dec informed schaefer on march,that he was responsible for investigative remedial activities,permanent containment efforts at the landfill,pursuant to both cercla a and the new york environmental conservation law ecl.later that year,schaefer entered into a consent order the consent order with the dec for investigation but not remediation of the landfill.to this end,schaefer hired dunn geoscience to conduct several studies in response to the threats posed by the landfill.the studies showed that,while there had been no proven release of hazardous wastes as defined by federal law and the ecl,there had been releases of hazardous substances as defined by cercla.see cercla.
because schaefer still had not closed his landfill,the dec finally brought an administrative complaint against schaefer on november.the dec alleged that schaefer was illegally operating the landfill without a valid permit and in violation of operational requirements.in january of,schaefer and the dec resolved the allegations in the administrative complaint through another consent order the consent order.pursuant to this order,schaefer agreed to close the landfill in an environmentally sound manner and to provide care of the landfill.the consent order further provided for the assessment of civil monetary penalties against schaefer and required schaefer to submit a closure plan within days.however,the agreement also allowed schaefer to continue operating the landfill until november.
schaefer and the dec later entered into three orders of modification,which altered various aspects of the consent order.on november,schaefer and the dec entered into the first order of modification,which allowed schaefer to continue operating the landfill until december.on december,schaefer and the dec entered into a second order of modification,which permitted schaefer to operate the landfill until april,gave schaefer until the end of january to submit a closure plan,and created a surety agreement to ensure proper closure of the landfill.the surety agreement was subsequently modified on january,when schaefer and the dec entered into a third order of modification,which required schaefer to submit an acceptable surety to the dec by march.
on january,schaefer and the dec entered into a separate closure implementation agreement,which established procedures for schaefer to notify the dec of work he had completed in closing the landfill and to request reimbursement.on january,schaefer entered into a trust agreement with canandaigua national bank for financing the closing of the landfill.on january,schaefer and the dec also entered into a stipulation acknowledging the landfill removal from new york registry of inactive hazardous waste disposal sites.the stipulation was based on a dec letter,dated december,which informed schaefer that his landfill was being deleted from the registry because the agency had not identified any hazardous wastes at his site.that stipulation was converted to an order of the new york supreme court on january.
schaefer continued to operate the landfill during the first four months of.schaefer contends that he ceased operating the landfill and began its permanent closure on april,date on which he was no longer permitted to operate the landfill.on june,more than four months after the deadline for submitting a plan,schaefer submitted but the dec rejected a plan prepared by lozier engineers and timothy rock.on august,schaefer submitted and the dec approved a revised plan.the revised plan indicated that the landfill would be closed in accordance with both the plan itself and the consent order and that the landfill would be monitored for thirty years with annual reports submitted to the.
in october of,nearly six months after permanent closure of the landfill began and more than two months after the dec approval of schaefer revised plan,schaefer commenced a proceeding in state court against the.in the proceeding,captioned schaefer dec,schaefer sought,among other things i payments from the trust fund for closure of the landfill ii nullification of the consent order and orders of modification and iii authorization to resume operating the landfill.
on march,the new york supreme court harvey,denied schaefer application the consent judgment.the court found that schaefer violated the third order of modification by failing to establish by march,an acceptable surety for the full costs of closing the landfill.the court noted that the amount schaefer had deposited was far short of the million dollar estimated cost of completion.the court concluded that the dec was justified in refusing to release funds to schaefer because doing so would reduce the fund below the amount necessary to insure completion of the closure.the court also emphasized that there is certainly no basis for allowing schaefer to reopen and resume operation of the landfill.schaefer appealed and,in,while his appeal was pending,schaefer completed permanent closure of the landfill.subsequently,on april,schaefer and the dec entered into a stipulation and settlement agreement,which formally discontinued schaefer appeal of the consent judgment.
on january,schaefer commenced this action against defendants including the town of victor and the village of victor collectively,victor.schaefer sought contribution under cercla f and contribution,indemnification,and unjust enrichment under new york state law.schaefer cercla claim alleged that he had incurred substantial response costs recoverable pursuant to a and that,pursuant to f,defendants should contribute to him their equitable share of his past and future response costs at the landfill,including the costs of investigation,closure,and activities.on november,defendants moved for summary judgment to dismiss schaefer claims as under the relevant statutes of limitations or,in the alternative,as without merit.on december,schaefer moved for partial summary on the liability portion of the cercla contribution claim.
the united states district court for the western district of new york feldman,granted defendants motions for summary judgment the court concluded that schaefer f contribution action failed to meet the applicable statutes of limitations for two independent reasons.see scharfer town of victory,wl.first,the magistrate judge held that the entry of the consent judgment in constituted a judicially approved settlement under cercla g and thus triggered a statute of limitations within which schaefer failed to file a claim.see id.at.second,the magistrate judge held that,even assuming that no triggering event had occurred,the relevant statute of limitations could be borrowed from g.see id.at.under g,the magistrate judge found that this case involved a remedial action with a limitations period of six years rather than a removal action with a limitations period of three years because schaefer actions were clearly intended to effectuate a,indeed permanent,remedy the actual closure of the landfill,id.at,rather than abatement activities,id.at.the court then found that it is clear that remedial activity began long before january.id.at.as a result,the court concluded that schaefer suit,which had been initiated on january,was not within six years of the initiation of remedial action and therefore was untimely.schaefer timely appealed.
discussion 
cercla statutory framework 
cercla establishes a regime of liability,permitting the government to recover its remediation expenses directly from parties responsible for pollution and authorizing private parties to pursue contribution or indemnification from potentially responsible parties for expenses incurred responding to environmental threats.commander oil barlo equip,cir citations omitted.in three separate provisions,cercla authorizes parties to recoup money spent to clean up and prevent future pollution at contaminated sites or to reimburse others for cleanup and prevention at contaminated sites.consol.edison of,ugi,cir.specifically,cercla permits cost recovery actions under a by the government and certain private parties against potentially responsible parties contribution actions under f for parties who have been sued under or and contribution actions under f b for parties that have entered an administrative or judicially approved settlement with the united states or a state.
under cercla,the federal government may clean up a contaminated area itself,under or it may compel responsible parties to perform the cleanup,under a cooper,at.citing key tronic united states,d.in either case,the government may recover response costs under for removal and remedial actions.section a enumerates four classes of potentially responsible parties prps owners of facilities with hazardous substances former owners of facilities with hazardous substances generators of hazardous substances and transporters of hazardous substances.id.a.these four classes of prps shall be liable for,among other things,all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the united states government not inconsistent with the national contingency plan.id.a a.
section also provides a cause of action for private parties to seek recovery of cleanup costs,key tronic,at,because prps are liable for any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan.a b emphasis added.under a,the government or a private party can sue for full recovery of its costs,indemnity,bedford affiliates sills,cir,and,w here the environmental harm is indivisible,multiple responsible persons will be jointly and severally liable for cleanup costs,id.at citing goodrich murtha,cir.
for cost recovery actions under,cercla distinguishes between two kinds of response remedial or permanent containment or disposal removal cleanup arrangements.new york shore realty,cir footnotes omitted.the statute of limitations for the recovery of costs related to removal actions is three years after the completion of the removal action,cercla g a,while the limitations period for the recovery of costs related to remedial actions is six years after the initiation of physical construction of the remediation,id.g b because of this difference in limitations periods,whether an activity is a removal action or a remedial action under a can be determinative of the timeliness of a claim.here,however,schaefer and victor both concede that the primary controversy in this case involves a remedial action.thus,if cercla allows schaefer to bring an action under a,the applicable statute of limitations would be six years.see id.g b.
after congress enacted cercla in,litigation ensued over whether,in addition to allowing the government and certain private parties to recover costs from prps,also allowed a prp that had incurred response costs to recover costs from other prps.cooper,at.in particular,the issue was whether a private party that had incurred response costs,but that had done so voluntarily and was not itself subject to suit,had a cause of action for cost recovery against other prps.id.at the time,v arioso courts held that a b and its predecessors authorized such a cause of action.id.citations omitted.
litigation also arose over the separate question whether a private entity that had been sued in a cost recovery action by the government or by another prp could obtain contribution from other prps.id.at.originally,cercla lacked a specific provision permitting a potentially responsible person that had incurred cleanup costs to seek contribution from other liable parties.bedford affiliates,at.nonetheless,several district courts held that,although cercla did not mention the word contribution,such a right arose either impliedly from provisions of the statute,or as a matter of federal common law.cooper,at.collecting cases.the supreme court has since characterized this conclusion as debatable in light of texas industries,radcliff materials,d,and northwest airlines,transport workers union,d two decisions in which the court refused to recognize implied or rights to contribution in other federal statutes.cooper,at.
in any event,congress subsequently amended cercla in the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of sacra,stat,to provide an express cause of action for contribution,codified as cercla f.id.as a result,and as noted above,cercla now provides for contribution actions under f,as well as cost recovery actions under a.specifically,under f,a party who is liable or potentially liable under a and who has been sued under or a may seek contribution under f.see f the statute of limitations for contribution claims under f is three years.see g.thus,if schaefer were able to bring a contribution claim under f,the applicable statute of limitations would be three years 
ii.cause of action under cercla 
under this circuit view of the statute at the time schaefer filed this action,a prp that had incurred cleanup costs could seek contribution under f even if the prp had not been sued in a cost recovery action under or a.as discussed below,that view has changed,and schaefer concedes on appeal that she can not maintain a contribution claim under f because schaefer has not been sued in a civil action as specified in that section schaefer now asserts,however,that she may bring an action under for response costs incurred during remediation of the landfill and that this claim is timely determining whether schaefer may bring this claim under a,however,requires a careful examination of several recent cases.
in bedford affiliates sills,we held that,under cercla,prps are limited to actions for contribution,cir.in that case,bedford affiliates,a property owner,brought a cercla action seeking recovery of cleanup costs and contribution from former lessees and a sublessee,sills,who had previously operated a dry cleaning business on bedford property.the district court concluded that bedford could not pursue a cost recovery claim under cercla a,but that bedford could pursue a contribution claim under cercla f.accordingly,the district court proceeded to apportion liability for remediation costs under f.the court found that,while sills was liable,bedford was responsible for the costs.id.at.
on appeal,we affirmed the district court determination that bedford could not pursue a cost recovery claim under a.we recognized the distinction between indemnification total reimbursement for costs incurred by an innocent party under and contribution the right to recover from other responsible parties for their pro rata share of the total liability under f.see bedford affiliates,at.we concluded that t he language of cercla suggests congress planned that an innocent party be able to sue for full recovery of its costs,indemnity under a,while a party that is itself liable may recover only those costs exceeding its pro rata share of the entire cleanup expenditure,contribution under f.id.emphasis added.we also noted that,in contrast to f,which has a statute of limitations,see g,a has a statute of limitations,see g.id.we emphasized that,w ere we to permit a potentially responsible person to elect recovery under either a or f,f would be rendered meaningless because a recovering liable party would readily abandon a f suit in favor of the substantially more generous provisions of a.id.
six years later,in cooper industries,aviall services,the supreme court held that a prp who had paid cleanup costs but had not done so in the context of a cercla administrative or cost recovery action could not obtain contribution under cercla f from other liable parties,d.avail services,which had operated four contaminated aircraft engine maintenance sites in texas,and was thus a prp under a,claimed that it was entitled to seek contribution,pursuant to f,from cooper industries,the owner of the sites.the supreme court held that f does not authorize a contribution claim by a prp unless that prp has been sued under either or.the court determined that the natural meaning of the first sentence of f is that contribution may only be sought subject to the specified conditions,namely,during or following a specified civil action.cooper,at.quoting f.the court noted that,if f were read to authorize contribution actions at any time,regardless of the existence of a or a civil action,then congress need not have included the explicit during or following condition.id.
however,in cooper industries,the supreme court declined to address the open question of whether a private party that is itself a prp may pursue a a action against other prps for joint and several liability.see id.at.the court noted numerous decisions,including bedford affiliates,holding that a prp may not bring a cost recovery action under a yet,the court concluded that to decide the issue it would have to consider whether these decisions are correct,an issue that avail services has flagged but not briefed.id.the court also declined to address the related issue of whether a plaintiff,who seeks to recover the share of its cleanup costs fairly chargeable to another prp,may pursue a cost recovery action for some form of liability other than joint and several.id.at.finally,the court declined to address the issue of whether a prp might have an implied right to contribution under.see id.at.
less than one year later,we confronted one of the issues left open in cooper industries does a prp who has not been sued under or have a cause of action under cercla see consol.edison of,ugi,cir.prior to entering into a voluntary cleanup agreement with the dec,consolidated edition con ed sued aug,a manufactured gas plant operator,seeking to recoup the costs that con ed had incurred,and would incur,in cleaning up contaminated sites.see id.at.after determining that f b did not provide con ed with a cause of action because an administrative settlement between con ed and the dec did not resolve cercla liability,see id.at,we considered whether con ed could bring its suit under either a or f.we held that,although the supreme court holding in cooper industries prohibits a prp who has not been sued from seeking contribution under f,such a prp could still recover under a for necessary response costs incurred voluntarily,not under a court or administrative order or judgment.id.at.we reasoned 
given that section a is distinct and independent from section f,and that section f remedies are not available to a person in the absence of a civil action as specified in that section,determining whether a party in con ed circumstances that is,a prp who has not been sued but who has voluntarily incurred response costs may sue under section a is easily resolved based on that section plain language.section a makes parties liable for the government remedial and removal costs and for any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan.
consol.edison,at quoting a.we concluded that con ed could bring suit under a for indemnification because,in light of cooper industries,con ed costs to clean up the sites are costs of response within the meaning of that section.id.at.
consolidated edison,while not explicitly overruling bedford affiliates,see id.at,effectively made a available for any prp that has not been sued but that has voluntarily incurred cleanup costs.the consolidated edison panel noted 
cooper industries may call into question the rationale of bedford affiliates section a holding.certainly,it no longer makes sense to argue that permitting a potentially responsible person to sue under section a would render section f statute of limitations meaningless because a party proceeding in the absence of a civil action no longer has the option of suing under section f.see bedford affiliates,at.consequently,it might be argued that,in the wake of cooper industries,bedford affiliates section a holding can no longer stand.
at.the court also pointed out that our case law suggests that there may be sound policy reasons in favor of revisiting bedford affiliates in light of cooper industries.
w e believe we would be impermissibly discouraging voluntary cleanup were we to read section a to preclude parties that,if sued,would be held liable under section a that is,prps from recovering necessary response costs.were this economic disincentive in place,such parties would likely wait until they are sued to commence cleaning up any site for which they are not exclusively responsible because of their inability to be reimbursed for cleanup expenditures in the absence of a suit.
consol.edison,at citing syms,at observing that the combination of cooper industries and bedford affiliates would create a perverse incentive for prps to wait until they are sued before incurring response costs.but united techs,cir i t is sensible to assume that congress intended only innocent parties who were themselves be permitted to recoup the whole of their expenditures.
in consolidated edison,this court recognized that allowing a cost recovery action under a would allow complete indemnification for a party that may itself be potentially liable for a portion of the cleanup costs.we noted that s come might argue that a person who,if sued,would be partly liable for necessary costs of response may be unjustly enriched if allowed under section a to recover percent of its costs from other persons.consol.edison,at.the court concluded that this fear seemed misplaced because there appears to be no bar precluding a person sued under section a from bringing a counterclaim under section f for offsetting contribution against the plaintiff volunteer who,if sued,would be liable under section a.id.
instead of overruling bedford affiliates,however,consolidated edison attempted to distinguish bedford affiliates by means of two critical distinctions.at.first,the consolidated edison court noted that,unlike in this case where there has been no adjudication of con ed liability for response costs and no administrative or judicially approved settlement requiring con ed to incur those expenses,in bedford affiliates,the plaintiff had entered into two consent orders with the department,pursuant to which the plaintiff began cleanup and remedial action.id.at.second,the court noted that the bedford affiliates plaintiff,having agreed to the consent order,put the extent of its liability at issue by proceeding to seek recovery under both sections a and f and that the district court in bedford affiliates had proceeded to find that the plaintiff was partially liable for the costs of response.id.at.applying these two factors in consolidated edison,the court concluded that,h ere,there have been no consent orders and no proceeding apportioning necessary costs of response to con ed,and these differences distinguish this case from bedford affiliates.id.
we conclude that,once again,we need not revisit the holding of bedford affiliates.consolidated edison is controlling on the question of whether schaefer has a cause of action under a.schaefer,like the plaintiff in consolidated edison,is a prp who has not been sued under either or but who seeks recovery of necessary response costs.as in consolidated edison,there has been no previous finding of partial liability under f.that is,unlike in bedford affiliates,there is no danger here that a party already adjudicated liable for a portion of the costs of response under section f could circumvent that section by recovering under section a that portion of the costs attributed to it by the adjudication.consol.edison,at.
like the plaintiff in consolidated edison,schaefer also initiated cleanup and remedial action voluntarily,not pursuant to a court or administrative order or judgment.however,as noted above,schaefer,unlike the plaintiff in consolidated edison,did enter into two consent orders with the dec the consent order which only required investigation of possible environmental threats posed by the landfill and the consent order which required closure of the landfill.consolidated edison used a seemingly similar fact in bedford incurred under consent orders with the one of the two critical distinctions for distinguishing bedford however,as discussed below,schaefer began to incur response costs prior to entering the consent order with the.as a result,in contrast to bedford affiliates,where bedford agreed to begin cleanup procedures pursuant to a consent order with the dec,see bedford affiliates,at emphasis added,schaefer response costs were not incurred solely due to the imposition of liability through a final administrative order.consol.edison,at.thus,under the holding of this court in consolidated edison,schaefer may bring this action under 
iii.statute of limitations under cercla 
the law affecting schaefer claim has undergone an interesting journey.although it is now clear that schaefer does have a claim for remedial cost recovery under a,it is also clear from the record that schaefer failed to file his cercla claim within the applicable statute of limitations.as both parties concede,schaefer actions were clearly remedial because they were part of a,permanent containment effort,see shore realty,at,and were intended to prevent or minimize the release of hazardous substances,cercla.therefore,the applicable statute of limitations for this cost recovery action under a is years after initiation of physical construction of the remedial action.cercla g b.the record indicates,however,that schaefer initiated construction of a remedial nature more than six years before the commencement of this suit.
on appeal,victor asserts that the district court correctly concluded that physical construction of a remedial nature commenced in and was substantially completed in.schaefer contends that the district court erred and that victor failed to establish any physical construction of a remedial nature prior to january,prior to six years before the initiation of this action.schaefer presses that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until either final approval of a remedial action plan or permanent closure of the landfill on april,and that therefore the instant suit,filed on january,is timely.in response,victor argues that schaefer impermissibly attempts to restrict cercla definition of initiation of physical construction of the remedial action.victor contends that there is no rule that remedial activity only occurs after closure of a landfill final approval of a permanent remedy plan.
the determinative question is whether any of schaefer actions before january,six years before schaefer initiated this recovery action constitute the initiation of physical construction of the remedial action.cercla g b.we hold that schaefer actions,coupled with schaefer deposition testimony,show that this action is untimely because schaefer initiated physical construction of a remedial nature prior to january.
first,schaefer purchase of a dragline crawler crane a crane mounted on a treaded tractor used for excavating from the vilsmeire auction in november was,in his own words,equipment we had to purchase start this closure.while the mere purchase of a crane does not constitute the initiation of physical construction,schaefer subsequent use of the crane to spread cover a mixture of topsoil,sand,and gravel over his landfill satisfies each of the four statutory prerequisites.as schaefer explained 
it a drag line crane.we were dragging material up from in the had the material on site that was used,it was okayed,the material on site was okayed for closure,we had to submit samples.so we used different types of equipment to dig this.
the activity of dragging material up from in the back with a crane certainly constitutes a physical activity.moreover,schaefer twice mentioned that this activity occurred on site.while the mere purchase of the crawler crane did not constitute construction,using this equipment to dig,drag,and spread soil and other material over the site as cover qualifies as construction of the remedial action.finally,schaefer testified that his use of the dragline crane was necessary for closure of the landfill,an action consistent with permanent remedy,cercla,and thus qualifies as the initiation of remedial action.
second,schaefer use of cover necessary for closure is itself the initiation of physical construction of a remedial nature.cercla specifically contemplates that the use of cover is a remedial action for purposes of the statute.see cercla.schaefer,in explaining his use of cover,notes that he used equipment from the genesee dump truck company in because you have to prepare your site,see,with a foot of soil all over before the closure process can occur.the material that schaefer used for cover,as noted above,was material from his own landfill property.indeed,in a cost estimate prepared in late,schaefer own expert,timothy rock,indicated that schaefer completed the closure in a very frugal matter because the estimated closure cost of million included topsoil,sand and gravel from schaefer own mine valued at about.schaefer spreading this cover on his site in preparation for closure also constitutes an action consistent with permanent remedy,cercla,and thus qualifies as the initiation of remedial action.
in fact,schaefer deposition indicates that between and many of schaefer actions at the landfill some of which included physical construction were part of a remedial action and were necessary preparations for closure.in addition to the examples enumerated above,schaefer indicated that the incurred for response costs between and were related to the closure of the landfill.at his deposition,schaefer was asked and these costs,to your knowledge,relate to the closure of your landfill is that right he responded yes,they do,sir.thus,these expenses were not merely the costs associated with the normal,activities of an operating landfill these expenses were specifically incurred in contemplation of,and were consistent with,the permanent remedy.indeed,schaefer further testified that between and there was no difference between running the landfill and preparing for closure.
relying on united states findett,cir,schaefer argues that because these actions were preparatory in nature,they do not trigger the start of the limitations period.we disagree.in findett,the eighth circuit concluded that activities such as evaluation,sampling,surveying and measuring did not constitute the initiation of construction because these activities did not constitute construction.id.at.by contrast,schaefer use of a crane to dig,drag and spread soil clearly constitutes construction 
the conclusion that schaefer actions were performed in contemplation of fact that schaefer repeatedly admits in his also bolstered by the fact that the dec directed schaefer to close the landfill no later than october,and that schaefer initially agreed to close it by november see consent order and then by december see order of modification.although the dec repeatedly instructed schaefer to close the landfill,schaefer continued to operate the landfill without a permit.at the same time,however,schaefer took steps in preparation for closure,including physical construction,that were consistent with a permanent remedy.later,at his deposition,schaefer continually asserted that,during this time period,he was engaged in physical construction consistent with a permanent remedy.thus,by waiting to file suit until january,schaefer failed to bring this action within six years after the initiation of physical construction of the remedial action as required under cercla g b 
schaefer contends,however,that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the final closure of the landfill,which schaefer claims began on april.schaefer asserts that t his is the earliest date on which permanent closure of the landfill began,since it was being operated and was an active landfill up to that point.schaefer draws support for a rule from california ex rel.california department of toxic substances control neville chemical,cir,in which the ninth circuit held that,for purposes of commencing the limitations period,the initiation of physical construction can only occur after the adoption of the final remedial action plan.id.at.schaefer asks that we adopt a rule providing that the initiation of physical construction can not occur until either after the approval of the final remedial action plan or after the closure of the landfill.
in neville chemical,california brought suit on behalf of the california department of toxic substances control,seeking to recover response costs under for a remedial action.see id.the action at issue involved a groundwater and treatment system,including three extraction wells,that was originally designed as an interim removal action but remained part of the final remedial action plan.id.at.neville argued that the action was untimely because the statute of limitations began to run more than six years prior to the initiation of the suit when it began excavating the extraction wells.see id.at.california contended that no remedial action could have occurred until the department had approved the final remedial action plan.see id.
in holding that california action was timely,the ninth circuit reasoned the first point at which both parties can be certain any construction is consistent with a permanent remedy is when the permanent remedy is actually selected.in this case,as in most cases,the permanent remedy was selected when the final remedial action plan was approved.id.at.the court concluded that t he plain meaning of the definition of remedial,read together with the statute of limitations in g and the use of that same term in the rest of the statute,supports the conclusion that the initiation of physical construction of the remedial action can only occur after the final remedial action plan is adopted.id.at.the ninth circuit rule postulates that approval of a final remedial action plan is the sine qua non for the initiation of remedial action 
we reject schaefer request that we adopt the ninth circuit approach or a similar approach that physical construction consistent with final remedy can only occur after the closure of the landfill.we do so for several reasons.schaefer contention is in tension with the plain language of the statute,which speaks of actions consistent with permanent remedy and nowhere mentions either approval of the final remedial action plan or closure of the landfill in connection with the statute of limitations.cercla emphasis added neville chem,at noting that there is no explicit definition of remedial action plan in either the statute or the regulations implementing it.indeed,schaefer reasoning contradicts the decisions in several circuits that have concluded that cercla statutory text does not support a rule for determining the initiation of remedial action.in discussing neville,the sixth circuit noted that other circuits have rejected this rule and have adhere d to the principle that for a remedial action to begin,the work must be consistent with the permanent remedy.gencorp,at citing geraghty miller,conoco,cir,and navistar int l trans,at second alteration in original.
in united states navistar international transportation,the seventh circuit rejected an argument that it should adopt a similar rule.at.in navistar,both the federal and state governments filed separate actions under cercla to recover costs that they had incurred in connection with the environmental and remediation of a landfill.id.at.these costs were not covered by the governments consent decree with a third party,which,in combination with several administrative documents,established a timeline for the preparation and creation of the remedial design plan for the site and for the implementation of that plan.id.although the consent decree indicated that the implementation of the remedial action was to begin after the final remedial design plans were approved by the epa and the state,the first lift of clay to build the permanent clay cap was placed on the landfill on september,two days before final approval of the design plan on september,id.at.the federal government filed its cost recovery suit on september,six years less one day after final approval of the design plan,but six years plus one day after the property owner began placing clay on the property.see id.at.
the seventh circuit concluded that the statute of limitations had run because physical construction began with the construction of the clay caps rather than with the final approval of the design plan.see id.at.in rejecting a rule based on final approval of the remedial design,the seventh circuit pointed out 
whatever might be the advantages of such a approach,we are not persuaded that congress intended such a rule.the statute is devoid of any reference that would lead us to conclude from its plain language that congress intended to incorporate this specific aspect of the administrative process in establishing the actions that would trigger the limitations period.on the contrary,remedial action is a term broadly defined by the fact of which congress was no doubt well aware when it incorporated that term in the statute of limitations.if it had intended to require that the epa issue its final approval of the remedial design in order for a remedial action to begin within the meaning of g b a contention unsupported by the definition of remedial action congress surely would have provided us with a more explicit direction to that effect.rather,in crafting the statute of limitations,congress specifically made the initiation of physical construction of the remedial action the triggering event.
navistar int l transp,at citations omitted.the reasoning underlying navistar rejection of a rule based on the final approval of the remedial design applies with equal force when considering schaefer attempt to establish a rule based on either the approval of the final remedial action plan or the closure of the landfill.either of schaefer proposals would date the limitations period from an event that the statute does not employ in calibrating the applicable limitations period.as victor points out,if schaefer approach were embraced,the lengthy statutory definitions in cercla of removal and remedial action would be rendered meaningless,and the terms would simply be defined as all response activities which occur after final approval of the permanent plan or,alternatively,all response activities which occur after closure of the landfill.appellee br.at quoting state of cal.ex rel.california dep t of toxic substances control hyampom lumber.schaefer proposed rules may be bright lines,but each suffers from a total disregard of the plain language of the statute 
schaefer proposed rule is untenable for yet another reason the rule would allow the commencement of the statute of limitations to become a discretionary determination.were we to adopt the approval of the final remedial action plan as the point from which physical construction would be measured,the commencement of the statute of limitations would be a discretionary decision for the party responsible for approving the remedial action plan.for example,in situations involving government actions to recoup response costs under cercla,see,neville chem,at,such a rule would give government entities almost unlimited discretion as to when,or even whether,the limitations period begins to run.accordingly,the value of the clarity and predictability of such a rule could be obscured by the inequity of intentional or negligent adjournment of the initiation of the limitations period by delay of approval of the final remedial action plan.
likewise,in suits in which the party seeking to recover response costs is a prp,such as schaefer,rather than the government,a plaintiff could engage in strategic behavior to preclude the start of any limitations period.if remedial measures were taken before a remedial action plan had been finalized,an opportunistic plaintiff could prevent the commencement of the limitations period merely by preventing the approval of the final remedial action plan.indeed,schaefer repeated attempts to operate the landfill without a permit and to seek modifications of the consent order,as well as his delay in submitting a plan,could be viewed as exactly this type of conduct.moreover,adopting the rule proposed by schaefer might lead to the awkward result that actions brought by private parties to recover response costs would be subject to a different statute of limitations trigger when no government agency is involved in the.navistar,at.we agree with the seventh circuit that w e do not think congress intended such an inconsistency when it drafted the statute of limitations provision.id.
the same issues would arise were we to adopt the official closure of the landfill as the point from which we would measure whether physical construction had occurred.a party could engage in significant construction consistent with a permanent remedy,such as beginning construction activities for the installation of a clay cap or spreading ground cover,while keeping the landfill nominally open.while the official closure of the landfill may,in many cases,coincide with initiation of physical construction of the remedial action,this is not necessarily so.as discussed,it is clear in this case that schaefer initiated physical construction of the remedial action prior to the point at which the landfill was initially closed.
one of the primary functions of a limitations period,especially with regard to regulatory matters,is to ensure an intelligible record for our review.statutes of limitations protect defendants and the courts from having to deal with cases in which the search for truth may be seriously impaired by the loss of evidence,whether by death or disappearance of witnesses,fading memories,disappearance of documents,or otherwise.united states kubrick,d.in the instant case,schaefer engaged in physical construction of a remedial nature more than a dozen years ago and more than six years before initiating this suit.but now,more than twenty years after the dec first directed closure of the landfill,schaefer attempts to characterize these activities as actions not consistent with a permanent remedy.allowing schaefer to recharacterize his prior actions and extend the limitations period in this way would be to allow schaefer to circumvent the very reasons for having a statute of limitations.
iv.state law claims 
schaefer also raises state law claims based on common law contribution,indemnification,and unjust enrichment.the district court,noting that plaintiff counsel agreed that these causes of actions were not viable claims,did not address these issues.on appeal,schaefer did not brief,and thus has waived,his unjust enrichment claim.see norton sam club,cir.schaefer also appears to concede on appeal,as she did before the district court,that she no longer has a viable claim for contribution or indemnification against the village of victor.but schaefer and the town of victor continue to dispute whether,earlier in this case,schaefer also waived the claims for contribution and indemnification against the town of victory,and there appears to have been some confusion in that regard when the issue was before the district court.upon our review of the transcript,it appears that schaefer may not have waived her state law contribution and indemnification claims against the town of victor.we thus remand these claims to the district court for further consideration.because we affirm the district court dismissal of all of schaefer federal claims,on remand,the district court can exercise its discretion whether to invoke supplemental jurisdiction under over schaefer remaining state law claims.we note that,under c,a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if it has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.see cohill,d see also tops markets,quality markets,cir holding that the district court properly exercised its discretion in declining supplemental jurisdiction after dismissing the federal claims on summary judgment.
conclusion 
accordingly,we hold that schaefer failed to initiate this cercla action within the applicable statute of limitations.while our holding in consolidated edison allows schaefer to bring this claim as a cost recovery action under a,schaefer failed to meet the statute of limitations for remedial actions under g.in so holding,we reject schaefer recommendation that we adopt a rule tied to the approval of a final remedial action plan or the permanent closure of the landfill.the limitations period for remedial actions begins six years from the initiation of physical construction of the remedial action.cercla g b.because schaefer initiated physical construction of a remedial action more than six years before the filing of this suit,schaefer cercla claim is untimely.consequently,the decision of the district court is hereby affirmed,except with regard to the district court conclusion regarding plaintiff remaining state law claims against the town of victor.as to these remaining state law claims against the town of victor,the decision of the district court is vacated,and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
