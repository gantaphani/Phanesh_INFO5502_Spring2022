opinion of the court 
a request for attorney fees should not result in a second major litigation.hensley eckerhart,d.regrettably,requests for attorneys fees in this protracted environmental case have resulted not only in a second major litigation,but a third as well.an earlier dollar fee award previously brought before us was vacated and remanded for additional review by the district court.interfaith cmty.org.honeywell int l,ico ii,cir.we are now confronted with a challenge to another dollar award.this latest appeal calls upon us to decide whether offers of judgment pursuant to.may be made in the context of attorney fee disputes under the provisions of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra,et.we are also called upon once again to determine whether the fee award is excessive.because we conclude that rule offers of judgment may be made in this context,we will reverse the district court declaration that the offers of judgment in this case are null and void as well as its decision to bar any further offers of judgment.and,while we uphold as not clearly erroneous the district court decisions with respect to the appropriate hourly rates in this case,we are unable to sustain its conclusions with respect to the number of hours claimed by counsel because the district court findings lack sufficient explanation.accordingly,we will vacate the fee award and remand for further proceedings.
facts and procedural history 
mutual chemical company of america mutual operated a chrome manufacturing plant in jersey city,new jersey from to.during that time,the company deposited approximately million tons of industrial waste residue containing hexavalent chromium into wetlands along the hackensack river.joint appendix.in,allied corporation purchased the plant and ended the dumping.allied corporation was succeeded by alliedsignal,and later by honeywell international,honeywell.although the dumping stopped,the contaminated area was not cleaned up.
in,the interfaith community organization and five residents of the nearby community collectively,ico,represented by the washington,law firm of terris,pravlik millian,llp terris,filed the original suit against alliedsignal,then the owner of the site,seeking the cleanup of a contaminated area designated study area.ico sued alliedsignal under the citizen suit provision of rcra,which allows individuals to bring a civil action against any person who has contributed or who is contributing to the past or present handling,storage,treatment,transportation,or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment a b.
the district court entered judgment for ico in,ordering honeywell which had succeeded alliedsignal to clean up study area.interfaith cmty.org.honeywell int l,d.this court affirmed.see,cir.
in,the district court awarded ico more than million in fees and expenses for litigating the action,and also required honeywell to pay the future fees and costs incurred by ico in monitoring honeywell cleanup.interfaith cmty.org.honeywell int l,ico i,d.we affirmed in part and vacated in part.ico ii,cir.specifically,we sustained as not clearly erroneous the district court decision with respect to the hourly rates sought by ico counsel,id.at,but rejected as inadequate the district court review of the hours for which compensation was claimed.id.at.accordingly,we vacated the fee award and remanded for further proceedings.
in,hackensack riverkeeper riverkeeper,also represented by terris,filed companion cases against honeywell stemming from the same contamination but relating to areas adjacent to study area,designated as study area and study area.the parties entered into a number of consent decrees in which honeywell conceded responsibility,and agreed to remediate the additional contaminated sites.as part of the consent decrees,honeywell also agreed to pay million in fees and costs for the expenses incurred prior to the decrees,and to pay reasonable future fees and expenses incurred in connection with monitoring honeywell remediation efforts.
initially,the parties were able to reach agreement on fees and expenses.beginning in the fall of,however,honeywell,on the one hand,and ico and riverkeeper collectively,appellees on the other,failed to reach agreement with respect to the fees sought for monitoring honeywell work.
terris subsequently filed two separate fee applications,totaling more than,for its monitoring work performed in and the first half of in connection with the case.terris filed a separate application,seeking almost million,for work performed on the litigation.honeywell filed objections to the fee applications.specifically,honeywell renewed its arguments that the forum rate rule should be applied so that the hourly rates sought by terris should be based upon the rates charged by new jersey lawyers as opposed to washington,lawyers,and that,even if rates were used,appellees applied the wrong method for calculating prevailing market rates.in addition,honeywell once again contested the reasonableness of the hours and expenses claimed by counsel.honeywell also served offers of judgment pursuant to rule for the disputed fees.in response,appellees asked the district court to issue a declaratory judgment that honeywell rule offers are null and void in the context of rcra citizen suits.
on september,the district court issued an opinion that substantially upheld the appellees fee request.first,the district court once again ruled that the rule need not be applied in this case so that terris could be paid washington,rates for work relating to a dispute in new jersey.interfaith cmty.honeywell int l,ico iii,d.second,the district court evaluated two different methods for calculating prevailing market rates,and approved the method requested by appellees.id.at.third,the district court rejected most of the challenges to the reasonableness of the hours expended by appellees counsel.id.at.and,finally,the district court held that rule offers of judgment can not be made in citizen suits filed under rcra,concluding that application of rule to rcra citizen suits would violate the rules enabling act,by discouraging the very citizen suits that congress intended to promote.id.this appeal followed.

rule offers of judgment 
we must first decide whether offers of judgment made pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure apply to attorney fee disputes brought under the citizen suit provision of rcra.as the supreme court has instructed,w e give the federal rules of civil procedure their plain meaning,and generally with them as with a statute,w hen we find the terms unambiguous,judicial inquiry is complete.pavelic leflore marvel entm t group,d quotation marks omitted.thus,we begin,as we must,with the text of the rule.see united states gonzales,d.
federal rule of civil procedure provides,in pertinent part 
a making an offer judgment on an accepted offer.at least days before the date set for trial,a party defending a claim may serve on an opposing party an offer to allow judgment on specified terms,with the costs then accrued 
c offer after liability is determined.when one party liability to another has been determined but the extent of liability remains to be determined by further proceedings,the party held liable may make an offer of judgment 
d paying costs after an unaccepted offer.if the judgment that the offeree finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer,the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the offer was made.
rule does not exempt from its purview any type of civil action.see wright miller,federal practice procedure ed.moreover,rule of the federal rules of civil procedure states that the rules apply to all suits of a civil nature,unless exempted by rule.rule,in turn,does not set forth any restrictions on rule applicability to citizen suits under rcra,or to suits seeking equitable relief generally.thus,by its plain terms,rule is applicable to rcra citizen suits.
the district court,however,held that rule is so incompatible with congress purpose in enacting rcra that its application to cases brought under would violate the rules enabling act.the rules enabling act gives the supreme court the power to prescribe general rules of practice and procedure and rules of evidence for cases in the united states district courts and the courts of appeals,provided that such rules do not abridge,enlarge or modify any substantive right.a b.thus,if applying rule to citizen suits abridges or modifies a substantive right,then rule offers are void in this context notwithstanding the plain meaning of the rule.
a rule of procedure does not run afoul of this statutory limitation merely because it affects a litigant substantive rights most procedural rules do.shady grove orthopedic assocs,allstate ins,d scalia,plurality opinion.as justice scalia elaborated what matters is what the rule itself regulates if it governs only the manner and the means by which the litigants rights are enforced,it is valid if it alters the rules of decision by which the court will adjudicate those rights,it is not.id.quoting mississippi pub g murphree.
applying the criterion that a rule of procedure impermissibly abridge s,enlarge s,or modif ies a substantive right,b,only if it alters the rules for adjudicating a litigant rights,we readily conclude that application of rule in the specific context of this case does not violate the rules enabling act.no rule of decision governing the adjudication of the attorney fee dispute that is the subject of honeywell offers of judgment is affected by application of rule.the amount of the fee to be awarded remains governed by the same rules of decision regardless of the interposition of an offer of judgment.at best,the only impact that rule has on the ultimate outcome of the attorney fee dispute is to require appellees to bear their costs,including counsel fees,if the fee award is less favorable than the offer of judgment see.d marek chesny,d 
in light of rule laudatory purpose of facilitating settlement,delta airlines,august,d,the requirement that a plaintiff bear the fees incurred after it rejects an offer of judgment simply can not be said to abridge some substantive right.in this regard,fees incurred after a party rejects an offer of judgment and recovers less than the offer are properly viewed as being unreasonable.
the district court,relying upon public interest research group of new jersey struthers dunn,civ,wl,reasoned that rule offers would discourage citizens from bringing suit and firms from accepting the cases,because there is no possibility for monetary relief in citizen suits and,therefore,the only source of compensation for law firms representing plaintiffs in these cases comes in the form of an award of attorney fees.ico iii,d at.the impact on a decision to pursue litigation,however,has nothing to do with whether the offer of judgment rule abridges or modifies some substantive right.it may very well be that a rule offer of judgment in the context of a rcra attorney fee dispute will require a plaintiff to make a hard choice between accepting what has been offered versus adjudicating the issues that are in dispute in such a case the appropriate hourly rate and the reasonableness of the hours expended.that appellees may feel compelled to take less than the amount to which they believe they are entitled,however,has nothing at all to do with the determination of the appropriate hourly rate and the reasonableness of the hours expended before the offer of judgment was made.settlement offers often present difficult choices for a plaintiff,but that fact neither abridges nor modifies the substantive rights at issue.speculation as to the potential chilling effect of allowing rule offers of judgment in citizen suits under rcra,advanced in struthers dunn and embraced by the district court in this case,is simply irrelevant to the pertinent inquiry whether the rules of decision are altered by the offer of judgment.
the supreme court has not considered rule impact on citizen suits,but it has addressed the interaction between rule and the statute applicable to civil rights litigation.see marek,d.while the majority opinion in marek did not address whether application of rule in the context of civil rights litigation violated the rules enabling act,its rationale is indeed instructive here.in marek,the court considered whether of judgment costs to be borne by the plaintiff included plaintiff attorney fees when the ultimate recovery was less than the offer.id.at.stated otherwise,the issue in marek was whether a plaintiff who received a verdict that was less than the offer of judgment could recover the fees incurred after the offer was made.the plaintiffs in marek argued that a recovery of less than the offer of judgment should not preclude an award of all counsel fees,including fees.id.at.much like the argument advanced by appellees in this case,the marek plaintiffs asserted that a different reading of rule would unfairly burden civil rights plaintiffs by discouraging attorneys from bringing meritorious claims at the risk of losing attorney fees.id.notwithstanding the strong policy arguments favoring the encouragement of suits to vindicate important constitutional rights,the court applied the plain meaning of rule to foreclose recovery of fees.the court concluded that the purpose of to encourage meritorious civil rights claims was distinct from and compatible with the purpose of rule to encourage settlement.id.at.thus,the court held that nothing in the policies underlying constitutes the necessary clear expression of congressional intent required to exempt the statute from the operation of rule.id.at citing califano yamasaki,d.
appellees argue that marek is distinguishable because civil rights plaintiffs are often motivated by the potential for personal gain,in contrast to rcra plaintiffs,who seek injunctive relief in furtherance of a purely public gain although appellees are correct that citizen plaintiffs suing under can not recover monetary damages,while plaintiffs in civil rights cases often can,they miss the point of the court analysis in marek.the court sustained application of rule to civil rights cases even though it could chill the pursuit of litigation intended to vindicate important rights.the court concluded that,notwithstanding such potential,rule applied because the policies underlying rule and the fee shifting statute at issue there were compatible 
the fact that only equitable relief is available under section does not alter this conclusion.courts have applied rule to suits seeking equitable relief despite arguments that doing so would discourage such claims.see,naacp town of east haven,cir n othing in the rule suggests that it applies only to cases seeking damages or other relief amenable to simple comparisons.chathas local int l of workers,cir rule offers are much more common in money cases than in equity cases,but nothing in the rule forbids its use in the latter type of case.
the fee shifting provision of section encourages plaintiffs to bring meritorious suits to enforce environmental laws,while rule encourages settlement of civil suits.see delta airlines,at.there is nothing incompatible with these two objectives.marek,at comparing purposes of with purposes of rule.accordingly,we conclude that nothing in the text of rule suggests that such an exemption is warranted,and application of rule in the context presented here does not violate the rules enabling act.
our rule inquiry is not yet complete,however.appellees raise another challenge to rule applicability in this case,contending that the rule does not apply to proceedings after judgment has been rendered on liability.appellees point to the text of the rule,which states that an offer of judgment must be made at least days before the date set for trial,or,if one party liability to another has been determined but the extent of liability remains to be determined by further proceedings it must be served within a reasonable time before the date set for a hearing to determine the extent of liability.a,c.appellees interpret this language to mean that the rule only applies in two situations first,before a trial and,second,in a bifurcated proceeding after judgment has been rendered but before the extent of liability is determined.
the first situation plainly does not apply here,and appellees claim that this case does not fall within the second situation because attorney fees can not be regarded as part of honeywell liability.specifically,appellees assert that the word liability even within the phrase extent of liability does not encompass a dispute over attorney fees.to support this interpretation of the text,appellees point to federal rule of civil procedure,which provides definitions of judgment and costs.see.because rule includes attorney fees within the definition of costs,appellees argue that fees can not also be included within the definition of liability.appellee br.further,appellees observe that rcra provides that costs of litigation include reasonable attorney and expert witness fees,and note that,under marek,rule costs must also include attorney fees.appellee br.because costs include attorney fees for purposes of rule,appellees argue,attorney fees can not also be part of liability.id.
given the ordinary meaning of liability,see black law dictionary ed,the phrase extent of liability encompasses all legal responsibilities.this appeal is evidence that the extent of honeywell liability has yet to be determined.
this conclusion is consistent with our approach in public interest research group of new jersey windall pirg,cir,where we implicitly treated a rule offer made at the attorney fee stage of litigation as valid.in pirg,we vacated a fee award and directed the district court to consider on remand whether the plaintiff reasonably continued to litigate the attorney fee issue after refusing the defendant rule offer.at.see also sanchez prudential pizza,cir indicating that rule offers may include attorney fees so long as the offer clearly states that it includes fees and costs.
moreover,the policies underlying rule support this interpretation.rule was created to encourage the settlement of litigation.delta airlines,at.the benefits of settlement are highest in the context of attorney fee disputes,which the supreme court has warned should not result in a second major litigation.hensley,at.incentive to settle is beneficial where,as here,the litigation to resolve fee disputes has taken on a life of its own.ico iii,d at.as the district court noted,the amount of litigation engendered by the present fee dispute has probably cost as much as the contested amount.id.at.we are confident that encouragement to settle is warranted in this context.thus,because we believe that a rule offer in this context both comports with the ordinary meaning of the phrase extent of liability and is consistent with the provision of rcra,we conclude that rule offers of judgment apply to disputes over attorney fees after liability has been determined.
forum rate rule 
we now turn our attention to the district court departure from the rule.the rule holds that in most cases,the relevant rate for calculating attorney fees is the prevailing rate in the forum of the litigation.ico ii,at.we have recognized two exceptions to the rule first,when the need for the special expertise of counsel from a distant district is shown and,second,when local counsel are unwilling to handle the case.id.internal quotations omitted citing report of the third circuit task force on court awarded attorney fees.we sustained as not clearly erroneous the district court decision in ico i that the rule should not be applied in this case.see ico ii,at.
our prior ruling presents us now with the question of whether further litigation of the rule is foreclosed by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.we have identified four standard requirements for the application of collateral estoppel the identical issue was previously adjudicated the issue was actually litigated the previous determination was necessary to the decision and the party being precluded from relitigating the issue was fully represented in the prior action.jean alexander cosmetics,usa,cir quotation marks omitted.we are satisfied that each element is met in this case.
in ico ii,we adjudicated the identical issue presented here namely,whether the lack of northern new jersey counsel willing to handle rcra citizen suits without an immediate payment of fees and advanced costs foreseeably amounting to over justifies a departure from the rule.appellee br.we held that departure was justified in this case.thus,the first element is met.second,the issue was actually litigated in this district court and,on appeal,in this court.see ico ii,at.third,a determination about the rule was necessary to this court decision about the proper rate for calculating attorney fees.finally,honeywell was represented in the prior case.honeywell fully litigated this issue in that case,and our decision was a valid,final judgment.
honeywell argues that collateral estoppel can not apply because the issue in the first case was whether a departure from the rule was justified in the litigation,asserting that appellees must prove that new jersey counsel is not available to take the case now.reply br.honeywell mischaracterizes this litigation.this court determined in that a departure from the rule was warranted.ico ii,at.the instant litigation is part of the same case that began in,including the case brought by riverkeeper in.as the district court noted,it would have been unreasonable to expect plaintiffs to change horses in midstream,and suddenly find,or need to document the inability to find,competent local counsel to continue the litigation in study areas and.ico iii,d at.thus,we conclude that further litigation concerning the applicability of the rule is barred by collateral estoppel.
c.the laffey matrix 
because we have sustained the district court decision to allow terris to be compensated on the basis of washington,rates,we must now determine whether the district court erred in deciding what these rates are.in this case,the district court applied what is known as the laffey matrix for purposes of determining the appropriate hourly rates the laffey matrix provides billing rates for attorneys in the washington,market with various degrees of experience.ico ii,at.the original laffey matrix set forth the prevailing market rates from.in,the laffey matrix was updated to account for inflation.see trout ball,approving updated laffey matrix.since,courts have approved various methods for updating the laffey matrix.compare salazar district of columbia,d,utilizing legal services component of the consumer price index with,sheet metal workers int l ass n,wl,at applying attorney office matrix.
the parties agree that the initial laffey matrix was a valid index of washington,rates in.the parties further agree that an updated version of the laffey matrix,which accounts for the rise in prevailing rates based on inflation,would be a valid vehicle for determining the applicable hourly rates in the legal market today.the parties disagree,however,about the proper method of updating the matrix.appellees favor the legal services index lsi method,which accounts for shifts in the consumer price index for legal services nationwide.ico iii,d at.honeywell prefers the attorney office usao matrix,which regularly updates the laffey matrix using the consumer price index for the area.appellant br.these divergent methods result in very different prevailing rates this circuit has not specifically approved of either method,and both parties cite cases from the district of columbia in support of their respective preferred method
