the federal energy regulatory commission decided that because a reservoir was not necessary or appropriate to the operation of power projects,it did not have jurisdiction over that reservoir,even though it did have jurisdiction over the power projects themselves bear lake watch,disagreed with that decision,and has petitioned for review of it.we deny the petition.
background 
in,telluride power company began action to develop bear lake as a reservoir,and in to it obtained the right to direct water from bear river into the lake.water is withdrawn from the river,and when needed downstream,it is pumped out of the lake at the lifton pump station and returned to the river.telluride undertook the project in order to store water for irrigation and power purposes.
disputes later arose between telluride successors in interest and various other entities,which had a claim on bear river water.litigation,agreements,and an interstate compact followed.the result was that the rights of telluride successors to store and use the bear river water at bear lake was recognized as long as that did not interfere with any senior users rights.pursuant to the interstate compact between idaho,utah and wyoming,there must also be an irrigation reserve in bear lake for a reservoir level up to feet,and water may not be released below that level for power generation alone.although bear lake does have a maximum usable storage capacity of acre feet,its operators have targeted a level of feet,which results in usable storage of acre feet.that is seen as a level that will allow the meeting of irrigation needs without posing a flood risk.
the end result of all of this is that,whatever might have been telluride original intent,bear lake is now primarily used for irrigation and flood control purposes,with power generation being incidental.of course,when water is released for irrigation purposes,it can generate power on its way to the irrigation canals,if power facilities stand between bear lake and the canals.
pacificorp does operate a number of facilities on the bear river downstream from bear lake.those are hydropower projects licensed by ferc.they include the following the megawatt soda project,located miles downstream of bear lake the megawatt grace project,located miles downstream of the soda project the megawatt cove project,which takes advantage of the tailrace waters of the grace project powerhouse the megawatt oneida project,located miles downstream of the cove project and the megawatt cutler project,located about miles downstream of the oneida project.most of them do make use of water released for irrigation,but cutler,which is furthest downstream,does not.
in ferc view,the denouement of this story of activity by telluride and its successors,including pacificorp,is that bear lake regulation of the flow of water in the bear river has made less water available for generation than there would have been if the bear river had been left alone.in short,as ferc sees it,telluride victory over the river can be summed up in one.thus,ferc declined to take jurisdiction,and this appeal followed.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction pursuant to b.
under the fpa federal power act,we grant conclusive effect to the commission findings of fact if such findings are supported by substantial evidence.where,however,the petitioners call into question the commission understanding of its statutory mandate,our review is de novo.am.rivers ferc,cir internal citation omitted.
if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue and its intent is clear,that is the end of the matter.chevron,nat.res.def.council,d.however,if the statute being construed by the agency is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.at.in other words,we owe deference to an agency reasonable interpretation of a statutory provision where congress has left the question to the agency discretion.see city of seattle ferc,cir holding that we show great deference to ferc interpretation of the law which it is charged with administering.citation omitted.
discussion 
bear lake watch attacks ferc decision on two fronts.it says that ferc applied both an improper legal analysis and an improper factual analysis when it eschewed jurisdiction in this case.we will discuss each of those in turn.
ferc legal analysis 
we start,as we must,with the statute and with ferc understanding of its meaning.
ferc is empowered to,among other things 
issue licenses to citizens of the united states or to any corporation organized under the laws of the united states for the purpose of constructing,operating,and maintaining dams,water conduits,reservoirs,power houses,transmission lines,or other project works necessary or convenient for the development,transmission,and utilization of power across,along,from,or in any of the streams or other bodies of water over which congress has jurisdiction 
e emphasis added.as the emphasis shows,the statute directs regulation of reservoirs and other project works.in a magnificent exercise in periphrasis,the fpa then defines project works as the physical structures of a project,and defines project as including,among other things,all,ditches,dams,reservoirs,lands,or interest in lands the use and occupancy of which are necessary or appropriate in the maintenance and operation of a complete unit of improvement or development.emphasis added.
periphrasis aside,the sections use two slightly different locutions regarding ferc authority.they refer to reservoirs which are necessary or convenient and to reservoirs which are necessary or appropriate to a power generating project.while convenient and appropriate are not exactly synonyms,if one rummages about in dictionaries,one finds that the words do overlap in some of their meanings,and one definition of convenient is appropriate.see,webster third new international dictionary.at any rate,neither ferc nor bear lake watch suggests that anything turns on the nuanced difference between the words in some other contexts.we will treat them as equivalent in this context and will hereafter use the single phrase necessary or appropriate.
it is clear enough,then,that ferc must take jurisdiction over the operations of bear lake by pacificorp,if that facility is necessary or appropriate to the operation of pacificorp hydropower facilities downstream.but congress has not directly said what necessary or appropriate means.its failure to do so means that it has left the complex policy decision about how far ferc should extend its regulatory tentacles up to ferc itself.see navellier sletten,cir authorization to grant exemptions when necessary or appropriate in the public interest reflects the congressional intent to entrust certain policy decisions to the sec.put another way,it has left that decision to the discretion of the agency.see concrete tie of san diego,liberty,cir the sba need only award a contract whenever it determines such action is necessary or appropriate a determination within the agency discretion.we,in turn,must respect that congressional choice,and must accord deference to ferc.see city of seattle,at see also dillingham ins,cir.
what ferc has quite reasonably decided is that when a reservoir is located far away from a power generating at least is not necessary or appropriate to that facility,if it does not provide any significant generating benefit.that seems to comport with common sense how can a reservoir be necessary or appropriate to a hydroelectric plant,if its regulation of water does not confer a significant generation benefit upon that plant it certainly makes little sense to say that it is necessary or appropriate when,as here,its effect on the flow of a river is to decrease the water otherwise available to the plant.as we have said in another context,t he term necessary imposes only the minimal requirement that the expense be appropriate and helpful for the development of the business.smith comm r,cir some internal quotation marks omitted see also to org.for women office workers bd.of governors of fed.reserve,cir.if
