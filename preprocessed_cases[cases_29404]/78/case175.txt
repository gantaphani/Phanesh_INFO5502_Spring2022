background 
workers compensation in illinois 
before delving into the facts of this case,we first provide some background on the somewhat complicated statutory scheme at issue here.like other states,illinois has a workers compensation system in which employers compensate their employees for injuries or illnesses,regardless of fault.see illinois workers compensation act iwca.comp.stat.et.in return for not having to prove fault,employees receive only workers compensation benefits from their employers and can not sue their employers to receive more damages.see id.at a.this rule also bars loss of consortium claims that employees spouses might otherwise bring against employers.id.extending bar to any one otherwise entitled to recover damages for such injury vickery,cir t he illinois workers compensation act has been consistently interpreted to bar suits for loss of consortium by a covered worker spouse citing dobrydnia.group,d.
sometimes,however,parties other than an employer might cause an employee to be injured at work.an employee in this situation can sue these third parties for damages.see.comp.stat.b where the injury or death for which compensation is payable under this act was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability for damages on the part of some person other than his employer to pay damages,then legal proceedings may be taken against such other person to recover damages notwithstanding such employer payment of or liability to pay compensation under this act.these third parties can in turn seek contribution from the employer,thereby pulling the employer into the suit.id.alternatively,an employer may choose to exercise its right to intervene in the suit before satisfaction of judgment.see ins.of am.andrew,d.
now suppose an employee ends up recovering money from a third party for a injury.that would imply the employer was not solely responsible for the accident.so illinois law gives the employer a lien on any recovery that an employee obtains from a third party for a injury.comp.stat.b.an employer who exercises this lien gets first crack at any recovery the employee gets from the third party.id.f rom the amount received by such employee or personal representative from a third party there shall be paid to the employer the amount of compensation paid or to be paid by him to such employee or personal representative.
to calculate the amount of the employer lien,one begins with the recovery that the employee receives from the lawsuit and then reduces this value by an amount equal to the amount found by the trier of fact to be the employer pro rata share of the common liability in the action.id.the amount of the employer lien can not exceed its total workers compensation obligation.here are some examples to help illustrate how this calculation works 
as the last entry in the chart shows,sometimes an employer pro rata liability might exceed its workers compensation obligation.this is problematic because illinois law seeks to protect employers from paying more than what workers compensation requires.
to avoid this difficulty,the illinois supreme court has provided employers with two different ways to curtail their contribution liability.first,illinois law caps an employer contribution liability at an amount not greater than the employer workers compensation liability.kotecki cyclops welding.this value,which is generally referred to as the kotecki cap,represents the maximum amount that an employer has to pay in contribution.
despite the protection that kotecki provides,however,some employers might still prefer to pay workers compensation rather than contribution.for example,a contribution judgment would probably require an employer to make a lump sum payment up front workers compensation,on the other hand,often includes a component that is paid out over many years.even if the lump sum payment is discounted to account for lost investment opportunities,it might not be properly indexed for inflation,which implicitly decreases the cost of future payments.moreover,because the total cost of workers compensation often depends on how long the injured employee survives,an employer might prefer workers compensation if it believes the employee will die sooner than expected.the flip side is that an employer may end up paying more in workers compensation than in contribution if the employee lives longer than expected.
so illinois law provides employers with a second employer can escape contribution liability altogether by waiving its lien on an employee recovery from third parties.see lafever,at.an employer who takes this option can no longer share in damages that the employee recovers from a third party.however,the employer can then be certain that its only payment obligation will arise under workers compensation.
factual background 
skeeter baltzell worked for ensign,a manufacturer of caps and boosters for explosives,at a facility in union county,illinois.he helped load specialized that hauled explosives away from the ensign facility.r r trucking had a contract with ensign to provide these along with the drivers,helpers,and equipment necessary to load and unload the trailers.
on may,an ensign employee backed an r r into skeeter,crushing him between the trailer and a loading dock.the freightliner tractor and lufkin trailer that were involved in the accident were not equipped with a alarm.
skeeter was terribly injured.his pelvis was severely fractured and his bladder and lower intestinal tract were crushed.because of his injuries,skeeter suffered deep vein thrombosis,a heart attack,respiratory failure,and a stroke that left him brain damaged and partially paralyzed.skeeter still needs constant care and attention from his wife,ruth ann,as he has a permanent colostomy,must be catheterized to urinate,and has cognitive difficulties.
skeeter filed a claim before the illinois workers compensation commission iwcc seeking workers compensation benefits from ensign.skeeter and ruth ann also filed this suit in federal court,alleging strict liability claims under illinois law for personal injury and loss of consortium,respectively,against r r,freightliner,and lufkin collectively,the defendants.the defendants then filed contribution claims against ensign 
on april,a jury returned a verdict in favor of skeeter for,and in favor of ruth ann for,which resulted in a total judgment of.the jury apportioned fault as follows skeeter baltzell,freightliner,lufkin,r r,and ensign.accordingly,ensign was liable to skeeter and ruth ann for.
illinois law limited ensign contribution liability to the present cash value of its total workers compensation obligation,its kotecki cap.but the iwcc had yet finally determined what ensign total workers compensation liability would be,so the district court required ensign to submit an estimate of this amount.ensign submitted documentation that its kotecki cap was,and that it had already paid in workers compensation to the baltzells.neither the defendants nor the baltzells disputed these values,which the district court proceeded to adopt.
ensign then moved to waive its lien on the baltzells recovery and to dismiss the defendants contribution claims.on
