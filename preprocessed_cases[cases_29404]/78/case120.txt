having duly considered the petition for rehearing and response,we hereby substitute the following opinion for the opinion issued on january.
this case presents numerous questions arising from a seaman suit against his employer to recover damages for an injury allegedly sustained while aboard the employer vessel.following a jury trial,the seaman was awarded damages for his maintenance and cure and jones act negligence claims.the employer appeals,contending that the jury erred when it found that the seaman had not willfully concealed his prior back injuries,and that the employer had been unreasonable in withholding maintenance and cure benefits.the employer also argues that the district court improperly instructed the jury regarding special damages,and that the seaman improperly invoked the golden rule during closing arguments.
we agree with the employer regarding willful concealment,and accordingly vacate the award for maintenance and cure.on the issues of the jury instructions regarding the inconsistent verdict and the invocation of the golden rule,we hold in brown favor and affirm the decisions of the district court.
facts and proceedings 
rickey brown injured his back in august while lifting a sack of corn.brown was treated at an emergency room and issued a wheelchair and walker.brown told his treating physician,walter johnston,that he heard a pop in his back during the accident.
ten months later,on june,brown applied to work as a seaman for letourneau.as part of the application process,brown filled out letourneau medical questionnaire.brown checked no when asked whether he had ever suffered from back trouble.based in part on this representation,letourneau hired brown.in late may,while working for letourneau,brown alleged that he injured his back.brown was again treated by johnston.after the accident,brown was terminated from letourneau for falsely reporting an accident,filing a false accident claim,and failing to disclose his back injury on letourneau medical questionnaire.
on august,two months after being fired by letourneau,brown applied to work as a floorhand for parker drilling offshore corporation parker drilling.on parker drilling medical questionnaire,brown checked no when asked whether he had past or present back and neck trouble.based in part on this representation,parker drilling hired brown.
on april,brown reported to his supervisor that he felt back pain while pulling slips on the rotary table aboard the parker drilling rig.brown was sent off the rig floor to complete a preliminary report.the report stated while tripping pipe out of hole,i felt a pain in my lower left back when i pulled the slips out of the rotary table.brown later explained that the master bushings came up and then popped back down,causing the slip he was holding,which was attached to the master bushings in the rotary table,to suddenly jerk him.during its accident investigation,parker drilling came to believe that brown back injury had not been sustained aboard the vessel,and that brown had willfully concealed his prior back injuries.based upon these beliefs,parker drilling withheld payment of brown maintenance and cure benefits.
brown sued parker drilling for negligence under the jones act,unseaworthiness under general maritime law,retaliatory discharge,maintenance and cure benefits,and compensatory damages resulting from parker drilling failure to pay such benefits.parker drilling countered that brown was not entitled to maintenance and cure on the ground that he willfully concealed his past back injuries,and that brown was not entitled to compensatory damages because parker drilling withheld benefit payments in reliance upon a reasonable defense.the jury ultimately returned a verdict finding for brown in part specifically,the jury found that brown was injured due to the negligence of parker drilling that brown was entitled to maintenance and cure because he did not willfully conceal his medical condition,and that brown was entitled to compensatory damages because parker drilling unreasonably withheld maintenance and cure benefits.
by order and reasons dated july,the district court denied parker drilling motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol and,alternatively,for a new trial.the district court later entered judgment against parker drilling for,and parker drilling timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
a.the mccorpen defense 
parker drilling contends on appeal that the jury committed clear error by finding that brown had not willfully concealed his prior back injuries when he completed parker drilling medical questionnaire.we construe this assertion as an argument that the district judge erred in denying parker drilling motion for jmol 
a jones act employer is entitled to investigate a seaman claim for maintenance and cure benefits.morales garijak,cir.an employer is allowed to rely on certain legal defenses to deny these claims.mccorpen cent.gulf,cir.one such defense is that the injured seaman willfully concealed from his employer a preexisting medical condition.id.in order to establish a mccorpen defense,an employer must show that 
the claimant intentionally misrepresented or concealed medical facts 
the facts were material to the employer decision to hire the claimant and 
a connection exists between the withheld information and the injury complained of in the lawsuit.
id.at.parker drilling contends that the jury committed clear error by not finding that each one of these elements was established by a preponderance of the evidence.we review de novo the judge order denying parker drilling motion for jmol.
intent to conceal 
parker medical questionnaire asked whether brown had suffered past or present back and neck trouble.brown answered this question in the negative.parker drilling contends that this response constitutes an intentional concealment of a medical condition because brown had been treated for back injuries on two occasions prior to the time he completed parker drilling medical questionnaire had been fired from letourneau for falsely reporting an accident,filing a false accident claim,and denying that he had suffered from prior back trouble on letourneau employment medical questionnaire and misstated during his deposition that he had not sought medical care while working at letourneau.these show that brown had sustained back injuries prior to completing parker drilling medical questionnaire,that brown knew at the time he completed the questionnaire that these injuries constituted back trouble in the eyes of a past employer,and that brown habitually denied his prior established by parker drilling at trial.the jury nonetheless found that brown had not intended to conceal his medical condition from parker drilling,and the district judge upheld this finding.
brown now offers two explanations for the jury finding that he did not intentionally conceal his medical condition.first,he alleges that the question at issue on the parker drilling medical questionnaire is compound.second,he argues that he did not understand the definition of trouble.both arguments fail.
compound question 
as stated supra,the question at issue on parker drilling medical questionnaire asked whether brown had past or present back and neck trouble emphasis added.brown points out that this question is compound,and argues that a prospective employee could answer it in the affirmative only if he had suffered from both back and neck trouble 
brown argument is not well taken.because brown did not raise this point before the district court or the jury,it is waived on appeal.see,greenberg crossroads,cir.the briefs cite no testimony to show that brown in fact interpreted the question to be compound,and brown points to none.the jury could not have rationally inferred that brown did not lie on the questionnaire because the question was compound,and the district court did not uphold the jury finding on this basis.brown response to the question amounted to intentional concealment of his medical condition.
brown did not know his injuries constituted trouble 
to further support his claim that he did not intend to conceal his medical condition from parker drilling,brown alleges that he did not understand that his back injuries constituted back trouble.he states that he instead interpreted trouble to indicate serious injuries such as a broken back or neck.
when questioned at trial about his appointments with johnston that preceded his employment with parker drilling,brown explained that he had been treated for a sore back and a pulled muscle 
were you having any type of back trouble when you filled out the parker application 
i just had that pulled muscle,you know.they scanned me about that right now,so i guess i had to say i had a back pulled muscle.it back troubles,they said.
q.what did you think when you read on the application had you ever had back trouble,what came to your mind 
disc and all of that,you know,broke back,a disc,neck being broke or something,the injury is a real one instead of a pulled muscle.
trial tr.at emphases added.
brown acknowledged on,however,that he had been fired from his job at letourneau for his back trouble 
q.why were you fired from letourneau 
for my back trouble.
id.at emphasis added.
this admission demonstrates that brown recognized,only two months before he completed the parker drilling medical questionnaire,that his minor injuries,pulled muscles and back strains,rose to the level of back trouble in the eyes of a past employer.nonetheless,the district court observed that brown was a former special education student who exhibited a demeanor at trial and was subjected to rigorous and was repeatedly accused by defense counsel of lying.because the jury may have discounted brown trial testimony for these reasons,brown characterization of his prior injuries as trouble on,without more,may have been insufficient to show that brown knew that he had back trouble.
brown understanding of his prior injury as trouble,however,was necessarily established by the circumstances surrounding his termination from letourneau.brown was fired for answering no on letourneau medical questionnaire when asked whether he had suffered from back trouble.at trial,brown testified to the following 
and i believe that you had testified earlier that the reason they,at letourneau,got rid of you,did want you to work there anymore,is because letourneau found out about your past they found out about your lying on the application,or whatever,is that right 
and the reason letourneau,fant at letourneau came to you and said hey,we ca have you working here,is because he showed you the employment application where you checked off no,about prior back problems,right 
and he said i ca have anybody working here like that who misrepresents the application,right he told you that 
trial tr.at.such testimony shows that brown knew he had been fired from letourneau for denying that he had back trouble,and renders implausible brown explanation that,two months later,he did not understand the definition of trouble on parker drilling medical questionnaire.
we disagree with the argument in the dissent on rehearing that this case turns on the jury impressions of brown credibility.judge stewart dissent on rehearing quotes mccorpen requirement that a shipowner must persuade the court or jury that the seaman could reasonably be expected to have considered his medical history a matter of importance,at,to support the proposition that whether brown intentionally concealed his back problems was an issue of credibility,which should have been left to the.the language is inapposite it applies to a situation where the employer does not require a preemployment health questionnaire.the entire passage in mccorpen reads 
where the shipowner does not require a medical examination or interview,the rule is that a seaman must disclose a past illness or injury only when in his own opinion the shipowner would consider it a matter of importance.if the shipowner is unable to persuade the court or jury that the seaman could reasonably be expected to have considered his medical history a matter of importance,he will be liable for maintenance.he will be liable if it is found that there existed reasonable grounds for the seaman belief that he was fit for duty.
id.at.this court continued in mccorpen on the other hand,where the shipowner requires a seaman to submit to a medical examination or interview and the seaman intentionally misrepresents or conceals material medical facts,the disclosure of which is plainly desired,then he is not entitled to an award of maintenance and cure.id.at.
in his order denying parker drilling motion for judgment as a matter of law,the district judge wrote 
w hether or not the plaintiff intended to misrepresent or conceal material medical facts was a hotly disputed question of fact at trial.the plaintiff stated that because of the minor nature of the muscle pulls he had experienced in the past,he did not consider any prior back strains or muscle pulls to be back injuries when confronted with the question on the parker employment application.he denied intentionally concealing any material medical information.it is apparent that the jury gave credence to his explanation and it rejected parker mccorpen defense.
brown parker drilling offshore,wl,dist.lexis,at.july.
however,parker drilling established as a matter of law that brown knowingly concealed material medical information.while the dissent on rehearing argues that intentional concealment can never be a matter of law,we do not adopt this interpretation of mccorpen intentional concealment prong.rather,we agree with the court of appeals for the ninth circuit that t he intentional concealment element does not require a finding of subjective intent.vitcovich ocean rover,wl,cir,unpublished opinion.the vitcovich court continued 
rather,it refers to the rule that a seaman may be denied maintenance and cure for failure to disclose a medical condition only if he has been asked to reveal it.failure to disclose medical information in an interview or questionnaire that is obviously designed to elicit such information therefore satisfies the intentional concealment requirement.
id.at citation omitted.see also evans blidberg rothchild,cir reversing judgment for maintenance,holding that the seaman made two misstatements of fact which materially affected his eligibility for employment with the shipowner and finding deliberate misrepresentation.
the view that the intentional concealment prong of mccorpen is an essentially objective inquiry has also been adopted by courts in this circuit.for example,caulfield kathryn rae towing,involved similar facts and legal issues.in spite of the plaintiff insistence that a factual dispute exist ed regarding whether he concealed or misrepresented medical facts,the district judge correctly concluded that the plaintiff knew that the information on the application was not correct,because he suffered a previous injury to his back id.finding that the plaintiff intentionally misrepresented his medical history,the district judge summarily dismissed the claim for maintenance and cure.see also bud boat rental,wiggins,wl,dist.lexis,at,finding that no genuine issue of material fact was in dispute because the claimant plainly concealed his past history of back trouble even though he denied having intentionally withheld information in re towing,wl,dist.lexis.june,granting summary judgment on finding that claimant concealed medical information,even though the plaintiff argued that a factual dispute existed as to his intent to conceal the pertinent facts.
the language of mccorpen lends itself to the objective interpretation of intentional concealment 
the applicant medical history was solicited by the shipowner through a questionnaire.thus,the issue for us is not whether mccorpen believed in good faith he was fit for duty but whether he was guilty of the kind of intentional concealment of a disabling illness that precludes an award of maintenance.tested by this standard,his case is not so strong in completing a form that was obviously designed to elicit information about past illnesses of importance,appellant failed to reveal his medical condition 
mccorpen,at.
as noted by other courts,the mccorpen test is less subjective,less reliant on determinations of a seaman credibility,than other circuits comparable tests.the court of appeals for the eighth circuit,in adopting the mccorpen test,noted that it is less subjective than the second circuit test.wactor spartan transp,cir citing sammon cent.gulf,cir explaining that the second circuit,in sammon,adopted a test allowing a seaman to claim maintenance and cure for a related injury or illness if he held a good faith belief,at the time he answered the question,that the condition or earlier injury was not relevant.mccorpen intentional concealment prong neither necessarily turns on credibility nor requires a subjective determination.
following the dissent on rehearing reasoning in this case would eviscerate the mccorpen defense,which would give rise to undesirable consequences.pulling slips on a drilling rig is demanding and potentially dangerous work.employers need to be certain that each employee is physically able to do the work,not only to protect the employer from liability,but also to protect the employees.this is the purpose of the preemployment health questionnaire,and of the mccorpen defense.seamen must not be allowed to blatantly misrepresent their medical history on questionnaires and then plead ignorance before a jury.
parker drilling established as a matter of law that brown intentionally concealed his prior back injuries,and the district judge erred in failing to so find in his ruling on the motion for jmol.
materiality 
the second element of the mccorpen defense,materiality,was clearly established at trial.the fact that an employer asks a specific medical question on an application,and that the inquiry is rationally related to the applicant physical ability to perform his job duties,renders the information material for the purpose of this analysis.brown history of back injuries is the exact type of information sought by employers like parker drilling.brown,by his own admission,realized that information about his back condition had been important to one of his past employers.brown he could perform heavy labor tasks for his first few months on the irrelevant parker drilling based its hiring decision at least,in part upon whether applicants had past or present back and neck trouble,not whether they could,on the date of their application,complete difficult manual labor tasks.parker drilling has established that brown misrepresentation was material to its hiring decision.
we now turn to whether parker drilling met its burden to establish causality,the third prong of the mccorpen test.c ase law reflects that even an intentional misrepresentation of medical facts which would have been material to the employer hiring decision is insufficient to overcome an obligation of maintenance and cure,barring a connection between the withheld information and the injury which is eventually sustained.howard well serv,wl,dist.lexis,at.we hold that parker drilling did demonstrate the existence of such a connection between brown preexisting injury and his injury giving rise to this lawsuit 
the evidence established that brown suffered a lumbar strain in and,with possible disc herniation,at and.dona,brown expert witness,acknowledged that brown prior back strains were to the same region as his current back problem.brown argues that parker drilling has not established causality because there is no proof that he suffered a previous disc herniation,and points out that nowhere in the reports of mimeles and applebaum is there any indication that brown herniated disc preexisted his employment with parker drilling.the dissent on rehearing echoes this argument,maintaining that there was no evidence presented to conclusively show that brown sustained the herniated disc prior to the incident at parker.this position is without merit because parker drilling need not prove that the prior injuries are the sole causes of the herniation.it need only show a causal relationship between the prior injuries and the herniation.t here is no requirement that a present injury be identical to a previous injury.all that is required is a causal link between the disability that was concealed and the disability incurred during the voyage.quiming int l pac,citing mccorpen,at.because brown injuries were to the same location of the lumbar spine,the causal link between the concealed information and the new injury was established at trial.
courts in this circuit have routinely found such a causal link in similar circumstances.in weatherford nabors offshore,wl,dist.lexis.march,the district court granted summary judgment for the defendant,holding that the claimant was not entitled to maintenance and cure as a matter of law,because w here plaintiff claims an injury in the exact same area of the back as was previously injured,the causal connection is clear.id.at,dist.lexis,at.see also fox plaquemines parish gov t,wl,dist.lexis,at,granting summary judgment against claimant on maintenance and cure claim,when defendant showed that the claimant prior and present back problems both involved lower back injuries involving the disc guillory northbank towing,wl,dist.lexis,at.june,granting summary judgment for defendant,holding that plaintiff maintenance and cure claim is for the exact same area of the back,at the level therefore,there clearly is a causal connection and materiality between and of that which was concealed and his present medical condition.keys halliburton,wl,dist.lexis,at.may,granting the defendant summary judgment motion on issue of its obligation to pay maintenance and cure benefits to the plaintiff,holding that both injuries at issue were medical injuries affecting the low back 
in sum,parker drilling mounted a successful mccorpen defense.it established brown intent to conceal his medical condition,that the nondisclosed facts were material to its decision to hire brown,and that a connection existed between the withheld information and the injury complained of in the lawsuit.we therefore reverse the district court decision denying parker drilling motion for jmol on whether brown is entitled to maintenance and cure benefits,which voids the jury determination of this issue.
parker drilling withholding of maintenance and cure benefits 
parker drilling contends that the jury clearly erred by finding that brown acted unreasonably in withholding brown maintenance and cure benefits.this court has recognized that 
there is an escalating scale of liability a shipowner who is in fact liable for maintenance and cure,but who has been reasonable in denying liability,may be held liable only for the amount of maintenance and cure.if the shipowner has refused to pay without a reasonable defense,he becomes liable in addition for compensatory damages.if the owner not only lacks a reasonable defense but has exhibited callousness and indifference to the seaman plight,he becomes liable for punitive damages and attorney fees as well.
morales,at emphasis added.
parker drilling offers two explanations for its failure to pay maintenance and cure brown willfully concealed his prior medical condition,and brown injury was not sustained on parker drilling vessel.the question before us is whether the judge erred in upholding the jury finding that parker drilling reliance on these explanations was unreasonable 
we hold that the judge erred in upholding the jury finding that it was unreasonable for parker drilling to withhold benefits because parker drilling refusal was based on a reasonable defense that brown had willfully concealed his medical condition.the jury could not rationally have determined that parker drilling was unreasonable in relying on this defense,so their finding constitutes clear error.accordingly,we need not reach parker drilling second explanation for withholding benefits.
does the jones act negligence verdict survive the mccorpen defense 
brown argues in his petition for rehearing that the panel decision improperly dismissed his jones act negligence claim based on the mccorpen defense.parker drilling argues in response that because brown lied on the employment questionnaire,he was not eligible to sue for negligence under the jones act.parker drilling argument proceeds from the uncontroverted premise that t he relationship is an absolute prerequisite to jones act liability.reed iowa marine repair,citing stamoulos howland panama,rev on other grounds,cir.if brown was not in a valid employment relationship with parker drilling because of his misrepresentations on the medical questionnaire,he is not eligible to recover damages under the jones act,according to minneapolis,paul sault marie ry.rock.
in rock,the supreme court barred a railway worker from suing under the federal employers liability act fela because he fraudulently substituted a for his preemployment physical exam.jones act cases follow cases under the fela.see,omar,cir.however,the supreme court has effectively overruled rock.in still norfolk western railway,the supreme court clarified that even an employee who obtains his employment through fraud is considered an employee for purposes of the jones act,d holding that even employees who become such through other kinds of fraud,although possibly subject to termination through rescission of the contract of employment,must be recognized for purposes of suits under the fela,and thus the jones act see also reed,at t he supreme court has effectively foreclosed any argument that misrepresentations in an application for employment might void the necessary employment relation.
notwithstanding brown misrepresentations on the health questionnaire,he was in an employment relationship with parker drilling for purposes of a jones act negligence claim.see,omar,at gypsum carrier,handelsman,cir.
because the jones act negligence verdict is viable,we must now consider parker drilling arguments that the district court abused its discretion when it charged the jury to reconcile its inconsistent verdict and that brown counsel invocation of the golden rule argument tainted the jury verdict such that a new trial is warranted.
c.did the district court abuse its discretion when it charged the jury to reconcile its inconsistent verdict 
the jury verdict for jones act negligence was inconsistent in that it awarded brown special damages but not general damages the judge immediately instructed the jury to remedy this error,explaining that if you decide that future medical expenses are going to be incurred as a result of that accident,you must award something for pain and suffering.parker drilling argued in its motion for judgment as a matter of law and,alternatively,for a new trial,that the district court erroneously charged the jury on how to reconcile its inconsistent verdict.the district court denied the motion,but did grant parker drilling motion for remittitur and entered judgment against parker drilling for.parker drilling renewed its objection to the district court instructions to the jury on appeal.
challenges to jury instructions are reviewed for abuse of discretion.interests,cal.pools,cir.a judgment should be reversed only if the charge as a whole creates a substantial doubt as to whether the jury has been properly guided in its deliberations.id.
parker drilling contends that the district court instruction to reconcile the jury inconsistent verdict constituted an abuse of discretion.specifically,parker drilling argues that the district court instruction to redeliberate essentially abrogated the jury stated will and intent to reconsider both special and general damages.parker drilling relies on two issues regarding the quantum of the award in attempting to show that the district judge instruction abrogated the jury intent to recalculate special damages during its redeliberation.
first,parker drilling asks this court to consider a statement by the jury on a questionnaire form separate from the verdict form that it wanted to award brown.during redeliberation following the judge instructions,the jury increased its award to.second,parker drilling argues that the fact that the jury did not adopt in toto one of the parties economic experts calculations of damages is evidence that it had derived its award from a consideration of the totality of the evidence.had the jury been instructed to reconsider all special and general damages,argues parker drilling,it could have readjusted the entire verdict to award something for general damages but to stay within the it originally wanted to award.
these arguments fail because the initial figure on the questionnaire was calculated during the jury original deliberation,when the jury was apparently unaware of its legal obligation to award general damages once it had awarded special damages.that the jury gave a higher award after receiving proper instruction on the law is not evidence that the district judge abrogated the jury intent.the district judge instruction did not prohibit the jury from making any adjustments to the verdict it wished,provided it remedied the inconsistency.the jury was free to readjust its award to total,had it so desired.
parker drilling argument regarding the district court instruction on redeliberation fails because the district court instructed the jury that if it awarded special damages,then it must award general damages.further,the judge offered the jury a new,blank set of interrogatories to complete during its redeliberation and instructed the jury to look at the instructions,which expressly stated that general damages must be awarded if special damages are awarded.it was clear to the jury that it was free to reconsider both special and general damages.it is settled law in this circuit that mere resubmission does not necessarily coerce a verdict.richard firestone tire rubber,cir.because the district judge did not abuse his discretion,we affirm the district court denial of a new trial on this issue.
d.did the invocation of the golden rule by brown counsel taint the jury verdict such that a new trial is warranted 
during closing arguments,brown counsel remarked to the jury 
this is an emotional injury.this year old needs a back fusion.he will go through pain and suffering.he will go through emotional issues,you can fairly compensate him for that.we not asking for sympathy here.i want you to close your eyes when you go in the back,please,and put yourself on a rig as a year old making a year.
parker drilling objected that counsel invocation of the golden rule,asking the jurors to stand in the shoes of a party,was improper.the district court sustained the objection,and later instructed the jury to not let bias,prejudice or sympathy play any part in your deliberations.parker drilling did not object to this instruction or request that the district court specifically instruct the jury to disregard plaintiff counsel invocation of the golden rule.parker drilling contends on appeal that the court should order a new trial on the ground that brown counsel improperly invoked the golden rule during its closing argument.
we review the district judge actions surrounding brown counsel invocation of the golden rule for abuse of discretion.truck lines,mills,cir.a plea to the jury members to put themselves in the shoes of the plaintiff and do unto him as they would have done unto them under similar circumstances is improper because it encourages the jury to depart from neutrality and to decide the case on the basis of personal interest and bias rather than the evidence.ivy sec.barge lines,cir.even if counsel does not explicitly invoke the golden rule but merely invites the jury to place themselves in the position of the plaintiff,the result is effectively the same and the risk of taint is no different.whitehead food max of,cir.any reasonable interpretation of the language used by brown counsel indicates that the golden rule was invoked.
even if a party does invoke the golden rule,however,a new trial is warranted only if the opposing party shows that it was sufficiently prejudiced considering all the facts and circumstances of the case.united states jefferson,cir.parker drilling claims that the jury deliberations were tainted by the district judge failure to expressly admonish brown counsel for employing the golden rule.to support this claim,parker drilling quotes this court statement in loose offshore navigation,that t he use of such a golden rule argument so taints a verdict as to be grounds for a new trial,cir.the trial judge in loose,however,had overruled the objection to counsel use of the golden rule.id.moreover,this court in loose further underscored that t he invocation of the golden rule does not create immutable error.the trial judge may,by appropriate instruction,salve the suit.id.at see also,at the best that can be done when the suggestion is made is for the court to indicate the legal impropriety of the notion.lovett union pac,cir concluding that because counsel did not refer to the improper hypothetical after the objection and because the trial court instructed the jury on its proper role,the complaining party was not prejudiced.
parker drilling objection was sustained,brown counsel immediately abandoned this line of argument,and the district court expressly instructed the jury not to sympathize with the plaintiff.parker drilling has failed to establish that it was sufficiently prejudiced by brown invocation of the golden rule,and a new trial is not warranted.
iii.conclusion 
because the district judge denial of the motion for jmol regarding the maintenance and cure claims was erroneous,we hereby vacate the jury verdict as to the maintenance and cure award.
the prior majority opinion dismissing brown jones act negligence award was erroneous accordingly,that award is reinstated.the district court denial of the motion for a new trial on the bases of erroneous jury instructions regarding reconciling the inconsistent verdict and brown counsel invocation of the golden rule,is affirmed.
i concur in the panel majority decision affirming the jones act verdict in favor of brown the denial of parker drilling motion for new trial claiming that the trial judge improperly charged the jury in its attempt to remedy the inconsistent verdict and the denial of parker drilling motion for new trial claiming that it was prejudiced by brown counsel invocation of the golden rule.regarding the majority reversal of brown maintenance and cure verdict,i continue to dissent.
the initial majority opinion appearing at cir,completely substituted its credibility determinations for those of the jury in this case in an effort to rescue the shipowner from what the majority considered to be a legally deficient jury verdict.on rehearing,the majority strains to characterize this case as one which principally turns on the resolution of an objective issue of law and not on credibility,a traditional jury province,as the trial judge saw it and as i saw it after reading the trial record.
a close examination of the cases the majority cites in its opinion on rehearing shows that the cases are an assortment of appeals of summary judgment rulings,bench trial rulings and,for the most part,cases where the facts involved were significantly more egregious than the facts and circumstances presented to the jury in this case.for the reasons that i shall reiterate,brown parker drilling was a hard fought,quintessential jury trial,presided over by a highly attentive trial judge.this case was not difficult for this citizen jury to understand.it was not a multiple party case requiring sophisticated organizational charts to explain for the jury the relative interests of the parties in the case,it required no complex federal statutory interpretation to guide its decision making,it involved no compound contractual entanglements between the parties requiring the jury to decipher reams of paper presented to it by each party,it involved no overlapping principal claims and cross claims tethered to a labyrinth of legal principles and theories.neither the trial judge denial of parker drilling motion for judgment as a matter of law,nor the jury verdict on the maintenance and cure issue should be reversed by the hindsight of this appellate court.
following a jury trial in this hotly contested maintenance and cure lawsuit,the jury deliberated for five hours over all the competing claims of the parties and then returned a verdict in favor of brown in the amount of.having remitted the verdict to,the trial court fully discussed the facts and law pertaining to parker drilling motions and then denied them.despite this context,the panel majority sifts through the evidence,essentially declares brown to be unworthy of belief by the jury,and then substitutes its appellate judgment for that of the jury.the majority discards the plaintiff verdict and summarily renders a substitute verdict for parker drilling,the employer.because i decline to participate in the majority usurpation of the jury function,i respectfully dissent.
the majority anchors its analysis on mccorpen central gulf steamship,cir.i have no quarrel with parker drilling right to assert a wilful concealment defense in this case.however,mccorpen also provided that,i f the shipowner is unable to persuade the court or jury that the seaman could reasonably be expected to have considered his medical history a matter of importance,he will be liable for maintenance.at see also springborn am.commercial barge lines,cir guevara maritime overseas,cir stating that the standard of review in a jones act case is highly deferential.brown testified,and his trial counsel presented evidence,that brown did not consider his prior injuries to be back problems within the meaning of parker drilling employment application,but instead considered his prior injuries mere muscle pulls.thus,the question whether brown fraudulently concealed prior back problems,within the meaning of parker drilling employment application was,in this instance,one of credibility.questions of credibility should properly be left to the.see,polanco city of austin,cir.
on appeal,parker drilling contests the district court rulings on its motion for judgment as a matter of law,or in the alternative,motion for new trial,or for remittitur.the panel majority reversal of the jury verdict here is tantamount to a judgment as matter of law,pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.a motion for judgment as a matter of law in an action tried by jury is,in essence,a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury verdict.hiltgen sumrall,cir.review under rule a of a trial court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law is de novo.this court must apply the same standard the district court used when it first considered the motion,on the first pass.hiltgen,at.thus,we will uphold a jury verdict unless there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find as it did.a.ambiguities and doubts are to be resolved in favor of the seaman.springborn,at.to show deference to a jury decision,this court has consistently stated that,
a jury may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence,and those inferences may constitute sufficient proof to support a verdict.
on appeal,we are bound to view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the jury determination.even though we might have reached a different conclusion if we had been the trier of fact,we are not free to reweigh the evidence or to credibility of witnesses.we must not substitute for the jury reasonable factual inferences other inferences that we may regard as more reasonable.

at trial,brown brought five claims against parker drilling negligence under the jones act,unseaworthiness under general maritime law,retaliatory discharge,maintenance and cure,and unreasonable failure to pay maintenance and cure.after five hours of deliberation,the jury returned a verdict in favor of brown on three of the five claims negligence under the jones act,maintenance and cure,and unreasonable failure to pay maintenance and cure.the jury found in favor of parker drilling on the two remaining claims of unseaworthiness and retaliatory discharge.on the claim for negligence under the jones act,the jury apportioned fault,finding brown at fault and parker drilling at fault.judgment was entered in favor of brown on may.parker drilling filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law,or in the alternative,a motion for a new trial,or a motion for a remittitur.the district court considered the matter under the appropriate standard articulated under rule a.the district court first considered the evidence under the standard for a motion for judgment as a matter of law.thus,the trial judge evaluated the facts to determine whether,after drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of brown,there was a legally sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find in favor of brown.the district court then considered parker drilling motion for a new trial.after weighing all the evidence anew,the district court concluded that the jury verdict was not against the great weight of the evidence.the district court cogently articulated in its order and reasons its explanation for denying the motion for judgment as a matter of law and the motion for a new trial.these reasons are based on detailed and careful analysis of the trial and supported by substantial facts in the record.the court observed 
contrary to the defendant characterization of the plaintiff testimony,whether or not the plaintiff intended sic to misrepresent or conceal material medical facts was a hotly disputed question of fact at trial.the plaintiff stated that because of the minor nature of the muscle pulls he had experienced in the past,he did not consider any prior back strains or muscle pulls to be back injuries when confronted with the question on the parker employment application.he denied intentionally concealing any material medical information.it is apparent that the jury gave credence to his explanation and it rejected parker mccorpen defense.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,the court also finds that the plaintiff did offer substantial evidence supporting his jones act and maintenance and cure claims.brown was,in fact,employed as a jones act seaman on the day of the accident on parker drilling vessel.plaintiff testified that he was engaged in pulling slips on the rig floor when the slips stuck in the master bushing,causing them to rise from the drill floor and then suddenly drop,abruptly jerking the plaintiff and causing injury to his back.he reported the accident in a timely manner and he was placed on light duty.
other evidence was presented which corroborates plaintiff claim.there was testimony that the master bushing should have been greased to prevent it from sticking,that plaintiff had never actually been instructed to grease the master bushing,that under normal circumstances the master bushing should not rise from the drill floor,that brown was an excellent employee during the six months prior to the accident that he worked for parker,and that brown had never exhibited back pain or a back injury prior to the accident.plaintiff drilling procedures expert,kubelka,testified that the plaintiff was not properly trained and that the equipment in use on the parker rig was not functioning properly.in addition,there was uncontradicted medical evidence that plaintiff does have a herniated disc in his lumbar region.
parker entire argument in favor of its motion for judgment as a matter of law is based upon its interpretation of the evidence in the light most favorable to its case,relying almost exclusively on its own credibility determinations.as noted above,however,in deciding a motion for judgment as a matter of law,the district court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence i t is the function of the jury as the traditional finder of facts,not the court,to weigh conflicting evidence and inferences,and determine the credibility of witnesses.victoria county,texas,cir,quoting macarthur of.health ctr.at tyler,cir citation omitted.as noted,the district court task is to determine if the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict,disregarding evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe.id.sic applying this stringent standard,the court finds that the defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law is without merit.
with respect to the defendant motion for a new trial on the jones act negligence and entitlement to maintenance and cure claims,for reasons previously stated,the motion is without merit.
this recitation by the trial judge alone is sufficient to demonstrate there was a lawful evidentiary basis for the district court to reasonably uphold the jury verdict.accordingly,our court is required to remain mindful that,in light of the seventh amendment guarantee of the right to jury trial,this court has a duty to proceed cautiously,and should validate the jury verdict if at all possible.gaspard,at.this record indicates that it is clearly possible to validate this verdict.
notwithstanding the district court conclusion,my review of the record,taken in the light most favorable to brown,also finds substantial evidence to permit a reasonable jury to reject parker drilling mccorpen defense.from the inception of opening statements to the final words of closing arguments,the salient facts of this case were fiercely debated.in opening statements,brown trial counsel delineated a succinct time line of brown first two injuries,leading up to the injury brown alleges he sustained in the course of his employ at parker drilling in,brown was treated in an emergency room in vicksburg,mississippi for what he claims was a pulled muscle resulting from the lifting of an ice chest filled with one hundred pounds of corn.at the time of the first injury,brown was seventeen years old and still in high school.brown were inconclusive as to whether he had a herniated disc.still reeling from the pain,brown visited his family physician,johnston,five days later.in may of,brown graduated from high school.brown testified that between the time of the first injury and the time of the second injury,he suffered no pain with his back.in august of,brown took a job with letourneau,a company at a shipyard that builds offshore drilling rigs.at letourneau,brown was employed as a welder.similar to what brown would later encounter in parker drilling employment application,letourneau employment application contained a questionnaire inquiring whether brown suffered,at that time,or in his past,back problems.brown did not inform letourneau of the incident with the corn,but testified that he failed to do so,only because he did not believe his prior injury constituted back problems,within the meaning of letourneau application.the evidence reveals that brown continued to work for letourneau from august of until june of,and that between that time,brown suffered no pain with his back.in june of,however,while lif
