michael preston filed a worker compensation claim against his employer,bath iron works biw,alleging that harassment in the workplace aggravated the symptoms of his previously existing neurological condition.after the administrative law judge alj denied benefits,preston appealed to the benefits review board the board.in vacating the alj decision,the board ruled that the alj had not determined whether the stress and harassment claimed by preston had occurred,and it remanded for further consideration.on remand,the alj made the requisite findings on stress and harassment and reversed his earlier disposition by granting benefits to preston.biw appealed the alj second decision,and the board affirmed.biw now appeals to this court,arguing primarily that the board erred in overturning the alj first decision denying benefits.it also challenges rulings in the board second decision.after careful review,we affirm.
we derive the following facts from the record before the alj.we relate only those facts necessary to dispose of the issues on appeal.
michael preston suffers from a hereditary neurological disorder called paramyoclonus multiplex,which causes involuntary shaking of his head and arms.preston has suffered symptoms of the disease from approximately age ten until the present.the involuntary shaking tends to become worse when he is under stress.when the stress subsides,however,his symptoms usually subside.
from until,preston worked at the biw shipyard in bath,maine.he began work as a rigger,which required him to attach shackles to ship often weighed between and that they could be picked up by a crane.typically,he worked as part of a six to eight person crew,and most of his work was done on the ground or in a hydraulic lift called a cherry picker.in the last six to eight years of his career,preston spent about half of his time at work as a crane operator,maneuvering cranes that sat on tracks approximately forty feet above the floor of the assembly area.
preston alleges that,during his twenty years at biw,he was ridiculed,called derogatory names,and subjected to practical jokes because of the symptoms of his disease.members of his crew referred to him as shake and bake and would sometimes try to startle him so that his shaking would become more pronounced.this harassment caused stress,which in turn exacerbated preston symptoms.as his shaking worsened,he began to worry that he could not safely perform his job.in a harmful cycle,this concern caused even greater stress which further aggravated his symptoms.as his symptoms grew worse,he claims that his coworkers began to question whether he was a danger to his crew.
in light of these difficulties at work,preston began to take time off to get his symptoms under control.on the advice of his treating physician,stephanie carcini,he stopped working altogether on august.he reports that his symptoms have improved since he stopped working.
on october,preston filed a claim for benefits under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act the act.on november,biw controverted preston claim.an alj held hearings on april and april,during which both parties presented evidence,including the expert testimony of several physicians.preston argued that the working conditions at biw so aggravated the symptoms of his disorder that he could not continue working.biw contended that any teasing or ridicule at the shipyard was minor and that any deterioration in preston condition was due to other stressful events in his life,such as struggles with his family life and his recurring problems with alcohol abuse.
the evidence offered by biw included the testimony of a neurologist,seth kolkin,and an evaluation conducted by a psychiatrist,david bourne.in his written decision,the alj described kolkin testimony about whether stress could aggravate preston conditions 
kolkin testified that stress can worsen the involuntary movements associated with myoclonus but only as a temporary aggravation,that any improvement of that temporary condition depends on the exact situation and his levels of concentration,medications,fatigue,motivation and that preston advised the doctor that he found his work to be stressful because of depression and difficulties at work.
t he doctor agree d that s tress,depression,any volition,motivation,any degree of psychological state would affect preston movements 
according to the doctor,stress and fatigue will transiently exacerbate preston symptoms,that the exacerbation would last for the duration of the fatigue or stress and once that stress is resolved the person would be back at his baseline,the doctor remarking that it would take moments to return to baseline after the stress is removed and that preston could work if he had a calm,supportive environment,and that if he were motivated and given some latitude and encouragement and support,there is no reason why he could be doing what he was doing before if he wanted to be.according to the doctor,if preston were to be called derogatory names because of his myoclonus,he should report those instances to his supervisors and if action were not taken to stop that harassment,then such would not constitute a calm and supporting work environment.
bourne evaluation,dated june,assessed only preston complaints of psychological problems,including anxiety and depression.the alj quoted bourne evaluation at length in his opinion,including the following passage 
it is my bourne belief that preston psychological condition has been caused by his physical illness and by the deterioration of his health which he perceives.his movement disorder has caused a psychological struggle,which has left him feeling isolated,sensitive and hurt.i do not have the expertise to determine whether any eventual aggravation of the movement disorder is or was due to work conditions,and will defer to the expertise of neurologists concerning that issue.
thus,kolkin stated that stressful working conditions could aggravate preston physical symptoms,even if the aggravation lasted only as long as the stress remained.bourne explicitly limited his analysis to preston psychological,rather than his physical,problems,and avoided any opinion on whether work conditions aggravated preston movement disorder.
on january,the alj denied benefits to preston.in his written order he explained that,to be eligible for benefits,a claimant must first establish a prima facie case,which gives rise to a presumption that his injury was caused by his employment and thus is covered by the act.
to establish a prima facie claim for compensation,a claimant need not affirmatively establish a connection between work and harm.rather,a claimant has the burden of establishing only that the claimant sustained physical harm or pain and an accident occurred in the course of employment,or conditions existed at work,which could have caused the harm or pain.
citations omitted.the alj noted that i f claimant employment aggravates a,underlying disease so as to produce incapacitating symptoms,the resulting disability is compensable.he also described the effect of establishing a prima facie case 
once this prima facie case is established,a presumption is created under section a a that the employee injury or death arose out of employment.to rebut that presumption,the party opposing entitlement must present substantial evidence proving the absence of or severing the connection between such harm and employment or working conditions if the presumption is rebutted,it no longer controls and the record as a whole must be evaluated to determine the issue of causation.
despite laying out this analytical framework accurately,the alj did not make specific findings as to whether preston had suffered the ridicule and verbal abuse at work that he had described,or whether the alleged abuse had aggravated the symptoms of his disease.instead,the alj ruled that biw had adequately rebutted any section a presumption of causation through kolkin testimony and bourne evaluation.he analyzed the rebuttal of the section a presumption in two passages.in the first,he acknowledged the nature of preston claim and then dispatched it summarily 
in the case sub judice,claimant alleges that the harm to his bodily frame resulted from working conditions at the employer shipyard.the employer has introduced substantial evidence severing the connection between such harm and claimant maritime employment.thus,the presumption falls out of the case,does not control the result and i shall now weigh and evaluate all of the record evidence.
later in the opinion,he revisited biw attempt to rebut the section a presumption 
t he employer,in this case,has clearly introduced substantial evidence to rebut the presumption with the testimony of kolkin,both in his report and in his deposition,and with the testimony of bourne.kolkin testified that claimant condition is the same now as it was six or ten years ago and has not been aggravated or accelerated by his work as a rigger,or by any of the alleged stress in any way in the work environment.bourne has testified that claimant psychological condition is a chronic adjustment disorder which is caused by his underlying disease and which was not caused,accelerated,aggravated or exacerbated by the alleged stress at work.
the alj cited only kolkin testimony and bourne evaluation in determining that biw had rebutted the section a presumption of causation with substantial evidence.
preston appealed the alj decision to the board.in its written opinion of january,the board noted that the alj had not made specific findings on whether preston had actually suffered increased harassment and stress while working at biw 
while the administrative law judge identified claimant allegations as to harm and working conditions,he did not determine whether the alleged stress and harassment at claimant workplace occurred.without findings evaluating the conflicting evidence on this issue the board lacks the proper context for considering whether employer presented substantial evidence in rebuttal.
the board reasoned that it should remand the case to the alj with instructions to determine whether preston condition or its symptoms were aggravated by conditions or an accident at work.answering this question requires findings identifying the accident or working conditions in existence which could have aggravated preston condition.
additionally,the board instructed the alj that kolkin testimony and bourne evaluation were,as a matter of law,inadequate to rebut the section a presumption of causation if the alj found on remand that preston had established a prima facie case.the board explained 
t he opinion of kolkin actually supports a causal connection rather than rebutting it as the administrative law judge found kolkin testified that stress could temporarily worsen the symptoms of claimant myoclonus disease.he also stated that the increase of the involuntary movements would not be permanent but,rather,would dissipate when the stressor was removed this medical evidence supports the conclusion that stressful working conditions could have aggravated claimant condition.
in a footnote,the board explained that bourne evaluation was also insufficient to rebut the section a presumption bourne report addressed only the alleged psychiatric injury and not the physical injury.in fact,bourne specifically admitted he has no expertise to determine whether claimant physical disorder had been aggravated by his employment.
on remand,the alj stated that,having been directed by the board to reconsider the totality of this closed record on the nature and extent of the section a presumption,i am now constrained to find and conclude that preston has established a prima facie claim.his opinion contained a detailed analysis of the evidence supporting the conclusion that the work environment at biw had caused stress that aggravated preston involuntary shaking.specifically,the alj relied on preston testimony,and the testimony of preston supervisor,in finding that preston had been ridiculed at work,that this ridicule caused stress,and that his symptoms had at least worsened temporarily during stressful periods during his twenty years at biw.additionally,the alj relied on testimony by biw own expert medical witnesses in finding that workplace stress could exacerbate preston symptoms,if only temporarily,and thus that preston had established that workplace conditions could have aggravated the symptoms of his underlying condition.the alj then found that biw had not rebutted the section a presumption,noting correctly that the board had ruled as a matter of law that kolkin testimony and bourne evaluation were not sufficient for rebuttal.finally,the alj ruled that preston claim was not time barred and that preston was entitled to benefits based on his weekly wages and medical expenses.
in making these findings and rulings,the alj groused that he had been prompted by the board.specifically,he stated that after being prompted by the board,i now find and conclude that preston has introduced ample evidence of harm to invoke the section a presumption.he then added this complaint 
this matter is another example of cases involving my decisions wherein the board has clearly usurped the functions of this administrative law judge,has clearly substituted its opinions for this who presided over two days of formal hearings and who alone had the opportunity to hear the testimony and judge the credibility of witnesses testifying under oath before me.in certain cases,the board has treated the section a presumption as virtually an irrebuttable presumption.this matter,in my judgment,is another of those cases.
biw appealed this second decision to the board.taking some cues from the complaints of the alj,it argued that the board first decision exceeded the scope of its review and usurped the administrative law judge function as a because it reweighed the evidence and made inappropriate factual determinations in concluding that employer did not establish rebuttal of the section a presumption as a matter of law.it further argued that the board had improperly required employer to rule out any possible causal connection between claimant employment and his condition in order to establish rebuttal,instead of allowing biw to rebut a section a presumption with only substantial evidence.
the board rejected these arguments.it ruled that its first decision had only required the alj to undertake the section a analysis mandated by law,which required the alj to make specific findings about stress and harassment in preston workplace.with respect to its ruling that biw had not introduced evidence sufficient to rebut a section a presumption,the board wrote that it had merely applied the aggravation rule,which provides that where a claimant employment aggravates,accelerates or combines with a condition,the entire resulting disability is compensable.under that rule,biw could only rebut a section a presumption of causation with substantial evidence that claimant condition was not aggravated by his working conditions.the board concluded that a s none of the physicians opined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that claimant working conditions did not aggravate his underlying physical condition,employer did not meet its burden of production to rebut the section a presumption.the board affirmed the alj second decision because biw had not challenge d the administrative law judge findings invoking section a and had not point ed to any evidence sufficient to rebut section a.finally,the board affirmed the alj rulings on the timeliness of preston filing and the award of benefits.
on appeal to this court,biw argues primarily that the board erred in overturning the alj first decision.it further argues that both the board and the alj,in the second round of decisions,erred in finding that preston filed his claim in a timely fashion,finding that preston was disabled within the meaning of the act and was therefore entitled to benefits,determining preston average weekly wage for the purpose of calculating the award of benefits,and considering the question of medical benefits even though the parties had agreed to litigate that issue at a later date.we take each of these arguments in turn.this court reviews the board decision on legal issues de novo and determines whether the board adhered to the substantial evidence standard when it reviewed the alj factual findings.bath iron works brown,cir.
a.the board first decision 
in order for an injury to be covered by the act,the claimant must initially make out a prima facie case.that is,a claimant must at least allege an injury that arose in the course of employment as well as out of employment.brown,at quoting indus.fed.sheet metal,director,owcp,d.to establish a prima facie case,a claimant must make two showings that he sustained physical harm and that conditions existed at work which could have caused the harm.susoeff san francisco stevedoring,ben.bd.serv.thus,to make his prima facie case,the claimant is not required to show a causal connection between the harm and his working conditions,but rather must show only that the harm could have been caused by his working conditions.for the purposes of making a claim under the act,the physical harm alleged can be the aggravation of a previously existing condition.see gardner director,owcp,cir holding that aggravation of claimant symptoms from a previously existing venous condition was compensable under the act strachan shipping nash,cir w here an employment injury worsens or combines with a preexisting impairment to produce a disability greater than that which would have resulted from the employment injury alone,the entire resulting disability is compensable.
once a claimant makes a prima facie case,he is entitled to a presumption that the injury was caused by his working conditions and is therefore compensable under the act.a see also brown,at once claimant made out his prima facie case,there was a presumption of liability.an employer can rebut this section a presumption by demonstrating,through substantial evidence that the injury was not caused by the claimant working conditions.see brown,at sprague director,owcp,cir.if an employer introduces substantial evidence severing the causal connection between the injury and claimant working conditions,the presumption falls out of the case.sprague,at.in that instance,the claimant bears the burden of showing,based on the record as a whole,that his injury was caused by his working conditions.brown,at.
biw contends that the board erred in its first decision by ruling that the alj had not made sufficient findings identifying the accident or working conditions in existence which could have aggravated preston condition.rather,biw argues that the alj found in his first decision that preston had suffered stress on the job that could have aggravated his condition,determined that preston had established a prima facie case entitling him to the section a presumption of causation,but then ruled that biw had rebutted that presumption with substantial evidence that personal factors unrelated to work caused claimant stress and worsened his condition.
biw points to a single statement from the alj first decision to support its argument that he made the necessary findings on stress and harassment i may properly rely on claimant credible testimony to establish that he experienced a harm,if the record reflects the presence of working conditions that could have caused the harm,thereby invoking the section a presumption.this is a contingent finding if the record reflects the alj never stated whether the record reflects the presence of working conditions that could have caused the harm.
in contrast,the alj made explicit findings about preston work environment in his second decision.specifically,he found that preston was routinely called shake and bake and that t his nickname was so pervasive that at least some employees did not know preston by his real name.he further found that preston was subjected to ad hominum sic and dehumanizing remarks about a genetic condition he could not do anything to change,that even though his job performance was good,he was subjected to constant name calling and pranks,and that s urely,ridicule for an inherited condition would make the usual stress of a job worse for anyone.he concluded that preston stressful working conditions aggravated,accelerated and exacerbated his and chronic neurological disorder.in the absence of such findings in the alj first decision,the board was entitled to remand the case to the alj.
biw next argues that the board first decision ignored the alj findings that the evidence as a whole did not support a causal connection between the aggravation of preston symptoms and his workplace conditions.this argument,however,skips several steps in the proper analysis.the alj could only consider the record as a whole after finding that preston had established a prima facie case and was therefore entitled to the section a presumption,and biw had rebutted the section a presumption.in reviewing the alj first decision,the board never reached the alj analysis of the record as a whole because it found that the alj had not made the factual findings about preston workplace conditions necessary to determine whether preston had established a prima facie case.thus,the alj analysis of whether the record as a whole supported a causal connection between preston injury and his work environment was irrelevant to the question remanded by the board in its first decision whether preston work environment had caused stress that could have aggravated his condition.
biw also argues that the board usurped the alj fact finding authority in its first decision when it stated that kolkin testimony and bourne evaluation were not sufficient to rebut the section a presumption.this conclusion of the board,however,was a legal conclusion.there was no disagreement between the alj and the board about the substance of the testimony or its credibility.rather,the board concluded that,as kolkin opined that stress could aggravate claimant condition,his testimony could not,as a matter of law,sever the causal link between preston aggravated symptoms and his work environment.thus,it could not rebut a section a presumption that preston injury was caused by his work environment.
similarly,the board emphasized that bourne evaluation only addressed preston mental state,and that bourne had specifically declined to comment on preston physical symptoms.it ruled that testimony about preston mental state could not rebut a section a presumption that preston physical injury was caused by his workplace environment.the board conclusions about kolkin testimony and bourne evaluation did not usurp the alj authority to make findings of fact rather they addressed only the legal sufficiency of that evidence to rebut the section a presumption.
b.the board second decision 
timely notice 
biw argues that preston did not file a claim within the time period specified by the act,and therefore his claim is barred.the act imposes two separate time limits for filing a workers compensation claim.in the case of a traumatic injury,an employee must give notice to his employer within thirty days of the injury.a.in the case of an occupational injury that does not immediately result in disability,the employee must notify the employer within one year after the employee becomes aware,or should have become aware,of the relationship between the employment,the disease,and the disability.id.however,f ailure to give such notice required by a shall not bar any claim under this chapter if the employer or the carrier had knowledge of the injury.d.
in his second decision,the alj ruled that biw had actual knowledge of the aggravation of preston condition on september,when preston and his union representative met with the medical staff of biw at the shipyard infirmary.records from that meeting indicate that preston discuss ed his tremors and indicat ed he is feeling uncomfortable due to coworker pressure and a worsening of his condition.preston also indicated that his tremors were worse when under stress and that his coworkers are concerned about their safety and often made fun of him.this record constitutes substantial evidence that biw was aware of preston injury as early as september.thus,the alj ruled correctly that preston failure to formally notify biw was excused pursuant to d.
the alj also offered an alternative basis for finding that preston claim was no
