the california constitution directs the legislature to create a system of workers compensation that accomplishes substantial justice in all cases expeditiously,inexpensively,and without incumbrance of any character.cal,art.xiv.a primary goal of the workers compensation system is to secure prompt treatment for an injured worker to facilitate his or her return to the work force at the earliest possible time.avalon bay foods workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.
the employer of an injured worker is responsible for all medical treatment reasonably necessary to cure or relieve the worker from the effects of injury,subd.a.in order to protect the injured employee right to prompt appropriate treatment and to reduce costs,in the legislature directed the administrative director director of the division of workers compensation to establish a medical treatment utilization schedule incorporating,nationally recognized standards of care.
under this statutory scheme,the treating physician submits a request for treatment to the employer or the employer insurer utilization review ur is the process by which an employer reviews the recommendations of a treating physician and then decides whether to approve,modify,delay,or deny authorization for treatment based on medical necessity.in acting on treatment recommendations submitted under ur procedures,the employer is bound by section,subdivision b,which defines medical treatment that is reasonably required to cure or relieve the injured worker as treatment that is based upon guidelines adopted by the director.
the ur process is subject to mandatory time frames.section,subdivision g requires an employer to timely approve,modify,delay,or deny treatment requests.ur decisions must be communicated within five working days from receipt of the information,and in no event more than days from the date of the recommendation.ibid.
in this review of a decision by the workers compensation appeals board wcab,we consider the consequences that flow from an employer failure to timely act on an injured worker treatment request under the ur process.brice sandhagen,the injured employee,argues that by failing to timely respond to his treatment request,his employer forfeited its right to deny the request under the ur process.sandhagen also insists that because the ur process is mandatory and the exclusive means by which an employer can modify,delay,or deny treatment,his treatment request must be granted by default.
the employer insurer,state compensation insurance fund fund,disagrees and asserts that only monetary penalties can be imposed for its tardiness it retains the right to deny the treatment request under the ur process and may pursue remedies under the dispute resolution procedures set forth in section.
the wcab asserts,as a threshold matter,that its decision is not a final order and the petition for review is premature.on the merits,the wcab argues it properly determined that as a result of fund failure to meet ur time deadlines,fund is precluded from using ur procedures or medical reports to support the denial of sandhagen treatment request but retains the right to object to sandhagen treatment request under section based on other evidence.the practical consequences of fund untimeliness,under the wcab reasoning,would be to deprive fund of any reliance on the ur report denying treatment and require it to bear the burden of proof and persuasion in proceedings under section.
we shall deny fund and sandhagen petitions for writ of review.
factual and procedural background 
in october a car struck sandhagen as he worked as a foreman on a road construction project.sandhagen has received medical treatment continuously since the accident.sandhagen physician referred him to spinecare medical group,for a joint consultation by goldthwaite and josey.
the consulting physicians recommended an mri of sandhagen cervical and upper thoracic spine to determine if there were any disc herniations or disc degeneration causing sandhagen pain.the consulting physicians produced a report dated may,which they faxed to fund on may,with a request to authorize the recommended mri.
fund referred the matter to krohn to review the request under the ur process.on june,days after the mri authorization request,krohn sent a written denial,citing new medical treatment guidelines.
prior to the denial,on june,sandhagen filed a request for an expedited hearing on the ground that fund failed to meet the deadline for conducting ur under section,subdivision g.an expedited hearing took place on july,on the sole issue of the need for the recommended mri.
the wcab administrative law judge wcj found that fund failure to comply with the ur deadlines barred it from relying on the ur process to deny sandhagen treatment.only goldthwaite report remained admissible krohn report was inadmissible.the wcj also found the mri authorization request consistent with the new treatment guidelines.
fund sought reconsideration from the wcab.fund argued the consequences for failing to meet ur guidelines are specified in section,subdivision i,which provides for administrative penalties,and in section,which allows possible penalties for delay under section.fund claimed nothing in the legislature formation of the ur process allows exclusion of a ur report.
sandhagen answered,contending section,subdivision g requires an employer to meet specific time deadlines,and therefore fund can not rely on the ur process to justify denial of treatment.in addition,the wcj properly excluded the ur doctor denial letter.sandhagen also argued he had met his evidentiary burden with substantial evidence,goldthwaite report.
reasoning that untimely ur reports are inadmissible,the wcj recommended that fund petition for reconsideration be denied and that an employer who fails to conform to the deadlines must fall back on the more cumbersome process set forth in section.
the wcab granted reconsideration.due to the important legal issues presented and to secure uniformity of future decisions,the matter was assigned to the wcab as a whole for an en banc decision.
on november,the wcab issued its decision,holding 
the utilization review time deadlines of section g are mandatory and,if a defendant fails to meet these mandatory deadlines,it is precluded from using the utilization review procedure for the particular medical treatment dispute in question 
if a defendant undertakes an untimely utilization review procedure,any utilization review report obtained as to the particular treatment in dispute is not admissible in evidence,and any utilization review report obtained can not be forwarded to an ame or qme if section a procedures are timely pursued and 
when a defendant does not meet the section g deadlines,it may use the procedure established by section a to dispute the treating physician treatment recommendation however,the defendant not the applicant is then the objecting party and the defendant must meet the section a deadlines,unless those deadlines are extended for good cause or by mutual agreement.the wcab rescinded the wcj determination that sandhagen was entitled to the medical treatment in dispute.instead,the wcab gave fund a reasonable opportunity to obtain a section,subdivision a evaluation to assess the reasonableness and necessity of treatment.
fund filed a petition for writ of review.we issued an order granting review on february.sandhagen also sought review of the wcab decision,specifically the wcab finding that a party failing to comply with the ur deadlines may nonetheless object to the treatment authorization and initiate dispute resolution under section,subdivision a.we issued an order granting review on july.
with leave of court,the california applicants attorneys association filed an amicus brief in support of sandhagen.
discussion 
this case requires us to determine the meaning and effect of section,which establishes the ur process,in relationship to section,which provides for resolution of disputes between injured workers and their employers generally.our inquiry into legislative meaning begins as always with the language of the statute the plain meaning of the statutory language is the best indicator of the legislature intent.however,we look not only to the language itself but also to the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil,d.faced with an issue of statutory interpretation,we are obliged to adopt a meaning for the language in issue consistent with and promotive of the purpose of workers compensation law.fresno unified school dist.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.

statutory background 
section establishes an employer responsibility for all medical treatment reasonably required to cure or relieve the worker from the effects of his or her injury.the director is empowered to develop guidelines for determining whether proposed medical treatment is mandated by section m edical treatment that is reasonably required to cure or relieve the injured worker from the effects of his or her injury means treatment that is based upon the guidelines adopted by the director pursuant to section 
an employer decisions regarding the necessity of an injured employee proposed treatment are generally made within the matrix of the ur process set forth in section,subdivision b,which provides that e very employer shall establish a ur process in compliance with this section,either directly or through its insurer or an entity with which an employer or insurer contracts for these services.the ur process allows an employer to prospectively,retrospectively,or concurrently review the recommendations of the treating physician and decide whether to approve,modify,delay,or deny authorization for the treatment based on medical necessity,subd.a.each ur process is governed by written policies and procedures,subd.c.
if the employee objects to a decision made pursuant to section to modify,delay,or deny a treatment recommendation,recourse is provided under section recourse is also provided under section i f either the employee or employer objects to a medical determination made by the treating physician concerning any medical issues not covered by section or and not subject to section,subd.a.objections must be timely filed and are followed by a medical review.
the medical review conducted under section differs from that conducted under section.under section,the employee undergoes a comprehensive medical evaluation.n o other medical evaluation shall be obtained,subd.a.if the employee is not represented by an attorney,the employee selects the evaluator from a panel of three qualified medical evaluators qme,subds.b,c.if the employee is represented by counsel,the parties either concur on an agreed medical evaluator ame,or failing agreement,the selection is made from a panel of qualified medical evaluators qme,subd.b.a decision is rendered.
once the process is completed,either party may bring the decision before a wcj for review 
as part and parcel of the ur procedure,section establishes mandatory time frames for compliance with the process.section,subdivision g states in determining whether to approve,modify,delay,or deny requests by physicians prior to,retrospectively,or concurrent with the provisions of medical treatment services to employees all of the following requirements must be met prospective or concurrent decisions shall be made in a timely fashion that is appropriate for the nature of the employee condition,not to exceed five working days from the receipt of the information reasonably necessary to make the determination,but in no event more than days from the date of the medical treatment recommendation by the physician.in cases where the review is retrospective,the decision shall be communicated to the individual who received services,or to the individual designee,within days of receipt of information that is reasonably necessary to make this determination.section,subdivision g sets forth the deadline of hours when the employee condition presents a serious threat to his or her health.
section,subdivision g allows the employer to notify the employee and the physician in writing if the employer can not make a decision within the required timeframes finally,section,subdivision i contemplates an employer failure to meet the ur timelines and states if the director determines that the employer,insurer,or other entity subject to this section has failed to meet any of the timeframes in this section,or has failed to meet any other requirement of this section,the administrative director may assess,by order,administrative penalties for each failure.a proceeding for the issuance of an order assessing administrative penalties shall be subject to appropriate notice to,and an opportunity for a hearing with regard to,the person affected.the administrative penalties shall not be deemed to be an exclusive remedy for the director.these penalties shall be deposited in the workers compensation administration revolving fund.
in addition to any penalties assessed under section,subdivision i,section also provides that employees may be entitled to penalties for unreasonable delay of medical treatment where the employer unreasonably delays the ur process 
the wcab argues its november,decision is not a final order subject to a petition for writ of review.according to the wcab,the decision is not final because it did not determine any substantive right or liability of the parties.in addition,the decision did not determine any threshold issue,but only determined interlocutory evidentiary and procedural issues.we disagree.
a petition for writ of review may be taken only from a final order of the wcab.the final order requirement eliminates piecemeal appeals and the concomitant burden on the courts.the requirement also serves to avoid multiple appeals that delay and impede the resolution of the case.maranian workers comp.appeals bd.th,d maranian.
in its november,decision,the wcab rescinded the wcj previous decision and remanded the matter to the trial level for further proceedings and a new decision.according to the wcab,based on the foregoing history,fund does that the wcab november,decision resolved any substantive right or liability.to the contrary,the wcab rescinded the wcj decision awarding the disputed medical treatment to sandhagen and,instead,remanded the issue to the wcj for further proceedings and a new decision.therefore,the wcab concludes,the order can not be considered final since it failed to determine any substantive right or liability.
however,as fund points out,the wcab rescission and remand order was for further proceedings at the trial level and a new decision consistent with this opinion.we focus on the wcab opinion,not on the ultimate disposition of the treatment dispute between fund and sandhagen.
in its decision,the wcab held that failure to meet the ur deadlines specified in section,subdivision g prevents the employer from utilizing the ur process and renders untimely ur reports inadmissible.fund challenges this holding.nothing in the rescission and remand order allows the wcj to depart from this holding on remand.
a final order for the purposes of appellate review of a wcab decision is one that settles an issue critical to the claim,even if it does not resolve all issues.a final order for purposes of section includes any order which settles,for purposes of the compensation proceeding,an issue critical to the claim for benefits,whether or not it resolves all the issues in the proceeding or represents a decision on the right to benefits.maranian,supra,th at,d.
here,the wcab issued a decision on a substantial issue critical to sandhagen claim.the wcab determined that failure to comply with ur timelines prohibits an employer from utilizing the ur procedure or admitting ur reports into evidence.as the wcab explained,the decision was assigned to the wcab as a whole for an en banc decision b ecause of the important legal issues presented,and in order to secure uniformity of decision in the future the decision challenged by fund determined an issue critical to sandhagen claim for benefits and is therefore final and ripe for appeal.
fund,sandhagen,and the wcab agree that section establishes mandatory time frames for ur compliance.the parties disagree over the consequences of a failure to comply with the time frames.the wcab reasoned that because section g imposes a mandatory duty on a defendant to comply with its deadlines,it would be incongruous to permit a defendant that fails to comply with the deadlines to nevertheless obtain a ur report and to then enter it into evidence.
citing the penalty provisions of section,fund does not perceive an incongruity.fund points out that the legislature has recognized the need for speedy disposition of treatment requests,imposed tight time deadlines,and vested authority in the director to impose administrative penalties for delay and to fashion other,unspecified relief.because the statutory scheme vests remedial powers in the director and does not mention the wcab,or expressly provide that untimely ur reports shall be inadmissible,fund questions the wcab authority to fashion its own evidence preclusion remedy.the wcab position is further weakened,according to fund,by the fact that section is neither a discovery statute nor within the ambit of the wcab dispute resolution process.
the wcab responsive arguments are not entirely on point.there is little doubt,as the wcab argues,that the legislature in establishing the mandatory ur deadlines sought to ensure that an employer who seeks to undertake the ur process does so expeditiously,so that any ur decision regarding what medical treatment is reasonably required for the injured worker is not unduly delayed.there is also merit to the wcab assertion that the mandatory deadlines ensure both that if an employer under the ur process authorizes treatment the employee will promptly receive such treatment,and if,as a result of the ur process,the employer denies authorization for treatment,the injured employee can immediately begin the dispute resolution process and,if necessary,bring the issue before the wcab through an expedited hearing or a nonexpedited mandatory settlement conference.
we are less persuaded by the wcab assertion that if administrative penalties are all an employer must fear,then it could indefinitely delay obtaining a ur report,notwithstanding the section,subdivision g deadlines,and,as a result,the medical treatment dispute resolution process established by the legislature would be thrown into utter chaos.an expression of the need for a rule,no matter how compelling,can not fill a gap in legal authority.the wcab foreboding sheds no light on the source of its authority to exclude untimely ur reports.
nevertheless,we conclude that the wcab acted within its authority in prohibiting the use of a report generated by an untimely ur process in subsequent proceedings challenging the treatment decision.
fund assertion that the director is vested with exclusive authority to impose remedies for violation of ur time deadlines misperceives the respective roles of the director and the wcab in relationship to the ur process.the ur process has two aspects.it provides a process for insuring the prompt review and disposition of treatment requests.in this aspect,it is not a vehicle for dispute resolution indeed,one supposes that most requests for medical treatment are approved by employers without dispute or controversy.however,the ur process becomes part of the workers compensation dispute resolution scheme when the employee is dissatisfied with the outcome,at which point the provisions of section and the full panoply of procedures before the wcab come into play.
as a process for insuring the timely disposition of treatment requests,the ur process falls within the authority of the director.timeliness is a primary goal,and the power of the director to impose monetary penalties and fashion other remedies serves to facilitate that goal.the tardy approval of a treatment request is no less a vice than a late disapproval.in either instance,the director is empowered to act.in vesting authority in the director to impose penalties and in providing that t he administrative penalties shall not be deemed to be an exclusive remedy for the director,subd.i,the legislature was addressing the director role as overseer of the process established for the timely review and disposition of treatment requests.
however,the ur process becomes an integral part of the workers compensation dispute resolution scheme when an employee or employer invokes the procedures set forth in section.the procedural mechanism created by section implicates the authority of the wcab,and the wcab authority is expressly acknowledged.while the ur process is a records review process,section is an evidence collection and evaluation process with one set of procedures that pertains when the employee is represented by counsel and another when the employee is unrepresented.once the process is completed,either party may bring the decision before a wcj for review the decision of the wcj is then reviewable by the wcab.barring intervention by the court of appeal,the decision of the wcab is final.
section grants the wcab the power to do all things necessary or convenient in the exercise of any power or jurisdiction conferred upon it.the wcab authority to develop and enforce rules of evidence can not seriously be questioned.t he wcab is empowered to adopt reasonable rules of practice and procedure to regulate and prescribe the nature of proof and evidence in workers compensation cases.crawford workers comp.appeals bd.d.it may do so by formal rule making or may,as here,issue a precedent decision that interprets and applies the law in the course of a adjudication.rea workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
the wcab has previously considered the admissibility of ur reports in light of section,subdivision a,which states,in part the wcab may receive as evidence either at or subsequent to a hearing,and use as proof of any fact in dispute,the following matters,in addition to sworn testimony presented in open hearing a reports of attending or examining physicians.section,enacted prior to section,would have made all ur reports inadmissible,since they are not reports of the attending or examining physicians but simply reflect a ur physician opinion on the medical necessity of proposed treatment,formulated without examining the injured employee,subds.a f.in willette au electric willette,the wcab noted section exclusion of ur reports but attempted to harmonize the ur process with section.the wcab determined the statutorily created ur process yielded a ur report that was an essential part of the wcab record in any proceeding regarding a medical treatment dispute.therefore,the wcab
