no compensation shall be paid by an employer for a psychiatric injury if the injury was substantially caused by a lawful,nondiscriminatory,good faith personnel action.the burden of proof shall rest with the party asserting the issue,subd.h.
the city of oakland oakland challenges a workers compensation appeals board board decision awarding temporary and permanent psychiatric disability payments to david gullet gullet,a supervising employee demoted during a citywide reduction in force.the board concluded the demotion did not qualify as a good faith personnel action because management personnel misled gullet about the possibility he would avoid the demotion by accepting a different position.we conclude the board erred by applying an incorrect standard in evaluating the conduct and in concluding oakland did not meet its burden of demonstrating good faith.therefore,we vacate the board decision.
gullet was employed by oakland parks and recreation department for approximately years and rose through the ranks to parks supervisor ii,where he also held the positions of acting area administrator and zone administrator.he worked long hours in those positions and in began to experience fatigue,muscle tightness,insomnia,anxiety,hypertension,headaches,and preoccupation with work.however,he did not seek medical treatment or lose time from work because of these problems.
the record notes that t he appointment of robert bobb as city manager and the subsequent election of mayor jerry brown combined to create budgetary pressures on all city departments.bobb targeted middle management positions like gullet for elimination,and in late,anthony acosta,the director of the parks and recreation department,advised gullet that positions like his would probably be eliminated from the fiscal year budget.he advised gullet to think management assistant.
by arrangement with acosta,gullet worked as a management assistant for the first five and months of.acosta assured him there was budgetary authority for this arrangement.gullet repeatedly asked why the appointment to management assistant had not been formalized and was told the budget person was too busy to process the paperwork.on june,without warning,gullet was given a demotion letter signed by bobb informing him that,as a result of the reduction in force,he would be reverting to a parks supervisor i position.the letter directed him to contact lenora hameed for the details of his new assignment beginning july.gullet considered this the last straw.he filed a workers compensation claim and left work,after which he received psychological counseling.
gullet initial claim alleged body resulting from reduction in force notice demoting me from my position.medical reports stated that gullet injury was substantially caused by his demotion.the workers compensation judge wcj concluded that the the context of acosta representation that the applicant had been promoted to a safe a substantial cause of the applicant psychiatric injury.the wcj concluded,however,that oakland did not carry its burden of proving its personnel actions were in good faith.he awarded disability payments totaling some and such further medical treatment as may be required.the board denied oakland petition for reconsideration,and this petition followed.
the board typically does not answer a petition for writ of review.it has done so in this case because gullet answer was filed in propria persona and because oakland did not present a complete record or describe the facts of the case to the board satisfaction.based upon the board answer,we obtained and reviewed the board certified record.
a court review of the board decision may extend only to determining,upon the entire record,whether the board acted within its powers,whether its findings of fact support the award,and whether its order,decision,or award was either procured by fraud,unreasonable,or not supported by substantial evidence.however,the substantial evidence rule does not limit the appellate court when,as here,the evidence is uncontradicted and the board conclusion of law is placed in issue.dimmig workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d.
the issue presented here is whether the board has correctly interpreted and applied section.section was part of the workers compensation reform act of,passed in response to increased public concern about the high cost of workers compensation coverage,limited benefits for injured workers,suspected fraud and widespread abuses in the system,and particularly the proliferation of workers compensation cases with claims of psychiatric injuries.hansen workers compensation appeals bd.th,d.as a result,t he legislature expressed intent in enacting labor code section was to establish a new and higher threshold of compensability for psychiatric injury.id.at,d see also lockheed martin workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
citing two board decisions larch contra costa county stockman department of corrections and the california supreme court wrongful termination decision in cotran rollins hudig hall,cal th,d,cotran,oakland argues that its personnel decision was made in good faith as contemplated by section and,therefore,gullet is not entitled to recover compensation for his alleged psychiatric injury.in this case,the applicant reversion to park supervisor i was necessitated by the city honest and sincere purpose of streamlining its budget.it must also be noted that there is no evidence in the record indicating that anyone at the city intentionally deceived this applicant and there is also no evidence of collusion or unlawful design on the part of the city.any employer,whether public or private,will go through periods during which management will feel that budget cuts are appropriate in order to sustain the fiscal integrity of the organization e mployers should be able to implement such budget cuts without the fear of having to defend psychiatric injury claims filed by employees whose positions are eliminated.
section does not define lawful,nondiscriminatory,good faith personnel action as that phraseology is used in subdivision h,and no appellate decision cited by the parties or discovered by this court directly addresses its meaning.
in cotran,the employer fired a manager after conducting an investigation into allegations he sexually harassed two employees.when the manager sued for unlawful an implied promise not to terminate without good trial court instructed the jury that the employer was required to prove the sexual harassment took place.cotran,supra,cal th at,d.cotran concluded that the question was not whether sexual harassment in fact took place,but whether at the time the decision to terminate his employment was made,defendants,acting in good faith and following an investigation that was appropriate under the circumstances,had reasonable grounds for believing plaintiff had done so.id.at,d.
cotran explained that the jury role was to assess the objective reasonableness of the employer factual determination of misconduct.cotran,supra,cal th at,d.in complicated analysis we need not repeat here,the court described this as the objective good faith standard and explained that coupling good faith with objectivity is intended to place the trier of fact in the position of the reasonable employer in deciding whether the defendant in a wrongful termination suit acted responsibly and in conformity with prevailing social norms in deciding to terminate an employee for misconduct.the proper inquiry for the jury is was the factual basis on which the employer concluded a dischargeable act had been committed reached honestly,after an appropriate investigation and for reasons that are not arbitrary or pretextual id.at fn,d.
under cotran the objective good faith standard prevented an employer from discharging an employee based on subjective reasons that might be pretextual,and mask arbitrary and unlawful motives made practically unreviewable by the good faith rule.but it would otherwise protect the employee in this manner without infringing more than necessary on the freedom to make efficient business decisions.cotran,supra,cal th at,d.
while cotran involved a very different context for evaluating good faith than
