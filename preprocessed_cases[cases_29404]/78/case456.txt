these four consolidated cases raise the issue of how to properly apportion permanent disability in light of the amendments to the workers compensation law.stats,ch.we conclude that in repealing labor code section and in enacting new sections and to govern apportionment,the legislature did not intend to alter the apportionment method adopted by the california supreme court years ago in fuentes workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,fuentes.in so concluding,we agree with the decision of the workers compensation appeals board wcab in nabors piedmont lumber mill company,wl nabors and disagree with our colleagues in the fifth appellate district,who reached the opposite conclusion in e j gallo winery workers comp.appeals bd.th,d gallo,as well as our colleagues in division two of the first appellate district,who followed gallo in nabors workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.accordingly,we will affirm the decisions of the wcab in these cases.
factual and procedural background 
we begin by briefly summarizing the factual and procedural background of each case now before us.
kenneth dee welcher 
welcher sustained an industrial injury in july when his right arm and leg were caught in a conveyor belt.a stipulated award determined that this injury resulted in a permanent disability of percent,and welcher received in permanent disability benefits.
later work as a laborer for hat creek construction,through march resulted in cumulative injury to welcher right leg that led to amputation below the knee.the parties stipulated that welcher level of permanent disability is now percent.
the workers compensation judge wcj determined that a pportionment is decided by subtracting percentage from percentage and awarded welcher in permanent disability benefits from state compensation insurance fund scif hat creek workers compensation carrier.apparently,the wcj reached this figure by subtracting welcher previous level of permanent disability from his current level of permanent disability and rounding the result down down to.thus,by the wcj calculation,scif was liable for percent of welcher permanent disability,which corresponds to weeks of payments at per week x.see,subd.b,subd.b.
welcher filed a petition for reconsideration with the wcab,arguing that his benefits should be determined not by subtracting his previous level of permanent disability from his current level of permanent disability,but by subtracting the monetary value of his previous award from the monetary value of a current award of percent disability.relying on its own en banc decision in nabors,supra,at page the wcab disagreed and denied welcher petition.
jack strong 
in november,while employed by the city and county of san francisco the city,strong sustained an industrial injury to his left knee which resulted in permanent disability of percent.he received permanent disability benefits of.
in february,strong sustained another industrial injury while employed by the city,this time to his left shoulder,left knee and ankle,and right wrist,resulting in permanent disability of percent after apportionment for the prior injury and permanent disability benefits of.
in may,strong sustained a third industrial injury while working for the city,this time to his back.the parties stipulated that strong overall level of permanent disability is now percent.a disability evaluation specialist determined that percent of strong permanent disability was due to his prior injuries to his shoulder,knee,ankle,and wrist,while percent was due to his current injury to his back.based on this apportionment,the wcj determined the current injury caused permanent disability of percent,and thus the wcj awarded strong permanent disability benefits of weeks of payments at per week.
strong filed a petition for reconsideration with the wcab,arguing that there can not be apportionment to disability occurring to other regions of the body and that,even if there can be,apportionment should be determined by subtracting the monetary equivalent of the disability from the current monetary equivalent of the overall disability.
the wcab granted strong petition and in an en banc decision determined that section requires the apportionment of overlapping permanent disabilities,even when those disabilities involve different regions of the body.based on its decision in nabors,the wcab also concluded that the wcj had properly apportioned strong permanent disability between the prior and current injuries.accordingly,the wcab affirmed the wcj award.
aurora lopez 
lopez sustained an industrial injury to her back and lower extremities in september.the parties stipulated that she has an overall permanent disability of percent percent caused by her industrial injury and percent caused by other factors.applying the wcab decision in nabors,the wcj awarded lopez permanent disability benefits of for a percent permanent disability.
lopez filed a petition for reconsideration with the wcab,arguing that nabors was wrongly decided and that she should receive the benefit of a percent disability rating,which,in her case,is per week for life,minus the amount of benefits that would be payable for percent permanent disability payable in weeks at per week.the wcab denied her petition.
henry williams.
while employed by united airlines,williams sustained a cumulative industrial injury to his lumbar spine ending in august.the parties stipulated that williams overall level of permanent disability is percent.williams had previously received in permanent disability benefits for a percent permanent disability based on an earlier injury to his lumbar spine while working for the same employer.the wcj apportioned williams permanent disability pursuant to nabors,concluding that the current injury resulted in percent permanent disability,for an award of in permanent disability benefits.
williams filed a petition for reconsideration with the wcab,arguing that nabors was wrongly decided and that the proper way to apportion is to convert his present overall percentage of permanent disability into its current monetary equivalent and then subtract the dollar value of his prior permanent disability award.the wcab denied his petition.
discussion 
iapportioning permanent disability 
the primary question in these four cases is how permanent disability is to be apportioned in light of the legislature recent overhaul of the workers compensation laws.under nabors,the wcab apportions permanent disability by subtracting the percentage of permanent disability caused by factors other than the current industrial injury from the overall percentage of permanent disability,thus determining the percentage of permanent disability caused by the current injury.the wcab then determines the monetary value of permanent disability benefits payable for this percentage of permanent disability.the four claimants contend this is incorrect and that the wcab should instead subtract the monetary value of the percentage of permanent disability caused by other factors from the monetary value of the overall percentage of permanent disability.
for reasons we will explain,we conclude the wcab approach is the correct one.
we begin with a discussion of permanent disability,followed by tracing how permanent disability has been apportioned in california.we will then turn to the wcab position on apportionment under the current law,and a recent appellate court opinion on the subject,before turning to our own analysis of the law.
fuentes and former section 
permanent disability is the disability that remains after the healing period.an injured worker is entitled to payments for a permanent disability that affects the worker ability to compete in the open labor market.cal.workers compensation practice ed.
permanent disability is expressed in percentages.if the disability is less than percent,it is permanent partial disability.a worker who suffers permanent partial disability is entitled to a certain number of weeks of indemnity payments for each percent of the rating.cal.workers compensation practice,supra,at.
section provides generally that if an industrial injury causes permanent disability,then the percentage of disability to total disability shall be determined,and the disability payment computed as described in that statute,subds.a,b,c,d.section,as it read prior to april,provided that,for each percentage point of permanent disability which was of industrial origin,an injured worker was entitled to four weeks of compensation.fuentes,supra,cal d at.thus,a worker who was percent permanently disabled was entitled to weeks of payments,while a worker who was percent permanently disabled was entitled to weeks of payments see ibid.
however,in the legislature amended section,establishing a different method for computing the number of weekly benefits to be awarded.under the new statute,the number of weekly benefits increase d exponentially in proportion to the percentage of the disability.fuentes,supra,cal d at.as an illustration of this change,under the new statute a worker who was percent permanently disabled who was formerly entitled to weeks of payments was now entitled to weeks of payments,while a worker who was percent permanently disabled who was formerly entitled to weeks of payments was now entitled to weeks of payments.see ibid.
this change in the law gave rise to conflicts over the proper method for apportioning an employee permanent disability.apportionment is the process employed to segregate the residuals of an industrial injury from those attributable to other industrial injuries,or to nonindustrial factors,in order to fairly allocate the legal responsibility.ashley workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.generally,an employer is held responsible in the workers compensation system only for the disability of an injured employee arising from the particular employment with that employer,but not for disability fairly attributable to periods of employment elsewhere or to nonindustrial conditions.ibid.
the conflicts over the proper method for apportioning permanent disability in light of the amendment to section reached the supreme court five years later in fuentes.in that case,the worker suffered from cumulative injury to his lungs resulting in an permanent disability rating of percent.of this disability was found by the referee to be industrially related,percent was the result of cigarette smoking,and the final percent due to nonindustrial causes.of the percent attributable to cigarette smoking,percent of disability was found to have been incurred in the course of smoking and wa s accordingly compensable.thus,of the total percent disability,approximately percent percent x percent was industrially related.the remaining percent was attributable to other factors,and being nonindustrial in origin wa s not compensable.fuentes,supra,cal d at.
the parties in fuentes suggested that in computing the number of weekly benefits to which the worker wa s entitled under the new section there we re three possible methods which m ight be utilized,described for the sake of convenience,as formulas a,b,and under former section the compensation was the same regardless of which formula was applied.however,as a result of the amendments substantial differences ensue d in the amount awarded a claimant depending on which formula wa s utilized.
under formula a,there wa s subtracted from the total disability that portion which wa s nonindustrial,the remainder being the amount of compensable disability.thus in the matter before the supreme court percent,representing nonindustrial origin,wa s deducted from the percent total disability with a net compensable disability of percent.under the schedule established by section,subdivision a,this entitled the worker to weekly benefits which could be converted in terms of dollars to an award of.
formula b contemplate d,first,determination of the number of statutory weekly benefits authorized under section for a percent disability,namely.this figure wa s then multiplied by the percentage of industrially related disability.the product wa s weeks,which result ed in a total monetary award of.
under formula c,the percent permanent disability wa s converted into its monetary equivalent of.from this figure wa s subtracted the dollar value of the percent of the noncompensable,nonindustrial disability.the result wa s an award of,or the equivalent of weekly benefits.fuentes,supra,cal d at.
based on the express and unequivocal language of former section,the supreme court concluded that formula a was the proper one.fuentes,supra,cal d at.at that time,former section provided as follows an employee who is suffering from a previous permanent disability or physical impairment and sustains permanent injury thereafter shall not receive from the employer compensation for the later injury in excess of the compensation allowed for such injury when considered by itself and not in conjunction with or in relation to the previous disability or impairment.the employer shall not be liable for compensation to such an employee for the combined disability,but only for that portion due to the later injury as though no prior disability or impairment had existed.fuentes,supra,cal d at.
according to the supreme court,in enacting section,the legislature expressed a clear intent that the liability of one who employs a previously disabled worker shall,in the event of a subsequent injury,be limited to that percentage of the disability resulting from the later harm considered alone and as if it were the original injury.the principle has been expressed that i ndustry is to be charged only for those injuries arising out of and in the course of employment and only for the result of that particular injury when considered by itself and not in conjunction with or in relation to a previous injury.fuentes,supra,cal d at,quoting gardner industrial acc.com.d.
the court explained that only formula a results in an award complying with the provisions of section.the worker has suffered a compensable disability of percent.under formula b,however,he would receive an award which,under the rates provided for in section,subdivision a,is equivalent to the amount given for a disability carrying a rating of approximately percent.application of formula c results in a recovery which is the same as that authorized by section,subdivision a,for a rating of percent.this arithmetic leads to the inevitable conclusion that neither method b nor c can be reconciled with the mandate of section that the compensation for a subsequent injury be computed as though no prior disability or impairment had existed.on the contrary,b and c result in an enhancement of the benefits due to the existence of a preexisting physical impairment.fuentes,supra,cal d at.
the court disagreed with an argument that there was an irreconcilable conflict between the legislative intent to increase workers compensation benefits as manifested by section,on the one hand,and the limiting effect of section on the other and stated the following section may be considered as a general provision establishing the amount of compensation benefits for a permanent disability,and section may be viewed as a specific rule limiting the benefits available in those cases where the employee has a preexisting permanent disability and thereafter sustains a further permanent injury.when so construed the statutes in question are complementary,not contradictory,and function together quite harmoniously,thus,serving the twin goals of providing proportionately greater benefits for more serious injuries while at the same time protecting employers from bearing a disproportionate share of a financial burden resulting from cumulative injuries.fuentes,supra,cal d at.
the court recognized that under formula a a worker who suffers a single injury resulting in,for example,a disability rating of percent,will receive greater benefits than one who sustains two successive injuries each of which causes a permanent disability of percent when considered alone.this result,however,is neither unjust nor unfair rather,it is a consequence of the recent amendments to section and is consistent with the policy of encouraging employers to hire the disabled.there being no evidence to the contrary,this court must assume that such a result was contemplated by the legislature.fuentes,supra,cal d at.
senate bill and sections and

under senate bill,two new statutes govern apportionment sections and.section provides as follows 
a apportionment of permanent disability shall be based on causation.
b any physician who prepares a report addressing the issue of permanent disability due to a claimed industrial injury shall in that report address the issue of causation of the permanent disability.
c in order for a physician report to be considered complete on the issue of permanent disability,it must include an apportionment determination.a physician shall make an apportionment determination by finding what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by the direct result of injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment and what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by other factors both before and subsequent to the industrial injury,including prior industrial injuries.if the physician is unable to include an apportionment determination in his or her report,the physician shall state the specific reasons why the physician could not make a determination of the effect of that prior condition on the permanent disability arising from the injury.the physician shall then consult with other physicians or refer the employee to another physician from whom the employee is authorized to seek treatment or evaluation in accordance with this division in order to make the final determination.
d an employee who claims an industrial injury shall,upon request,disclose all previous permanent disabilities or physical impairments.
second,section provides as follows 
a the employer shall only be liable for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment.
b if the applicant has received a prior award of permanent disability,it shall be conclusively presumed that the prior permanent disability exists at the time of any subsequent industrial injury.this presumption is a presumption affecting the burden of proof.
c the accumulation of all permanent disability awards issued with respect to any one region of the body in favor of one individual employee shall not exceed percent over the employee lifetime unless the employee injury or illness is conclusively presumed to be total in character pursuant to section.as used in this section,the regions of the body are the following 
c mental and behavioral disorders.
d the spine.
e the upper extremities,including the shoulders.
f the lower extremities,including the hip joints.
g the head,face,cardiovascular system,respiratory system,and all other systems or regions of the body not listed in subparagraphs a to f,inclusive.
nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the permanent disability rating for each individual injury sustained by an employee arising from the same industrial accident,when added together,from exceeding percent.

in nabors,supra,at page,the wcab considered,en banc,the proper method for apportioning permanent disability in light of senate bill.in nabors,a majority of the wcab commissioners,cuneo,murray,and brass decided that when the wcab awards permanent disability after apportionment,the amount of indemnity due the applicant is calculated by determining the overall percentage of permanent disability and then subtracting the percentage of permanent disability caused by other factors under section c or previously awarded under section b the remainder is the applicant final percentage of permanent disability for which indemnity is calculated pursuant to section and.nabors,supra,at.the majority based its decision on t he plain terms of sections c and a,which mandate that the percentage of or previously awarded permanent disability be subtracted from the overall percentage of permanent disability in the same manner as formula a adopted by the supreme court in fuentes.nabors,supra,at.
one dissenting member of the wcab believed that the express language of section as amended by sb requires the application of formula b discussed in fuentes.nabors,supra,at dis.opn.of chairman rabine.the other dissenting member believed that the express language of sections and as amended by sb requires the application of formula c discussed in fuentes.nabors,supra,at dis.opn.of commissioner caplane.

apportionment under sections and 
in each of the four cases before us,the primary question is whether the wcab properly apportioned permanent disability by subtracting the percentage of permanent disability caused by factors other than the current industrial injury from the overall percentage of permanent disability to determine the percentage of permanent disability for which the employer or its insurer is liable,before determining the compensation payable for that percentage of disability under section.to answer this question,we must construe the new apportionment statutes,sections and.
the fundamental rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute.citation.we construe the workers compensation scheme as a whole and consider the words used in their usual,commonsense meaning.citation.we liberally construe all aspects of workers compensation law in favor of the injured worker.henry workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.the liberality rule,however,which is found in section can not supplant the intent of the legislature as expressed in a particular statute.fuentes,supra,cal d at.if the legislature intent appears from the language and context of the relevant statutory provisions,then we must effectuate that intent,even though the particular statutory language is contrary to the basic policy of the workers compensation law,quoting earl ranch,industrial acc.com.cal d.
in interpreting sections and,we are further guided by the policy that it should not be presumed that the legislature in the enactment of statutes intends to overthrow principles of law unless such intention is made clearly to appear either by express declaration or by necessary implication.fuentes,supra,cal d at,quoting theodor superior court cal d.
here,it was established law under fuentes for almost years that permanent disability is apportioned by subtracting the percentage of the disability attributable to factors other than the current industrial injury from the overall percentage of disability to determine the percentage of the disability that is compensable,then determining the amount of permanent disability benefits payable under section by reference to the compensable percentage of disability.thus,we begin with the question of whether,by repealing the former law including former section and enacting new sections and,the legislature clearly expressed or necessarily implied an intent to abandon this approach and adopt instead the approach advocated by the claimants here and the appellate court in gallo namely,converting the percentages of disability into their monetary equivalents under section before performing the necessary subtraction.
in our view,no such intent appears in the new apportionment provisions.section expresses the principle that apportionment of permanent disability is to be based on causation of the permanent disability,subds.a,b.moreover,a physician addressing the issue of permanent disability must make an apportionment determination by finding what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by the direct result of injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment and what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by other factors both before and subsequent to the industrial injury,including prior industrial injuries,subd.c.
thus,section speaks of apportioning permanent disability based on causation by determining the percentage of the permanent disability directly caused by the current industrial injury as distinguished from the percentage of the permanent disability caused by other factors.subdivision a of section then expressly provides that the employer is liable only for the former is,the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment,subd.a.
in our view,these provisions neither clearly express nor necessarily imply an intent to abandon formula a from fuentes for apportioning permanent disability.on the contrary,we conclude these provisions compel the continued application of that formula.by its plain terms,section limits an employer liability for a claimant overall permanent disability to the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the present industrial injury.thus,the employer is not liable for the percentage of permanent disability caused by any other both nonindustrial factors and previous industrial injuries.in this context,the phrase percentage of permanent disability is easily referable to the phraseology used in section to express the extent of permanent disability caused by an injury,which in turn is used to determine the amount of permanent disability benefits payable to a claimant for that injury.that statute provides that where an industrial injury causes permanent disability,the percentage of disability to total disability shall be determined,and the disability payment computed by awarding the claimant a certain amount of money for a certain number of weeks for each percent of disability,subds.a,b,c,d.
we are given no reason to believe that the legislature intended the term percentage of permanent disability,as used in sections and,to have a different meaning than the term percentage of disability,as used in section.in his dissenting opinion in nabors,chairman rabine concluded that a different meaning was intended,which compelled him to conclude that formula b from fuentes is now the proper way to apportion permanent disability.nabors,supra,at.none of the claimants in these four cases,however,proposes we adopt chairman rabine approach.moreover,we are unpersuaded by his reasoning.he asserts in his opinion that percentage,as used in sections and,is the ratio of the disability caused by the industrial injury to the claimant overall disability.nabors,supra,at.thus,where the claimant had an overall permanent disability of percent,with a prior permanent disability award of percent,chairman rabine concluded that the percent of his disability that was directly caused by his present injury is ibid.that is to say,than the percent that is obtained by subtracting from under formula a from fuentes.
in our view,there is no sound explanation for why the legislature would have intended percentage,as used in sections and,to mean the ratio of a claimant partial disability to his overall disability,when that same word is used in section to mean the ratio of a claimant disability to total disability.
the words of a statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible,fair employment housing com.cal d.here,we conclude that sections and can best be harmonized with section by construing the word percentage as having the same meaning in both contexts.thus,percentage of permanent disability,as that term is used in sections and,means the percentage of permanent disability to total disability.indeed,the primary definition of percentage is a part of a whole expressed in hundredths.collegiate dict.ed,italics added.in this context,the whole is total,percent permanent disability,and a percentage of permanent disability is any part of that whole expressed in hundredths.
what this means is that under section,permanent disability must be apportioned based on causation by determining the percentage of the permanent disability to total disability that was directly caused by the current industrial injury as distinguished from the percentage of the permanent disability to total disability that was caused by other factors.then,under subdivision a of section,the employer is liable only for the percentage of the permanent disability to total disability that was directly caused by the current industrial injury.having thus complied with the requirement of section to determine the percentage of permanent disability to total disability that is compensable for the current industrial injury,the amount of permanent disability benefits payable to the claimant for that injury is computed by awarding the claimant the requisite number of weeks of payments for each percent of permanent disability directly caused by that injury.thus,the approach to apportionment adopted by the majority in nabors is correct.
having reached this conclusion,we turn back to the fifth appellate district opinion in gallo,upon which the claimants in this case primarily rely to support their claim that formula c is now the proper method for apportioning permanent disability.as we will explain,we can not agree with the gallo court analysis or its conclusion that the legislature intended formula c to supplant formula 
i t should not be presumed that the legislature in the enactment of statutes intends to overthrow principles of law unless such intention is made clearly to appear either by express declaration or by necessary implication.fuentes,supra,cal d at.however,the gallo court did not discuss whether the legislature expressly declared or necessarily implied in senate bill that it intended to overthrow the use of formula a from fuentes to apportion permanent disability.the gallo court also did not attempt to construe the term percentage of permanent disability in sections and consistently with the term percentage of disability in section.
the gallo court concluded the legislature contemplated a variation in determining apportionment by repealing section and replacing it with different language in section.gallo,supra,th at,d.of particular importance to the gallo court was its conclusion that t he supreme court holding in fuentes expressly rested on language in section that the level of permanent disability caused by a subsequent injury was to be determined without reference to or consideration of the employee prior condition.gallo,supra,th at,d.according to the gallo court,senate bill reversed that policy.now,a prior award is conclusively presumed to exist as a means of establishing the level of permanent disability directly caused by the subsequent injury,subd.b.evaluating physicians must also make similar apportionment percentage determinations,subd.c.the wcab may no longer apportion liability without considering a prior or other noncompensable disability.gallo,at,d.
we can not agree with the gallo court conclusion that in apportioning permanent disability under former section,the level of permanent disability caused by a subsequent injury was to be determined without reference to or consideration of the employee prior condition,while under new sections and,the employee prior condition must for the first time be taken into account in performing that task.gallo,supra,th at,d,italics added.the limiting language in former section to which the gallo court was referring was not directed at the determination of the level of permanent disability caused by the current industrial injury,but rather at the payment of compensation based on that injury.thus,former section provided that an employee who sustained a subsequent industrial injury was not entitled to compensation for the later injury in excess of the compensation allowed for such injury when considered by itself and not in conjunction with or in relation to the previous disability or impairment,and the employer was liable only for that portion of the compensation due to the later injury as though no prior disability or impairment had existed.italics added.the purpose of this language in former section was to ensure that the employer was not required to compensate the employee for an aggregate disability which included a previous injury fuentes,supra,cal d at,but instead was required to compensate the employee only for the permanent disability stemming from the current industrial injury.
of course,to accomplish this result,it was always necessary to compare the claimant present overall level of permanent disability to his or her previous level of disability in order to identify the portion of the overall permanent disability that stemmed from the current industrial injury.this is what formula a from fuentes did.under that formula for the claimant in that case,percent,representing the portion of the claimant permanent disability of nonindustrial origin,wa s deducted from the percent total or overall disability with a net compensable disability of percent.fuentes,supra,cal d at.thus,contrary to the gallo court conclusion,even under former section as the supreme court applied that statute in fuentes,the level of permanent disability caused by a subsequent injury could not be determined except by reference to the employee prior condition.gallo,supra,th at,d.
accordingly,the enactment of sections and did not represent a reversal of policy on this point.now,as then,the level of permanent disability caused by the current industrial injury can be determined only by reference to the level of disability attributable to other the claimant prior condition.once the level of permanent disability caused by the current industrial injury has been isolated from the level of disability attributable to other factors,then compensation can be awarded for the portion of the disability attributable to the current injury.it is in the awarding of compensation,once the level of disability attributable to the current injury has been isolated,that the claimant prior condition is necessarily ignored.
because senate bill did not evidence any change of policy on this point,we can not agree with the gallo court conclusion the legislature contemplated a variation in determining apportionment by repealing section and replacing it with different language in section.gallo,supra,th at,d.
we acknowledge that i t is ordinarily to be presumed that the legislature by deleting an express provision of a statute intended a substantial change in the law.people valentine cal d,see gallo,supra,th at,d,quoting lockheed martin workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.that presumption,however,is rebutted here with respect to the legislature repeal of former section by replacement of that section with a new section covering the same subject.where former section limited an employer liability for compensation to that portion of the claimant combined disability due to the later injury as though no prior disability or impairment had existed,subdivision a of section now limits the employer liability for compensation to the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the current industrial injury.we perceive no intended change in meaning between these two provisions thus,the presumption on which the gallo court relied is not controlling here.the remaining portions of former section,which the legislature did not reenact in the new law,were likely omitted because they were simply superfluous.
unable to discern in senate bill any particular method for apportioning a permanent disability award,the gallo court relied on the liberality rule of section,keep ing firmly in mind the exponentially progressive nature of the workers compensation disability tables,the increasing maximum weekly benefit rates,and the lifetime pension for disabilities over of which serve to compensate employees with higher levels of permanent disability in greater proportion to those with lower levels of permanent disability.gallo,supra,th at,d.based on these factors,the gallo court concluded that only formula c ensures both that an employee is adequately compensated and that an employer is directly liable for the percentage of disability directly caused by the injury arising out of employment.id.at,d.according to the court,by not recognizing the injured employee total disability and artificially shifting compensation down on the permanent disability tables,all of the other formulas shortchange an employee by treating him or her as though no prior injury or disability existed,which is now no longer permitted.ibid.
we can not agree with this reasoning.first,the language of sections and shows the legislative intent to continue applying formula a from fuentes to apportion permanent disability.only the continued application of formula a ensures that an employer is liable only for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the current industrial injury,as section requires,and harmonizes the use of the word percentage in sections and with the use of that word in section.
second,as to the liberality rule of section,we are guided by the admonition in fuentes that that rule can not supplant the intent of the legislature as expressed in a particular statute.fuentes,supra,cal d at.here,we have discerned the legislative intent to continue applying formula a and therefore the rule of liberal construction is of no moment.
third,to the extent the gallo court analysis was driven by what it perceived to be the unfairness of applying formula under that formula a claimant who sustains a given level of permanent disability as a result of a single industrial injury will receive more compensation than a claimant who sustains the same level of disability as a result of multiple industrial supreme court rejected the same claim of unfairness in fuentes.fuentes,supra,cal d at.moreover,for nearly years following fuentes,the legislature left section in place,thus allowing formula a to govern apportionment of permanent disability for a substantial period of time.the legislature then enacted sections and,which,in our view,compel the continued application of that formula.it is not for us to question the wisdom or fairness of that decision.see schnyder state bd.of equalization th,d.
in any event,as sect
