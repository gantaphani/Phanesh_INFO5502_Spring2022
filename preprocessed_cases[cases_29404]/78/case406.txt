introduction 
in,as part of a comprehensive reform of workers compensation law adopted as urgency legislation,the legislature enacted senate bill sb,which contained a provision that,on its face,required every permanent disability award to be apportioned to the extent that the disability did not arise out of and in the course of employment,added by stats,ch,eff.april.but the legislature did not repeal or amend previously enacted provisions which had established a different rule for public safety officers any specified injury or illness which developed or manifested itself during the officer service was rebuttably disputably presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of employment absent controverting evidence,the workers compensation appeals board wcab had to find in accordance with this presumption and the injury or illness could not be attributed to any preexisting disease.
an uncodified section of the legislation provided the amendment,addition,or repeal of any provision of law made by this act shall apply prospectively from the date of enactment of this act,regardless of the date of injury,unless otherwise specified,but shall not constitute good cause to reopen or rescind,alter,or amend any existing order,decision,or award of the workers compensation appeals board.sb reg.sess.
in,the legislature passed and the governor signed assembly bill ab,which amended section by adding subdivision e section e,which provides subdivisions a,b,and c shall not apply to injuries or illnesses covered under sections,and.e,added by stats,ch.an uncodified section of the enacting legislation provides it is the intent of the legislature that this act be construed as declaratory of existing law.ab reg.sess.
after considering this history,the wcab here concluded that section e was in effect as of the effective date of section.petitioner,department of corrections and rehabilitation the department,contends that the wcab erred and section e applies only prospectively from the date of its enactment.we disagree with petitioner and agree with the wcab.since the legislature did not repeal or alter section et when it enacted section,the latter subsequent amendment merely made express what the legislature prior actions implied that section et remained good law notwithstanding enactment of section.
factual and procedural background 
real party in interest james alexander was employed by the department through july,as a correctional officer at solano state prison.in september,he filed an application for adjudication of his workers compensation claim,alleging injury to his heart,cardiovascular system,and left shoulder.
on april,the parties stipulated before workers compensation administrative law judge robinson,as relevant alexander sustained injury to the heart and left shoulder arising out of and in the course of employment.he had received permanent disability compensation since on or around february.without apportionment,his permanent disability was percent apportionment,if legally appropriate,would be at the level of percent.the issue to be litigated was whether section e was in effect before january,barring apportionment of that part of alexander permanent disability which had accrued as of then.
on august,judge robinson issued a decision in alexander favor,finding section e is declaratory of existing law.it applies retroactively to dates of injury preceding its enactment date january.the legislature intended it to apply retroactively.
on september,acting by and through its adjusting agent,state compensation insurance contract services,petitioner filed a petition for reconsideration.
on september,judge robinson recommended in writing that the wcab deny the petition.
on october,wcab presiding judge cuneo issued an order and decision denying reconsideration and incorporating judge robinson report and recommendation.
the department filed a petition for writ of mandate prohibition in this court.we treated the petition as a petition for writ of review and issued the writ.real party in interest alexander filed a reply brief we also granted leave to los angeles professional peace officers association,los angeles police protective league for los angeles police department,los angeles county firefighters association,united firefighters of los angeles city for los angeles fire department,and california state firefighters association to file an amicus brief.we now uphold the wcab order and decision and deny the relief requested by the department.
discussion 
isection e,when enacted,declared existing law 
as we have explained,when enacting section the legislature left in place the existing provisions that barred attributing certain public safety officers disabilities to a preexisting condition,though section facially requires such attribution.when the legislature later enacted section e,which codified the exemption of injuries or illnesses covered under sections through from apportionment under section,it called the new provision declaratory of existing law.for the reasons that follow,we agree.
we decide questions of statutory construction independently.but in doing so,we consider and respect the interpretation of a statute by an administrative agency charged with its enforcement.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.
we read related provisions together as part of an overall statutory scheme,so as to harmonize them and give them all effect if possible.people king cal th,d,fair employment housing com.cal d.as a corollary,we presume that when the legislature enacts a statute it does not intend to repeal or abrogate any other statute by implication.people bouzas cal d,bouzas.though we begin with the language of the statutory scheme,if that presents an irreducible ambiguity we consult the statute legislative history,supra,cal d at.
a statute that merely clarifies,rather than changes,existing law does not operate retrospectively even if applied to transactions predating its enactment because the true meaning of the statute remains the same.citation.but if the amendment changed the law,the question of retroactivity arises.mcclung employment development cal th,d,mcclung.
th e purpose of amending a statute is not necessarily to change the law.while an intention to change the law is usually inferred from a material change in the language of the statute citations,a consideration of the surrounding circumstances may indicate,on the other hand,that the amendment was merely the result of a legislative attempt to clarify the true meaning of the statute.citation.williams garcetti cal th,d.
the legislature statement that an enactment is intended to declare existing law does not bind us,because it is for the courts to determine what the law did mean.citation.mcclung,supra,cal th at,d.nevertheless,the legislature expressed views on the prior import of its statutes are entitled to due consideration,and we can not disregard them.western security bank superior court cal th,d.
here,we have a facial contradiction between section,as originally enacted,and sections through,which neither the legislature nor the courts addressed before the passage of section e.thus,to understand why the legislature stated in enacting the latter provision that it declared existing law,we examine its history.in doing so,we consider only documents which serve as valid indicia of legislative intent,supra,cal d at,kaufman broad communities,performance plastering,th,d.
the proponents of ab,which enacted section e,maintained that when the legislature enacted section through sb,it did not intend to abrogate the public safety officer presumptions.as first drafted,sb did not affect or amend these presumptions in any way,and its author had had an understanding with the interested parties that the bill would preserve the presumptions.on its way to passage,however,amendments to other code sections inadvertently affected sections through therefore it was now necessary to clarify the law by amendment.rules,off.of floor analyses ab,reading,august,com.on labor and industrial relations,hearing on ab,june,assemblymembers karnette and umberg letter to schwarzenegger.
