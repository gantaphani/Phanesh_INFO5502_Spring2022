we must decide whether a county employee was dismissed for disability within the meaning of government code section.if he was so dismissed,because the county board of retirement ruled he was not entitled to a disability retirement the county would be required to reinstate him to his old job,together with back wages and benefits.because we conclude the trial court ruled correctly that the employee was not dismissed from his job,we reverse the decision of the court of appeal.
john stephens began working for the tulare county as a detention specialist iii in december.he was assigned to the bob wiley detention facility,where his job entailed working on the floors with jail inmates,transporting inmates,and writing reports.his job also required him to carry a firearm.in the course of his duties,in he suffered an injury to his right thumb.in he injured his thumb again and spent some time away from work.when he returned to work,his employer modified his job to light duty pursuant to the recommendation of his physician,john edwards.in this new position,stephens was assigned to a housing unit control room,requiring him to open and close the security doors in the jail for the other detention officers by pushing buttons using both hands.it was anticipated that when the jail became fully staffed,stephens would rotate into the central control room,where his work would also involve pushing a button to open a security door.captain janet perryman testified that the duties in the control room of a housing unit and in the central control room were not significantly different.
when stephens complained his modified light duty was inconsistent with the limitations recommended by edwards,he was examined by a hand specialist.the specialist june,report acknowledged edwards recommendation that the client perform no longer than minutes of upper extremity activity at one period of time and then have a break,but concluded currently the control room officer job is adhering to this prescription.the client is able to do minutes of hand tasks and then patrol the control room for one to five minutes without using his hands.the client does use his hands frequently but not at a constant rate and is able to take a break after minutes of hand activity.italics added.following this report,stephens apparently continued in his modified position and was in fact rotated into the central control room.
stephens testified that in september,while performing this modified light duty,sergeant montoya,one of his supervising sergeants,approached him and asked how he was doing.stephens told him his thumb was bothering him,but he denied he asked sergeant montoya to be relieved.
sergeant sheri lehner,another of stephens supervising sergeants,also testified to events occurring in september.she reported that stephens had approached her and complained that there was a misunderstanding as to what his light duty was supposed to be,and that he was suffering from pain in his thumb,due to his job assignment.sergeant lehner confirmed that,following a shift,stephens thumb was in fact red and swollen.he told her he was not supposed to use his thumb for more than minutes at a time.because persons performing stephens job worked shifts,sergeant lehner thought it would be infeasible for stephens to take a break every minutes.
sergeant lehner also testified that stephens told her not to be surprised when things start happening when he was rotated from the housing unit control room into the central control room,that he would call his lawyer,and he would own the county because in his last lawsuit,which was successful,the trial court had informed everyone that reassigning him would be considered a discriminatory act stephens boasted of his attorney legal prowess and said that this time we sue for money.sergeant lehner reported this conversation to her superiors.
in light of stephens complaints,captain perryman sent him a letter that forms the basis of his claim he was dismissed from his job.the letter,dated september,stated in pertinent part 
you have been working in a modified work assignment light duty at the bob wiley detention facility due to an injury to your right hand.your doctor,john edwards,has described your restrictions as no inmate contact,some right hand more than hours per day,writing limitations of minute intervals,no power gripping or pulling of the right hand.the department has made efforts to accommodate your return to work and reviewed job assignments and duties performed in the division.the tasks required in operating a control room at the facility appeared to accommodate the doctor listed restrictions for use of your right hand.you have in fact worked in a housing control room for sometime sic.
on you notified sergeant lehner that you believed there was a misunderstanding about your light duty and the restrictions.it was your opinion that working in central control would result in compromising those restrictions.
you were assigned to central control and given the task of training detention service officer rosario.you worked central control and when going off duty on you spoke to sergeants lehner and montoya.you were asked how your hand was and responded that it was swollen.
because of your statements we believe that we will not be able to provide a modified work assignment at this time.this letter is to confirm to you that you are not to return to work until further notice.at such time as your condition improves and you are able to return to work with no restrictions,or improves to the point that you are able to perform the light duty tasks required in central control without further complaint or injury,you will be expected to submit time sheets reflecting off.i understand you have an open job injury claim for this problem,that has yet to be resolved.until notified by worker compensation we will expect your time sheets to reflect use of your personal sick leave.
captain perryman testified the letter was generated to make sure that stephens understood that our concern for him was that we not further injure his thumb.and that he needed to do what had to be done in terms of return ing to work,with no restrictions,as a detention specialist iii,which is commonly referred to as a.or to be well to the point where he could serve in the capacity of a detention service officer,which is the position that we had temporarily provided him with.captain perryman further testified she did not intend the letter to be a dismissal from employment it was her understanding the letter left open the possibility of stephens return to work in either a capacity or performing the full range of duties as a detention specialist iii.she testified the sheriff department had taken no affirmative steps to terminate stephens and,when asked whether tulare county had actually terminated him from the county payroll,paid him off for any accrued leave,she answered no,not at all.
after receiving captain perryman letter,stephens did not return to work.asked at trial whether he was terminated from his employment shortly after,that is,after he received captain perryman letter,he replied not to my knowledge.asked whether he had ever received a termination notice,he replied no.no termination.
for the rest of,and until december,stephens received full pay from tulare county in the form of his sick and personal leave and then benefits pursuant to labor code section following cessation of his section benefits in late,he participated in vocational rehabilitation and was trained to become a computer technician.after completion of that training,stephens twice sought positions with the county but was unsuccessful in obtaining a job.he worked various jobs with other,private employers in during this time he also received a compromise and release for,settling one of his workers compensation cases see fn,ante.
stephens applied for a disability retirement with the tulare county employees retirement association tcera on november.while his application was pending,tulare county informed him of an opening for a job he could perform consistent with his medical limitations,but withdrew the offer of employment when the county decided not to fund the position.tcera board of retirement subsequently denied his application for a disability retirement,and the superior court denied his petition for a writ of mandamus.he then sent a letter to the tulare county demanding reinstatement pursuant to government code section.he also filed a government tort claim,seeking payment of retroactive wages pursuant to the same statute,which the county denied.
stephens employer then sent him a letter dated december,explaining that as it is the decision of the board of retirement that you are not substantially incapacitated,and thus able to work,the county is ready to reinstate you to employment.the letter asked him to contact a designated person to initiate an interactive review of restrictions per ada feha,to discuss arrangements for your return to work and to discuss your new assignment.the letter also gave stephens the option of not returning to work and stated that if he did not contact the designated person by december,the would assume he was not returning.stephens attorney contacted the designated person to begin the process of reinstatement.
when stephens had not been reinstated by may,he filed a petition for writ of mandate in superior court,seeking reinstatement and repayment of back wages and benefits pursuant to government code section.on june,he received a response letter from the,informing him he had been reinstated to the sheriff department.stephens returned to work for the sheriff department on july,and performed the same modified light duty the had made available in.asked whether prior to returning in july of did your condition change such that you could work the functions that you had been working in,he replied there was no change.it has been the same.
the trial court issued an alternative writ but ultimately denied relief.the court concluded captain perryman september,letter contemplates that stephens is still an active county employee utilizing leave time.at no time was stephens advised in this letter that he was dismissed from employment.although the letter does state do not return to work until further notice,it goes on to tell stephens that he will be placed on sick leave until he can report back to work under certain conditions.these were conditions that only stephens could determine stephens always had a doctor release and could have gone back to work if he had informed the county that he was willing and able.at no time did stephens advise the county that he considered this a dismissal.the trial court found that because stephens did not seek a new medical evaluation of his thumb after receiving captain perryman letter or seek reinstatement with the county during this time period,the only reasonable determination the court can make is that stephens could have been performing these duties all along but never complied with the letter of september,by informing the county that he could perform.
the court of appeal reversed,and we granted review.
discussion 
resolution of the present dispute requires us to interpret the meaning of government code section section.that statute provides in full permanent incapacity for the performance of duty shall in all cases be determined by the board.if the medical examination and other available information do not show to the satisfaction of the board that the member is incapacitated physically or mentally for the performance of his duties in the service and the member application for a disability retirement is denied on this ground the board shall give notice of such denial to the employer.the employer may obtain judicial review of such action of the board by filing a petition for a writ of mandate in accordance with the code of civil procedure or by joining or intervening in such action filed by the member within days of the mailing of such notice.if such petition is not filed or the court enters judgment denying the writ,whether on the petition of the employer or the member,and the employer has dismissed the member for disability,the employer shall reinstate the member to his employment effective as of the day following the effective date of the dismissal.italics added.
in other words,if the county board of retirement rules an is not permanently disabled so as to be entitled to a disability retirement,the board denies the employee disability retirement application on that ground,and no appeal is filed or all appeals are final,then the is entitled to reinstatement to his or her prior position if the employing county has previously dismissed the employee for disability.section,where applicable,has been interpreted to require not only reinstatement but also payment of wages and benefits that would have accrued during the period of dismissal.leili county of los angeles d.leili see generally tapia county of san bernardino th,d tapia applicant must comply with statutory claim presentation requirements.
that stephens applied for a disability retirement,the county board of retirement denied his application on the ground he was not disabled,and all appeals are final is not disputed by the parties,thus satisfying the first three prerequisites to reinstatement under section.the only question remaining is whether the county dismissed stephens for disability within the meaning of section.
when interpreting statutes,we follow the legislature intent,as exhibited by the plain meaning of the actual words of the law this court has no power to rewrite the statute so as to make it conform to a presumed intention which is not expressed.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of that intent,we look first at the words themselves,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning and construing them in context.citation.if the plain language of the statute is clear and unambiguous,our inquiry ends,and we need not embark on judicial construction.citations.if the statutory language contains no ambiguity,the legislature is presumed to have meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.people johnson cal th,d.
applying these principles here requires us to discern the plain meaning of the word dismissed as used in section.to dismiss means to send or remove from employment.webster new internat.dict.as used in connection with section,dismissed,terminated,and released all share a common meaning.those terms describe a circumstance in which the employment relationship,at the employer election,has ended.because the relationship has ended,the employer no longer has an obligation to pay salary or other forms of compensation,and the employee has no basis for expectation that a position exists,will be kept open,or will be made available upon the employee offer to return to work.because section is concerned only with the consequences of p ermanent incapacity for the performance of duty,we can reasonably assume the statute addresses permanent,not merely temporary,absence from employment.an employee who is temporarily absent from the workplace due to illness or vacation,where both employer and employee understand the employee will return to work when the reason for the leave ceases,would have no need to pursue a disability retirement before the board of retirement.
in addition,a dismissal as contemplated by section requires an employer action that results in severance of the employment relationship.an employee who is neither sent away nor removed,but voluntarily absents himself or herself from the job,without more,can not validly claim he or she was dismissed by the employer.an employee who is uncertain of his or her status or the existence of an employment relationship is entitled to seek clarification.
was stephens dismissed from his job plainly not.the trial court found he injured himself on the job,took medical leave,and then returned to work subject to medical restrictions concerning the use of his right thumb.his employer provided him with a modified position consistent with those restrictions.sergeant lehner testified stephens nevertheless complained that he was reinjuring his thumb even in this modified light duty,that she observed his thumb was in fact red and swollen,and that he told her his modified light duty was inconsistent with his medical restrictions.stephens admitted he told sergeant montoya that his thumb bothered him.these express and implied factual determinations are supported by substantial evidence and are thus entitled to deference on appeal.county of san bernardino th,d.
stephens complaints led captain perryman to send him the september,letter that forms the crux of this case.the critical portion of the letter provides because of your statements we believe that we will not be able to provide a modified work assignment at this time.this letter is to confirm to you that you are not to return to work until further notice.at such time as your condition improves and you are able to return to work with no restrictions,or improves to the point that you are able to perform the light duty tasks required in central control without further complaint or injury,you will be expected to submit time sheets reflecting off.i understand you have an open job injury claim for this problem,that has yet to be resolved.until notified by worker compensation we will expect your time sheets to reflect use of your personal sick leave.italics added.
the letter thus directed stephens to leave work temporarily until his medical condition improved and required him to report his absence from the workplace on his timesheets to reflect that he was either off duty or taking sick or personal leave.as the trial court concluded at no time was stephens advised in this letter that he was dismissed from employment.this factual conclusion was supported by substantial evidence.captain perryman testified that she did not intend the letter to be a termination of stephens employment,that she anticipated he would return to the job when he had been rehabilitated to the point that he could perform the modified light duty tasks required in the central control room,and that he was never taken off the county payroll or had his accrued leave time paid off.that the letter expressly instructed stephens to use his sick leave while away from work is a clear indication it did not constitute a dismissal.stephens himself testified he did not consider the letter a termination nor did he ever receive a formal notice of termination.the county subsequent offer to bring him back in a different modified position is consistent with the view he had not been dismissed from employment.
in concluding stephens was dismissed,the court of appeal below reasoned that,although he was provided with modified light duty working in the housing unit control room,his employer insisted that he rotate into the central control room,where his duties would allegedly be physically inconsistent with his documented medical restrictions,thus placing stephens in the untenable position of either accepting assignment to duties that would injure him or declining to do so and absenting himself from the job.
we respectfully disagree.the county assigned stephens to perform modified light duty,and the trial court concluded that he always had a doctor release to perform the modified duties and his doctor never changed his recommendation as to stephens ability to perform this modified position.although stephens testified the duties in the central control room were more strenuous because there was more activity and m ore use of the hand,and that he could perform the modified light duty in the housing unit control room but not in the central control room,the trial court was not obligated to accept these assertions in the face of other,contrary testimony.for example,captain perryman testified the primary difference between a person working in a control room of a housing unit and central control,would be who they dealt with and the request to open or close the door or to communicate over the intercom.in a housing unit,a large percentage of those transactions would have to do with inmates and in central control you would deal exclusively with staff significantly,when asked whether the actual physical requirements of using your thumb to push buttons was significantly different from one assignment to the other,captain perryman answered no.as the parties presented conflicting evidence on this point,we defer to the trial court implicit factual determination as supported by substantial evidence.
the court of appeal also criticized the trial court determination that stephens could have returned to work anytime between and if he had chosen to do so,finding this an illusory option,as the september,letter premised stephens return on his being able to work in the central control room without further complaint or injury.but as we explained,ante,substantial evidence supports the trial court factual determination that the physical demands of working in the central control room were no different than in the housing unit control room.
in sum,we conclude that applying the plain meaning of section to the facts of this case supports the county position that it never dismissed stephens from his job.our conclusion is consistent with the legislative intent underlying the statute,as demonstrated by its legislative history.according to the report of the assembly committee on public employment and retirement,the purpose of amending the retirement act was to eliminate severe financial consequences to an employee resulting from inconsistent decisions between an employer and the retirement board as to whether a particular employee is incapacitated and unable to perform the duties of his position.prior to the amendment of section which added the statutory language at issue in this case,a local government employer could release an employee under a local county rule and the retirement board could deny the employee a disability pension on the ground he was not disabled.the assembly committee found that,as a result of such disputes,approximately one percent of the applicants for a disability retirement pension have found themselves in the position of having neither a job,nor a retirement income.
the committee concluded thus,to remedy this problem,which is virtually a matter of life and death for the very few individuals involved each year,the public employees retirement system should be given authority to mandate reinstatement of an a finding of a lack of that the employing agency have the right of appeal to the courts.
the committee continued such a method provides a system which involves only two administrative or judicial proceedings instead of three,since the employee does not have to sue in court on a writ to secure an order to reemploy or an order to pay the disability allowance.mcgriff county of los angeles d.mcgriff.
in enacting section,the legislature was thus concerned that disputes between local governments and county retirement boards over whether an employee was disabled left such employees in limbo,having neither employment nor disability income.the legislature solved this problem by giving the retirement board the final word on whether an employee was disabled and providing that dismissed employees must be reinstated if the board found they were not disabled,while also giving local governments the right to take a judicial appeal of the board decision.in this way,the legislature ensured that county employees dismissed for disability would have either employment or disability income and not be left destitute.county of san bernardino,supra,th at,d the county can not deny an employee both disability retirement and employment.nothing in this history suggests the legislature intended the statutory reinstatement remedy to apply to employees who do not face this involuntary financial dilemma,that is,those who are not actually dismissed from their jobs.nor does this legislative history indicate the legislature was concerned about employees who choose voluntarily to leave the county employ.neither type of employee faces the dilemma of losing a job due to a disability whose existence the board of retirement declines to acknowledge.
stephens falls outside the class of employees the legislature intended to protect by enacting section.captain perryman,informed by sergeant lehner that stephens was reinjuring his thumb even in the modified light duty
