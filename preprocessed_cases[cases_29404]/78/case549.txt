introduction 
in this case we hold that the compensability threshold established by labor code section,subdivision b applies to any claim for psychiatric injury,whether or not it is related to a compensable physical injury.employer lockheed martin corporation lockheed and its insurer,bankers standard insurance company bankers,petitioned for review of a decision of the workers compensation appeals board board or wcab reversing the finding of a workers compensation administrative law judge wcj that employee applicant virginia mccullough suffered no compensable psychiatric injury.we granted the petition and now reverse the board order in case no.wck.
background 
in,while employed by general electric,mccullough sustained an admitted industrial injury to her left forearm and was awarded percent permanent disability.in,she filed another claim against alleging cumulative pulmonary and internal trauma exposure to toxic chemicals,later adding an allegation of associated psychiatric injury.during the period ending april,while employed by lockheed,she sustained admitted cumulative injury to her right upper arm and neck and alleged additional psychiatric and internal injury case no.wck.
the wcj found mccullough had never sought to reopen her first claim,as to which she was not entitled to further temporary disability indemnity,and the evidence did not justify,on an industrial basis,medical treatment for her psychiatric condition she did not sustain injury to her pulmonary or internal organs,or to her psyche,arising out of and in the course of her employment and she did sustain injury to her right upper arm and neck at lockheed for which she was awarded percent permanent disability and future medical treatment,but not to her psyche or internal organs.in particular,the wcj found mccullough aggravated psychological state did not satisfy the threshold of compensability established by section,subdivision b which he ruled applicable to all psychiatric injuries,even those incurred as a consequence of a physical work injury.
mccullough petitioned for reconsideration,challenging,inter alia,the wcj interpretation of section,which she asserted does not apply to a psychiatric injury that is a compensable consequence of an orthopedic injury.in his report and recommendation on her petition,the wcj discounted the precedential value of the board panel decision on which mccullough relied,rebelo washington hospital sj,cal.workers comp.rptr.rebelo.
the board granted reconsideration and reversed the wcj order with respect to the claims based on mccullough and injuries,finding in each case that under rebelo,she did sustain psychiatric injury as a compensable consequence of the admitted industrial physical injury.accordingly,the board awarded her further psychiatric care in both cases,and increased her permanent disability award to percent in the latter.as to the alleged injury,reconsideration was denied.lockheed and bankers hereafter collectively lockheed filed a timely petition for writ of review did not.
discussion 
statutory construction 
although the wcab findings on questions of fact are conclusive citation,the construction of a statute and its applicability to a given situation are matters of law that are reviewable by the courts.rex club workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.the board administrative construction of statutes that it is charged to enforce and interpret is entitled to great weight unless it is clearly erroneous.citation.ralphs grocery workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.an erroneous interpretation or application of law by the wcab is a ground for annulment of its decision.citations.rex club,supra,th at,d.
the fundamental goal of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.juran epstein th,d.in determining legislative intent,courts must look first to the plain words of the statute,but statutes must also be construed in light of their historical background and evident objectives ibid,especially if the statutory language is ambiguous,susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation granberry islay investments cal th,d.in general,the legislature has directed us to construe workers compensation laws liberally with the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.
labor code section was enacted as part of the workers compensation reform act of.it is part of the legislature response to increased public concern about the high cost of workers compensation coverage,limited benefits for injured workers,suspected fraud and widespread abuses in the system,and particularly the proliferation of workers compensation cases with claims for psychiatric injuries.hansen workers compensation appeals bd.th,d hansen,fn.omitted.the legislature expressed intent in enacting labor code section was to establish a new and higher threshold of compensability for psychiatric injury.id.at,d,citing,subd.c.as originally enacted,therefore,subdivision b of the statute provided,in order to establish that a psychiatric injury is compensable,an employee shall demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that actual events of employment were responsible for at least percent of the total causation from all sources contributing to the psychiatric injury.stats,ch.
in,section was amended to add subdivision d,which provided that no compensation shall be paid for psychiatric injury resulting from a regular and routine employment event including lawful personnel actions unless the employee has been employed by the employer for at least six months.the legislature apparent purpose in enacting subdivision d of section was to limit questionable claims for psychiatric injuries resulting from routine stress during the first six months of employment.hansen,supra,th at,d.as the hansen court explained,this policy decision was based on the fact that a new employee is customarily on probation for the first six months of employment,during which time problems often occur which may result in disciplinary action,resignation,or termination and lead to claims of psychiatric injury due to stress.ibid.however,subdivision d also stated,nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that there shall not be compensability for any psychiatric injury which is related to any physical injury in the workplace.stats,ch,eff.july,italics added.
in,the legislature again amended section,increasing the causation requirement for psychiatric injury from percent to more than half.see ante,fn.department of corrections workers comp.appeals bd.th,d predominant as to all causes means more than percent.at the same time,the italicized sentence quoted above was deleted from subdivision d.stats,ch.
c.the board interpretation 
in bechtel corporation industrial indemnity insurance company workers comp.appeals bd.bechtel,the board affirmed a wcj ruling and declined to apply subdivision d employment provision to a claim of psychiatric injury as a compensable consequence of admitted industrial injuries to the claimant back as opposed to an independent or separate psychiatric injury claim absent specific language from the legislature or any appellate authority.id.at.the board did not believe the amendments had undermined the hansen court conclusion that the overriding purpose and the focus of the legislature in enacting that section was to eliminate questionable psychiatric claims arising from employment exposure.ibid.division three of this court denied the employer writ petition.id.at.
in rebelo,supra,cal.workers comp.rptr,the board rescinded a wcj order and ruled that the requirements of labor code section do not apply to a psychiatric injury that is alleged to be a compensable consequence of a physical industrial injury.id.at.despite the omission effected by the amendment of subdivision d,the board nonetheless found it worthy of note that the legislature did not disturb the rule of compensable consequences when it enacted.id.at.although the compensable consequence doctrine has a foundation in workers compensation law,the panel continued,compensable consequence injuries are nowhere described in.nor were compensable consequences the subject or focus of the amendments to the statute that were directed to reducing or eliminating psychiatric claims due to stress arising from employment exposure.that is,the legislature was focused on psychiatric injuries resulting from employment events as opposed to the compensable consequences of an admitted physical injury.thus,the panel was not persuaded that the deleting of the last sentence of d in was intended to do away with the compensability of psychiatric consequences of a physical injury.id.at.
there was apparently no appellate review of rebelo,but the board expressly followed its rationale in two other writ denied cases.first,in circle corporation workers comp.appeals bd.circle k,the wcj ruled the applicant claimed psychiatric injury was a compensable consequence of an admitted industrial injury to her head,neck and shoulder.he found that section,subdivision b did not apply and,in the alternative,that the opinion of the qualified medical examiner justified a finding that the applicant psychiatric injury was,in fact,predominantly caused by her admitted physical injury.id.at.in granting reconsideration,the board adopted and incorporated the wcj analysis and reiterated the rebelo panel conclusion that the legislature focus in enacting section was on reducing or eliminating stress claims arising from the very brief exposure window in the initial stage of employment.ibid.alternatively,if a psychiatric injury is governed by the statute,the precipitating orthopedic injury constitutes an actual event of employment within the meaning of subdivision b.ibid.
finally,in county of monterey workers comp.appeals bd.monterey,the applicant suffered a bilateral wrist injury in.the psychiatric evaluator apportioned percent of her psychiatric injury to the industrial injury,assuming the loss of medical insurance resulting from her absence from work was a compensable consequence of the wrist injury.if not,he apportioned percent of the psychiatric injury to industrial factors.the wcj found the loss of insurance was non industrial,and percent industrial causation did not meet the statutory threshold.the board granted reconsideration and rescinded the wcj finding based on the principle of compensable consequences,as applied in the rebelo and bechtel cases id.at,section does not apply to a claim of psychiatric disability resulting from physical industrial injury.
thus,in the absence of appellate guidance,various panels of the board have consistently taken the same position on this issue for over two years nevertheless,in the case before us,the wcj characterized rebelo as only a panel decision of the appeals board not entitled to much weight and concluded from the sequence of legislative changes in the language of that the legislature intended to raise the standard for all psychiatric injuries,even those incurred as a consequence of a physical injury.he noted that circle k value as precedent is low because there the applicant physical injuries were indeed the predominant cause of her psychiatric injury.he was not familiar with monterey.in reversing the wcj,the board repeated its statement in rebelo that the predominant cause threshold does not apply to a psychiatric condition which is a compensable consequence,regardless of the date of injury.compensable consequence injuries are nowhere described in.citation.
resolution 
until now,there has been no appellate authority on this issue.we are not bound by either board panel decisions such as rebelo,or writ denied cases such as bechtel,circle k,and monterey smith workers comp.appeals bd.th,fn,d.the language of subdivision b clearly and unambiguously refers to the compensability of a psychiatric injury,without any exceptions.the legislature undoubtedly knows how to enact an exception as it did in,and the fact that it later deleted that exception would appear determinative when the legislature deletes an express provision of a statute,it is presumed that it intended to effect a substantial change in the law.citation.royal.auctioneers,coast printing equipment d.
lockheed submits that this is the only reasonable interpretation of the statute as it has evolved through successive amendments but,acknowledging that those with opposing viewpoints often interpret the same plain language in different ways,requests judicial notice,of selected documents furnished by the legislative intent service.exhibit h to the petition contains materials relating to the amendments,specifically,excerpts of of the documents the service sent lockheed attorney.lockheed claims these materials demonstrate that insurance industry concerns about the proposed amendment led to deletion of subdivision d previous exemption,that the legislature expressly intended the increased threshold of compensability to apply to all psychiatric claims,not just,and that a different but related assembly bill provided for psychiatric injury resulting from aggravation of physical injury to be governed by the predominant cause provision.
we need not tarry over the propriety of judicial notice or the reliability of lockheed scant documentation as evidence of legislative intent,since it adds almost nothing that is not evident from the mere deletion of subdivision d last sentence.neither mccullough nor her amici curiae see post,have directed us to,nor have we independently found,any evidence whatever in the legislative history of the amendments to section supporting the conclusion that the legislature did not mean to repeal the previous exception by that deletion 
nor have we been offered any convincing arguments for the board interpretation.mccullough suggests the legislature deleted the exclusionary language because it was redundant,since section,by definition,never applied to compensable consequences cases.but she offers no authority for any legally meaningful distinction between the psychiatric component of a physical injury,as she now styles it,and the psychiatric injury referred to in both the statute and the board compensable consequence decisions on which she relies.caaa asserts that psychiatric injury is a term of art referring not to the psychiatric sequela e of physical injuries,but only to the initial determination of exclusively emotional harm generally arising out of stress.section,subdivision a,however,defines a compensable psychiatric injury as a mental disorder which causes disability or need for medical treatment and is diagnosed in accordance with prescribed criteria.as mccullough notes,this definition has remained substantially unchanged.the cases on which caaa relies cole fair oaks fire protection dist.cal d,hart national mortgage land d.livitsanos superior court cal th,d,do not support its contention.these cases established that emotional distress claims based on alleged misconduct that is a normal part of the employment relationship come within the exclusive remedy provisions of the workers compensation law,which preclude civil suit.and this is true,regardless of whether related physical injury is alleged or not.
mccullough also argues the legislature may have deleted the final sentence of subdivision d because it was redundant in that once the exclusion was established in the version,it did not have to remain in the statute.one shudders to think of the effect of such an approach on the whole of california statutory law.
amicus curiae california society of industrial medicine surgery,csim s,asserts that the doctrine of compensable consequences encompasses the concept of predominant cause that is,the but for test mentioned in brock workers comp.appeals bd,and shannon,supra,at page the injury have occurred but for defendant conduct is more stringent than section causation threshold.this assertion can not withstand scrutiny.according to the cited authority,the but for rule was one of two tests for establishing cause in fact,a concept included in the term proximate cause.mitchell gonzales cal d,d.the tort concept of proximate causation,however,is not followed in workers compensation.citation.instead,the causal connection between employment and the injury is sufficient if the employment is a contributing cause of the inju
