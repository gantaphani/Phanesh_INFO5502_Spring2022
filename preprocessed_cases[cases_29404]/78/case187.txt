background 
carmelo menist is an indiana truck driver who was injured in a collision with a truck driven by an employee of plaintiff schneider national carriers,schneider.national employee care systems necs is the administrator for carolina casualty company,the worker compensation carrier for menist employer,burlington motor carriers.following the accident,menist received approximately in worker compensation benefits from necs.
menist then sued schneider in state court in pennsylvania,where the accident occurred,and the case was removed to the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.necs moved to intervene in the suit in order to protect its lien or subrogation rights,but schneider opposed the motion,arguing that intervention was unnecessary because menist attorney has acknowledged the lien or subrogation right at issue,and has fulfilled his duty to the subrogation carrier in writing that the subrogation right will be honored,protected and reimbursed from settlement proceeds.before the district court ruled on the intervention motion,necs entered into a stipulation of subrogation lien agreement with menist stating that menist would recognize and agree to honor the subrogation lien of necs pursuant to and consistent with the aforementioned pennsylvania and indiana law.for its part,necs agreed to withdraw its intervention motion upon execution of the stipulation,and promptly did so.schneider was not a party to the stipulation.
menist and schneider then settled the lawsuit for less than the in worker compensation benefits necs had paid.necs was not a party to the settlement agreement,did not participate in settlement discussions,and did not give its consent to the settlement as required by.despite the presettlement representations of schneider and menist that necs lien rights would be honored and protected,necs was never paid any portion of the settlement proceeds by either menist or schneider.instead,the settling parties provided in their written settlement agreement that schneider would assume responsibility for negotiating with necs regarding its lien rights and indemnify and defend menist against any lien claim by necs.more specifically,the settlement agreement provided that schneider would 
n egotiate with necs to the extent that necs has paid for medical services and income loss benefits rendered to menist as a result of alleged injuries and damages that menist contends was sic causally related to the may,accident if schneider can not negotiate a reasonable settlement with necs,schneider agree s to defend any lawsuit filed against menist seeking reimbursement for expenses incurred as a result of this accident.schneider hereby promise s to satisfy any judgment which might result from such a lawsuit but only to the extent of fault assessed against schneider by judgment or stipulation,and only to the extent that their medical expenses are reasonable,necessary,customary and causally related to the accident of may,
after the case was dismissed by stipulation on the basis of the settlement,attorneys representing schneider and necs discussed payment of necs lien claim,as contemplated by the settlement agreement.it appears,however,that negotiations broke down on the issue of whether the lien amount was reasonable,necessary,and caused by schneider employee negligence.the record does not disclose the specifics of the dispute we are told only that the negotiations between schneider and necs were unsuccessful in resolving necs lien claim.
schneider then filed the present action against necs and menist seeking a judicial declaration of its rights and obligations necs and menist with respect to the worker compensation lien necs counterclaimed against schneider and crossclaimed against menist seeking enforcement of its lienholder rights and recovery from either schneider or menist.the parties agreed that indiana law applied and that no material facts were in dispute and submitted the case to the district court for resolution on crossmotions for summary judgment.
the district court awarded summary judgment to necs and against schneider and menist jointly and severally in the amount of,representing the settlement minus the contingency fee that would have gone to menist attorney if the settlement had been properly handled in the first place.based on the indemnity provision in the settlement agreement,the district court held that schneider was responsible for paying the judgment.schneider appeals,arguing that necs waived its subrogation and lien rights by failing to intervene in the suit against schneider or timely institute its own suit as menist subrogee.alternatively,schneider argues that necs is limited to recovering its lien amount from menist,not schneider,because schneider was under no duty to protect necs interests and any promises it made menist to the contrary were invalid.
ii.discussion 
indiana law 
under indiana law which the parties agree applies here,necs lien rights are clearly established by operation of,which provides in pertinent part 
t he injured employee may commence legal proceedings against the other person to recover damages notwithstanding the compensation insurance carrier payment of compensation in that case,however,if the action against the other person is brought by the injured employee and settlement is made with the other person,either with or without suit,then from the amount received by the employee there shall be paid to the employer compensation insurance carrier the amount of compensation paid to the employee 
if the injured employee shall agree to receive compensation from the employer compensation insurance carrier the employer compensation insurance carrier shall have a lien upon any settlement award out of which the employee might be compensated from the third party.emphasis added.
paras.the statute protects a worker compensation carrier lien rights by requiring the lienholder approval of any settlement between the injured employee and the tortfeasor no release or settlement shall be valid without the written consent of the insurer,except consent shall not be required where the insurer has been fully indemnified or protected by court order,para.
the supreme court of indiana has described the purpose of this statute as follows 
the section provides for only two means of settling a claim against a third party.the employer must either give written consent or be fully indemnified or protected by court order.the reason the legislature required written consent as one alternative is obvious.because settlement serves as a bar to further recovery against the third party,state mileff,without a consent requirement,an employee could settle a lawsuit for an amount well below medical and disability costs and leave the employer with nowhere to turn for the additional money owed
