maytag corporation terminated thomas mccoy employment for failing to comply with the notice provision of its collective bargaining agreement after mccoy did not provide a medical update to justify his absence from work after his leave of absence expired.mccoy then sued maytag,alleging that maytag terminated him in retaliation for his filing of a workers compensation claim and that his termination breached the collective bargaining agreement.the district court granted summary judgment to maytag on both claims.we affirm.
thomas mccoy was an assembly line employee in maytag corporation maytag washer and dryer manufacturing facility in herrin,illinois.on april,mccoy injured his left shoulder while moving washing machine bases as part of his job duties.mccoy felt something pop in his left shoulder,and then his arm began to go numb and he experienced a tingling sensation.
that same day,mccoy reported the incident to his supervisor,gordon dailey.a physician assistant,chris shadowens,examined mccoy that day and diagnosed him as suffering from rotator cuff tendinitis,but he ruled out a tear.shadowens opined that mccoy was fit to return to work the next day,with the restriction that mccoy may not use his left arm to lift objects weighing more than five pounds.later that day mccoy provided shadowens written medical evaluation to nurse kathy lemay,who worked in maytag medical office,which was located within the manufacturing facility.mccoy also testified that in the past he had provided medical documents,such as doctor notes,both to lemay and to maytag senior workers compensation specialist,marie brasher.brasher,unlike lemay,worked in maytag human resources office.
mccoy returned to work the next day.an unidentified doctor then modified shadowens prior work limitations to restrict mccoy from using his left arm and stated in his written medical evaluation that mccoy could return to work the next day.mccoy discussed the new restriction with dailey.unfortunately for mccoy,dailey informed him that maytag had no jobs that could accommodate his restriction.mccoy left work on april,and never returned to work at maytag.
mccoy testified that at some point shortly thereafter,he had a conversation with lemay during which he requested a form to fill out for work comp.according to mccoy,lemay gave him a maytag form entitled statement of claim for accident or sickness benefits a s form mccoy then completed the a s form and dated it april.on the form,mccoy indicated that he had been injured at work and that he intended to present a workers compensation claim.mccoy personal physician,edward corder,completed the physician portion of mccoy a s form and signed and dated it may.two days later,mccoy sent to maytag a facsimile of his completed a s form mccoy stated that no one at maytag discouraged him from filing an application for a s benefits,and he acknowledged that he received a s benefit payments.
mccoy testified that,at the time he completed the a s form,he mistakenly believed it was a form to apply for workers compensation benefits.on the same day that mccoy completed his portion of the a s form,however,he completed,signed,and dated a separate workers compensation benefits application at his attorney office.the record indicates that mccoy filed his workers compensation claim with the illinois industrial commission and that maytag initially disputed mccoy claim.in may,mccoy and maytag ultimately settled his workers compensation claim for a lump sum payment to mccoy of.
in the months that followed his application for a s benefits,mccoy stayed in touch with brasher and provided to her medical evaluations forms completed by his treating physicians indicating the status of his condition and limitations.some of the documents that mccoy submitted were completed versions of maytag own health insurance claim group disability income forms maytag forms,while others were evaluations written on his treating physicians letterheads.for example,mccoy submitted to maytag an evaluation from one of his treating orthopedists,william harryman,dated august,and written on harryman letterhead,which stated that he was unable to work until after his next evaluation on august,on august,mccoy and corder completed,signed,and dated a maytag form indicating that mccoy remained totally disabled and unable to work.harryman mccoy on august,and mccoy testified that he believed that he provided to maytag another letter on harryman letterhead indicating that mccoy may not return to work until after undergoing surgery.
on september,five months after his injury,harryman performed surgery on mccoy shoulder.in a letter on harryman letterhead and signed by harryman,he stated that mccoy m ay not return to work for at least weeks following his surgery.both mccoy and harryman also completed a maytag form dated september,indicating that mccoy was presently disabled and unable to work.mccoy testified that harryman office sent to brasher a facsimile of both of harryman written medical evaluation forms.maytag acknowledges that it received the forms and that they were kept in its manufacturing facility medical office.however,neither lemay nor david wittenbrink,maytag other nurse,received harryman september medical evaluations.janice mcconnaughy,maytag manager of employee relations,also testified that she did not know the documents existed and that she never received copies.
it was at that point that the situation became convoluted.maytag states that it was working under the belief that mccoy had a duty to provide it with status reports regarding his medical condition every thirty days pursuant to article of its collective bargaining agreement cba.prior to his surgery,mccoy provided periodic updates within the required time frames,and maytag accordingly paid a s benefits to mccoy.it is uncontested,however,that following his surgery and submission of harryman medical evaluation forms,mccoy did not provide any further status updates to maytag for at least thirty days.based on its interpretation of the cba,maytag determined that without any updated status reports,mccoy a s benefits and leave of absence expired on october.
lemay asked mcconnaughy to advise mccoy that he was delinquent in submitting his updated status reports in a letter dated november,sent via certified mail,mcconnaughy informed mccoy that we have not heard from you or received medical documentation since your leave of absence expired on october.mcconnaughy letter requested that mccoy submit documentation necessary to support your absence for the past three weeks by on friday,november,for us to review to determine your employment status and warned him that i f we do not hear from you by that date,we will have assumed that you have terminated your employment.
from november,through november,maytag did not receive a response from mccoy,nor did it receive a certified mail receipt evincing delivery of the letter.on november,mcconnaughy sent an to lemay and wittenbrink,asking,c an you please tell me if you received updated medical documentation for thomas mccoy,as well as w hat address do you have for thomas wittenbrink responded that he had not received an update from mccoy,and that mccoy had provided an address different than his original paperwork on his last continuation form.mcconnaughy then sent to mccoy a second letter via certified mail,which was dated november,that letter stated that because maytag had not heard from mccoy since october,effective immediately,his employment with maytag has been terminated.if you can provide documentation to support that you have been reporting your absences to maytag,please submit them for our review.
on november,mccoy accepted delivery of both of maytag certified letters.that same day mccoy contacted his,mark prince,who in turn contacted maytag attorney,michael keefe,regarding getting mccoy reinstated.according to mccoy,nothing came of prince efforts,and mccoy did not speak with anyone at maytag regarding his termination mccoy did not,however,contact his union representative or submit any additional documents to maytag for review for approximately two months.not until january,did mccoy contact his union representative,steve jones,regarding his termination.jones declined to file a grievance on mccoy behalf,based on his conclusion that a grievance would have been untimely because it was well past the cba deadline to file such a grievance.
mccoy filed this lawsuit against maytag approximately four months later.mccoy alleged that maytag terminated his employment in retaliation for his exercise of his workers compensation rights and that maytag breached the cba following discovery,maytag moved for summary judgment.the district court granted maytag motion.mccoy appeals.
on appeal,mccoy first argues that the district court should not have granted summary judgment in favor of maytag because maytag proffered reason for his he failed to provide medical a pretext.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.clark state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.in doing so,we view all facts and draw all inferences in the light most favorable to the party.abstract title guar.chicago ins,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the evidence before the court indicates that there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.mccoy retaliatory discharge claim is based on illinois law.see generally kelsay motorola,recognizing for the first time a retaliatory discharge cause of action under illinois law.when resolution of an issue depends on state law,we must apply the law that would be applied in this context by the state supreme court.ali shaw,cir.see also clark,at.
under illinois law,a valid claim for retaliatory discharge requires a showing that an employee has been discharged in retaliation for the employee activities and that the discharge violates a clear mandate of public policy.carter tennant,cir quoting bourbon kmart,cir citing hartlein.power.in the workers compensation context,a plaintiff must show that he was the defendant employee before his injury that he exercised a right granted by the workers compensation act and that he was discharged from his employment with a causal connection to his filing a workers compensation claim.id.quoting hiatt rockwell int l,cir citing kritzen flender,d.the element of causation is not met if the employer has a valid basis,which is not pretextual,for discharging the employee.id.quoting hartlein,at.an employer discharge of an employee for filing a workers compensation claim is equally offensive to the public policy of this state as stated in the workers compensation act.id.quoting darnell impact.
some question remains,however,regarding whether,under the erie doctrine,a federal court exercising diversity jurisdiction to hear a retaliatory discharge claim under the illinois workers compensation act must apply the illinois framework,or whether it may use the familiar method first presented in mcdonnell douglas green,d.see carter,at see also bourbon,at posner,concurring if the requirement of proving cause is so attenuated as to give the plaintiff a boost toward winning his case that he would not have under ordinary rules of pleading and production,then there is a conflict with substantive state law,and what the federal courts inaptly call the mcdonnell douglas standard for proving retaliation must give way in any retaliation case governed by state law.this is of potential importance because while the supreme court of illinois expressly rejected the application of mcdonnell douglas to illinois cases in clemons mech.devices,carter,at quoting bourbon,at posner,concurring,we previously have utilized the mcdonnell douglas framework,see hiatt rockwell int,cir applying mcdonnell douglas framework to retaliatory discharge claim under illinois law citing mcewen delta air lines,cir.as we noted in carter,the supreme court of illinois was concerned that use of the mcdonnell douglas framework would,in essence,expand the tort of retaliatory discharge by reliev ing plaintiffs of their burden to prove as an element of their prima facie case under illinois law a causal link between their workers compensation claims and their discharge.carter,at quoting clemons,at.thus,to determine which framework should apply,we would need to examine whether the mcdonnell douglas framework is substantive or procedural when it is applied in this context.carter,at.if the mcdonnell douglas framework is substantive for erie purposes,then we must apply the illinois framework when a retaliatory discharge claim under the illinois workers compensation act wander s into federal court by virtue of diversity jurisdiction.bourbon,at posner,concurring.we did not resolve this uncertainty in carter,because the parties waived the issue by ignoring it on appeal,and because the plaintiff claim failed under either the illinois framework or the mcdonnell douglas framework because the defendant provide d a valid,reason for its decision to terminate the plaintiff.carter,at.see also siekierka united steel deck,d,the mere existence of a valid or sufficient reason,however,does not defeat a retaliatory discharge claim.i f an employer chooses to come forward with a valid,nonpretextual basis for discharging its employees and the trier of fact believes it,the causation element required to be proven is not met.quoting clemons mech.devices,emphasis added tincher stores,cir the pretext inquiry focuses on the the the employer stated reason for the termination.citations omitted.we face a similar situation in this case,because neither party raised this issue on appeal and,as discussed below,maytag provided a valid,reason for terminating mccoy employment.accordingly,as we did in carter,we leave the decision regarding what the prima facie case of retaliation is in the seventh circuit for another day.carter,at quoting bourbon,at posner,concurring.
even assuming that mccoy could demonstrate a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge under either the illinois framework or the mcdonnell douglas framework,mccoy claim fails because maytag has articulated a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for terminating mccoy employment and mccoy has failed to show that maytag proffered reason was pretextual.see gomez v.the finishing,d,if the employer is able to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the employee discharge,then the plaintiff has an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not true,but a pretext for discrimination.see also tincher,at stating that once an employer provides a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for terminating the employee,the mcdonnell douglas framework drops out of the picture leaving the employee with the ultimate burden of proving the discrimination by showing that his employer provided a pretextual reason for her termination citations omitted.maytag has consistently argued that it discharged mccoy not because he filed a workers compensation claim,but because he failed to provide maytag with status reports regarding his medical condition every thirty days pursuant to article of the cba and because he did not notify maytag within hours regarding his failure to return after his leave of absence expired pursuant to article of the cba.mccoy counters that maytag stated reason for his termination was pretextual.to show pretext a plaintiff must offer evidence to indicate that the employer did not honestly believe the reasons it gave for its action and is simply lying to cover its tracks.cardoso robert bosch,cir.see also gomez,at.in other words,pretext means more than a mistake on the part of the employer pretext means a lie,specifically a phony reason for some action.tincher,at.see also essex united parcel,cir the fact that the employer was mistaken or based its decision on bad policy,or even just plain stupidity,goes nowhere as evidence that the proffered reason is pretextual.
in this case,there is ample evidence in the record that maytag decision to terminate mccoy employment was based on its interpretation of the cba terms and its conclusion that mccoy leave of absence had expired and he had abandoned his employment.mccoy claims that maytag deliberately misread the cba as requiring him to submit medical status updates every thirty days as p
