factual and procedural background 
the complaint 
on june,leegin creative leather products,leegin filed a fraud complaint against carolina diaz santiaguin alleging the following facts 
on january,santiaguin informed leegin that she was suffering from injuries based on an event that had occurred on december.leegin sent santiaguin to the industrial health clinic it uses to diagnose and treat its employees for injuries.from january,to april,santiaguin worked on light duty because leegin reasonably believed santiaguin had suffered injuries.since april,santiaguin has not worked because leegin had no light work duty for her.
munir uwayday certified that santiaguin was temporarily totally disabled in both arms from april to june.
on april,santiaguin filed a workers compensation claim for injuries suffered in december and continuing thereafter.the injuries were to her b ilateral shoulders,arms,wrists,hands,and fingers.leegin reported santiaguin claim to its workers compensation insurer.
in may,leegin learned that santiaguin injury claim was false.leegin had been advised that santiaguin had been observed and videotaped performing strenuous physical activities at and near her home and at other locations and engaging in other acts and conduct that are inconsistent with the physical activities of a person who is totally temporarily disabled because of an injury to her bilateral shoulders,arms,wrists,hands and fingers.
leegin alleged that santiaguin falsely represented that she had been injured on the job with the intent to have leegin rely upon those false representations and with the foreseeable consequence of having leegin submit her claim to its workers compensation carrier.leegin alleged it had reasonably relied upon santiaguin representations that she had suffered injuries described in the employee claim for benefits and the application for adjudication of claim filed april,that she was temporarily totally disabled.leegin reported the claim to its workers compensation insurer.
leegin alleged that because it reported santiaguin fraudulent claim to its insurer,it leegin has been damaged and has otherwise suffered a detriment in that,among other things,leegin insurance premiums and reserves will automatically be increased in an amount to be proven at trial.leegin also sought punitive damages.
santiaguin motion 
on august,santiaguin filed her special motion to strike the complaint she urged that leegin action would have a chilling effect on her constitutional right to seek redress for her injuries through the workers compensation system.a declaration from santiaguin attorney explained that santiaguin workers compensation claim was presently pending.leegin insurer,the state compensation insurance fund scif,had accepted the claim and was providing medical treatment and temporary disability insurance.citing labor code section,counsel argued that because scif had not rejected the claim within days,it was presumed compensable.lastly,counsel claimed that scif had not raised any defense of fraud or alleged any fraud or misconduct by santiaguin.
leegin opposition to the motion 
leegin conceded that for purposes of the motion to strike,santiaguin actions were taken in furtherance of her right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue.code civ,subd.e.leegin reiterates that concession in this appeal.
to demonstrate the probability of prevailing on the merits of its complaint,leegin offered evidence to establish santiaguin claim was fraudulent.in a declaration,gregory robles,leegin safety manager,explained that he first became suspicious of santiaguin claim in april after a leegin employee told him that he had seen santiaguin pulling a large suitcase full of clothes to sell to the employees.as a result,leegin contacted its insurance agent.it was decided to conduct a surveillance of santiaguin.ronald danison,a claims investigator,took the video surveillance tape of santiaguin on may.danison declaration explained that he observed and videotaped her exerting a considerable amount of force in order to accomplish several activities,including lifting heavy boxes,lifting a heavy vacuum,closing a heavy garage door,squatting several times to lift these objects and to speak with a child.thereafter,leegin contacted the scif claims adjuster.the adjuster suggested that scif do some additional surveillance of santiaguin.leegin told him that it already had a great deal of evidence on tape demonstrating that she was not temporarily totally disabled as of the date of the surveillance.the adjuster only response was to keep him posted.
brian solberg,director of orthopaedic trauma at cedars sinai medical center,reviewed the surveillance videotape.in his report,solberg wrote d uring the time period of the video,santiaguin displayed normal shoulder,elbow,wrist and finger motion.all motions demonstrated were well within normal.she repeatedly demonstrates an ability to lift objects up to lbs without overt signs of strain or discomfort.she also demonstrates the ability to deep knee squat for periods in excess of thirty seconds without overt signs of discomfort or kneeling problems.solberg concluded that based upon the objective evidence of the video,santiaguin had at the maximum,a disability which precludes heavy work,lifting in excess of lbs.repeatedly.she has clearly demonstrated the ability to lift objects up to lbs.repeatedly and to perform tasks requiring significant grip strength.therefore,he could refute with reasonable medical probability santiaguin claim of total temporary disability.
in addition to the above evidentiary showing,leegin offered legal authorities to support its argument that its right to sue santiaguin for fraud was not barred by the exclusivity provisions of the workers compensation system.
santiaguin reply to leegin opposition to her motion to strike 
santiaguin argued that leegin evidence at most may raise an issue of the nature and extent of her industrial disability but did not show fraud because leegin complaint alleged she suffered no injury to begin with,not that she is exaggerating or amplifying the degree of her disability.her workers compensation claim was based on her inability to engage in her usual and customary occupation,not an inability to engage in normal daily activities which are considerably less arduous than those of her work as a laborer.
on the legal issue of an employer right to sue an employee for filing a fraudulent workers compensation claim,santiaguin cited labor code section to urge that the only civil remedy for this species of fraud is an action by a district attorney.
the trial court ruling 
the trial court requested and received additional briefing from the parties on four legal questions related to leegin right to bring an action for fraud against santiaguin in the civil court system.at the hearing held on the motion,the court remarks indicated that it believed leegin did not have a right to file a fraud action against santiaguin instead,according to the court,leegin remedy was to contest santiaguin claim for claim which had not yet been the context of the workers compensation system.the trial court minute order grants santiaguin motion to strike leegin complaint and awards her attorney fees and costs.
this appeal by leegin follows.
