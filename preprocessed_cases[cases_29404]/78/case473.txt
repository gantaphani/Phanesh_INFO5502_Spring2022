this case poses the question whether a police officer who injured his leg while off duty,playing in a pickup game of basketball at a private facility,is entitled to workers compensation benefits.
a workers compensation judge wcj concluded the injury arose out of and occurred in the course of the police officer employment because,in the wcj view,the officer reasonably believed that his participation in cardiovascular activities such as basketball were sic expected by his employer.in a decision,the workers compensation appeals board denied the employer petition for reconsideration.
the police officer employer then petitioned for,and we issued,a writ of review.we now shall annul the award of workers compensation benefits.
as we will explain,when an employee is injured during voluntary,participation in a recreational,social,or athletic activity,labor code section,subdivision a provides that the injury is not covered by workers compensation,unless the activity was a reasonable expectancy of the employment or it was expressly or impliedly required by the employment.general assertions that the employer expects an employee to stay in good physical condition,and that the employer benefits from the employee doing so,are not sufficient for worker compensation coverage since that would impose virtually limitless liability for any recreational or athletic activity in which the employee chooses to result that would run afoul of the limitation set forth in labor code section,subdivision a.
turning to the facts of this case,we conclude the evidence does not support a finding that officer sean jenneiahn subjectively believed that his employer expected him to engage in an occasional pickup game of basketball in order to stay in shape.in any event,such a subjective belief would have been objectively unreasonable under the circumstances here.thus,it can not be said that the specific activity during which he was injured was a reasonable expectancy of,or was expressly or impliedly required by,his employment.for this reason,the workers compensation appeals board erred in concluding that jenneiahn injury was covered by workers compensation.
sean jenneiahn is employed as a police officer by the city of stockton the city.he engages in additional employment by officiating at high school basketball and baseball games.
the city police department has a regulation stating that police officers shall maintain good physical condition.however,after an officer is hired,the department does not require any physical fitness tests or examinations.according to the record in this case,no officer has ever been fired or otherwise disciplined for not being physically fit.
officer jenneiahn was not aware of the regulation requiring physical fitness,although he remembered that the application for employment said an officer must be physically fit to do the job.some of his training officers advised him to stay in shape,and jenneiahn believed that officers should remain physically fit.he did so by jogging and running,doing cardiovascular workouts,and playing basketball and softball.
the city police officers are not given time to work out while on duty.however,in the basement of the police department,the city maintains a gymnasium and workout facility that is available for officers use.officer jenneiahn did not use the department facility because he preferred to work out elsewhere when he was not on duty.
while off duty and playing in a basketball game,officer jenneiahn hyperextended his leg and suffered a fracture of the tibia plateau.
the facility where the injury occurred is owned and operated by the stockton police officers association spoa,not by the city.the facility,which has a gymnasium,kitchen,bar,pool tables,basketball court,barbeque facility,and racquetball court,is used for a variety of social,recreational,and athletic activities.spoa members can use it whenever they want as part of their union dues.
when the spoa facility opened,the city chief of police issued a special order strictly prohibiting officers from visiting the facility for any reason while on duty,including taking meal breaks or using the restrooms.
the basketball game in which officer jenneiahn was playing when he was injured was not an event.in fact,it was not a scheduled event at all.the game was described as a pickup game jenneiahn went to the spoa facility and got into a game with others who were there.at the time,he had not been playing very much basketball.he was staying in shape by running and officiating at basketball games.he testified that he would have been in shape regardless of whether he played basketball.
discussion 
the question whether workers compensation benefits should be received for injuries suffered by an employee during recreational or athletic pursuits has arisen often.
in liberty mut.ins.acc.com.cal d,hereafter liberty mutual,the claimant was a employee at a recreational resort.when not performing his duties,he could participate in any of the recreational activities available in the area,including swimming in a pool created by a dam across a stream.he was injured while diving into the pool.because the pool was located beyond the area under its control,the employer could not prohibit the employee from swimming in the pool.id.at.the california supreme court concluded the injury was not covered by workers compensation because it occurred while the employee was engaged in a personal recreational activity on his own free time in an area without the orbit of his employment and beyond the control or dominion of his employer.id.at.the court observed that to hold otherwise would make compensation coverage virtually limitless.id.at.
the same conclusion was reached in fireman fund.acc.com.cal d,hereafter fireman fund,where the claimant,a cook and housekeeper,was injured during a walk.it was her custom to take short walks once or twice a day,and she had been advised to do so by the employer doctor.on the day of the injury,she informed her employer that she was going for a walk.the employer told the employee not to go too far.id.at.the supreme court found the injury was not compensable because it occurred while the employee was walking on a public road as an act of recreational diversion of her own free choice and when from her work.id.at.the court rejected her argument that she was following her medical adviser recommendation as to a suitable exercise,and so was conditioning herself to perform better the duties of her employment.id.at.the court explained i f such theory should be adopted as sufficient to establish the necessary causal connection with the employment,then any injury sustained by an employee in a recreational activity would be compensable.ibid.
in united parcel service of america,industrial accident commission d,the court of appeal concluded that an employee who was injured in a foot race at a company picnic was not entitled to worker compensation because the intangible value of improvement in the employee health or morals that is common to all kinds of recreation and social life is not sufficient to make an injury compensable.id.at,see also state farm fire casualty workers comp.appeals bd.d.
and in city of los angeles workers comp.appeals bd.d.hereafter city of los angeles,the court of appeal concluded that worker compensation did not apply to injuries suffered by a police officer while weightlifting at home in preparation for a physical fitness test.id.at.the workers compensation appeals board had found compensation was appropriate because the officer was required to undergo a physical fitness test for which he was preparing.id.at.the court of appeal disagreed,stating there is a wide variety of occupations in which it is necessary for the employee to maintain or improve physical or mental proficiency in order to continue employment or qualify for advancement.the variety of activities which might be thought to serve those purposes is infinite.when the activity is voluntary,off the employer premises and unregulated,the employer can have little knowledge of the physical risks involved,and no opportunity to minimize or protect the employee against such risks.these circumstances strongly militate in favor of classifying such activities as personal in the absence of some connection with employment other than personal improvement.the fact that the employer tested the fitness of the employee periodically should not by itself make a program an industrial activity.id.at,fn.omitted.
in,the legislature acted on the question by adding to labor code section a provision that is now subdivision a of the section further section references are to the labor code,with references to subdivision a of section cited simply as subdivision a.section provides generally that an injury is covered by worker compensation benefits when,at the time of the injury,the employee is performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment and is acting within the course of his or her employment and the injury is proximately caused by the employment,either with or without negligence,subd.a.however,subdivision a sets forth a limitation.to be compensable,the injury must be one that does not arise out of voluntary participation in any recreational,social,or athletic activity not constituting part of the employee duties,except where these activities are a reasonable expectancy of,or are expressly or impliedly required by,the employment.
the statutory scheme was construed in ezzy workers comp.appeals bd.d.hereafter ezzy.the court of appeal noted that what is now subdivision a was added by the legislature in reaction to decisions that had allowed workers compensation for injuries suffered by employees during activities where the activities were reasonably foreseeable or expectable in the work setting.id.at.the court concluded the subdivision was intended to draw a brighter line delimiting compensability by replacing the general foreseeability test with one of reasonable expectancy of employment ibid,a test that is met when the employee subjectively believes his or her participation in the activity is expected by the employer,and the belief is objectively reasonable.id.at.
the claimant in ezzy was injured while playing in a regularly scheduled league softball game sponsored by her employer law firm.ezzy,supra,d at.while the court of appeal considered the case to be close,it found the injury was compensable because the claimant,a law clerk in her second year of law school,was particularly vulnerable to pressure or suggestion that she play,she felt she was essentially drafted to play when a partner handed her a and schedule and told her that the team would see her at the next game,female employees were pressured to play so the team would not forfeit due to the league requirement that a team have four women on the field at all times during a game,the firm paid for all equipment,and refreshments,and hosted an awards banquet for players,the firm benefited through improved office cooperation,spirit,morale,and camaraderie,and the firm had not posted or read to its employees the provisions of what is now subdivision a.id.at.
in hughes aircraft workers comp.appeals bd.d.hereafter hughes aircraft,the court of appeal further considered what is now section,subdivision a.noting legislative history shows the provision purpose is to ensure that an employer could provide voluntary recreational,social and athletic benefits for his employee personal use without also bearing the expense of insuring the employee for workers compensation benefits during participation in those activities id.at,the court found that the legislature intended to exclude from coverage any injuries that are only remotely,so as not to deter employers from subsidizing,sponsoring,or encouraging personal employee activities of a recreational or social character.ibid.
the claimant in hughes aircraft suffered a injury while attending an annual,holiday party that was subsidized percent by the employer.the employer organized the event to foster an atmosphere of togetherness,but attendance was wholly voluntary.an employee position would not be enhanced by attendance,and there would not be any adverse consequence if an employee did not attend.hughes aircraft,supra,d at.the workers compensation appeals board awarded compensation based solely on its view that the employer obtained a direct benefit from the party.ibid.the court of appeal held it was incorrect as a matter of law to conclude that the existence of a direct benefit to the employer could be used to circumvent the express terms of now subdivision a.id.at.
since hughes aircraft,a number of published decisions applying what is now subdivision a have found that injuries suffered in recreational,social,or athletic settings were covered by workers compensation.
in smith workers comp.appeals bd.d.hereafter smith,a math teacher suffered fatal injuries while windsurfing at a math club picnic.id.at.the court of appeal considered the question extremely close,but concluded that certain factors tipped the balance to compensability the teacher was classified as temporary and,thus,was vulnerable to pressure or suggestion that he participate to improve his chances of being rehired the club was an official school club,and the picnic was an annually scheduled event teachers were encouraged to participate in school club activities annual evaluations of teachers were based in part on their willingness to participate in club activities the event benefited the school by promoting better relationships math club funds were used to provide food and refreshments and students were required to submit parental permission slips in order to participate.id.at.
in wilson workers comp.appeals bd.d.hereafter wilson,the claimant was a police officer who injured his ankle while running at a junior college track.as a member of the police department special emergency response team sert,he had to pass physical tests four times a year in order to remain on the team.the tests included a requirement that officers over the age of must be able to run two miles in minutes.a sert supervisor testified he told sert officers that they would have to engage in exercise to pass the tests.id.at.the court of appeal held the injury was compensable because i t would be completely unrealistic to conclude that running was not expected of a sert member over years old who wanted to pass the sert tests.id.at.
in kidwell workers comp.appeals bd.th,d hereafter kidwell,the court of appeal found compensable an injury suffered by a california highway patrol chp officer while she was practicing a standing long jump at home.the standing long jump was a required protocol of the chp annual,mandatory fitness test.in past years,she had passed the fitness tests except for the standing long jump.her failure to pass the standing long jump had significant consequences,including the loss of a per month salary differential,loss of eligibility for certain assignments and overtime,issuance of a fitness plan,and an entry in her performance evaluation.id.at,fn,d.under the circumstances,the court concluded that it would be patently unreasonable to find the chp did not expect the claimant to practice for the standing long jump test.id.at,d.
on the other hand,a number of published decisions applying what is now subdivision a have found that injuries suffered in recreational,social,or athletic settings were not covered by workers compensation.
in meyer workers comp.appeals bd.d.hereafter meyer,a car salesman was injured while driving for a weekend visit to his supervisor place near the colorado river.id.at.the court of appeal concluded the injury was not compensable because the employer did not subsidize or sponsor the event,and it was not regularly was just an informal invitation by a supervisor,while the visit might foster improved morale,this is true of every social event and,therefore,it is not sufficient to impose compensability,and there was insufficient evidence of pressure exerted to attend the outing.id.at.simply stated,the trip,although initiated by a supervisor,was not a reasonable expectancy of the employment.id.at.
