factual and procedural summary 
the nature of the appellate issues require that we set forth the alleged facts in some detail.because we are reviewing a judgment after a demurrer,we assume the truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations of acuna first amended complaint and the facts implied from those allegations.schifando city of los angeles cal th.
acuna,who is hispanic,began working for sdg e in june.her work involved timekeeping responsibilities,including inputting daily time sheets into the computer system.acuna consistently received positive performance appraisals.her supervisors and coworkers praised her dedication and commitment to work.
in,jim valentine became acuna supervisor.shortly after,valentine began making numerous condescending comments to acuna about her hispanic background,and told employees that he did not want employees speaking spanish around him.he also allegedly made numerous unjustified criticisms of acuna work.
in august,acuna repetitive motion work resulted in carpel tunnel to her right wrist.during an unspecified time,she was on medical leave.after treatment and ergonomic modifications were made to her work station,acuna returned to work.after her return,valentine continuously and falsely accused acuna of making data entry errors.valentine consistently treated acuna differently from other employees,especially with issues of overtime and lunch periods.
in a february written evaluation,valentine retaliated against acuna by misrepresenting acuna work performance valentine comments were false and adversely affected her pay increases.valentine also violated acuna right to take training classes and required that she bring her lunch so that she could eat and work at her desk.
in april,acuna suffered an emotional breakdown allegedly caused by valentine conduct towards her.she was placed on disability leave for an industrial stress claim.she lodged an internal discrimination and harassment claim with sdg e human resources department.sdg e told acuna an investigation would be initiated which would take about six weeks.
three months later,on june,acuna returned to work and was immediately required to meet with valentine and two other supervisors.at the meeting,acuna was falsely accused of errors and overtime issues apparently concerning her personal timekeeping record without any supporting evidence.during the next week acuna was placed under constant scrutiny,and her job duties changed.acuna believed that sdg e was retaliating against her for reporting discrimination and harassment by valentine and filing a workers compensation claim.
about one week after she returned,on june,acuna treating physician again placed acuna on disability based on the exacerbation of her stress issues.while on leave,on july,acuna sent an email to the human resources department regarding the status of the internal investigation of her discrimination and harassment claims against valentine.the next day,acuna received a response that there were two separate investigations being conducted,one involving acuna discrimination and harassment claims,and one involving valentine allegations against acuna for timekeeping irregularities.acuna was told her required contact in human resources was valentine wife.
after sdg e challenged acuna workers compensation stress claim,acuna was evaluated by a qualified medical evaluator,who prepared an october,report concluding acuna has suffered a temporary and total industrial psychological disability as a result of an injury stress related to the harassment and disparagement of her by her immediate manager,valentine.the evaluator opined that the only necessary work restriction was to place acuna in a different department under a different manager.after sdg e requested a supplemental report,the evaluator provided an additional report in january,in which he concluded that acuna major source of psychological stress and her distress more than arises from the negative treatment,amounting to harassment,by her current supervisor,jim valentine.
at that point,acuna retained counsel.acuna alleges she did so because she received no response from sdg e concerning her internal investigation or efforts to place her back to work in a department under a different supervisor 
several months later,on march,acuna filed an administrative complaint with the california department of fair employment and housing dfeh.in the complaint,acuna alleged she was discriminated and harassed because i was an hispanic female.harassment increased after i filed a worker compensation claim and then i was retaliated against for protesting.she requested an immediate letter.
about days later,on march,the dfeh issued a letter,stating that the civil action must be filed within one year of the letter.however,four months later,in july,acuna counsel and sdg e counsel began a series of communications concerning sdg e internal investigation of acuna complaints.in november,acuna treating physician released her to return to work,but not under valentine supervision.however,sdg e refused to allow acuna to return to work,stating it needed additional clarification from acuna physician.
on january,sdg e counsel sent correspondence to acuna counsel stating he was arranging witness interviews and he expected to be in a position to discuss acuna claims in two to three weeks.however,sdg e counsel never sent any further communications regarding sdg e investigation.
on february,acuna filed her second dfeh administrative complaint.in the complaint,acuna alleged sdg e engaged in disability discrimination and failed to provide reasonable accommodation for her disability.she stated that on november,i provided a medical note that i could return to work with restrictions of returning to a different work site.to this date i have not been reinstated.she claimed she had applied for vacant positions that would satisfy her doctor restrictions,but sdg e failed to engage in an interactive process to accommodate her disability.
immediately thereafter,sdg e informed acuna that it was working on providing acuna a job under the work restrictions outlined by her physician and that she would need to go back to see the qualified medical examiner before sdg e could bring her back to work.sdg e also told acuna that john garcia would be her human resources contact to assist her in finding a job at sdg acuna immediately began researching and applying for open sdg e job listings.
in april,another medical evaluator opined that acuna could return to work and recommended a transfer so acuna would have no meaningful contact with valentine.sdg e disputed this recommendation,and the parties agreed to dominick addario as an agreed medical examiner to resolve the medical dispute.
on december,addario provided a report in which he opined that acuna suffered a injury predominantly caused by acuna exposure to harassment at work from her supervisor,valentine.addario recommended acuna be accommodated in a position with a different supervisor.
from december through june,sdg e refused and continued to refuse to consider acuna for any position or job opening for which she was qualified additionally,the sdg e employee assigned to help her with the disability accommodation garcia failed to make any reasonable efforts to assist acuna or respond to her calls or emails 
during this same period,on february,the dfeh issued a second notice based on acuna february dfeh complaint.the dfeh notified acuna that a civil action must be filed within one year of this notice.
two months later,in april,acuna became concerned about the sincerity of sdg e efforts to help her find a position after she was rejected for two positions based on valentine previous characterization of her work performance.in response to her concerns,garcia assured her that he was continuing to assist in her job search.
in about june,acuna learned that valentine was transferred to a different location and department.acuna thus requested to return to work at her former position,and she was offered and accepted the position.at the same time,sdg e notified acuna that it was resuming the investigation into the timekeeping allegations made against her by valentine in.she was told to report to manager alan dulgeroff to resume her former position.
however,when acuna met with dulgeroff and a senior human resources manager on june,she was threatened with termination based on the revived timekeeping allegations made by valentine.she was told that she would be fired unless she signed a release of all claims against sdg e.at the conclusion of the meeting,acuna was handed a severance and release agreement,and told she would be terminated if she refused to sign it.
about one month later,on july,sdg e sent acuna a notice of termination effective that date.in the letter,sdg e said acuna was being terminated because she had engaged in wrongful conduct in and relating to reporting hours worked and overtime.acuna denied these allegations and alleged that sdg e fabricated these issues in retaliation for protesting defendant unlawful conduct.
four months later,on october,acuna filed a third administrative complaint with the dfeh,alleging discrimination,harassment,and retaliation.the administrative complaint described the alleged discrimination as follows previous protests and reports of discrimination,harassment and retaliation by valentine.increased harassment after filing work comp claim and previous dfeh complaints.failure to accommodate me and forced termination.
based on this administrative complaint,the dfeh issued a notice on november.less than one year later,on november,acuna filed a verified complaint in superior court,alleging three feha claims retaliation,disability discrimination,and racial harassment,wrongful termination in violation of public policy,and several nonstatutory claims fraud,breach of contract,and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.sdg e demurred,contending the claims were barred by applicable statutes of limitations and the common law claims failed to state a viable cause of action.the court sustained the demurrer,with leave to amend on all claims except for the fraud claim.
acuna then filed a verified amended complaint.on the feha claims,acuna added allegations relating to the continuing violation and equitable tolling doctrines.on the contract claims,acuna added allegations in an attempt to rebut the presumption that her employment was at will.
after considering the new pleading and conducting a hearing,the court sustained sdg e demurrer without leave to amend.on the feha claims,the court focused primarily on acuna first two dfeh complaints and the notices received in response to these complaints,and found acuna lawsuit filed in november was because acuna did not file her lawsuit within one year of these notices.the court reasoned that the continuing violation and equitable tolling doctrines did not apply to the limitations period applicable after an employee receives a notice,and that the third notice could not revive the claims set forth in acuna prior two administrative complaints because the allegations were essentially identical.on the contract claims,the court found acuna did not allege sufficient facts to overcome the presumption of an employment or provide sufficient specificity regarding the nature of the alleged contract.the court further found there was no reasonable possibility acuna could state a viable cause of action if she was permitted to amend the complaint.

ii.acuna feha causes of action 
acuna alleged three feha causes of action disability discrimination racial discrimination and wrongful retaliation.she contends the court erred in concluding each of these claims was time barred.for the reasons explained below,we conclude acuna racial and disability discrimination claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations,but the court erred in sustaining the demurrer on acuna claim that her employment termination was motivated by improper retaliation.
feha statute of limitations 
feha claims are governed by two statutory deadlines section and section.
section provides that an employee bringing an feha claim must exhaust the administrative remedy by filing an administrative complaint with the dfeh within one year after the alleged unlawful action occurred,subd.d.this code section states that with certain exceptions not applicable here no administrative complaint may be filed after the expiration of one year from the date upon which the alleged unlawful practice or refusal to cooperate occurred see okoli lockheed technical operations th.
this period is subject to equitable tolling under various doctrines.of relevance here,the california supreme court has held the continuing violations doctrine may toll the section accrual period if the employer engaged in a series of continuing and related feha violations and at least one of those violations occurred within the period.richards hill,cal th,richards.in richards,a disabled employee asked for accommodation over a period,and was given mixed signals on her accommodation requests throughout the period.id.at.the employer argued the limitations period was triggered the first time the employer refused to accommodate the employee disability and because the employee did not file her dfeh claim at this time,the claim was barred for any employer actions occurring more than one year before she filed the dfeh complaint.id.at.the california supreme court rejected this argument,emphasizing the importance of protecting employee rights and the fact that reasonable accommodation is frequently a process rather than a discrete event.id.at.after considering these policies and reviewing the various approaches to the continuing violations theory,the richards court interpreted section to mean that when a continuing pattern of wrongful conduct occurs partly in the statutory period and partly outside the statutory period,the limitations period begins to accrue once an employee is on notice of the violation of his or her rights and on notice that litigation,not informal conciliation,is the only alternative for the vindication of his or her rights.id.at.
specifically,the richards court held the limitations period for filing a dfeh complaint is tolled if an employer engages in repetitive violations of an employee feha rights and the employer actions were sufficiently similar in kind have occurred with reasonable frequency and have not acquired a degree of permanence.richards,supra,cal th at.the court stated that permanence in the context of an ongoing process of accommodation of disability,or ongoing disability harassment,mean s that an employer statements and actions make clear to a reasonable employee that any further efforts at informal conciliation to obtain reasonable accommodation or end harassment will be futile.ibid.several years later,the high court extended the continuing violations doctrine to feha claims alleging a retaliatory course of conduct.yanowitz usa,cal th.
section concerns a separate statutory deadline applicable after the dfeh issues a notice.the code section provides that after an employee files a complaint and the dfeh does not issue an accusation within a specified period,the dfeh must issue a letter notifying the employee that he or she may bring a civil suit within one year of the date of the notice,subd.b pearson dental supplies,superior court cal th,fn.this code section establishes a strict statute of limitations,commencing from the date of the notice by the dfeh,except for certain statutory exceptions,subd.d.section deadline from the notice is a condition on a substantive right rather than a procedural limitation period for commencement of an action.williams pacific mutual life ins.d.thus,it cause s the right which previously arose and on which a suit could have been maintained,to expire.ibid.
summary of important dates regarding limitations analysis 
before analyzing these two limitations periods in the context of the alleged facts,it is helpful to restate certain dates important to our analysis.
on march,acuna filed her first dfeh complaint,alleging racial discrimination and harassment,and retaliation for having filed a worker compensation claim.on march,the dfeh issued a right to sue notice on this first dfeh complaint.
on february,acuna filed her second dfeh complaint,alleging disability discrimination failure to accommodate her claimed disability.on february,the dfeh filed a notice on this second dfeh complaint.
on july,sdg e terminated acuna employment.
on october,acuna filed her third dfeh administrative complaint,alleging various wrongful acts,including her alleged retaliatory termination.on november,the dfeh issued a letter based on this third dfeh complaint.
on november,acuna filed her lawsuit.
acuna appellate contention focuses on her final notice,dated november.she argues that her lawsuit was timely because her lawsuit was filed within one year of this november,notice and to the extent her current claims are based on feha violations occurring more than one year before she filed her october administrative claim,the time period was tolled by the continuing violations and equitable tolling doctrines.
we examine these arguments with respect to each of acuna feha claims disability discrimination racial discrimination and retaliation.
disability discrimination claim 
on her disability discrimination claim,acuna alleged she had a mental health disability relating to stress and depression and that sdg e repeatedly denied her requested accommodations for this disability in the form of a job position with a supervisor other than valentine.acuna acknowledges that her october administrative claim was filed more than one year after sdg e engaged in this alleged disability discrimination,but argues that the time period for filing her administrative claim was tolled under the continuing violations doctrine.this argument is without merit.
as discussed above,in california the continuing violations doctrine applies to toll section period for filing a dfeh claim during the time the employee and employer are engaged in informal efforts to resolve the employer claimed wrongful conduct.richards,supra,cal th at.the california supreme court held this tolling period ends when the employer determination achieves a level of permanence,when a reasonable employee would understand that further efforts to end the unlawful conduct will be in vain.id.at.
acuna allegations establish that a reasonable person would have understood that sdg e had denied her requests for accommodation no later than february.according to acuna allegations,beginning in late,sdg e repeatedly declined to permit acuna to return to her job and refused to permit her to work for a supervisor other than valentine.in response to this conduct,acuna retained counsel and filed a dfeh complaint.after sdg e continued to refuse to accommodate her claimed disability,acuna filed her second dfeh complaint in february.in this complaint,acuna specifically alleged that sdg e was refusing to accommodate her disability.by retaining counsel and filing a dfeh complaint,acuna manifested an understanding that further attempts at informal,rather than formal,resolution of the disability accommodation process would not be successful and were futile.under these circumstances,the continuing violations doctrine is inapplicable.because acuna did not file her lawsuit within one year of receiving the second notice,her disability discrimination claim is.
in this regard,this case is similar to cucuzza city of santa clara th cucuzza.in cucuzza,the court held the employer alleged sexual discrimination reached a state of permanence after the plaintiff supervisor repeatedly refused to respond to her requests to be permitted to work in a particular job and the plaintiff internal grievances challenging these decisions were unsuccessful.id.at.the cucuzza court held that at that point the plaintiff should have known that further efforts to resolve the situation would be futile.id.at.similarly here,when sdg e repeatedly and consistently refused to find a job position for acuna with a new supervisor and acuna retained counsel and filed a formal administrative claim challenging this refusal,she should have known further efforts to resolve the alleged disability discrimination would be futile.
acuna contends sdg e actions after she filed the second administrative complaint in february negated her earlier understanding that any additional informal conciliation to obtain reasonable accommodation for her disability would be futile.in her amended complaint,acuna alleged that i mmediately after she filed her second dfeh complaint,sdg e told her it was working on providing her a job under her work restrictions.however,acuna also alleged that within several months,sdg e disputed her doctor recommendation that she return to work without any meaningful contact with valentine.at this time she was represented by counsel and had a pending dfeh complaint regarding sdg e refusal to accommodate her claimed disability.under these circumstances the employer conduct became permanent under the richards standard in that no reasonable employee would have believed that further efforts at informal conciliation would be successful.see richards,supra,cal th at.
we also reject acuna reliance on her allegation in her amended complaint that in december through june,sdg e led the plaintiff to believe that it was earnest in its efforts to find her a position or job opening.this allegation directly contradicts acuna admission in her original verified complaint that during this same time period sdg e refused and continued to refuse to consider plaintiff for any position or job opening for which she was qualified and that the assigned human resources employee made no effort whatsoever to assist her.these admissions defeat acuna claims that sdg e continued to lead her to believe it would accommodate her disability.where a party amends a verified pleading to avoid the effect of a damaging factual allegation,a court may disregard the new inconsistent allegations.see shoemaker myers cal d,vallejo development beck development,th,blain doctor d.
acuna reliance on accardi superior court th is misplaced.in accardi,the court held a claim alleging the employer engaged in a series of acts of harassment and discrimination was timely because the employer acts showed a deliberate pattern of discrimination id.at.however,the california supreme court later rejected accardi broad view of the continuing violation doctrine and adopted a more ba
