this appeal concerns whether an disease is a bodily injury by accident as that term is interpreted under several workers compensation and employers liability insurance policies.because we agree that the policies are subject to only one reasonable an injury is not a bodily injury by accident under the policies in affirm the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of employers insurance of wausau.
factual and procedural background 
graphic packaging international,formerly known as riverwood international riverwood,owns and operates a paperboard manufacturing facility in west monroe,louisiana.riverwood purchased a series of excess workers compensation and employers liability policies collectively,the policies from employers insurance of wausau wausau,which provided coverage from may to january beginning in early,numerous present and former employees sued riverwood,seeking damages for injuries,including asbestosis and other diseases,allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos while working at the west monroe facility.riverwood settled employee claims for a lump sum of million.
riverwood sent notice letters to its multiple insurers,including wausau,advising them of the claims.the notice letters identified the employees claims as bodily injury by disease claims.wausau denied coverage based on the month exclusion provision in the policies,which provides that bodily injury by disease claims are excluded from coverage if not brought within months after the end of the policy period wausau also denied coverage on the basis that riverwood could not meet the retention sir requirements in the policies accordingly,wausau refused to contribute to the million settlement.
on march,riverwood filed a suit seeking indemnity from wausau under,inter alia,the policies for the underlying asbestos claims on january,wausau filed a motion for partial summary judgment,seeking enforcement of the month exclusion provision.it is undisputed that none of the asbestos claims was asserted against riverwood within months of the policies expiration.the district court,however,denied the motion,relying on the recommendation of the magistrate judge,who reasoned that the policies language was ambiguous because an issue of fact existed regarding whether an disease is a bodily injury by disease or a bodily injury by accident under the policies.
on october,wausau filed another motion for summary judgment,arguing that the employees claims were bodily injury by disease claims barred by the month exclusion provision and riverwood could not satisfy its sir requirements as required to trigger coverage under the policies regardless of whether the claims were treated as bodily injury by disease or bodily injury by accident claims.on february,based on the magistrate judge recommendation,the court granted wausau motion.
with respect to the month exclusion provision,the court reconsidered its determination of ambiguity and concluded that,based on the evidence,t he only reasonable conclusion is that the underlying claims in question in this lawsuit involve bodily injury by disease.therefore,the exclusion applies and should be enforced as written.the court reasoned,inter alia,that the vast majority of courts considering the issue have also treated claims as injury by disease under excess w orker c ompensation e mployer l iability policies with the same or nearly the same policy definitions.citing hamilton anco insulation,so d.cir,hubbs anco insulations,so d.cir,rareshide mobil oil,so d.cir,laurendine fischbach moore,so d.cir,and froust coating specialists.
with respect to the sir issue,the court noted that because the claims were bodily injury by disease claims,a separate sir had to be met for each claim.however,no individual claim exceeded the smallest sir,much less the sir on the later policies the court also noted that even if the claims were bodily injury by accident claims,riverwood would have to meet its sir requirement for each accident.however,riverwood failed to present any evidence to show it could meet its sir requirement for each accident.in addition,the court stated that because riverwood was seeking to trigger coverage under multiple policies for damages stemming from multiple years of exposure,the plaintiffs losses had to be allocated on a pro rata basis across all the years of exposure.under this method,the court concluded that riverwood could not satisfy a single sir for any employee in any policy year.the court rejected riverwood argument that all the claims should be construed as arising out of a single accident because riverwood did not present any evidence that all of the claimants were exposed by one specific accident at the same time and at a common location.
on appeal,riverwood argues that a genuine issue of fact remains as to whether it is entitled to coverage under the policies.specifically,riverwood argues that the language of the policies at issue is ambiguous.with regard to the sir issue,riverwood argues that there is sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that it could satisfy at least one sir under the policies.riverwood further argues that under fifth circuit precedent,its sirs should be apportioned pro rata.

iii.analysis 
riverwood argues that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the underlying asbestos claims are bodily injury by disease or bodily injury by accident claims under the policies.
